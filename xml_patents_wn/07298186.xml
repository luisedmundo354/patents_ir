<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates in general to a control circuit of command signals, and more particular to a control circuit of command signals of a clock generator.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A clock generator mounted on a motherboard of a computer is used to determine the CPU, PCI, and system bus speeds. The clock generator is controlled by command signals from a control circuit. If all of the voltages at the planar connector from the power supply are within a predetermined tolerance level, i.e. within specification, the power good (PG) signal goes high thereby causing the clock generator to generate clock signals to a computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a conventional control circuit for command signals of a clock generator. The control circuit includes two transistors Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>. A base of the transistor Q<b>1</b> is connected via a resistor R<b>3</b> to a control end Vccp, a collector of the transistor Q<b>1</b> is coupled to a power supply end Vdc via a resistor R<b>1</b>, the collector of the transistor Q<b>1</b> is also coupled to a base of the transistor Q<b>2</b>. A collector of the transistor Q<b>2</b> is connected to the power supply end Vdc via a resistor R<b>2</b>. Emitters of the two transistors Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are grounded. The collector of the transistor Q<b>2</b> is connected to an output end VTT_PWRGD via a resistor R<b>4</b>. The output end VTT_PWRGD outputs the command signal PG to a clock generator. The voltage of the power supply end Vdc is provided by the motherboard and the value is 3.3V. When the voltage of the control end Vccp is at a high level, the transistor Q<b>1</b> is turned on, the transistor Q<b>2</b> is turned off, the voltage at the output end VTT_PWRGD is at a high level to enable the clock generator to generate clock signals; when the voltage of the control end Vccp is at a low level, the transistor Q<b>1</b> is turned off, the transistor Q<b>2</b> is turned on, the voltage at the output end VTT_PWRGD is at a low level, the clock generator does not generate clock signals. However, employing the two transistors to control the command signals of the clock generator increases the cost of the manufacture of the motherboard.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">What is needed, therefore, is a control circuit for command signal of clock generator which not only accomplishes the same efficiency of the prior art, but also can be mass produced at a reasonable cost.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An exemplary control circuit for command signals of a clock generator includes a power supply end, an output end, a control end, a diode, a first resistor and a second resistor. The first resistor, the diode, and the second resistor are connected in series between the power supply end and the ground. The diode has an anode connected to the first resistor and a cathode connected to the second resistor. The control end is connected to a node between the diode and the second resistor; the output end is connected to a node between the diode and the first resistor. The output end outputs the command signals to the clock generator.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is of advantage that employing a diode as a switch to replace the two transistors of the prior art can be mass produced at a reasonable cost.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a control circuit for command signals of a clock generator includes a diode D<b>1</b>, a first resistor R<b>10</b>, a second resistor R<b>20</b>, a control end Vccp, a power supply end Vdc, and an output end VTT_PWRGD. The first resistor R<b>1</b>, the diode D<b>1</b>, and the second resistor R<b>2</b> are connected in series between the power supply end Vdc and the ground. An anode of the diode D<b>1</b> is connected to the first resistor R<b>1</b>, and a cathode of the diode D<b>1</b> is connected to the second resistor R<b>20</b>. The control end Vccp is connected at a node between the diode D<b>1</b> and the second resistor R<b>20</b>. The output end VTT_PWRGD is connected to a node between the first resistor R<b>10</b> and the diode D<b>1</b>. A voltage of the power supply end Vdc is 3.3V.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When the voltage of the control end Vccp is at a high level, the diode D<b>1</b> is turned off, the voltage at the output end VTT_PWRGD is at a high level to enable the clock generator to generate clock signals; when the voltage of the control end Vccp is at a low level, the diode D<b>1</b> is turned on, the voltage at the output end VTT_PWRGD is at a low level, the clock generator does not generate clock signals.</p>
