<p id="p-0001" num="0000">When a portion of an image is displayed, a range of the image which is being displayed can be easily recognized. Namely, when enlarged image data which corresponds to an enlarged display range shown by hatching is extracted from image data and displayed on a display, a portion of the image which is represented by the enlarged image data is displayed on the entire display surface of the display. Original image data is processed such that a frame which represents the enlarged display range is synthesized with the image represented by the original image data, and resultant image data is displayed, as a navigation image, in an upper right corner of the display surface of the display.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image display apparatus and an image photographing apparatus, and in particular, to an image display apparatus which displays an image represented by image information on a display device, and an image photographing apparatus which includes the image display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, an image photographing apparatus such as a digital still camera, a digital video camera, or the like is provided with a display device which is formed by an LCD or the like in order to enable confirmation of a photographed image or a played-back image at a time of photographing or playing back an image. Among various image photographing apparatuses, some apparatuses have a function in which the photographed image or the played-back image which is displayed on the display device can be displayed in an enlarged manner in accordance with a designation from a user. This function is effective, for example, in a case of confirming the focus or exposure at the time the image was photographed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 6-153071 discloses, in relation to the above-described art, an image signal processing mechanism in which image processing such as enlargement/reduction, rotation, or the like of an image can be easily carried out when the stored image data is played back.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Here, in the image photographing apparatus, the resolution of the photographed image (the number of pixels of the image data obtained by photographing) is an important factor which relates to the image quality of the photographed image, and technology is advancing at a pace such that resolution becomes higher year by year. Accordingly, there arises a problem that when the photographed image or the played-back image which is displayed on the display device is displayed in an enlarged manner, it is difficult to know which portion of the original image is being displayed in an enlarged manner. Especially, when the original image is an image obtained by photographing a scene in which the same type of objects are aligned in succession, or the like, it is difficult to determine which portion of the original image is being displayed in an enlarged manner.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above-described problem is not limited to image photographing apparatuses. In an apparatus which has functions of displaying an image on a display device and of displaying the displayed image in an enlarged manner (e.g., an apparatus which has a function of simply playing back an image), for example, when the surface area of a display surface of the display device is small and a display range when an image is displayed in an enlarged manner is limited, it is difficult to judge which portion of the image is being displayed in an enlarged manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been developed in view of the aforementioned facts, and an object of the present invention is to provide an image display apparatus and an image photographing apparatus in which in a case of displaying a portion of an image, the range of the image which range is being displayed can be easily recognized.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to accomplish the above-mentioned object, a first aspect of a first invention is an image display apparatus, comprising: (a) a memory device having circuitry disposed therein for electronic storage and retrieval of information; (b) a display device having a display panel and circuitry for electronically displaying information on the panel; and (c) a display control device electronically connected to the memory device and the display control device, the display control device having electronic program logic, which when information is stored in the memory device representing an image, is operable for causing the display control device to retrieve the stored information and display a portion of the image represented by the stored information as a main image on the display device panel and range information indicating the portion of the image displayed in relation to the entire image represented by the stored information.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The first aspect of the first invention includes the memory device which stores image information and the display device for displaying the image. The memory device may be formed by, for example, a RAM or the like. The image information may be, as recited in the sixth aspect of the first invention, for example, image information which is read out from an information storage medium, or may be image information which is outputted from a photographing device which converts an optical image to image information, or may be image information which is obtained by communication with another devices. The display device may be a transmission type dot matrix display as in the second aspect, or may be a reflection type dot matrix display, or may be another displays. Specifically, the display device may be structured by an LCD display, a CRT display, a plasma display, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When a portion of an image represented by the image information stored in the memory device is displayed on the display device as a main image, the display control device of the first aspect also displays visible information which represents a range, of the image represented by the image information, which range is being displayed as the main image. Accordingly, a user can easily visually recognize the range (specifically, the position, the shape, and the size of the range of the image) which is being displayed as the main image by viewing the displayed visible information. Therefore, according to the first aspect of the present invention, it is possible to easily recognize the displayed range, within the entire image, when a portion of the image is being displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A third aspect of the first invention is the image display apparatus of the first aspect of the first invention, wherein the range information comprises a sub-image on the display device panel of the entire image, superposed over a section of the main image.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the third aspect of the first invention, a sub-image, whose display range is the entire image represented by the image information and in which the range which is being displayed as the main image is designated, can be displayed as the visible information at a smaller display magnification than that of the main image. Therefore, when the user views the displayed sub-image, the user can easily recognize not only the range of the image which is being displayed as the main image, but also the entire image represented by the image information. As a result, for example, in an aspect such as a fifth aspect of the present invention which will be described later and in which a size or a position of the range which is to be displayed as the main image can be changed by the user, the user can easily decide the range of the image which is to be displayed as the main image.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the third aspect of the first invention, the range which is being displayed as the main image can be designated on the sub image by, for example, displaying, as the sub-image, an image on which a graphic form which represents a boundary between the range which is being displayed as the main image and a range other than the range which is being displayed as the main image is superposed, or displaying, as the sub-image, an image in which at least one of saturation, lightness, and hue of the range which is being displayed as the main image is different from that of the range other than the range which is being displayed as the main image.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Display of the main image and the sub-image may be, as in a fourth aspect of the present invention carried out by displaying the main image and the sub-image on a single display device, or, if a plurality of display devices are provided, by separately displaying the main image and the sub-image on the plural display devices. When the main image and the sub-image are displayed on the single display device, it is not necessary to add a new display device to display the sub-image, and therefore, manufacturing costs do not increase. When the main image and the sub-image are separately displayed on the plural display devices, there is no need to limit a display area of the main image in order to display the sub-image.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A fifth aspect of the first invention is the image display apparatus of the first aspect of the first invention, further comprising a designation device electronically connected to the display control device, the designation device being for selecting at least one of a position designating the portion of the image to be displayed, and a magnification size, wherein the electronic program logic determines the range information in accordance with a selection inputted via the designation device.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the fifth aspect of the first invention, if the user designates via the designating device at least one of the size and the position of the range which is to be displayed as the main image, at least one of the size and the position of the range which is to be displayed as the main image is changed. Accordingly, it is possible to display, as the main image, any range of the image represented by the image information. Therefore, it is possible to easily confirm or view any portion of the image represented by the image information.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A sixth aspect of the first invention is the image display apparatus of the first aspect of the first invention, wherein the stored information was read from an information storage medium and stored in the memory device. In the sixth aspect of the first invention, because an image represented by image information which is read out from an information storage medium is displayed on the display device, a portion of the image represented by the image information stored in the information storage medium can be easily confirmed or viewed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An image photographing device of a first aspect of a second invention includes a photographing device which converts an optical image to image information, and the above-described image display apparatus. The display control device displays on the display device an image represented by image information which is outputted from the photographing device and stored in a memory device, or an image represented by image information which is read out from an information storage medium and stored in the memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first aspect of the second invention includes the photographing device which converts an optical image to image information, and the above-described image display apparatus. The display control device relating to the first aspect of the second invention displays on the display device an image (a photographed image) represented by image information which is outputted from the photographing device and stored in the memory device, or an image (a played-back image) represented by image information which is read out from the information storage medium and stored in the memory device. Accordingly, in accordance with the first aspect of the second invention, when a portion of the photographed image or the played back image is displayed, as in the first aspect of the first invention, it is possible to easily recognize the range within the entire image, which range is being displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A second aspect of the second invention is an apparatus for photographic imagery of the first aspect of the first invention, further comprising an optical finder for viewing an optical image for conversion by said photography device to electronic image information representative of the optical image, wherein the display device includes another display panel and when the stored information has been outputted from the photography device into the memory device, the electronic program logic displays as main image the entire image represented by the stored information, and a portion of the entire image, the another display panel with the range information being indicated as a differential portion of the main image.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the second aspect of the second invention, the optical finder for visually confirming the optical image which is converted to image information by the photographing device is provided. An image which represents the range which is being displayed as the main image is displayed as visible information in a superposed manner on the image which is being viewed via the optical finder. As described above, displaying the image, which represents the range which is being displayed as the main image, in a superposed manner on the image which is being viewed via the optical finder, can be realized as follows. An optical element, whose light transmittance can be partially changed such as an LCD or the like, is disposed on the optical finder. An image in which the light transmittance of the range of the main image is different from that of the range other than the range of the main image (a light transmittance pattern), or an image in which the light transmittance of the boundary between the range of the main image and the range other than the range of the main image is different from that of other portions (a light transmittance pattern), is displayed on the LCD as the image which represents the range which is being displayed as the main image.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the second aspect of the second invention, an image which is being viewed at via the optical finder is used, and an image which serves as visible information is superposed on the image which is being viewed at via the optical finder. Therefore, the range which is being displayed as the main image is visually displayed. Accordingly, it is possible to grasp the overall image represented by the image information without, for example, providing a new display device for displaying the sub-image or without limiting the display area of the main image by displaying the main image and the sub-image on the same display device.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail hereinafter with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a digital still camera <b>10</b> relating to a first embodiment. The digital still camera <b>10</b> has, as described later, a function as an image display apparatus recited in the first aspect of the first invention and the like, and corresponds to an image photographing apparatus recited in the first aspect of the second invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a main body <b>12</b> of the digital still camera <b>10</b> is formed in a substantial box shape, and a protrusion (grip portion) for easy grip of the main body <b>12</b> is formed at the left side of the main body <b>12</b>, seen from the front. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a lens <b>14</b> is mounted at a center of the front surface of the main body <b>12</b>. An optical finder <b>16</b> for a user to visually confirm a range to be photographed or the like, and a flash <b>18</b> for emitting auxiliary light when an image is photographed at a low illumination level or the like, are mounted above the lens <b>14</b> of the main body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A power switch <b>20</b> is provided at the right side, seen from the front, of the top surface of the main body <b>12</b> and a shutter button <b>22</b> is provided at the left side (a position which corresponds to the grip portion), seen from the front, of the top surface of the main body <b>12</b>. A slot <b>24</b>, into which a memory card (not shown) which serves as an information storage medium can be loaded, is provided at the right side surface of the main body <b>12</b>, seen from the front.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a color display <b>26</b> (which may be a monochrome display), which is formed by a reflection type display device or a transmission type display device (for example, an LCD), is mounted at a lower side of the back surface of the main body <b>12</b>. A menu switch <b>28</b>, an execution/view changing switch <b>30</b>, and an operation switch <b>32</b> are respectively mounted above the display <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a structure of an electric system of the digital still camera <b>10</b>. The lens <b>14</b> is specifically a zoom lens (a focal distance varying lens) having an automatic focusing (AF) mechanism. The AF mechanism and the zoom mechanism of the lens <b>14</b> are driven by a driving circuit <b>36</b>. Instead of the zoom lens, a focal distance fixing lens having only the AF mechanism may be used as the lens <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A photographing device <b>38</b> which is structured by an area CCD sensor or the like is disposed at a position corresponding to a focal position of the lens <b>14</b> within the main body <b>12</b>. Light, which is reflected by a subject and made incident on the lens <b>14</b>, is imaged on a light receiving surface of the photographing device <b>38</b>. The photographing device <b>38</b> is driven at a timing which is synchronized with a timing signal generated by a timing generation circuit (not shown) which is included in the driving circuit <b>36</b>, and outputs an image signal (a signal which represents an amount of light received in respective plural photoelectric conversion cells arranged in a matrix on the light receiving surface).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A shutter/diaphragm <b>40</b> is disposed between the lens <b>14</b> and the photographing device <b>38</b>. The shutter/diaphragm is driven by the driving circuit <b>36</b>. The shutter is designed to prevent smear from being generated due to the incidence of light on the light receiving surface of the photographing device <b>38</b> when the image signal is outputted from the photographing device <b>38</b>. The shutter may be omitted depending on the structure of the photographing device <b>38</b>. The diaphragm may be structured by a single diaphragm which can continuously change a setting of the diaphragm, or may be structured such that a plurality of diaphragms, each of whose setting is different, are switched. The flash <b>18</b> is also connected to the driving circuit <b>36</b>. The flash <b>18</b> is made to emit light by the driving circuit <b>36</b> when a low illumination level is detected, or made to emit light by the driving circuit <b>36</b> when emission is designated by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Connected to a signal output terminal of the photographing device <b>38</b> are an analog signal processing section <b>42</b>, an A/D converter <b>44</b>, a digital signal processing section <b>46</b>, and a memory <b>48</b> in that order. The analog signal processing section <b>42</b> amplifies an image signal outputted from the photographing device <b>38</b> and carries out corrections of white balance or the like upon the amplified image signal. The image signal which is outputted from the analog signal processing section <b>42</b> is converted to digital image data by the A/D converter <b>44</b> and the digital image data is inputted to the digital signal processing section <b>46</b>. In the digital signal processing section <b>46</b>, various processings such as color correction, γ correction, Y/C conversion and the like are carried out upon the inputted image data. The image data outputted from the digital signal processing section <b>46</b> is temporarily stored in a memory <b>48</b> formed by a RAM or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The memory <b>48</b> corresponds to a memory device of the present invention. The image data stored in the memory <b>48</b> corresponds to image information relating to the present invention. The lens <b>14</b>, the photographing device <b>38</b>, the analog signal processing section <b>42</b>, the A/D converter <b>44</b>, and the digital signal processing section <b>46</b> correspond to a photographing device of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The driving circuit <b>36</b>, the analog signal processing section <b>42</b>, the A/D converter <b>44</b>, the digital signal processing section <b>46</b>, the memory <b>48</b> and, a compression and decompression section <b>50</b> (to be described later) are connected to a bus <b>52</b>. A CPU <b>54</b> is connected to the bus <b>52</b>. Switches (which are referred to as “operation switches” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) such as the power switch <b>20</b>, the menu switch <b>28</b>, the execution/view changing switch <b>30</b>, the operation switch <b>32</b> and the like, and a shutter switch <b>56</b> which is turned on and off by operating the shutter button <b>22</b> are also respectively connected to the bus <b>52</b>. The CPU <b>54</b> includes a peripheral circuit (not shown) such as a ROM, a RAM, an input/output port or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The display <b>26</b> and the compression and decompression section <b>50</b> are respectively connected to the memory <b>48</b>. When an image is to be displayed on the display <b>26</b>, the CPU <b>54</b> carries out image display processing, which will be described later, upon the image data which is temporarily stored in the memory <b>48</b>, and then transmits the image data to the display <b>26</b>. As a result, the image which is represented by the image data which is temporarily stored in the memory <b>48</b> is displayed on the display <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When storage of the image data to the memory card which is loaded into the slot <b>24</b> is designated by operating the shutter button <b>22</b> so as to turn on the shutter switch <b>56</b>, the CPU <b>54</b> reads out the image data which is temporarily stored in the memory <b>48</b> and transmits the image data to the compression and decompression section <b>50</b>. Then, the image data is compressed at the compression and decompression section <b>50</b> and then the resultant image data is stored in the memory card. There may be cases in which the image data is stored in the memory card without being compressed depending on a photographing mode or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When playback (display) of the image represented by the image data which is stored in the memory card which is loaded into the slot <b>24</b> is designated, the image data is read out from the memory card. When the read-out image data is compressed and stored, the compressed image data is decompressed at the compression and decompression section <b>50</b> and then the resultant image data is temporarily stored in the memory <b>48</b>. Then, the image is displayed (played back) on the display <b>26</b> by using the image data which is temporarily stored in the memory <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As an operation of the present embodiment, image display processing will be explained with reference to the flowcharts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. This image display processing is carried out in the CPU <b>54</b> when displaying an image on the display <b>26</b> in the photographing mode is designated, or when the image play-back mode is selected, in which the image represented by the image data which is stored in the memory card is displayed on the display <b>26</b>. This image display processing is carried out in a state in which image data obtained by photographing with the photographing device <b>38</b> or image data which is read out from the memory card is stored in the memory <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In step <b>100</b>, a determination is made as to whether or not to display an image in an enlarged manner by an electronic magnification-changing processing. If displaying the image in an enlarged manner by the electronic changing magnification is not to be carried out (if the entire image represented by image data which is stored in the memory <b>48</b> is to be displayed on the display <b>26</b>), the process proceeds to step <b>102</b>. In step <b>102</b>, the pixel density of the image data which is stored in the memory <b>48</b> is converted on the basis of the number of pixels of the display <b>26</b> (i.e., the pixel density is converted such that the number of pixels of the image represented by the image data in vertical and horizontal directions coincides with the number of pixels of the display <b>26</b> in the vertical and horizontal directions).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In next step <b>104</b>, the image data, whose pixel density has been converted, is expanded in an image-data-for-display storage region (bit map memory) which is provided in the memory <b>48</b> in advance. Then, the process proceeds to step <b>126</b>. In step <b>126</b>, the image data which is stored in the image-data-for-display storage region is transmitted to the display <b>26</b>. Accordingly, the entire image represented by the image data which is stored in the memory <b>48</b> is displayed on the entire display <b>26</b>. In step <b>128</b>, a determination is made as to whether displaying of the image is finished. If the answer to the determination in step <b>128</b> is “No”, the process returns to step <b>100</b> and steps after step <b>100</b> are repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The operation switch <b>32</b> which is provided at the back surface of the main body <b>12</b> of the digital still camera <b>10</b> is provided with switches corresponding to upper, lower, right and left end portions of a substantially square button. When an end portion of the button is pressed, a corresponding switch is turned on. In the image photographing mode, the operation switch <b>32</b> is used to designate to switching of the zoom magnification. When the zoom magnification is to be increased, the upper switch is turned on, and when the zoom magnification is to be reduced, the lower switch is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In accordance with turning on or off the upper or lower switch of the operation switch <b>32</b>, the CPU <b>54</b> changes the optical magnification of the optical finder <b>16</b> as well as the optical magnification (focal distance) of the lens <b>14</b>. If an image is being displayed on the display <b>26</b>, an image corresponding to the optical magnification of the lens <b>14</b> is displayed on the display <b>26</b>. In the image photographing mode, the image data which is stored in the memory <b>48</b> is periodically updated by the image signal which is periodically outputted from the photographing device <b>38</b>. While the zoom magnification is switched only by changing the optical magnification of the lens <b>14</b>, as described above, the answer to the determination in step <b>100</b> is not affirmative. Accordingly, the entire image represented by the image data which is stored in the memory <b>48</b> is always displayed on the entire display <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the image photographing mode, when increasing the zoom magnification is further designated via the operation switch <b>32</b> when the optical magnification of the lens <b>14</b> is maximized, if an image is being displayed on the display <b>26</b>, it is determined that displaying an image in an enlarged manner needs to be carried out by the electronic changing magnification processing. Then, the answer to the determination in step <b>100</b> is affirmative. In the electronic changing magnification processing in the image photographing mode, the central position of an enlarged display range always coincides with the central position of an original image.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">On the other hand, in the image play back mode, the operation switch <b>32</b> is used to designate switching of the image display magnification and moving of the image display range. That is to say, when the upper or lower switch is simply turned on or off, it means that changing the image display magnification is designated. When the image display magnification is to be increased, the upper switch is turned on, and when the image display magnification is to be reduced, the lower switch is turned on. When any one of the upper, lower, right, or left switches is turned on or off in a state that a button (not shown) is being pressed, it means that changing the image display range is designated. Then, a switch corresponding to a direction in which the image display range is to be moved is turned on in a state that the unillustrated button is being pressed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the image play back mode, an initial value of the image display magnification is a magnification (i.e., a minimized magnification) at which the entire image represented by the image data is displayed on the entire display <b>26</b>. When switching the image display magnification (i.e., displaying the image in an enlarged manner) is designated via the operation switch <b>32</b>, and when moving the enlarged display range is designated via the operation switch <b>32</b>, it is determined that the image needs to be displayed in an enlarged manner by the electronic changing magnification processing. Accordingly, the answer to the determination in step <b>100</b> is affirmative. In the electronic changing magnification processing in the image play back mode, the central position of the enlarged display range is set or changed in accordance with the designation for moving the enlarged display range.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">If the answer to the determination in step <b>100</b> is affirmative as described above, the process proceeds to step <b>110</b>. In step <b>110</b>, enlarged display parameters (a magnification of an image and the central position of the enlarged display range) which are set or changed by operating the operation switch <b>32</b> are fetched. In step <b>112</b>, on the basis of the fetched enlarged displayed parameters, a position which corresponds to the outer edge of the enlarged display range on the image represented by the image data stored in the memory <b>48</b> is computed. In step <b>114</b>, on the basis of the result of the computation in step <b>112</b>, data within the enlarged display range (enlarged image data) is extracted from the image data which is stored in the memory <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, when a range (the outer edge) of the image represented by the image data which is stored in the memory <b>48</b> is represented by a white rectangle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, and an enlarged display range is represented by a hatched rectangle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, data within the range represented by the hatched rectangle is extracted as the enlarged image data. Determination of the enlarged display range in accordance with the operation of the operation switch <b>32</b> and extraction of the enlarged image data within the enlarged display range, as in steps <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, correspond to a display controller recited in the fifth aspect of the first invention. The operation switch <b>32</b> corresponds to a designating device recited in the fifth aspect of the first invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In step <b>116</b>, the pixel density of the enlarged image data which has been extracted is converted on the basis of the magnification and the number of pixels of the display <b>26</b> (i.e., the pixel density of the enlarged image data which has been extracted is converted such that vertical direction and horizontal direction the numbers of pixels of the image represented by the enlarged image data which has been extracted coincide with the numbers of pixels of the display <b>26</b> in the vertical and horizontal directions). Then, in step <b>118</b>, the enlarged image data, which has been subjected to pixel density conversion, is expanded in the image data-for-display storage region.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In next step <b>120</b>, the original image data which is stored in the memory <b>48</b> is modified such that a frame which represents a boundary (the outer edge of the enlarged display range) between the inside of the enlarged display range and the outside thereof, is synthesized with the image represented by the original image data. In step <b>122</b>, the pixel density of the image data is converted to a predetermined pixel density such that a frame size of the image with which the frame is synthesized and which is represented by the image data is reduced to a predetermined frame size (predetermined frame size which is smaller than the original image). In step <b>124</b>, the image data (reduced image data), for which the pixel density has been converted into the predetermined pixel density, is expanded in a region, in the image-data-for-display storage region, which region corresponds to the upper right corner of the display surface of the display <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The image data which is expanded in the image-data-for-display storage region as described above is transmitted to the display <b>26</b> in the next step <b>126</b>. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, an enlarged image <b>80</b> (which corresponds to a main image in the present invention) which is enlarged at a magnification which corresponds to the operation of the operation switch <b>32</b> is displayed on the entire display <b>26</b>. At the same time, an image <b>82</b> (which is referred to as a navigation image <b>82</b> hereinafter), which represents the entire image and into which has been added a frame <b>84</b> which specifies the range being displayed as the enlarged image <b>80</b>, is displayed in the upper right corner of the display surface at a smaller magnification which is smaller than that of the enlarged image <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The navigation image <b>82</b> corresponds to visible information of the present invention, and specifically to a sub-image of the present invention. A display method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> corresponds to the respective display of the main image and the sub-image on a single display, as recited in the forth aspect of the first invention.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">By using the navigation image <b>82</b> displayed on the display <b>26</b> as a reference, a user can grasp the overall image, and can easily visually recognize the range being displayed as the enlarged image <b>80</b>. In the image photographing mode, for example, the user can easily determine whether a range to be photographed is appropriate. In the image play back mode, for example, the user can easily confirm or appreciate detail portions of the image by making reference to the enlarged image <b>80</b> and can easily determine the range to be displayed as the enlarged image <b>80</b> by making reference to the navigation image <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The above-described steps <b>110</b> to <b>126</b> are repeatedly carried out while the answer to the determination in step <b>128</b> is negative and the answer to the determination in step <b>100</b> is affirmative. Accordingly, if changing the zoom magnification, switching the image display magnification, or moving the enlarged display range is designated by the user's operating the operating switch <b>32</b> again, the enlarged display range is changed, and in accordance with this change of the enlarged display range, the size of the frame <b>84</b> and the position of the frame <b>84</b> on the navigation image <b>82</b> are changed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the above-described embodiment, a case has been explained, in which the enlarged image <b>80</b> is continuously displayed while the image is displayed in an enlarged manner by the electronic changing magnification processing, and the navigation image <b>82</b> is superposed on the enlarged image <b>80</b> and continuously displayed in the upper right corner of the enlarged image <b>80</b>. Instead of the above-described case, for example, each time a switching of the display mode is designated by operating the menu switch <b>28</b> or the operation switch <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is possible to successively switch to a state in which only the enlarged image <b>80</b> is displayed on the display <b>26</b>, a state in which only the navigation image <b>82</b> is displayed on the display <b>26</b>, and a state in which the enlarged image <b>80</b> and the navigation image <b>82</b> are respectively displayed on the display <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As a result, the user can easily confirm a portion of the enlarged image <b>80</b> on which the navigation image <b>82</b> is superposed in the range of the image which is displayed as the enlarged image <b>80</b>, or can confirm in detail the position or the size of the enlarged display range by making reference to the navigation image <b>82</b>. Each time a switching of the display mode is designated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for example, it is possible to successively switch to, in addition to the above-mentioned three states, a state of displaying a set-up image <b>86</b> which enables switching of modes such as whether or not a flash is to be used, whether or not exposure correction is to be carried out, or an AE mode or the like, i.e., it is possible to successively switch to a fourth state.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Instead of switching the image displayed on the display <b>26</b> in accordance with the designation for switching the display mode as described above, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the enlarged image <b>80</b> and the navigation image <b>82</b> may be respectively displayed on a display surface of the display <b>26</b> such that they do not overlap each other. When the aspect ratio of the enlarged image <b>80</b> or the navigation image <b>82</b>, is the same as that of the display surface of the display <b>26</b> or the like, a region in which no image is displayed is generated within the display surface of the display <b>26</b>. Therefore, in an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, by displaying photographing information or set-up information in the region, the display surface of the display <b>26</b> can be efficiently used.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the aspect that the enlarged image <b>80</b> and the navigation image <b>82</b> are respectively displayed such that they do not overlap each other as described above, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, the aspect ratio of the display surface of the display <b>26</b> may be different from that of the enlarged image <b>80</b> or the navigation image <b>82</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows an example in which the ratio of the horizontal length of the display surface of the display <b>26</b> to the vertical length thereof is larger than that of the displayed image. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> shows an example in which the vertical length of the display surface of the display <b>26</b> is longer than the horizontal length thereof. As compared with the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a region within the display surface in which the image is not displayed can be made smaller and therefore the display surface of the display <b>26</b> can be used more efficiently.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. The same portions as those of the first embodiment are designated by the same reference numerals, and descriptions thereof are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in a digital still camera <b>60</b> relating to the second embodiment of the present invention, a small size display <b>62</b>, which is formed by a reflection type display device or a transmission type display device (for example, an LED) and is smaller than the display <b>26</b>, is mounted at a right side of the display <b>26</b> on a back surface of a main body <b>12</b>. Hereinafter, the display <b>26</b> is referred to as a “main display <b>26</b>” and the display <b>62</b> is referred to as a “sub display <b>62</b>”. The sub display <b>62</b> may be a monochrome display or may be a color display. The main display <b>26</b> and the sub display <b>62</b> correspond to “a plurality of displays” recited in the forth aspect of the first invention.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, as well as the main display <b>26</b>, the sub display <b>62</b> is connected to the memory <b>48</b>. An image which is represented by image data which is transmitted from the memory <b>48</b> to the sub display <b>62</b> is displayed on the sub display <b>62</b>. A dot matrix display <b>64</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) for displaying photographing information or set-up information is also connected to the bus <b>52</b>. The dot matrix display <b>64</b> is not an essential component and can be substituted with the main display <b>26</b> or the sub display <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An operation of the second embodiment of the present invention will be explained. In the second embodiment, when the electronic changing magnification processing is carried out, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, an enlarged image <b>80</b> is displayed on the entire display surface of the main display <b>26</b> and a navigation image <b>82</b> is displayed on the entire display surface of the sub display <b>62</b>. Accordingly, as in the first embodiment, a user can easily grasp the overall image and can easily visually recognize a range of the image which is being displayed as the enlarged image <b>80</b>. Because the enlarged image <b>80</b> and the navigation image <b>82</b> do not overlap and respective images are displayed on the displays <b>26</b> and <b>62</b> respectively, respective portions of the enlarged image <b>80</b> can be easily confirmed.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The present invention is not limited to displaying the enlarged image <b>80</b> on the main display <b>26</b> and the navigation image <b>82</b> on the sub display <b>62</b>. When switching the display mode is designated, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the navigation image <b>82</b> may be displayed on the main display <b>26</b> and the enlarged image <b>80</b> may be displayed on the sub display <b>62</b>. The user can easily confirm in detail the position or the size of the enlarged display range by making reference to the navigation image <b>82</b> which is displayed on the main display <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Although there has been explained the case in which the enlarged image <b>80</b> or the navigation image <b>82</b> is displayed on the sub display <b>62</b>, the present invention is not limited to this case. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the position and the size of the enlarged display range may be simply displayed by displaying a graphic form <b>88</b> which represents the position and the size of the enlarged display range in the entire image on the sub display <b>62</b>. This graphic form also corresponds to visible information in accordance with the present invention. As described above, (it is possible to use a low cost display in which the number of pixels is small and an image is difficult to be displayed with an image quality level which is at least higher than a predetermined level). Accordingly, cost reduction of a digital still camera can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Instead of displaying the navigation image on the display <b>26</b> or <b>62</b>, or displaying the graphic form <b>88</b>, the enlarged display range may be designated as follows. For example, a crystal liquid display is disposed so as to be superposed on an optical finder <b>16</b>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, among respective cells of the liquid crystal display, light transmittance of cells within the enlarged display range on the image which is visually confirmed by the user via the optical finder <b>16</b> is made different from that of cells outside the enlarged display range. A light-transmittable pattern which is displayed on the liquid crystal display also corresponds to visible information (the image recited in the second aspect of the second invention) relating to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In this way, the image (light-transmittable pattern) which is displayed on the liquid crystal display is superposed on the image which is to be imaged by the optical finder <b>16</b>. When the user looks through the optical finder <b>16</b>, the user will visually confirm an image in which lightness of the inside of the enlarged display range is different from that outside of the enlarged display range, and therefore the user can easily recognize the position and the size of the enlarged display range.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further, for example, if the size of the enlarged display range can be gradually changed with the central position thereof being fixed, instead of displaying the light-transmittable pattern on the liquid crystal display which is disposed so as to be superposed on the optical finder <b>16</b> as described above, the image which represents the enlarged display range can be displayed as follows. For example, light transmittable patterns (or graphical forms shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) which correspond to various sizes of the enlarged display range are respectively recorded on a plurality of transparent sheets. Then, a sheet whose size corresponds to the current size of the enlarged display range is selectively inserted to an optical path.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> and the like show an example in which a boundary between the inside of the enlarged display range and the outside thereof is designated by the frame <b>84</b> which is formed by a line having high density, but the present invention is not limited to this example. The frame may be formed by a line having low density (for example, a white line) or may be formed by a line having low saturation. Instead of the frame, for example, at least one of lightness, saturation and hue of an image may be changed between the inside and the outside of the enlarged display range (for example, outside of the enlarged display range is set at low lightness or low saturation, or hue of the outside of the enlarged display range is changed to a complementary color of the original color or the like). The enlarged display range is formed in a rectangle which has a constant aspect ratio, but the present invention is not limited to this case. The aspect ratio of the enlarged display range may be optionally determined or the enlarged display range itself may be optionally changed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Image information of the present invention is not limited to image data which represents a single image. Image data, which represents a state in which a plurality of images are arranged in a matrix (a so-called index image), may be used as image information of the present invention. For example, in the aspect in which a plurality of displays are provided as in the second embodiment, image data of the plural images which are stored in a memory card or the like is edited as image data which represents an index image and is stored in the memory <b>48</b>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, an index image <b>90</b> is displayed as a navigation image on the main display <b>26</b> and one image <b>92</b> of the plural images contained in the index image <b>90</b> is displayed as an enlarged image on the sub display <b>62</b>. Details of respective image can be confirmed by making reference to the image displayed on the sub display <b>62</b>, and therefore, a large number of images can be displayed as the index image on the main display <b>26</b>. For example, images represented by a large number of image data stored in the memory card can be easily understood.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the above-described description, a digital still camera has been explained as the image photographing apparatus recited in the first aspect or the second aspect of the second invention, but the present invention is not limited to the same. It is needless to say that a digital video camera can be applied to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">An image photographing apparatus has been explained, which has a function as the image display apparatus recited in any one of the first aspect to the sixth aspect of the first invention, but the invention recited in the first aspect to the sixth aspect of the first invention is not limited to applying to an image photographing apparatus. It is possible to use the present invention as an image display apparatus which reads out image data which is stored in an information storage medium such as a memory card, a CD-R, or the like and displays the image data on a display device such as a display or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a schematic block diagram of an image display apparatus <b>70</b> in which a single display <b>26</b> is provided as in the digital still camera shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a schematic block diagram of an image display apparatus <b>72</b> in which a main display <b>26</b> and a sub display <b>62</b> are provided as in the digital still camera <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. When the present invention recited in any one of the first aspect to the sixth aspect of the first invention is applied to these image display apparatuses and the image is displayed in an enlarged manner by the electronic changing magnification processing, visible information relating to the present invention (navigation image, graphic form or image which represents the enlarged display range) may be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Although embodiments of the present invention have been explained, the above embodiments include aspects described below.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">(1) An image display apparatus according to the first aspect of the first invention, wherein an image represented by image information is an index image in which a plurality of images are arranged in a matrix, and a display controller displays one of the plurality of images contained in the index image as a main image.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">(2) An image display apparatus according to the sixth aspect of the first invention, wherein image information obtained by photographing with the image photographing apparatus is stored in an information storage medium.</p>
