<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates generally to storing and organizing electronic devices and more specifically to a device that holds and supplies power and data communication to a plurality of common desk-top items while allowing continuous rotatable access to each item.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Technology has provided us with many useful tools for making communication and basic office functions efficient, easy, and of higher quality. Some of these devices include computers, computer monitors, printers, scanners, facsimile machines, copiers, cordless telephones, transponders for wireless connectivity, paper shredders, surge protectors, and others. However, spatially arranging all of these useful devices consumes an inordinate amount of desk-top real-estate, leaving less and less room to actually accomplish the work which the devices are intended to facilitate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Additionally, each device must be powered, which requires a separate power-carrying cable running from a power source to each device. Furthermore, many of the devices also require interconnectivity to at least one other device, the internet, a phone line, all three, or others. The aggregation of devices on a desk brings with it a multitude of cables strung throughout and consuming further workspace area. The cables are not only unattractive; they also interfere with the workspace and become a nuisance.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Storing the devices on the floor is an alternative to utilizing valuable desk space. However, storing devices on the floor suffers from the disadvantages of making the devices difficult or inconvenient to reach, easy to damage by kicking, stepping on, or otherwise, and also consuming valuable floor space.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a rotatable storage device including a continuously rotatable platform configured for storing and allowing ease of access to electronic devices such as printers, fax machines, computers, scanners, and others. The device includes a base member having high and low voltage base connectors. A support platform is rotatably positioned on the base member and includes an acceptor assembly having high and low voltage receptacles. A rotatable connector includes a first connector portion and a second connector portion rotatable with respect to the first connector portion. The rotatable connector further includes high and low voltage connectors, wherein the rotatable connector electrically couples the acceptor assembly high and low voltage receptacles and the high and low voltage base receptacles, such that the acceptor assembly high and low voltage receptacles are rotatable with respect to the high and low voltage base receptacles as the support platform is rotated with respect to the base member.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The device can further include a first column affixed to and extending from the support platform. A second supporting platform can be rotatably affixed to the first column, such that the second support platform is rotatable with respect to first support platform. The second platform can include a second column affixed to and extending there from. The first and second column can each include high and low voltage receptacles, where a first rotatable connector operably connects the high and low voltage receptacles of the first column to the base high and low voltage connectors. A second rotatable connector operably connects the high and low voltage receptacles of the second column to the high and low voltage receptacle of the first column.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention provides a rotatable storage device including a rotatable platform configured for storing and allowing ease of access to electronic devices such as, printers, facsimile machines, computers, scanners, and others. The rotatable platform includes high and low voltage receptacle for connection to the electronic devices. The high and low voltage receptacles provide power, as well as data and voice communication to the electronic devices. The receptacles are connected to a rotatable connector allowing the rotatable platform and receptacle to be rotated in unison without the twisting or tangling of the power and connecting wires. The rotatable connector can take the form of sliprings, brushes, mercury rotatable connectors, or other known devices.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to the drawing figures in which like reference designators refer to like elements, there is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> an assembly <b>100</b> of the present invention. The assembly <b>100</b> includes a base section <b>102</b> and a rotatable platform <b>104</b>. An acceptor assembly <b>106</b>, including a plurality of high and low voltage receptacles <b>108</b>, is centrally positioned on and connected to the rotatable platform <b>104</b>, such that the receptacle assembly <b>106</b> rotates with the rotatable platform <b>104</b>. The receptacles <b>108</b> are configured for receiving and securing of data cables and power cables for connection to the electronic devices. The base section <b>102</b> can further include a surge protector, uninterrupted power supply (“UPS”), or other electronic connector or modifier connected to the acceptor assembly <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The rotatable platform <b>104</b> can be any shape, but in the embodiment shown, is circular. The rotatable platform <b>104</b> may be made of any rigid material, such as plastic, metal, wood, or others.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the acceptor assembly <b>106</b> is operably connected to an acceptor <b>202</b> configured for receiving and securing low-voltage cables <b>204</b> and a power cable <b>206</b>. Surrounding the acceptor <b>202</b> is a number of rollers <b>208</b> for supporting the rotatable platform <b>104</b> positioned on the base section <b>102</b>. The rollers <b>208</b> can be wheels, balls, or any other friction-reducing surface or mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Located along an outside edge <b>210</b> of the base section <b>102</b> is a plurality of data ports <b>212</b>. The data ports include low voltage ports, jacks, or connectors, which can include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: ethernet ports, phone jacks, USB ports, serial ports parallel ports, coaxial cable connectors, and RCA jacks. The ports <b>212</b> are coupled to the acceptor <b>202</b> allowing electronic devices and services outside the assembly <b>100</b> to couple to the assembly <b>100</b> and communicate with the electronic devices located on the assembly <b>100</b>. The devices can include such items as computers, computer monitors, printers, scanners, facsimile machines, copiers, cordless telephones, transponders for wireless connectivity, and others. Services include telephone, cable, internet, intranet, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The cables <b>204</b> run from the ports <b>212</b> to the acceptor <b>202</b> and are able to carry low-voltage data signals between the ports <b>212</b> and a connector that couples the base section <b>102</b> to the rotatable platform <b>104</b> as will be explained below. The cables <b>204</b> can be any industry standard or specially made cable for transmitting low-voltage data signals. The term “low-voltage,” as used herein, refers to voltages below 110 volts and the term “high-voltage” will refer to voltages that are 110 volts and above. In other words, high-voltage means the standard electrical power and is generally 100-240 V<sub>AC</sub>, 0.15 A and 50-60 Hz. In contrast, low-voltage is generally a DC voltage, and, depending on the device, is typically less than 24 V<sub>DC</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The power cable <b>206</b> is a standard power cord for carrying high-voltage of 110 volts and higher. The outside edge <b>210</b> of the base section <b>102</b> has an opening <b>214</b> where the cable <b>206</b> passes through the wall <b>210</b>. The power cable <b>206</b>, similar to the data cables <b>204</b>, passes through the acceptor <b>202</b> for connection to the connector (not shown). The base section <b>102</b> can further include a spring-loaded recoiler for winding up and keeping portions of the power cord <b>206</b> within the base <b>102</b>. Alternatively, the outer edge <b>210</b> of the base section <b>102</b> can include a power receptacle, surge protector, or UPS configured for receiving a power cord.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the acceptor assembly includes a connector <b>302</b> that couples voltage receptacles <b>108</b> on the rotatable platform <b>104</b> to the acceptor <b>202</b>. The connector <b>302</b> can include two coaxial sections, a first section <b>304</b> and a second section <b>306</b>, that are each rotatable with respect to each other. The connector <b>302</b> has a plurality of pins <b>308</b> on the first section <b>304</b> and a corresponding plurality of pins <b>312</b> (not shown) on the second section, opposite the first section <b>304</b>. Within the connector <b>302</b> are conductive pathways that connect each individual pin <b>308</b> to a corresponding one of the pins <b>312</b> so that each pin is a single isolated pathway to a pin on the other side of the connector <b>302</b>. The connector <b>302</b> further allows the sections <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> to be rotated any number of times in either of two directions with the sets of corresponding pins remaining electrically coupled to each other throughout all angles of the rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One exemplary connector is connector “830,” manufactured by Mercotac, Inc. of Carlsbad Calif. The “830” connector provides eight pins on each section of the rotatable connector's two sections. Within the “830” connector are channels where connector pins are present and conductive mercury within the channel keeps each set of two pins in electrical communication, regardless of rotation of the two sections. The 830 connector provides 6 pathways rated up to 30 amps and 2 pathways rated up to 4 amps. It should be noted that other connectors having fewer or lesser pins or other mechanisms, such as sliprings and brushes, for allowing rotation while keeping uninterrupted electrical communication between sets of pins, may also be used in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The connector <b>302</b> couples to the acceptor <b>202</b>. The cables <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> are terminated at the pins <b>308</b> on the first section <b>304</b> of the connector <b>302</b>. Rollers <b>208</b> make contact with a bottom side <b>310</b> of, and support, the first rotatable platform <b>104</b>. The rollers <b>208</b> provide support so that when the electronic devices are placed on the surfaces, undo strain is not placed on the connector <b>302</b>. Other methods of providing support so that the rotatable platform <b>104</b> can rotate independent of the base may be used and are within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the rotatable platform <b>104</b> is shown placed on the base section <b>102</b>. The acceptor assembly <b>106</b> can include a first column <b>112</b> centrally positioned on and connected to the rotatable platform <b>104</b>, such that the first column <b>112</b> rotates with the rotatable platform <b>104</b>. The first column <b>112</b> can be a hollow tubular member and includes one or more high-voltage power receptacles <b>402</b> and one or more low-voltage receptacles <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a cutaway view of an exemplary column <b>112</b>. Provided within the column <b>112</b> is at least one high-voltage receptacle for supplying power to electronic devices. In one embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of high-voltage receptacles are provided within one or more power strips <b>502</b> secured on an interior of the column <b>112</b>. Power is supplied to the strip from the second side <b>306</b> of the connector <b>302</b> by a set of wires <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Also provided within the column <b>112</b> are one or more low-voltage receptacles <b>506</b>. The low voltage receptacles <b>506</b> can include low voltage jacks, ports, or connectors, including but not limited to, ethernet ports, phone jacks, USB ports, serial ports, parallel ports, coaxial cable connectors, and RCA jacks, among others. The low-voltage receptacles <b>506</b> can be provided within a power strip <b>508</b>, which has one or more types of low-voltage receptacles <b>506</b>. Each low-voltage receptacle <b>506</b> is electrically coupled to the second side <b>306</b> of the connector <b>302</b> by one or more wires <b>510</b>. It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to a column or round shape for supporting receptacles and/or supplying high-voltage power or low-voltage signals to electronic items on the same or different platforms. Other shapes, such as boxes or others are contemplated and are within the spirit and scope of the invention. In other embodiments, the receptacles are provided within the item-supporting platforms.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As stated above, the rotatable platform <b>104</b> and the first column <b>112</b> are mechanically coupled together so that when the rotatable platform <b>104</b> is rotated, the column <b>112</b> also rotates. The connector <b>302</b> allows the wires <b>504</b> and <b>510</b> to remain stationary relative to the power strips <b>502</b> and <b>508</b> so that the wires <b>504</b> and <b>510</b> do not become twisted and pulled away from the power strips <b>502</b> and <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In another embodiment, the assembly <b>600</b> may include a number of tiers. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the base section <b>602</b> can include a first tier <b>604</b>, a second tier <b>606</b>, and a third tier <b>608</b>.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first platform <b>610</b> is substantially similar to the rotatable platform <b>104</b> as described above, and coupled to the base section <b>602</b> in like manner. The second platform <b>614</b> is similar to the first platform <b>610</b> and is placed on top of the first platform <b>610</b>. Protruding from the bottom of the second platform <b>614</b> is a second rotatable connector <b>702</b> that includes a coaxial first half <b>704</b> and second half <b>706</b> that rotate relative to one another while maintaining at least one continuous electrical path between the two halves <b>704</b> and <b>706</b> of the connector <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, the second connector <b>702</b> is inserted inside the upper portion <b>608</b> of the first column <b>612</b>. In this configuration, the first platform <b>610</b> and the second platform <b>614</b> can rotate independently of each other. Any number of platforms can be stacked in this manner and the invention is not limited to the number shown in the diagrams.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is shown that a second column <b>616</b> is mechanically coupled to the second platform <b>614</b>. The second column <b>616</b> is similar in structure to the first column <b>612</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The second column <b>616</b> is provided with one or more high-voltage receptacles <b>120</b> and one or more low-voltage receptacles <b>122</b>. The second connector <b>702</b> receives power from the second side <b>306</b> of the first connector <b>308</b>. Both the second side <b>306</b> of the first connector <b>308</b> and the first side <b>704</b> of the second connector <b>702</b> are mechanically coupled to the first column <b>612</b> so that the second side <b>306</b> of the first connector <b>308</b> and the first side <b>704</b> of the second connector <b>702</b> maintain a fixed orientation to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an exemplary wiring diagram for exemplary electrical connections between the first platform <b>604</b> and the second platform <b>606</b>. In the diagram, connectors having eight pins are shown for simplicity of illustration. However, connectors having more or less than eight pins can be used with the present invention. In the figure, pins <b>1</b> through <b>8</b> are provided on the first side <b>304</b> of the first connector <b>302</b>. Pins <b>1</b> through <b>8</b> are electrically connected to corresponding pins <b>1</b> through <b>8</b> on the second side <b>306</b> of the first connector <b>302</b>. Wires <b>802</b> carry power from pins <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> to the high-voltage power strip <b>502</b> and then on to pins <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> of the first side <b>704</b> of the second connector <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Wires <b>804</b> conduct low-voltage signals between pins <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> and receptacle <b>810</b> in the strip <b>508</b>. Wires <b>804</b> also conduct low-voltage signals from pins <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> of the first connector to pins <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> of the first side <b>704</b> of the second connector <b>702</b>. Because pins <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are connected to the receptacle <b>810</b> and to the second connector <b>702</b>, it is possible for devices on the second platform <b>606</b> to communicate with devices on the first platform <b>604</b> and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A third set of wires <b>806</b> conduct low-voltage signals between pins <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> and a second data receptacle <b>812</b> in the low-voltage strip <b>508</b>. Wires <b>806</b> also conduct low-voltage signals from pins <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> of the first connector to pins <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> of the first side <b>704</b> of the second connector <b>702</b>. Because pins <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> are connected to the data receptacle <b>812</b> and to the second connector <b>702</b>, it is possible for devices on the second platform <b>606</b> to communicate with devices on the first platform <b>604</b> and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A fourth set of wires <b>808</b> directly connect pins <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> of the first connector to pins <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> of the second connector <b>702</b>. Wires <b>808</b> can be used to communicate data directly and exclusively between the two connectors <b>302</b> and <b>702</b>. As stated above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, outside devices can attach to the base <b>102</b> through ports <b>212</b>. Through use of wires <b>808</b>, a device on the second platform <b>606</b> can communicate directly with outside devices via cables <b>204</b> and data communication ports <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, a low-voltage data connector <b>814</b> is connected directly to another low-voltage data connector <b>816</b> through wires <b>818</b>. Through these connectors, two electronic items on the same platform can be communicatively coupled together via that platform's column. Any number of connectors can be coupled together on the same platform. Connection through the column allows the electronic items to be added and removed easily without having to physically connect the items to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the first platform <b>604</b> is mechanically coupled to the second side <b>306</b> of the first connector <b>302</b>. The second platform <b>606</b> is mechanically coupled to the second side <b>706</b> of the second connector <b>702</b>. When the first and second platforms <b>604</b> and <b>606</b> rotate in relation to each other, the pins <b>1</b>-<b>8</b> on the first side <b>304</b> of the first connector <b>302</b> remain continuously electrically coupled to pins <b>1</b>-<b>8</b> on the second side <b>706</b> of the second connector <b>702</b> as shown in the wiring diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. These pins remain connected regardless of rotational movement of the two sides of either connector.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring once again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a third platform <b>608</b>, which includes a third platform <b>618</b> is placed on top of the second column <b>616</b> of the second platform <b>606</b>. The third platform <b>618</b> can be fixedly attached to the second column <b>616</b>, so that the third platform <b>618</b> moves in unison with the second column <b>616</b> or, in an alternative embodiment, a third rotatable connector <b>624</b>, which is similar in structure to the first and second connectors <b>302</b> and <b>702</b>, couples the third platform <b>618</b> to the second column <b>616</b> so that the third platform <b>618</b> can rotate independently of the second column <b>616</b> below.
