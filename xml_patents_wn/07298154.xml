<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a wafer testing apparatus, and more particularly, to a probe card where more number of testing probes can be disposed thereon by modifying the layout of the circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Along with progressive development of the semiconductor fabricating process, the channel length of the modern semiconductor process is reduced from 0.15 μm to 0.13 μm and further to the newest 90 nanometer. During the semiconductor fabricating process, in order to ensure the yield rate and avoid the package wastage, the electrical properties and the functions of the wafer are required to be tested before the wafer is fabricated, cut and packaged. In such testing method, a testing loop is constituted by a test tool and a probe card, and each probe pin on the probe card directly contacts a pad or a bump on the chip, such that a chip signal is extracted from each chip on the wafer through the probe. Thereafter, the chip signal is sent to the test tool for further analysis. With such testing method, the chips with poor electrical properties or functions are scrapped before the wafer is packaged, such that the problem of the package fabricating cost increasing due to the growing number of the wafers with poor quality is effectively eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows a layout diagram of a conventional probe card. Wherein, the probe card <b>100</b> includes a front surface and a back surface that have the specific layout and arrangement as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>), respectively. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>), the front surface of the probe card <b>100</b> includes multiple pogo pads <b>120</b>, multiple capacitors <b>130</b>, and multiple relays <b>140</b> that are disposed on the circular printed circuit board (PCB) <b>110</b>. Wherein, the pogo pads <b>120</b> are disposed on the periphery of the PCB <b>110</b> with a ring arrangement aligned to the center of the PCB <b>110</b>. The capacitors <b>130</b> and the relays <b>140</b> are disposed outside a square area aligned to the center of the PCB <b>100</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>), the back surface of the probe card <b>100</b> includes a square ceramic head <b>150</b> that is disposed on the circular PCB <b>110</b>. In addition, multiple probe pins <b>160</b> are disposed on the ceramic head <b>150</b> with an arrangement of a square-shaped array.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The connection and function of the tester are described in detail hereinafter. Wherein, the pogo pads <b>120</b> are connected to multiple pogo pins (not shown) on the mother board of the test tool, such that the test signal is transmitted from the mother board to the probe pins through the pogo pads <b>120</b>, and then the test signal is further transmitted to multiple chips of a test wafer for performing a functional test. In addition, the relays <b>140</b> are cooperated with the capacitors <b>130</b>, such that the capacitors <b>130</b> can be controlled and switched by the relays <b>140</b> according to the instruction of the test signal to filter the noise in the test signal.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, since the ICs currently used are demanded to be smaller and capable of providing more functions and higher pin counts, under the pressure of the successful development of the driver share testing method, more number of probe pins are demanded by the test tool. However, the number of the probe pins used in the present probe card is not changed, if the conventional probe card is used to test the wafer, it may require more time and more effort, and the lifespan of the probe card is significantly impacted due to the over-worn of the probe pin. In addition, if it is required to add more number of probe pins on the probe card, since the space on the probe card is limited, the probe card cannot accommodate all of the testers. Moreover, if the size of the probe card is needed to be enlarged, both of the securing unit of the mother board and the probe card of the test tool have to be redesigned and modified accordingly, which significantly raises the test cost.</p>

Moreover, the test signal is transmitted to multiple chips on the test wafer <b>380</b> through multiple probe pins <b>370</b> on the probe apparatus <b>340</b>, so as to determine whether the electrical properties and functions of the chips are optimum or not.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The probe tool <b>320</b> includes a chuck <b>390</b> for loading and spinning the test wafer <b>380</b>, such that the probe apparatus <b>340</b> can test multiple chips on different areas of the test wafer <b>380</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the probe system <b>300</b> of the present embodiment, the size of the securing unit <b>350</b> is modified accordingly to adapt with the enlarged space of the probe apparatus <b>340</b>, and the pogo pads of the probe apparatus <b>340</b> are disposed with the same arrangement of the present test tool. Accordingly, the total number of the chips that can be tested at one time by the probe apparatus <b>340</b> is increased, and the testing efficiency of the present test tool is substantially promoted without modifying the design of the mother board <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, only 32 DUTs (device under test) can be tested by the conventional probe apparatus at one time. However, by using the probe apparatus of the present invention in conjunction with the driver share testing technique, more than 64 or 128 DUTs can be tested at one time. In other words, the testing time can be reduced by ½ or ¼ compared to the conventional probe apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In summary, in the probe apparatus of the present invention, a larger circuit board is used for disposing the testers and the layout of each tester in the circuit board is modified accordingly, such that more number of testers can be disposed on the circuit board and the pin count of the probe apparatus is increased. In addition, the probe apparatus may be installed in the test tool. Accordingly, the testing efficiency of the present test tool is substantially promoted and the overall cost of testing can be substantially reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although the invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment thereof, it will be apparent to one of the ordinary skills in the art that modifications to the described embodiment may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention will be defined by the attached claims not by the above detailed description.</p>
