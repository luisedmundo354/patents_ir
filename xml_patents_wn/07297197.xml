<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an ink jet ink which has high environmental gas resistance and provides good images in which the occurrence of metallic luster, the so-called bronze phenomenon, is suppressed even when the ink is printed on a recording medium. The present invention also relates to an ink jet recording method, an ink cartridge, a recording unit, and an ink jet recording apparatus each using the ink jet ink.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An ink jet recording method is a recording method of applying a small ink droplet to any one of recording media such as plain paper and glossy media to form an image, and has become rapidly widespread owing to reduction in costs and improvement in recording rate. With the rapid spread of digital cameras in addition to improvement in the quality of images recorded by the method, the method has been generally used as a method of outputting photographic images comparable to silver halide photographs.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, image quality has undergone improvement more than ever owing to, for example, extreme reduction in size of an ink droplet and an improvement of the color gamut involved in the introduction of multi-color inks. Meanwhile, there have been growing demands for coloring materials and inks, and stricter properties have been required in respect of improvement of color developability and reliability concerning anti-clogging or ejection stability.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As compared with the silver halide photograph, the ink jet recording method is problematic in respect of, for example, the image storage stability of the resultant recorded product. In general, the recorded product obtained by the ink jet recording method is inferior in image storage stability to that by the silver halide photograph, and involves the emergence of a problem in that a coloring material on the recorded product is apt to deteriorate to cause a change in the color tone of the image and the color fading of the image when the recorded product is exposed to light, heat, environmental gases present in the air, or the like for a long period of time. In particular, the enhancement of environmental gas resistance to the level of silver halide photographs has been of a concern from the past in the ink jet recording method. Cyan has the lowest environmental gas resistance among yellow, magenta, and cyan, which are hues used for ink jet ink. Therefore, the enhancement of the environmental gas resistance of cyan ink to the level comparable to that of yellow ink or magenta ink is of one important concern in the ink jet recording method.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The basic skeletons of coloring materials for ink jet ink having a cyan hue are roughly classified into a phthalocyanine skeleton and a triphenylmethane skeleton. Representative coloring materials of the former include C.I. Direct Blue 86 and 87, and C.I. Direct Blue 199. Representative coloring materials of the latter include C.I. Acid Blue 9.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In general, a phthalocyanine-based coloring material is characterized in that it is excellent in light resistance as compared with a triphenylmethane-based coloring material. Furthermore, the phthalocyanine-based coloring material has high fastness properties against humidity or heat and has good color developability, and so the coloring material has been widely used as a coloring material for ink jet ink.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the phthalocyanine-based coloring material tends to be poor in fastness against environmental gases in the air (such as ozone, No<sub>x</sub>, or SO<sub>2</sub>), especially an ozone gas. In particular, in a recorded product obtained by applying the coloring material on a recording medium having an ink-receiving layer containing an inorganic substance such as alumina or silica, the fastness is significantly low, hence the color fading of the recorded product is remarkable when the recorded product is left standing in a room for a long period of time. Various compounds to be added to ink have been disclosed for the purpose of improving the environmental gas resistance (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H05-171085, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H11-29729, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H10-130517, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-303009, and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-249677). However, none of those publications has achieved the compatibility between good color developability and-high environmental gas resistance for ink jet ink.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The phthalocyanine-based coloring material involves another problem, that is, the occurrence of metallic luster resulting from the high aggregation properties of the coloring material, the so-called bronze phenomenon. When the bronze phenomenon occurs in a recorded product, the optical reflection properties of the recorded product change. As a result, the color developability and hue of an image remarkably change, with the result that the image quality is significantly lowered. The bronze phenomenon is considered to occur as a result of the aggregation of the coloring material on the surface of a recording medium due to, for example, the high aggregation properties of the coloring material in ink and a lowering in permeability of the-ink into the recording medium when the ink is applied to the recording medium in particular, a coloring material with an amino group introduced in its molecule for the purpose of improving environmental gas resistance, or an ink containing a coloring material having low solubility in water tends to significantly cause the bronze phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, it has been proposed that a specific phthalocyanine-based coloring material is used to improve the environmental gas resistance (see, for example, Japanese Patent No. 2942319). The use of the specific phthalocyanine-based coloring material provides the environmental gas resistance which is of one concern in the phthalocyanine-based coloring material. However, in the proposition, there is no reference to the bronze phenomenon, and hence, resistance to the bronze phenomenon of the coloring material is unclear. In other words, the compatibility between resistance to bronze phenomenon (bronze resistance) and environmental gas resistance has not yet been achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, it is indispensable to conduct research on ink jet ink using a phthalocyanine-based coloring material which is excellent in color developability, has high environmental gas resistance, and suppresses the occurrence of the bronze phenomenon.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Hereinafter, components constituting the ink jet ink according to the present invention (hereinafter also referred to simply as “ink”) and the like will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With an ink in which the compound represented by the above formula (I) or a salt thereof is contained in an amount of more than 3.0 mass % based on the total mass of the ink, the bronze phenomenon is apt to occur. In particular, when the under-mentioned d<sub>75 </sub>value exceeds 7.50 nm, the bronze phenomenon conspicuously occurs in some cases. In addition, in an ink in which the compound represented by the above formula (I) or a salt thereof is contained in an amount of more than 0.5 mass % and less than 3.0 mass % based on the whole mass of the ink, when the d<sub>75 </sub>value exceeds 10.60 nm, the bronze phenomenon occurs in some cases. Upon finding such problems as mentioned above, the present inventors have come to make the present invention under the recognition that it is necessary to prevent the bronze phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">(Coloring Material)</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The ink according to the present invention must contain a compound represented by the following general formula (I) or a salt thereof. The compound represented by the following general formula (I) or the salt thereof is a phthalocyanine derivative characterized in that it has a cyan hue and is excellent in environmental gas resistance.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In general, when a phthalocyanine derivative is synthesized, it often inevitably includes substitution position isomers which are different in positions at which substituents R<sub>n </sub>(n: 1 to 16) in the general formula (IV) (positions of carbon atoms on the benzene rings to which R<sub>1 </sub>to R<sub>16 </sub>are bonded are defined as 1-position to 16-position, respectively) are present. However, in general, the substitution position isomers are not distinguished from one another, and are often regarded as the same derivative.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The compound represented by the general formula (I) or the salt thereof used in the present invention is synthesized by using, as a raw material, a phthalocyanine compound obtained by reacting a 4-sulfophthalic acid derivative, or a 4-sulfophthalic acid derivative and a phthalic(anhydride) derivative, in the presence of a metal compound. The compound or the salt thereof is obtained by converting a sulfonic group in the phthalocyanine compound into a chlorosulfonic group which is then allowed to react with an aminating agent in the presence of an organic amine.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In general, a phthalocyanine-based coloring material has higher aggregation properties than coloring materials having other structures (for example, a triphenylmethane-based, azo-based, or xanthene-based coloring material). The enhancement of the aggregation properties elevates fastness. Meanwhile, coloring materials having high aggregation properties shows high aggregation properties also in ink. Therefore, when an image is printed on a recording medium by using such coloring materials, the bronze phenomenon tends to remarkably occur to lower image quality.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In contrast, when a coloring material has significantly low aggregation properties, the fastness properties (especially environmental gas resistance) of the coloring material deteriorate. Therefore, the recorded product obtained by using an ink containing such a coloring material may be unable to obtain image storage stability at the same level as yellow ink and magenta ink which are excellent in environmental gas resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Accordingly, when the compound represented by the general formula (I) or the salt thereof is used as a coloring material, the aggregation properties of the coloring material must be controlled in such a manner that the occurrence of the bronze phenomenon can be suppressed and desired environmental gas resistance can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Based on the afore-mentioned findings, the present inventors focused their attention on the aggregation properties of the compound represented by the general formula (I) and the salt thereof and conducted exhaustive researches. As a result, they have found that the aggregation properties of the coloring material, the compound represented by the general formula (I) and the salt thereof, can be controlled by changing kinds of its substituents, and further color developability can be improved and the bronze phenomenon can be prevented from occurring by including the amine compound represented by the general formula (II), and arrived at the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">(Measurement of Aggregation Properties of Coloring Material)</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A small-angle X-ray scattering method is applicable to the measurement of the aggregation properties of a coloring material used in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As described in, for example, “Saishin Colloid Kagaku” (Latest Colloid Chemistry) (Kodansha Scientific, Fumio Kitahara and Kunio Furusawa) and “Hyomen Jotai and Colloid Jotai” (Surface State and Colloid State) (Tokyo Kagaku Dozin, Co., Ltd., Masayuki Nakagaki), the small-angle X-ray scattering method is an approach that has been generally used for calculating a distance between colloid particles in a colloidal solution.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The outline of a small-angle X-ray scattering apparatus will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> showing the measurement principle of the small-angle X-ray scattering method. The focal spot size of each of X-rays generated from an X-ray source is reduced to about several millimeters during the passing of the X-rays through first to third slits, and a sample solution is irradiated with the X-rays. The X-rays with which the sample solution is irradiated are scattered by particles in the sample solution before the X-rays are detected on an imaging plate. Since the scattered X-rays interfere with each other because of an optical path difference between them, a distance d value between particles can be determined on the basis of a Bragg equation (the following expression (1)) using the resultant θ value. When particles are arranged to be equidistance, the d value determined here is considered to be a distance from the center of a particle to the center of an adjacent particle.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>d</i>=λ/2 sin θ  Eq. (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
(In the expression (1), λ represents the wavelength of an X-ray, d represents the distance between particles, and θ represents a scattering angle.)
</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In general, no peak occurs in a scattering angle profile when particles in a solution are not regularly arranged. In the case of an aqueous solution of the coloring material (phthalocyanine-based coloring material) used in the present invention, a strong peak having the maximum value in the range of 2θ=0° to 5° is detected, and particles (molecular aggregates) formed by aggregation of phthalocyanine-based coloring material molecules are found to be arranged by a certain regulation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the scattering angle profile in a 10-mass % aqueous solution of each of a triphenylmethane-based coloring material having a structure represented by Compound (1) below and a phthalocyanine-based coloring material having the structure represented by the general formula (I). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that phthalocyanine-based coloring materials specifically have scattering angle peaks even when they have the same cyan hue. In other words, several phthalocyanine molecules are aggregated in an aqueous solution of a phthalocyanine-based coloring material to form molecular aggregates. In addition, the distances between the molecular aggregates have such a constant distribution as represented by the scattering angle profile.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic view of the dispersion distance between molecular aggregates of a phthalocyanine-based coloring material. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the radius of a certain molecular aggregate of the phthalocyanine-based coloring material is denoted by r<b>1</b> and the distance between molecular aggregates is denoted by d<b>1</b>. Assuming that d<b>1</b> is always constant when the structure of the phthalocyanine-based coloring material remains unchanged, the d value measured by a small-angle X-ray scattering method is considered to increase from d<b>2</b> to d<b>3</b> as the radius of the molecular aggregate formed by the phthalocyanine-based coloring material increases from r<b>1</b> to r<b>2</b>. Accordingly, the d value measured by the above method is considered to be an indication of the size of the molecular aggregate of the phthalocyanine-based coloring material, and the size of the molecular aggregate formed from coloring material molecules is considered to increase as the d value increases.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Investigation into the relationship between the d value in ink containing a phthalocyanine-based coloring material and the bronze phenomenon has revealed that in the case of phthalocyanine-based coloring materials represented by the same structural formula, the bronze phenomenon is more likely to occur as the d value is larger. Taking into consideration the fact that the bronze phenomenon occurs owing to the aggregation of coloring material molecules on a recording medium, it has been supported that there is the correlation between the d value described above and the size of a molecular aggregate.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A peak shape in a scattering angle profile indicates the distribution of the distances between molecular aggregates, that is, the distribution of the dispersion distances between the molecular aggregates. Taking into consideration the above-described fact that the dispersion distances are an indication of the sizes of molecular aggregates, such scattering angle profile is supposed to indicate the distribution of the sizes of molecular aggregates in a solution. In other words, assuming that the peak area of a scattering angle profile shows the sizes of the entire molecular aggregates in a solution, the bronze phenomenon tends to be more likely to occur as the d value is larger, that is, the frequency of large molecular aggregates is higher. Therefore, reducing the frequency of large molecular aggregates which are apt to cause the bronze phenomenon is expected to be capable of suppressing the occurrence of the bronze phenomenon. However, in the case of ink containing only significantly small molecular aggregates, the environmental gas resistance of the ink is lowered, although the bronze phenomenon is less likely to occur. Accordingly, the sizes of molecular aggregates (the absolute value of the d value) must be appropriately controlled for suppressing the occurrence of the bronze phenomenon and for obtaining environmental gas resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In general, when the sizes of coloring material molecules have a certain frequency distribution, the threshold value of the visual sense which is the limit of the observability of a human being is said to be 25% of the entire amount. In view of the above, the d value at the point at which large molecular aggregates causative of the bronze phenomenon comes to account for 25% or less of the entire aggregates, i.e., the point at which small molecular aggregates which hardly cause the bronze phenomenon account for 75% or more of the entire aggregates is defined as a d<sub>75 </sub>value and the d<sub>75 </sub>value is so controlled as to fall within a specific range, whereby ink which suppresses the occurrence of the bronze phenomenon and has high environmental gas resistance can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In actuality, according to investigation into the correlation between each of a d<sub>peak </sub>value calculated from the peak of a 2θ value in a scattering angle profile and the above-described d<sub>75 </sub>value, and the occurrence level of the bronze phenomenon, it has been found that the d<sub>75 </sub>value in which a distribution factor of the sizes of the entire molecular aggregates is taken into account has a stronger correlation with the bronze phenomenon than the d<sub>peak </sub>value. A base line for determining the 2θ value is drawn in the range of 0.5° to 5°.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The following experiment was carried out using compounds prepared by changing the number, kinds, and substitution positions of substituents in the compound represented by the general formula (I) or the salt thereof, which is a phthalocyanine-based coloring material, that is, coloring materials with the aggregation properties controlled. Inks containing the coloring materials were prepared, and the scattering angle profiles of the inks were measured to calculate the d<sub>75 </sub>values. Next, the coloring materials were evaluated for the aggregation properties on the basis of their respective d<sub>75 </sub>values. As a result, it turned out that when the d<sub>75 </sub>value was 6.70 nm or more and 10.60 nm or less and the content of the coloring material was more than 3.0 mass % based on the total mass of the ink, the bronze phenomenon occurred, and besides, that when the d<sub>75 </sub>value was more than 10.60 nm and the content of the coloring material was more than 0.5 mass %, the bronze phenomenon occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In each of the above case, it has been found that when the amine compound represented by the general formula (II) is included in the ink, the bronze phenomenon is prevented from occurring and high-environmental gas resistance is developed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A molecular density in a solution must be kept constant in order to measure the d value by a small-angle X-ray scattering method. Therefore, the d value is preferably measured by using ink with its coloring material concentration kept constant. In the present invention, ink was diluted with purified water so as for the coloring material content (mass %) to be 0.5 mass % with respect to the total mass of the ink, and the scattering angle profile of the diluted ink was measured. The fact that the coloring material content in the ink is 0.5 mass % can be examined on the basis of the fact that the absorbance of the ink diluted 150 times with purified water is in the range of 1.15 to 1.30. The conditions under which the absorbance is measured are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Spectrophotometer: Self-recording spectrophotometer (trade name: U-3300; manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd.)</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Measurement cell: 1 cm quartz cell</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Sampling interval: 0.1 nm</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Scanning rate: 30 nm/min</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Number of measurements: Measurement is performed five times to take the average value of the five measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The aggregation properties of the coloring material described above has a correlation also with the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) in an absorption spectrum. Ink having higher molecular aggregation properties (a higher d<sub>75 </sub>value) tends to have smaller λmax. Therefore, a coloring material can be evaluated for its aggregation properties by means of λmax having a correlation with the d<sub>75 </sub>value. In this case, when the λmax in the ink diluted 2,000 times with pure water is 612.0 nm or less and the coloring material content exceeds 3.0 mass % based on the total mass of the ink, the bronze phenomenon may occur, and when the λmax is less than 608.0 nm and the coloring material content exceeds 0.5 mass %, the bronze phenomenon may occur. Here, the conditions for measuring the maximum absorption wavelength are the same as the aforementioned conditions for measuring the absorbance.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In both of the above cases, it has been found that when the amine compound represented by the general formula (II) is included in the ink, the bronze phenomenon is prevented from occurring and high environmental gas resistance is developed.</p>

When a coloring material has values shown in Table 4, the coloring material can be judged to be usable in the present invention. In the coloring material used in the present invention, the peak ratio of the mass spectrum obtained from a peak of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) varies depending on a mixing ratio of isomers different from each other in the number, kinds, and substitution positions of substituents in the coloring material, but the peak of the M/Z described in Table 4 below is characterized in that it is always detected.

<p id="p-0091" num="0093">The amine compound represented by the following general formula (II) is indispensably contained in the ink of the present invention.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>NR<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>R<sub>3</sub>  General formula (II)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
(In the general formula (II), R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>3 </sub>each independently represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, a lower hydroxyalkyl group, a cyclohexyl group, a mono- or di-alkylaminoalkyl group, a lower cyanoalkyl group, or a phenyl group which may be substituted, provided that all of R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>3 </sub>are not simultaneously a hydrogen atom).
</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0094">Where the amine compound of the above general formula (II) is included in the ink, in particular, the effect of preventing the bronze phenomenon from occurring is remarkably exhibited. The reason therefor is considered to be that when a water-soluble organic solvent evaporates on a recording medium on which the ink is applied, the following phenomenon occurs. In the case where the amine compound of the general formula (II) is in existence, an unshared electron pair of a nitrogen atom in the amine compound interacts with a primary aggregate of a phthalocyanine-based coloring material. Since the amine compound existing around the aggregate causes steric hindrance, it is difficult to bring about secondary aggregation.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0095">It is considered that since a nitrogen atom having an unshared electron pair can easily approach a primary aggregate, the interaction between an amine compound and a primary aggregate most effectively occurs when using a primary amine as the amine compound, and the effectiveness is followed by a secondary amine and a tertiary amine in this order. In addition, in the case where an amine compound interacts with a primary aggregate, if the organic group of the amine compound is bulky, it is difficult for primary aggregates to approach to each other, and hence secondary aggregation is considered to be difficult to bring about. Furthermore, when the amine compound is high in boiling temperature, preferably solid at normal temperature, the organic compound easily stays close to the aggregate without evaporating on a recording medium, and it is difficult for secondary aggregation to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0096">As a result of exhaustive researches conducted by the present inventors based on the above findings, it has been found that when using the compound of the general formula (I) or the salt thereof which is a phthalocyanine-based coloring material having high aggregation properties, and the amine compound of the general formula (II) in combination, the secondary aggregation of the coloring material on a recording medium can be surely prevented, and high resistance to environmental gas is developed.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0097">Particularly among the amine compounds, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane is a primary amine, has a bulky tris-hydroxymathyl group in its molecular structure, and is solid at normal temperature. Therefore, from the afore-mentioned viewpoint, the bronze phenomenon resulting from the compound of the general formula (II) or the salt thereof can be effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0098">The content of the amine compound represented by the general formula (II) is preferably 0.1 mass % or more and 10.0 mass % or less based on the total mass of the ink. If the amine compound content is less than 0.1 mass %, the effect of preventing the bronze phenomenon may be insufficient in some cases, and on the other hand, if the amine compound content is more than 10 mass % the ejection properties of the ink may be lowered depending on ink jet recording apparatuses. In addition, the content of the amine compound represented by the general formula (II) is preferably 5.0 mass % or more with respect to the content of the coloring material which is the compound represented by the general formula (I) or the salt thereof. The reason therefore is that if the rate of the amine compound content is less than 5.0 mass %, the effect of preventing the bronze phenomenon from occurring may not be sufficiently exhibited. Furthermore, the content of the compound represented by the general formula (II) is preferably 1,000 mass % or less with respect to the content of the coloring material which is the compound represented by the general formula (I) or the salt thereof. The reason therefore is that if the rate of the amine compound content is more than 1,000 mass %, the ejection properties of the ink may be lowered depending on ink jet recording apparatuses. When the amine compound represented by the general formula (II) is excessively included, the bronze phenomenon can be prevented from occurring, but the viscosity of the ink may come to be too high, thus affecting the ejection properties of the ink in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0099">(Aqueous Medium)</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0100">An aqueous medium as well as the amine compound of the general formula (II) is added to the ink composition of the present invention to exhibit an effect, and inasmuch as not impairing the effect of the present invention and not deviating form the objects of the present invention, water or an aqueous medium which is a mixed solvent of water and any one of various water-soluble organic solvents may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0101">There is no particular limitation concerning the water-soluble organic solvent as long as they are water-soluble, and preferable examples thereof include: an alkyl alcohol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, 2-butanol, or 3-butanol; a carboxylic acid amide such as N,N-dimethylformamide or N,N-dimethylacetamide; a ketone or a keto alcohol such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, or 2-methyl-2-hydroxypentan-4-one; a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane; a polyhydric alcohol such as glycerin, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, 1,2 or 1,3-propylene glycol, 1,2 or 1,4-butylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,2-hexanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, dithioglycol, 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, an acetylene glycol derivative, or trimethylolpropane; an alkyl ether of a polyhydric alcohol such as ethylene glycol monomethyl (or ethyl) ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl (or ethyl) ether, or triethylene glycol monoethyl (or butyl) ether; a heterocyclic compound such as 2-pyrrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, or N-methylmorpholine; a sulfur-containing compound such as dimethyl sulfoxide; and urea and a urea derivative. Each of those water-soluble organic solvents may be used alone, or two or more of them may be used as a mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0102">The content of such a water-soluble organic solvent is preferably 5.0 mass % to 90.0 mass %, or more preferably 10.0 mass % to 50.0 mass % with respect to the total mass of ink. The reason therefore is as follows. If the content is smaller than the range, reliability for ejection properties, etc. may lower when the water-soluble organic solvent is used for ink jet ink, on the other hand, if the content is larger than the range, insufficient ink supply due to an increase in viscosity of ink may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0103">Deionized water (ion-exchange water) is preferably used as water. The water content is preferably 10.0 mass % to 90.0 mass % with respect to the total mass of ink.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0104">In the present invention, among the above-described water-soluble organic solvents, 2-pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol (molecular weight: 200 or more), and alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols such as triethylene glycol monoethyl ether are preferable because they exhibit the effect of suppressing the bronze phenomenon when they are used in combination with the compound represented by the formula (II) or the salt thereof. In particular, 2-pyrrolidone is preferable because it is particularly effective in suppressing the occurrence of the bronze phenomenon when it is used in combination with the compound represented by the general formula (I) or the salt thereof. The content (mass %) of 2-pyrrolidone in ink is preferably 50.0% or more with respect to the coloring material content (mass %) in order to obtain the effect by incorporating 2-pyrrolidone into the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0105">The mechanism for suppressing the occurrence of the bronze phenomenon by those specific water-soluble organic solvents is unclear, but is estimated to be as follows. The d<sub>75 </sub>value of ink obtained by a small-angle X-ray scattering method does not,change depending on the presence or absence of those specific water-soluble organic solvents in the ink. In view of this, those specific water-soluble organic solvents do not change the aggregation properties of a coloring material in the ink, and are capable of suppressing the aggregation of molecular aggregates of the coloring material on the recording medium. The content (mass %) of those specific water-soluble organic solvents in ink is preferably 50.0% or more with respect to the coloring material content (mass %) in order for the effect to be exhibited by incorporating those specific water-soluble organic solvents into the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0106">(Other Additive)</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0107">In addition, in the present invention, various additives such as a surfactant, a pH adjustor, a rust inhibitor, an antiseptic, a mildew proofing agent, a chelating agent, a UV absorber, a viscosity modifier, a defoaming agent, and a water-soluble polymer may be incorporated as required.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0108">When the ph of ink is low, the solubility of the compound of the formula (I) in the ink is reduced and the aggregation is apt to occur. Accordingly, if the pH of ink is high, the aggregation is suppressed, and it comes to be difficult for the bronze phenomenon to occur. Therefore, the pH of ink is preferably in the range of from 6.0 to 11.0. Additionally, in order to particularly effectively suppress the bronze phenomenon, it is preferred that the pH of ink is 9.0 or more.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0109">Any substance can be used as a pH adjustor as long as the substance is capable of adjusting the pH of ink to fall within the range of 6.0 to 11.0. Examples of such substance include: alcoholamine compounds such as diethanolamine, triethanolamine, and isopropanolamine; hydroxides of alkali metals such as lithium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide; ammonium hydroxide; and carbonates of alkali metals such as lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, and potassium carbonate. Of those, alcoholamine compounds such as diethanolamine, triethanolamine, and isopropanolamine, and carbonates of alkali metals such as lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, and potassium carbonate are preferable because each of them has the effect of suppressing the occurrence of the bronze phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0110">Specific examples of the surfactant include an anionic surfactant, an ampholytic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, and a nonionic surfactant.</p>

<p id="p-0119" num="0121">&lt;Recording Medium&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0122">Any recording medium can be used for forming images by means of the ink of the present invention as long as recording is performed by applying the ink to the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0123">The present invention is applicable to a recording medium in which a coloring material such as a pigment or a dye is adsorbed to fine particles forming a porous structure in an ink-receiving layer and an image is formed from at least the fine particles with the coloring material adsorbed thereto, and is particularly suitable for the case where an ink jet method is used. Such an ink jet recording medium is preferably of a so-called absorption type in which ink is absorbed by a gap formed in an ink-receiving layer on a support.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0124">An absorption type ink-receiving layer is constituted as a porous layer mainly composed of fine particles and containing a binder and any other additive as required. Specific examples of the fine particles include: inorganic pigments such as silica, clay, talc, calcium carbonate, kaolin, aluminum oxide (for example, alumina or alumina hydrate), diatomaceous earth, titanium oxide, hydrotalcite, and zinc oxide; and organic pigments such as a urea formalin resin, an ethylene resin, and a styrene resin. One or more kinds of them may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0125">Examples of a binder that is suitably used include a water-soluble polymer and latex. For example, the following may be cited: polyvinyl alcohol or a modified product thereof; starch or a modified product thereof; gelatin or a modified product thereof; gum arabic; cellulose derivatives such as carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, and hydroxyproylmethylcellulose; vinyl-based copolymer latexes such as an SBR latex, an NBR latex, a methyl methacrylate-butadiene copolymer latex, a functional group-denatured polymer latex, and an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer; polyvinyl pyrrolidone; maleic anhydride or a copolymer thereof; and an acrylate copolymer. Two or more kinds of them may be used in combination as required. In addition, an additive may be used, and examples of an additive to be used as required include a dispersant, a thickener, a pH adjustor, a lubricant, a fluidity denaturing agent, a surfactant, a defoaming agent, a releasing agent, a fluorescent bleach, a UV absorber, and an antioxidant.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0126">In particular, a recording medium having an ink-receiving layer formed thereon which is mainly composed of fine particles having an average particle size of 1 μm or less is preferably used in the present invention. Specific examples of the fine particles include silica fine particles and aluminum oxide fine particles. Preferable silica fine particles are silica fine particles typified by colloidal silica. Colloidal silica, which itself is available in the market, is particularly preferably what is described in JP 2803134 B or JP 2881847 B. Preferable aluminum oxide fine particles are alumina hydrate fine particles and the like. An alumina hydrate represented by the following general formula may be exemplified as one example of such alumina hydrate fine particles.

(In the formula, n represents an integer of 1, 2, or 3, and m represents a value of 0 to 10, or preferably 0 to 5; provided, however, that m and n are not simultaneously 0. m may be or may not be an integer because mH<sub>2</sub>O also represents an aqueous phase that can desorb and is not involved in the formation of an mH<sub>2</sub>O crystal lattice in many cases. In addition, when heating such kind of material, m may reach 0.)
</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0127">An alumina hydrate can be produced by a conventionally known method such as: the hydrolysis of aluminum alkoxide or sodium aluminate described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,242,271 or 4,202,870; or a method involving adding an aqueous solution of sodium sulfate, aluminum chloride, or the like to an aqueous solution of sodium aluminate or the like to perform neutralization described in JP 57-44605 B.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0128">The recording medium preferably has a support for supporting the above-described ink-receiving layer. Any support may be use without any particular limitation as long as its ink-receiving layer can be formed of the above-described porous fine particles and it provides rigidity which enables it to be conveyed by a conveying mechanism of an ink jet printer or the like. Specific examples thereof include: a paper support formed of a pulp raw material mainly composed of natural cellulose fibers; a plastic support composed of a material such as polyester (for example, polyethylene terephthalate), cellulose triacetate, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, or polyimide; resin-coated paper (for example, RC paper) having, on at least one side of base paper, a polyolefin resin coating layer in which a white pigment or the like is added.</p>

<p id="p-0137" num="0139">When sheets are fed in the recording apparatus, only the predetermined number of recording media are sent to a nip portion composed of a sheet feeding roller M<b>2080</b> and a separating roller M<b>2041</b> in the sheet feeding portion including a sheet feeding tray M<b>2060</b>. The sent recording media are separated at the nip portion, and only the uppermost recording medium is conveyed. The recording medium sent to the sheet conveying portion is guided by a pinch roller holder M<b>3000</b> and a paper guide flapper M<b>3030</b> to be sent to a roller pair composed of a conveying roller M<b>3060</b> and a pinch roller M<b>3070</b>. The roller pair composed of the conveying roller M<b>3060</b> and the pinch roller M<b>3070</b> are driven and rotated by an LF motor E<b>0002</b>, whereby the recording medium is conveyed through a platen M<b>3040</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0140">In the carriage portion, when an image is formed on a recording medium, a recording head H<b>1001</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is arranged at a target image forming position, and ink is ejected to the recording medium in accordance with a signal from an electrical substrate E<b>0014</b>. Details about the constitution of the recording head H<b>1001</b> will be described later. While recording is performed by the recording head H<b>1001</b>, recording main scanning in which a carriage M<b>4000</b> scans in the column direction and sub scanning in which a recording medium is conveyed in the row direction by the conveying roller M<b>3060</b> are alternately repeated, whereby an image is formed on the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0141">Finally, the recording medium on which an image has been formed is pinched at a nip between a first sheet discharge roller M<b>3110</b> and a spur M<b>3120</b> in the sheet discharge portion, conveyed, and discharged to a sheet discharge tray M<b>3160</b>.</p>

The ink remaining in the cap M<b>5010</b> is sucked with the cap M<b>5010</b> opened, whereby neither adhesion of the remaining ink nor a subsequent harmful effect occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0143">(Constitution of Recording Head)</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0144">The constitution of a head cartridge H<b>1000</b> will be described below. The head cartridge H<b>1000</b> includes the recording head H<b>1001</b>, means for mounting ink tanks H<b>1900</b>, and means for supplying ink from the ink tanks H<b>1900</b> to the recording head, and is detachably mounted on the carriage M<b>4000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows how the ink tanks H<b>1900</b> are mounted on the head cartridge H<b>1000</b>. The recording apparatus forms images by means of yellow, magenta, cyan, black, pale magenta, pale cyan, and green inks, and so the ink tanks H<b>1900</b> are independently prepared for seven colors. The ink according to the present invention is used for at least one of the above inks. In addition, as shown in the figure, each ink tank is detachable to the head cartridge H<b>1000</b>. The ink tanks H<b>1900</b> can be detached in such a state that the head cartridge H<b>1000</b> is mounted on the carriage M<b>4000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an exploded perspective view of the head cartridge H<b>1000</b>. In the figure, the head cartridge H<b>1000</b> includes a first recording element substrate H<b>1100</b>, a second recording element substrate H<b>1101</b>, a first plate H<b>1200</b>, a second plate H<b>1400</b>, an electric wiring substrate H<b>1300</b>, a tank holder H<b>1500</b>, a flow path forming member H<b>1600</b>, a filter H<b>1700</b>, and a seal rubber H<b>1800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0147">Each of the first recording element substrate H<b>1100</b> and the second recording element substrate H<b>1101</b> is a Si substrate having multiple recording elements (nozzles) for ejecting ink formed on one side by means of photolithography. Electric wiring made of Al or the like for supplying power to each recording element is formed by means of a film formation technique, and multiple ink flow paths corresponding to the individual recording elements are also formed by means of photolithography. Furthermore, ink supply ports for supplying ink to the multiple ink flow paths are formed so as to open on the rear surface.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an enlarged front view for explaining the constitution of each of the first recording element substrate H<b>1100</b> and the second recording element substrate H<b>1101</b>. Reference symbols H<b>2000</b> to H<b>2600</b> denote recording element trains (hereinafter referred to also as nozzle trains) corresponding to different ink colors. The first recording element substrate H<b>1100</b> has nozzle trains for three colors: the nozzle train H<b>2000</b> to which yellow ink is supplied, the nozzle train H<b>2100</b> to which magenta ink is supplied, and the nozzle train H<b>2200</b> to which cyan ink is supplied. The second recording element substrate H<b>1101</b> has nozzle trains for four colors: the nozzle train H<b>2300</b> to which pale cyan ink is supplied, the nozzle train H<b>2400</b> to which black ink is supplied, the nozzle train H<b>2500</b> to which orange ink is supplied, and the nozzle train H<b>2600</b> to which pale magenta ink is supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0149">Each nozzle train is constituted by 768 nozzles arranged at intervals of 1,200 dpi (dot/inch; reference value) in the conveying direction of a recording medium, and each nozzle ejects about 2 pl of ink. An opening area in each nozzle ejection port is set to be about 100 μm<sup>2</sup>. The first recording element substrate H<b>1100</b> and the second recording element substrate H<b>1101</b> are bonded and fixed to the first plate H<b>1200</b> having ink supply ports H<b>1201</b> formed thereon for supplying ink to the first recording element substrate H<b>1100</b> and the second recording element substrate H<b>1101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0150">The second plate H<b>1400</b> having openings is also bonded and fixed to the first plate H<b>1200</b>. The second plate H<b>1400</b> holds the electric wiring substrate H<b>1300</b> in such a manner that the electric wiring substrate H<b>1300</b>, the first recording element substrate H<b>1100</b>, and the second recording element substrate H<b>1101</b> are electrically connected.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0151">The electric wiring substrate H<b>1300</b> impresses electrical signals for causing each of the nozzles formed on the first recording element substrate H<b>1100</b> and the second recording element substrate H<b>1101</b> to eject ink. The electric wiring substrate H<b>1300</b> has: electric wiring corresponding to each of the first recording element substrate H<b>1100</b> and the,second recording element substrate H<b>1101</b>; and an external signal input terminal H<b>1301</b> which is positioned at the end portion of the electric wiring to receive electrical signals from the recording apparatus main body. The external signal input terminal H<b>1301</b> is positioned and fixed to the back surface side of the tank holder H<b>1500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0152">The flow path forming member H<b>1600</b> is fixed by means of, for example, ultrasonic welding to the tank holder H<b>1500</b> for holding the ink tanks H<b>1900</b>. Thus, an ink flow path H<b>1501</b> passing from the ink tanks H<b>1900</b> to the first plate H<b>1200</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0153">The filter H<b>1700</b> is arranged at the end portion on the ink tank side of the ink flow path H<b>1501</b> engaged with the ink tanks H<b>1900</b>, and so the filter H<b>1700</b> prevents dust from entering from the outside. The seal rubber H<b>1800</b> is mounted on the portion at which the ink flow path H<b>1501</b> is engaged with the ink tanks H<b>1900</b> to prevent ink from evaporating from the portion.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0154">Furthermore, as described above, the head cartridge H<b>1000</b> is made up by connecting a tank holder portion constituted of the tank holder H<b>1500</b>, the flow path forming member H<b>1600</b>, the filter H<b>1700</b> and the seal rubber H<b>1800</b>, with the recording head portion H<b>1001</b> constituted of the first recording element substrate H<b>1100</b>, the second recording element substrate H<b>1101</b>, the first plate H<b>1200</b>, the electric wiring substrate H<b>1300</b> and the second plate H<b>1400</b> by the use of an adhesive or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0155">Description has been made here by taking, as an example of an embodiment of a recording head, a recording head according to a bubble jet (registered trademark) method that performs recording by means of an electrothermal converter (recording element) for generating thermal energy for causing ink to generate film boiling in accordance with an electrical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0156">As for the representative structure and principle, it is preferred to use basic principles disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,723,129 and 4,740,796. The method is applicable to any one of a so-called on-demand type and a so-called continuous type. In particular, the method is effective for the on-demand type because of the following reason. At least one driving signal which corresponds to recording information and causes a sudden increase in temperature exceeding nuclear boiling is applied to electrothermal converters arranged corresponding to a sheet or liquid flow path holding a liquid (ink), thereby causing the electrothermal converter to generate thermal energy. Then, film boiling is generated on the thermal action surface of a recording head. As a result, an air bubble in the liquid (ink) can be formed so as to be in one-to-one correspondence with the driving signal. The growth and contraction of the air bubble eject the liquid (ink) through an opening for ejection, thereby forming at least one droplet. It is more preferable that the driving signal is of a pulse shape because the growth and contraction of an air bubble can be performed immediately and appropriately, and hence the liquid (ink) can be ejected with excellent responsiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0157">As an example of a second embodiment of an ink jet recording apparatus utilizing mechanical energy, an on-demand ink jet recording head may be cited, including: a nozzle forming substrate having multiple nozzles; pressure generating means arranged so as to be opposite to the nozzles and composed of a piezoelectric material and a conductive material.; and ink filling the surroundings of the pressure generating means, in which the pressure generating means is displaced by an applied voltage to eject a small ink droplet from a nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0158">The ink jet recording apparatus is not limited to such apparatuses as described above in which a head and an ink tank are separated, and may be one in which a head and an ink tank are unified so that they are unseparable. The ink tank may be separably or unseparably unified with the head to be mounted on a carriage, or may be mounted at a fixing portion of an apparatus to supply ink to a recording head through an ink supply member such as a tube. When the ink tank is provided with a constitution for applying a suitable negative pressure to the recording head, an absorber may be arranged in an ink storage portion of the ink tank, or the ink tank may have a flexible ink storage bag and a spring portion for applying bias in the direction of expanding the internal volume of the bag. The recording apparatus may adopt a serial recording method as described above, or may be in the form of a line printer obtained by aligning recording elements over the range corresponding to the entire width of a recording medium.</p>

<p id="p-0186" num="0188">After each of the inks 1 to 17 had been diluted 2,000 times with purified water, the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) was measured. Table 8 shows the results. The maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) was measured under the following conditions.</p>

<p id="p-0192" num="0194">(4) Creation of Recorded Product</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0195">Each of the inks 1 to 17 thus prepared was mounted on an ink jet recording apparatus (trade name: Pixus 950i; manufactured by CANON Inc.) to print a 13-level gradation pattern on an ink jet glossy medium (trade name: PR101; manufactured by CANON Inc.) by changing a printing duty to 5, 12, 21, 29, 35, 43, 51, 58, 66, 74, 85, 90, and 100%. Thus, a recorded product was created.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0196">(5) Evaluation of Bronze Resistance</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0197">The printing duty at which the bronze phenomenon occurred in the 13-level gradation pattern of the recorded product thus created was visually observed to define the printing duty as the printing duty at which the bronze phenomenon occurred. In general, the bronze phenomenon is apt to occur with increasing the printing duty. In other words, the bronze phenomenon is more likely to occur where the ink has a lower printing duty at which the bronze phenomenon occurs, while the bronze phenomenon is less likely to occur where the ink has a higher printing duty at which the bronze phenomenon occurs. The criteria for the bronze resistance are as follows.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Table 8 shows the results of the evaluation.</p>
