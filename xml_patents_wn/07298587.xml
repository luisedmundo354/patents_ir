<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Provisional Application No. 60/401,163 filed Aug. 5, 2002, for “Rounded Top Pole” by Taras G. Pokhil, Ned Tabat, Martin L. Plumer, Steven P. Bozeman, and Nurul Amin.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of magnetic data storage and retrieval systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a magnetic recording head with a writer portion having a rounded top pole.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an electronic data storage and retrieval system, a transducing head typically includes a writer for storing magnetically-encoded information on a magnetic disc and a reader for retrieving that magnetically-encoded information from the magnetic disc. The reader typically consists of two shields and a magnetoresistive (MR) sensor positioned between the shields. Magnetic flux from the surface of the disc causes rotation of the magnetization vector of a sensing layer of the MR sensor, which in turn causes a change in electrical resistivity of the MR sensor. This change in resistivity of the MR sensor can be detected by passing a current through the MR sensor and measuring a voltage across the MR sensor. External circuitry then converts the voltage information into an appropriate format and manipulates that information as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The writer portion typically consists of a top and a bottom pole, which are separated from each other at an air bearing surface of the writer by a gap layer, and which are connected to each other at a region distal from the air bearing surface by a back gap closer or back via. Positioned between the top and bottom poles are one or more layers of conductive coils encapsulated by insulating layers. The writer portion and the reader portion are often arranged in a merged configuration in which a shared pole serves as both the top shield in the reader portion and the bottom pole in the writer portion.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To write data to the magnetic media, an electrical current is caused to flow through the conductive coils to thereby induce a magnetic field across the write gap between the top and bottom poles. By reversing the polarity of the current through the coils, the polarity of the data written to the magnetic media is also reversed. Because the top pole is generally the trailing pole of the top and bottom poles, the top pole is used to physically write the data to the magnetic media. Accordingly, it is the top pole that defines the track width of the written data. More specifically, the track width is defined by the width of the top pole near the write gap at the air bearing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In magnetic recording, it is desirable to improve the areal density at which information can be recorded and reliably read. This desire has led to a trend toward shorter bit length along a magnetic recording track and a shrinking track width. Narrow track widths are achieved by use of narrow pole tips at an air bearing surface (ABS) of the head. However, the pole width must be large in the body region of the head where the coil passes between the poles. The larger pole width is necessary to gain adequate magnetic flux through the poles by the coil write current. Hence, it is common to taper the pole from the larger width in the body region to a narrower width in the pole tip region at the ABS.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The top pole in conventional writer designs has a generally triangular shape in the pole tip area. Furthermore, the top pole is typically made of materials that do not have strong intrinsic uniaxial anisotropy. As a result, the shape anisotropy of the top pole is a dominating factor governing domain formation in the top pole. Shape anisotropy of the top pole in the pole tip area results in formation of a domain wall pinned at or near the pole tip. Also, magnetic flux from domains adjacent to the pole tip induces a high remanence in the pole tip. This can result in on-track erasure of data. Plus, magnetization reversal in the pole tip coincides with domain wall motion across the tip. Thus, in conventional top pole designs domain wall motion can be rather slow and irregular and, consequently, magnetization reversal in the pole tip can also be slow.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, a top pole is needed in which faster magnetization reversal occurs and in which domain walls do not form in the pole tip area.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is a magnetic recording head having an air bearing surface for confronting a surface of a rotating disc and comprising a pole tip and a generally rounded and substantially planar body attached to the pole tip. The width of the pole tip defines a track width of data written to the rotating disc. The generally rounded shape of the top pole body is such that top pole magnetization gradually changes its direction and follows the edges of the body. Further, the pole tip has low remanence (to reduce the possibility of on-track erasure), gradual domain spin structure (for increased switching speed and repeatability) and no domain walls formed near the pole tip.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of magnetic read/write head <b>100</b> and magnetic disc <b>102</b> taken along a plane normal to air bearing surface <b>104</b> of read/write head <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a top view of a prior art writer portion <b>130</b> including top pole <b>131</b>. Top pole <b>131</b> includes pole body <b>132</b> and pole tip <b>134</b>. Top pole <b>131</b> is located in the same position as top pole <b>108</b> in magnetic read/write head <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Also shown is <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are conductive coils <b>112</b>, shared pole/top shield <b>114</b>, and bottom shield <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Pole body <b>132</b> has a triangular shape at the end of pole body <b>132</b> near pole tip <b>134</b>. Pole tip <b>134</b> defines the track width of data written to magnetic disc <b>102</b>. Typically, top poles are made of materials with high magnetic moments that do not have strong intrinsic uniaxial anisotropy. Consequently, the shape anisotropy of top pole <b>131</b> is a dominating factor governing formation of domains <b>140</b> in top pole <b>131</b>. A domain is a local region of the material in which all atomic moments are pointing in the same direction. The direction that the magnetization takes within a domain in the absence of an external magnetic field is represented by the easy axes of the particles of the material. This is what is depicted by domains <b>140</b>. Shape anisotropy of top pole <b>131</b> at pole tip <b>134</b> results in formation of domain walls <b>142</b> pinned at or near pole tip <b>134</b>. Domain walls <b>142</b> are very narrow regions in which the magnetization changes from its direction in one domain to its direction in an adjacent domain. Thus, domain walls <b>142</b> form at pole tip <b>134</b> because of the abrupt change in magnetization direction at or near pole tip <b>134</b>. Magnetic flux from domains near pole tip <b>134</b> and domain walls <b>142</b> pinned at pole tip <b>134</b> induces a high remanent magnetic moment in pole tip <b>134</b>. This undesirable flux can result in on-track erasure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to write data to a magnetic disc, magnetization in pole tip <b>134</b> must be reversed as the state of data written to the disc is to be reversed. Magnetization reversal of pole tip <b>134</b> is controlled by domain wall motion across pole tip <b>134</b>. Domain walls <b>142</b> move in response to an applied magnetic field (which results from current applied to conductive coils <b>112</b>). In top pole <b>131</b>, with a triangular shape near pole tip <b>134</b>, domain wall motion can be rather slow and irregular (compared to magnetization rotation) and therefore magnetization reversal is slowed in pole tip <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> are top views of a writer portion including a planar rounded top pole according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a top view of writer portion <b>150</b>, including rounded top pole <b>151</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Rounded top pole <b>151</b> is located in the same position as top pole <b>108</b> in magnetic read/write head <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Top pole <b>151</b> includes pole body <b>152</b> and pole tip <b>154</b>. Pole body <b>152</b> typically has a generally elliptical shape. Writer portion <b>150</b> also preferably includes a yoke (like yoke <b>109</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) which matches the shape of pole body <b>152</b>. Also shown are conductive coils <b>112</b>, shared pole/top shield <b>114</b>, and bottom shield <b>118</b> (to show the relationship of rounded top pole <b>151</b> to the components within magnetic read/write head <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Top pole <b>151</b> is elongated along an axis perpendicular to the air bearing surface, and thus has shape anisotropy perpendicular to the air bearing surface. Top pole <b>151</b> is typically composed of a high magnetic moment material with low coercivity and magnetostriction, such as Ni<sub>45</sub>Fe<sub>55</sub>, CoFe, CoNiFe and FeTaN. In top pole <b>151</b>, magnetization gradually changes its direction when under the influence of an applied magnetic field (which results from current applied to conductive coils <b>112</b>), and domains <b>160</b> follow the edges of pole body <b>152</b>. The direction that the magnetization takes within a domain in the absence of an external magnetic field is represented by the easy axes of the particles of the material. This is what is depicted by domains <b>160</b>. Because domains <b>160</b> follow the edges of pole body <b>152</b>, only two magnetic vortex states are formed (one at the top and one at the bottom of pole body <b>152</b>). Also, because domain walls <b>162</b> form only where magnetization changes direction, no domain walls form at or near pole tip <b>154</b> as in the prior art design shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This type of domain structure is very stable and repeatable. That is, since the spin structures in the pole tip area are gradual and domain walls <b>162</b> do not form near pole tip <b>154</b>, domains <b>160</b> return to their unbiased state quickly when the applied magnetic field is removed. Furthermore, magnetization reversal of domains <b>160</b> in top pole <b>151</b> is characterized by a nearly linear, low coercivity hysteresis loop when the applied magnetic field limits are lower than the saturating field (which must occur for top pole operation). Domains <b>160</b>, which form in rounded top pole designs, also do not support high remanence in pole tip <b>154</b> (since domain walls <b>162</b> do not form at or near pole tip <b>154</b>). This low remanence in pole tip <b>154</b> reduces the probability of on-track erasure.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In operation, data is written to magnetic disc <b>102</b> by inducing domain rotation in top pole <b>151</b>. This is accomplished by causing current to flow through conductive coils <b>112</b>, thereby inducing a magnetic field in top pole <b>151</b>. Domains <b>160</b> rotate to align with this magnetic field (and the center of the domain vortices concurrently shifts to align with the magnetic field), allowing a first state of data to be written to magnetic disc <b>102</b>. The magnetic flux which flows through pole tip <b>154</b> as a result of domain rotation defines the state of data written. Pole tip <b>154</b> defines the track width of data written to magnetic disc <b>102</b>. A second state of data is written to magnetic disc <b>102</b> by reversing the flow of current in conductive coils <b>112</b>. This causes domains <b>160</b> to rotate to point toward the opposite direction, consequently writing an opposite data state to magnetic disc <b>102</b>. The rounded top pole design is advantageous in that magnetization reversal is due to rotation of domains <b>160</b>. This differs from conventional top pole designs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), which require domain wall motion for magnetization reversal. Domain wall motion requires more energy and a stronger magnetic field than does magnetization reversal of domains <b>160</b>. Thus, the rounded top pole design allows for faster switching and is more reproducible than conventional top pole designs, since domains <b>160</b> quickly rotate to align with an applied magnetic field. A yoke, typically comprised of a high resistivity material, is preferably provided between top pole <b>151</b> and conductive coils <b>112</b> to increase the amount of flux which flows through pole tip <b>154</b>. Furthermore, a rounded top pole design allows for better magnetic flux closure within the top pole than conventional top pole designs. As a result, less flux leaks from the top pole into shared pole <b>114</b>. Consequently, the probability of formation of unwanted spin structures in shared pole <b>114</b> is reduced.</p>

For example, varying the size of conductive coils <b>112</b> may necessitate altering the size of the top pole. Furthermore, the rounded top pole design is not limited to the three embodiments provided heretofore. That is, the top pole may have any shape or size with rounded edges.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention is a magnetic read/write head having a top pole with a rounded (typically generally elliptical) pole body and a pole tip. In rounded top poles, magnetization gradually changes its direction when under the influence of an applied magnetic field, and magnetic domains in the top pole follow the edges of the pole body. Because the domains follow the edges of the pole body, few magnetic vortex states form in the pole body. Also, because domain walls form only where magnetization changes direction, no domain walls form at or near pole tip.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">This type of domain structure is very stable and repeatable. That is, since the spin structures in the pole tip area are gradual and domain walls do not form near the pole tip, the domains return to their unbiased state quickly when the applied magnetic field is removed. Furthermore, magnetization reversal of the domains in the rounded top pole is characterized by a nearly linear, low coercivity hysteresis loop when the applied magnetic field limits are lower than the saturating field (which is always the case in top pole operation). The domain walls which form in rounded top pole designs also do not support high remanence in pole tip (since the domain walls do not form at or near pole tip). This low remanence in the pole tip reduces the probability of on-track erasure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the shape of the top pole is not limited to the three embodiments disclosed, and may be fabricated into any shape having rounded edges. Also, the shape and size of the top pole are variable depending on the particular requirements for the writer portion. For example, the dimensions of the top pole are variable as varying coil sizes become necessary. Finally, the rounded top pole design is applicable to longitudinal recording systems as well as perpendicular recording systems.</p>
