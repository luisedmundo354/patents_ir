<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system uses a resource locking token to allow various processes to have exclusive access to a system resource. The process that receives the token then requests that a local database be updated/synchronized with a master database. The process continues checking the synchronization status every time it gets the token. When the process receives the token and the synchronization is complete, the local database is accessed and the data is used in accessing the system resource.

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to the sharing of system resources.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">System resources, such as printers, processors, modems, memory, and even other applications, may be shared amongst various system applications/processes. For example, a communication process may share a modem resource with an email process.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, typically only one system process can access the resource at any one time. If a lower priority process is using a system resource, other higher priority processes are locked out until the lower priority process has relinquished control.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Systems that employ databases can have one master copy of the information contained in the database and multiple “local” copies. The local copies may be exact copies of the master database information or the local copies may be a subset of the information that is stored in the master database.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order for the local databases to have the most up-to-date information from the master database, the local databases must be periodically synchronized with the master database. For example, if the master database is updated with new information, the local databases typically will not have this-new information until the databases are synchronized.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One problem with synchronizing databases in a system is that a lower priority process may have a system resource locked while waiting for a local database to synchronize. While the lower priority process has the system resource locked, higher priority processes cannot use the resource. There is a resulting need in the art for a prioritized system that enables system processes having different priority levels to share a system resource.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The embodiments of the present invention encompass resource sharing and database synchronization. The method first receives exclusive access to the resource. Synchronization of a local database with a master database is then requested. The method then checks the synchronization status until synchronization is complete. Data from the local database is then read and the shared resource is accessed with the data. The exclusive access to the resource is then returned to the controlling system for distribution to other processes.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The embodiments of the resource sharing with database synchronization of the present invention provide prioritized access to a shared system resource. Additionally, a low priority process does not lock out other higher priority processes from the resource while waiting for a local database to be synchronized.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Subsequent discussions of the various databases of the embodiments of the present invention refer to synchronization of the databases. Synchronization and updating of the databases are considered to be substantially similar tasks and the terms can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of a distributed database system of the present invention. The master database (<b>101</b>) stores information/data for later retrieval. In one embodiment, the master database (<b>101</b>) stores statistics regarding a quality of service provided over a communication line (e.g., a digital subscriber line (DSL)).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Each statistic in the database may be referred to as an object or element. For example, in one embodiment, if the data stored in the database includes statistics on the quality of service of a communication link, one object stored in the database is a bit error rate for each link that is coupled to the master database. Other types of objects/elements include link downtime, link bit rate, and subscriber information.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In alternate embodiments, the database is used for storing information that is not related to communication link quality of service. In such embodiments, the objects/elements are not communication link related. The types of objects/elements stored in the database do not limit the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The master database (<b>101</b>) is coupled to multiple local databases (<b>105</b>-<b>106</b>). The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates these databases as local database <b>1</b> (<b>105</b>) through local database N (<b>106</b>). The databases may be of any size.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The local databases (<b>105</b>-<b>106</b>), in one embodiment, have the capacity to hold a substantially equivalent copy of the data that is stored in the master database (<b>101</b>). In another embodiment, the memory capacity of the local databases (<b>105</b>-<b>106</b>) is such that only a smaller subset of the data stored in the master database (<b>101</b>) will fit in the local databases.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The databases (<b>101</b>, <b>105</b>, and <b>106</b>) of the present invention are stored in some form of memory. In one embodiment, the database memory is of the type used for temporary storage of data such as random access memory (RAM). The database memory may also be of the type used for permanent storage of data such as read only memory (ROM), programmable read only memory (PROM), and/or memory cards.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Other types of database memory may include semiconductor, magnetic, optical, or storage media. The storage media memory can include hard disk drives, floppy disk drives, optical drives, removable solid-state memory cards, or any other type of storage media. The storage media may be fixed or removable from a database system.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The master database (<b>101</b>) and the local databases (<b>105</b>-<b>106</b>) are coupled through a background synchronization block (<b>110</b>). As described subsequently, the background synchronization block (<b>110</b>) provides a method by which the local databases (<b>105</b>-<b>106</b>) are updated with data from the master database (<b>101</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment of the present invention, the objects stored on the local databases each have a flag that indicates a synchronized or not synchronized status of the object. In one embodiment, the flag indicates either “pending” or “ready”.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The “pending” flag indicates that the object has not been synchronized with the master database and, therefore, may not be accurate and up-to-date. The “ready” flag indicates that the object has already been successfully synchronized with the master database.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the “pending” and “ready” flag takes the form of a single bit of data. For example, if the flag is a logic 0, the flag is set for “pending”. If the flag is a logic 1, the flag is set for “ready”. Other embodiments may use other flags to indicate the “pending” and “ready” states.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The “pending” and “ready” states are for illustration purposes only. Alternate embodiments may use other states that perform substantially the same function as the states of the present invention. For example, in one embodiment, a “pending” flag is set by a bit set to a logical 1. If that bit is not present, then the object has been synchronized and is considered “ready” for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a flow diagram of one embodiment of a resource sharing system of the present invention. In this embodiment, the system has a high priority process (<b>201</b>), a medium priority process (<b>203</b>), and a low priority process (<b>205</b>). Additionally, a resource locking token (<b>200</b>) is passed by the operating system among the various processes of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The various processes (<b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, and <b>205</b>) of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be any application being executed by a system controller and/or a local controller. In an embodiment where a data port is the shared resource, a high priority process may be a communication sub-routine that scans for input data from a modem. A medium priority process may be an application that outputs data through the data port. A low priority process may be an application that scans the data port for communication line statistics and outputs to the data port statistics from a local database.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The above-described processes are for illustration purposes only. There may be any number of processes that can take the form of any process/application that is executable by a controller. Additionally, while the low priority process is illustrated as accessing a local database, alternate embodiments have other priority processes accessing the local database.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The resource locking token (<b>200</b>) may take the form of a binary semaphore or some other type of token. In one embodiment, the token (<b>200</b>) is controlled by the operating system. The operating system determines the priority of each process (<b>201</b>, <b>203</b>, and <b>205</b>) and passes the token to a particular process based on that priority. The higher priority processes receive the token before the lower priority processes.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Once a particular process has the token, other processes are locked out from accessing the resource. When the process is finished with the resource, the token is passed back to the operating system in order to be passed to another process.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The token passing may be accomplished in various ways. In one embodiment, the operating system assigns a portion (e.g., a bit) of a memory cache to each process for one particular resource. When the bit for a particular process is set, that process now has access to the resource to the exclusion of the other processes. Once that bit has been reset and the bit for another process has been set, the token has been passed to that process and it now has exclusive use of the resource.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">This token passing process is for illustration purposes only. Alternate embodiments accomplish the token passing in other ways.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a state diagram of one embodiment of a resource sharing and database synchronization method of the present invention. The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is initiated only when the initiating process has the token.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the subsequently discussed embodiment, the resource sharing and database synchronization method is initiated from the low priority process (<b>205</b>) of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Alternate embodiments initiate the resource sharing and database synchronization method from other priority processes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The token sharing method is initiated by the low priority process at state A (<b>301</b>) where a request to synchronize a local database with a master database is requested (<b>303</b>). One embodiment of a background synchronization method of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and discussed subsequently.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The method then goes to state B (<b>307</b>) where it is determined if the background synchronization of the local database has been completed (<b>309</b>). If the synchronization has not been completed, the process exits and the low priority process returns the token (<b>315</b>) for use by another higher priority process.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If the synchronization process has been completed, the process reads and processes the data from the local database (<b>311</b>). The type of processing performed depends on the function performed by the low priority process that is accessing the local database. In one embodiment, the low priority process is responsible for tracking error statistics of a communication link.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The low priority process then accesses the shared resource that is locked (<b>313</b>) to other processes. If the shared resource is a data port, as discussed above, the low priority process accesses the data port (<b>313</b>) in order to transmit data from the local database through the modem or other device coupled to the data port.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The method then returns to state A (<b>301</b>) where the entire method is repeated. For example, the database synchronization is requested (<b>303</b>), a check for synchronization is done (<b>309</b>), and the token is returned (<b>315</b>) for use by the next process.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a background synchronization method of the present invention. The process that has the token and, therefore, access to the shared resource initiates this method.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, the local databases start off empty and the synchronization method loads the requested objects into the requesting local database memory. In another embodiment, the local databases already have objects in memory that are overwritten by objects requested from the master database.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While the subsequently described method refers to one local database, the same method may apply to each of the 1-N local databases. One local database is used for illustration purposes only.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The status flags of any of the local database objects are set to “pending” (<b>401</b>). A request is made for synchronization of the local database with the master database (<b>405</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, in the request for synchronization (<b>405</b>), the request is to synchronize the entire local database or only a desired group of objects. For example, the group of objects to be synchronized may include only the bit error rate and the down time and not the other objects stored in either the master or local databases.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the objects to be synchronized are downloaded from the master database to the local database. These downloaded objects then replace the older objects in the local database.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another embodiment, the objects to be synchronized are operated on by a process that determines whether the local database objects are more recent or whether the master database objects are more recent. If the local objects are the most recent, these objects overwrite the objects in the master database. If the master database objects are more recent, the objects from the master database overwrite the older objects in the local database. If the objects to be synchronized are not already present in the other database, they are written to that database.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The local database, in one embodiment, requests synchronization using a request command from a card controller that is transmitted over a data bus. Such a configuration is discussed subsequently with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As the objects are transferred to the local database, their associated status flags are changed (<b>407</b>) to “ready” or some equivalent indication. The status flag of the last object in the group of objects to be synchronized is checked (<b>410</b>). If the status flag is “pending” (<b>415</b>), read access to the local database is blocked (<b>416</b>) so that objects that have not been synchronized cannot be read and processed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, this blocking is accomplished by a memory read subroutine not permitting access until the last object has a “ready” flag. Other techniques, that are well known in the art, may be used to block access to the memory until the database is synchronized. The present invention is not limited to any one technique. The method then returns (<b>425</b>) to the database access method that initiated the request for synchronization.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an alternate embodiment, each of the status flags of each synchronized object is checked. If any of the objects to be synchronized still has a “pending” flag set, access to the local database is blocked and the method returns to the initiating method.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With the synchronization method of the present invention, a controller running various processes is not tied up waiting for the synchronization method to be completed only periodic checking is required to determine the status of the synchronization.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">If the status flag of the last object, or all the objects, in the group is checked and found to be set to “ready” (<b>415</b>), the objects in the local database are read and processed as required (<b>420</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a-block diagram of a typical communication system in accordance with the background synchronization method of the present invention. The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is for illustration purposes only and does not limit the synchronization method to this particular type of system.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">This system includes a management card (<b>500</b>) that is responsible for controlling the system of the present invention. In one embodiment, the master database is maintained on the management card (<b>500</b>) or other type of controller card. One embodiment of the management card (<b>500</b>) is described subsequently with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Line cards 1-N (<b>501</b>-<b>503</b>) are coupled to the management card (<b>500</b>) through a multi-drop bus or backplane (<b>504</b>). In the communication system embodiment, line cards 1-N (<b>501</b>-<b>503</b>) are modems that support data services that are provided to customers. The local databases of the present invention are maintained on the line cards. In one embodiment, the resource sharing and database synchronization is performed on each line card (<b>501</b>-<b>503</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Each line card (<b>501</b>-<b>503</b>) is coupled to a communication link (<b>521</b>-<b>523</b> respectively).

In other words, if line card <b>1</b> (<b>501</b>) is a DSL modem, remote terminal <b>1</b> (<b>505</b>) is a DSL modem.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment, a remote user computer (<b>510</b>) is coupled to the remote line cards (<b>505</b>-<b>507</b>). The remote user computer (<b>510</b>) can then communicate over its communication link (<b>521</b>) with the network to which the system is connected.</p>
