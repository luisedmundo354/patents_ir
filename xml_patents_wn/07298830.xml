<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to computer network telephony in general, and more particularly to methods and apparatus for telephone and wireless access to computer network-based audio.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Accessing and listening to computer-network based audio content is currently accomplished by transferring audio content from a computer network, such as the Internet, to an end-user's computer, where the audio content is then played. Until recently, audio content was exclusively stored as a computer file that needed to be completely downloaded to the end-user's computer before it could be played. While the recent development of streaming audio technologies, such as REAL AUDIO®, has provided a measure of concurrency between downloading and playing audio content, a computer with network access is still a required component for retrieving and playing computer-network based audio content.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">The process of accessing audio information is composed of many parts. Typically common to all devices is an audio source and multiple clients. When transferring information from an audio source to multiple clients, a number of technologies are typically implemented to make the process more efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">One such technology is cache management. Cache management enables enhanced efficiency in the use of bandwidth, so that multiple clients listening to the same information should not have to retrieve it every time from the source.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Normally when downloading audio information, a user downloads from the source to the client and plays the audio from the client side. In a cached environment, the user downloads from the source to a proxy, which caches the information, and from the proxy to the client. It is assumed that the connection between the proxy and the client is better than the connection between the source and the client. An example of a cache management system is Squid (http://www.squid-cache.org).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">Another component in servicing audio clients is a streaming server. Streaming is a process by which segments of audio data are transmitted to the client in a way that ensures that the client always has necessary information. A streaming server transmits just the necessary information to the client, for the client to render. At any point in time, the user does not need the complete audio data. For example, when listening to a 3 hour lecture in streaming audio format, the user does not ever need to have the whole 3 hour lecture in memory on the client side. Rather, the user needs only one or two seconds at a time in memory. An example of a streaming audio server is a Real Audio server (www.real.com )</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">A client receiving a REAL AUDIO® transmission may find that for some reason the connection has gone bad in the middle of the transmission. One thing a REAL AUDIO® server may do to deal with this is to ‘drop off’ packets—by dropping a missed segment and skipping to the next segment. This would be preferable if a user were listening to live radio. Alternatively, the server could continue sending data as if nothing has happened. In each case the user would hear quiet followed by the continued transmission. If packets were dropped, some information would not reach the user.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">A third technology used for transferring audio information to the client is multicasting. This technology is employed, for example in an MP3 multicasting server, which multicasts streaming audio. A radio station provides an analog source, which is sent to a radio transmitter and to a transcoder which decodes, mixes and encodes the analog source. A client could be, for example, an Ericsson telephone with an MP3 player attached, as described in: (http://www.ericsson.com/press/mp3player.html),(http://www.ericsson.com/press/telecom99/presskit/mp3.html).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">Another technology useful in transferring information from an audio source to multiple clients is Voice Over IP (VoIP). VoIP employs transcoders. A standard telephone may connect to a VoIP Gateway. The VoIP gateway converts the telephone signal into a digital signal, encodes it and sends it through a VoIP Server to another gateway, which decodes it and sends it to another telephone. Two telephones can thus communicate over the Internet. It is also known to employ a PBX to provide radio or MP3 music on hold. This is described, inter alia in (http://www.onholdplus.com/pages/ohp3000.html).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">The present invention seeks to provide enhanced telephone functionality, through the use of an Interactive Voice Response Unit (IVR). This functionality may include, for example, an ability to receive a live Internet audio stream via a conventional telephone, navigation and bookmarking of an audio stream, and forwarding audio content, such as an office voicemail, from a PBX connected telephone to a user not directly connected to the PBX.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">The present invention seeks to provide methods and apparatus for accessing and retrieving computer-network based audio content via a telephone without requiring that the telephone have computing capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">The present invention allows a user to predefine a set of personal preferences related to audio content via a telephone or a computer for playing audio content on a telephone. The set of personal preferences may be stored on an easily accessible database for later access via telephone. Such personal preferences may include Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) indicating the location of specific audio content on the Internet. The user can access a previously defined set of personal preferences by dialing into an IVR. The user may navigate menus presenting predefined audio content options and make selections by using Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) and/or voice input. Once the user has made a selection, the present invention retrieves the audio content from the Internet and renders it suitable for audio output at the user's telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">In a typical scenario, a user may wish to listen to a world news broadcast, such as the BBC World Service at the URL http://www.broadcast.com/bbc/, while traveling. The user accesses a network server of the present invention, establishes a user name and password, and indicates that he would like to receive the BBC World Service broadcast, typically by providing the associated URL or by selecting a predefined URL. Later, the user places a telephone call to an IVR interface of the present invention and enters his user name and password. The user is then presented with a menu of choices, including URLs that the user previously indicated, typically presented by content category. The user then chooses a category that includes the BBC World Service broadcast and then selects the BBC World Service broadcast. Responsive to this selection, the apparatus of the present invention establishes a network connection with http://www.broadcast.com/bbc/, if such a connection has not earlier been established. The network server receives the news broadcast in a streaming audio format, and then renders the streaming audio to provide a telephone output.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">There is thus provided, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a system for transmission of audio content to a telephone, the system including an audio stream navigation functionality operable by using a telephone user interface and enabling a user to select audio data to be heard by the user via a telephone, an interactive voice response unit operative in response to an input from the telephone user interface operating the audio stream navigation functionality, and a transcoder operative in response to an input from the interactive voice response unit for providing audio data, from an audio source remote from the transcoder, to the interactive voice response unit for listening by the user via the telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">Also provided, in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, is a method for transmission of audio content to a telephone, the system including providing a telephone user interface, enabling a user, using the telephone user interface, to select audio data to be heard by the user via a telephone, operating audio stream navigation functionality on a basis of an output from the telephone user interface, and providing audio data, from a remote audio source, for listening by the user via the telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">Further in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the transcoder employs at least one of the following protocols in providing the audio data from the audio source remote from the transcoder to the interactive voice response unit: MP3, REAL AUDIO, WINDOWS MEDIA, RTSP, RTP, HTTP, MGCP, and VoIP.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">Further in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the audio content selected by the user is delimited by a frequency range.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019">Still further in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the audio content selected by the user is delimited by a temporal range.</p>

DNIS is a telephone service that informs the call receiver of the number that the caller dialed. This function is used frequently with free phone lines, where a multiplicity of numbers can lead to the same destination, such as multiple 1-800 numbers. DID is a service typically provided by local phone companies) that provides “a block of telephone numbers for calling into a company's Private Branch Exchange (PBX) system. Using DID, a company can offer its customers individual phone numbers for each person or workstation within the company without requiring a physical line into the PBX for each possible connection.”</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the platform <b>112</b> is shown as having one or more conventional Interactive Voice Response (IVR) interfaces <b>200</b>. Each IVR may communicate with one or more transcoders <b>202</b> via a switch <b>204</b>, such as an IP switch. Each IVR interface <b>200</b> is operative to receive telephone and wireless communication from a telephone, such as the telephone <b>108</b> and/or the wireless communicator <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or to receive voice and/or DTMF commands. In response thereto, the IVR interface <b>200</b> provides audio output.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0134">Each transcoder <b>202</b> is operative to communicate with one or more audio content sources, such as a PSTN audio stream <b>206</b> or an Internet Stream <b>209</b> (IP) using any suitable communication format, and to receive streamed or non-streamed audio content. The transcoder <b>202</b> typically receives relatively high bandwidth audio content, such as content transmitted at <b>44</b> kHz, and converts the audio content to a form suitable for telephone and wireless output at a relatively low bandwidth, such as 8 kHz μ-law.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0135">As input and output bandwidth varies, due to changes in available quality of service or due to other causes, transcoder <b>202</b> may adapt its sampling rates accordingly. The transcoder <b>202</b> may also adaptively select portions of the audio content input for processing into a form suitable for telephone and wireless output. These portions may be, for example, specific segments of the audio content, as described in greater detail herein below, or specific frequencies that may be selected by using standard filtering techniques. A content manager <b>208</b> may also be also provided for managing the interconnections between the IVRs <b>200</b>, the transcoders <b>202</b>, and the audio content sources <b>206</b> and <b>209</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0136">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which is a simplified block diagram of an implementation of the transcoder <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the transcoder <b>202</b> is shown as having a command parser <b>300</b>, which parses commands received by IVR <b>200</b> via one or more request sockets <b>302</b>, each socket <b>302</b> being suitable for conveying an audio stream to the IVR <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) via an IP switch <b>204</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).

<p id="p-0136" num="0138">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> which, taken together, are simplified flowchart illustrations describing a method of operation of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a user employs the client <b>100</b> to establish a communications channel with the server <b>102</b> via the computer network <b>104</b> (step <b>400</b>). The user establishes a unique identification via the server <b>102</b>, or provides a previously established identification to server <b>102</b> (step <b>402</b>). Next, the user communicates the location of audio content on the network <b>104</b> to the server <b>102</b> and/or selects from among predefined audio content whose locations are configured with the server <b>102</b> and presented to the client <b>100</b> for selection (step <b>404</b>). The server <b>102</b> then stores the desired audio content indicated by the user in the database <b>106</b> (step <b>406</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0139">It is appreciated that steps <b>400</b>-<b>406</b> may additionally or alternatively be carried out by the telephone <b>108</b> and/or the wireless communicator <b>110</b> in communication with the audio transcoding communications platform <b>112</b>, as described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0140">Subsequently, the user contacts the audio transcoding communications platform <b>112</b> employing the telephone <b>108</b> and/or the wireless communicator <b>110</b> and interfaces with the IVR <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) using voice and/or a Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) input (step <b>408</b>). The user is prompted to enter his identification (step <b>410</b>). The IVR <b>200</b> authenticates the user's identity against the database <b>106</b>. The IVR <b>200</b> then requests that the content manager <b>208</b> access from the database <b>106</b> audio content selections previously provided by the user, other available audio content, or any combination (step <b>412</b>). The IVR <b>200</b> then presents to the user an audible menu of the audio content, typically organized into subject categories (step <b>414</b>). The user then selects the desired audio content and indicates his selection to the IVR <b>200</b> (step <b>416</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0141">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, once the audio content is selected, content manager <b>208</b> refers IVR <b>200</b> to a specific transcoder <b>202</b>. A connection is established from the IVR <b>200</b> to an available socket on the transcoder <b>202</b>. (step <b>418</b>). The content manager <b>208</b> selects a specific transcoder <b>202</b> in order to maximize usage of transcoder resources. Transcoders <b>202</b> are allocated to supply access to a specific stream by the content manager <b>208</b> in a manner that preferably limits the number of connections to the outside stream. For instance, should one of the transcoders be currently connected to the BBC World Service via internet stream <b>236</b>, future requests for access to information from the IVR <b>200</b> will be referred by the content manager <b>208</b> to that transcoder.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0142">A request socket <b>302</b> informs the cache manager <b>308</b> of the requested audio content (step <b>422</b>). The cache manager <b>308</b> checks the cache <b>304</b> and/or the audio content storage device <b>122</b> to see if any of the audio content has been previously cached and/or stored (step <b>424</b>). Any cached or stored audio content is then retrieved and provided to the IVR <b>200</b> for output via the telephone <b>108</b> and/or the wireless communicator <b>110</b> (step <b>426</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0143">If the requested audio content is unavailable from cache or storage, the request socket instructs the transcoder <b>202</b> to load content. The transcoder <b>202</b> selects the audio content player <b>310</b> that matches the format of the incoming audio stream (step <b>428</b>). If the requested content originates from a PSTN source, the PSTN manager <b>312</b> connects to the desired PSTN source <b>206</b> via the telephonic interface <b>314</b> and provides the content to the IVR <b>200</b> (step <b>430</b>). If the requested content originates from a live audio source <b>126</b> via the network <b>104</b>, then audio content player <b>310</b> establishes a network connection with the appropriate source via network <b>104</b> (step <b>432</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0144">Optionally, the audio stream may then be modified by the equalizer <b>320</b> and the resampler <b>308</b>. The equalizer <b>320</b> may modify the frequencies of audio content, such as by removing high frequencies or adjusting tone and bass. The resampler <b>306</b> may change the sampling rate for instance, by converting from 44 kHz to 8 kHz. The resampler <b>306</b> preferably contains a converter (not shown), which is capable of converting audio content to 8-bit μ-law format. The audio stream, which leaves the resampler <b>306</b> and enters the cache <b>304</b>, is thus modified into a format that is suitable for telephone and wireless output (step <b>434</b>). The re-sampled audio stream is then provided to the IVR <b>200</b> for output via the telephone <b>108</b> and/or the wireless communicator <b>110</b> (step <b>436</b>). Re-sampled content may be optionally cached and/or stored in the cache <b>304</b> and/or the storage device <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0145">It is appreciated that the existence and validity of audio content may be determined, and audio content may be cached and/or stored in anticipation of serving user requests. It is also appreciated that any of steps <b>428</b> through <b>434</b> may be performed by platform <b>112</b> as sources of audio content are made known to platform <b>112</b>, preferably prior to serving telephone requests for such audio content. These steps may be performed in a process separate from the method of operation of the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> and described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0146">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which is a simplified flowchart illustration describing a method of operation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> providing the functionality of semaphoring audio content, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, once the transcoder <b>202</b> begins providing audio content to the telephone <b>108</b> and/or the wireless communicator <b>110</b>, the user may provide a voice and/or DTMF command to the IVR <b>200</b> to indicate the placement of a “semaphore”, operable to mark a position in the audio stream (step <b>500</b>). The IVR <b>300</b> then provides the command to the parser <b>200</b>, which identifies the command as being a request for semaphore (step <b>502</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0147">Once the command for a semaphore has been identified, the transcoder <b>202</b> instructs the IVR <b>200</b> to save the current location of the audio stream in the database <b>106</b> (step <b>504</b>). The platform <b>112</b> may additionally be configured to begin caching and/or storing the audio stream from the point where the semaphore is indicated (step <b>506</b>). Later, when the user reconnects by telephone to the platform <b>112</b> and selects the previously semaphored audio content (step <b>508</b>), the transcoder <b>202</b> begins the audio stream from the location of the semaphore, either automatically or upon specific instruction by the user (step <b>510</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0148">Alternatively, the user <b>100</b> may request the future placement of a semaphore. For instance, a user may wish to record a future BBC broadcast of ‘Letter from America’ scheduled to take place at 3:00am. In one scenario, the user is responsible for providing information regarding the link to be recorded, such as the URL and recording time. The user accesses the IVR, establishes a user name and password, and indicates that he would like to receive the BBC World Service broadcast of ‘Letter from America’. This is accomplished by providing the associated URL and entering start &amp; finish times for the recording. The system, as described in step <b>500</b> will, at the appropriate time, provide a semaphore command to the IVR <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0149">Later, when the user wishes to hear the recording, the user places a telephone call to an IVR interface of the present invention and enters his access code and password. The user is then presented with a menu of choices, including URLs that the user previously indicated, typically presented by content category. The user then chooses a category that includes the BBC World Service broadcasts and then selects the ‘Letter from America’ broadcast. Responsive to this selection, the transcoder <b>202</b> of the present invention establishes a network connection with http://www.broadcast.com/bbc/, if such a connection has not earlier been established. The network server receives the news broadcast in a streaming audio format, and then renders the streaming audio to provide a telephone output. The IVR <b>200</b> then provides the command to the parser <b>300</b>, which identifies the command as being a request for a semaphore (step <b>502</b>). Once the command for a semaphore has been identified, the transcoder <b>202</b> instructs the IVR <b>200</b> to save the current offset of the audio stream in the database <b>106</b> (step <b>504</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0150">The platform <b>112</b> may additionally be configured to begin caching and/or storing the audio stream from the location where the semaphore is indicated (step <b>506</b>). Later, when the user reconnects by telephone to the platform <b>112</b> and selects the previously semaphored audio content (step <b>508</b>), the transcoder <b>202</b> begins the audio stream from the point of the semaphore, either automatically or upon specific instruction from the user (step <b>510</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0151">In an alternative scenario, the system provides the details and the user selects his choices from a menu of pre-configured presentations. The user places a telephone call to an IVR interface of the present invention and enters his user name and password. The user is presented with a main menu and list of options such as “press 1 for news, press 2 for business”. The user typically selects 1 for news and is presented with an additional list of options. Within the list is the option to “press 3 to record a program”. The user is given a list of choices of stations to from which to record, such as BBC, CNN or CBS.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0152">The user typically selects the BBC World Service and is presented with a list of programs that are broadcast on the BBC World Service. The user typically selects the program ‘Letter from America’. The information is stored in a database (not shown) which stores all program data such as URLs and broadcast times.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0153">Later, when the user wishes to hear the recording, the user places a telephone call to an IVR interface of the present invention and enters his user name and password. The user is typically presented with a main menu and list of options such as “press 1 for news, press 2 for business”. The user typically selects 1 for news and is presented with an additional list of options. Within the list is the option “press 4 for a pre-recorded program”. The user typically selects the appropriate pre-recorded program. Responsive to this selection, the transcoder <b>202</b> of the present invention establishes a network connection with http://www.broadcast.com/bbc/, if such a connection has not earlier been established. The network server receives the news broadcast in a streaming audio format, and then renders the streaming audio to provide a telephone output.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0154">The IVR <b>200</b> then provides a semaphore command to the parser <b>300</b>, which identifies the command as being a request for semaphore (step <b>502</b>).
