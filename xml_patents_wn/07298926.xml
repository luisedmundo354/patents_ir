<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to imaging systems and more particularly relates to an image reduction system and method that utilizes an image rotation algorithm to achieve a reduced image.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As devices that utilize digital imaging systems (e.g., scanners, digital cameras, etc.) become more popular, a demand for robust applications that can manipulate digital images has been created. One such application involves image scaling, where for instance, the size of an image is reduced. Available applications range from very simple algorithms that are highly lossy to very complex algorithms that are very sophisticated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An example of a very sophisticated system may, for example, process a high order surface that is fitted with incoming data, which is then re-sampled. Unfortunately, such sophisticated algorithms become increasingly difficult to implement for small image size reductions, e.g., an image size reduction from 200 pels (picture elements or pixels) to 180 pels. Such systems may therefore be too costly or too slow to implement.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An example of a very simple system may utilize half-scaling, where every other pixel is discarded. When such a system is applied to only slightly reduce an image, e.g., where every tenth pixel has been discarded, unacceptable distortions or artifacts may be introduced into the reduced image.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, a need exists for an image reduction system that can efficiently provide small image size reductions without introducing unwanted distortions or computational costs.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention addresses the above-mentioned issues, as well as others, by providing a system and method for reducing an image. In a first aspect, the invention provides a system for reducing a size of an image, comprising: a system for rotating the image in a first direction using a rotation algorithm to generate an intermediate reduced image; a system for rotating the intermediate reduced image in a direction opposite the first direction using the rotation algorithm to generate a final reduced image; and wherein the rotation algorithm uses weighted sums of neighboring pixels in the image prior to rotation to calculate new pixel values.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a second aspect, the invention provides a program product stored on a recordable medium for reducing a size of an original image, comprising: means for rotating the original image in a first direction to generate an intermediate reduced image; means for rotating the intermediate reduced image in a direction opposite the first direction to generate a final reduced image; and wherein the means for rotating the original and intermediate reduced image use weighted sums of neighboring pixels in the image prior to rotation to calculate new pixel values.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a third aspect, the invention provides a method of reducing a size of an image, comprising: providing an original image having W<b>1</b> pixels in each row; generating an intermediate reduced image having a reduced number of pixels W<b>2</b> in each row, wherein W<b>2</b> is less than W<b>1</b>, and wherein for each pixel <b>1</b> to W<b>2</b> in each row, pixel values are calculated based on weighted sums of neighboring pixels in the original image; and generating a further reduced image having W<b>3</b> pixels in each row, wherein W<b>3</b> is less than W<b>2</b>, and wherein for each pixel <b>1</b> to W<b>3</b> in each row, pixel values are calculated based on weighted sums of neighboring pixels in the intermediate reduced image.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a fourth aspect, the invention provides a system for reducing a size of an original image, wherein the original image has a predetermined number of pixels W<b>1</b> in a row, the system comprising: a system for generating an intermediate reduced image having a reduced number of pixels W<b>2</b> in the row, wherein W<b>2</b> is less than W<b>1</b>, and wherein for each pixel <b>1</b> to W<b>2</b> in the row, pixel values are calculated based on weighted sums of neighboring pixels in the original image; and a system for generating a further reduced image having a reduced number of pixels W<b>3</b> in the row, wherein W<b>3</b> is less than W<b>2</b>, and wherein for each pixel <b>1</b> to W<b>3</b> in the row, pixel values are calculated based on weighted sums of neighboring pixels in the intermediate reduced image.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a reduction system <b>14</b> embodied in a computer system <b>10</b>. Computer system <b>10</b> receives: (1) an original image <b>28</b>, having original pixel coordinates <b>29</b>; and (2) a set of reduced pixel coordinates <b>30</b>, and outputs a reduced image <b>32</b> having the reduced pixel coordinates <b>30</b>. Thus, for example, the coordinates of the original image <b>28</b> may be 201 pixels in width by 231 pixels in height, and the resulting reduced image may be 187 pixels in width by 214 pixels in height. The present invention allows for near continuous image scaling with virtually no loss of information. Thus, for instance, the image size can be reduced so that the resulting image pixel coordinates are multiples of eight, as required for JPEG image compression. It should be appreciated that while in most cases the amount of pixel reduction will be symmetrical with respect to width and height (e.g., 7% in both directions), any reduced pixel coordinates <b>30</b> may be inputted, including ones that cause a non-symmetrical result. Thus, the inputted reduced pixel coordinates <b>30</b> may be received in any format, e.g., as pixel dimensions such as 187×214, as a reduction percentage such as 10%, etc. It should also be understood that for the purposes of this disclosure, the term “pixel” is synonymous with, and may refer to, any type of picture element, data element, image element, etc.</p>

Enhancement systems <b>22</b> enhances any contrast reduction that may have resulted from the size reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Reduction system <b>14</b> generally comprises a reduction algorithm <b>16</b>, a pixel selection system <b>18</b>, and a system for computing and/or storing constant K values <b>20</b>. Reduction algorithm <b>16</b> reduces the original image by rotating the image in a first direction (Rotation System A), and then rotating the image in a second direction (Rotation System B). According to reduction algorithm <b>16</b> detailed below, each rotation causes a size reduction that is proportional to the angle of rotation. Specifically, an image width can be reduced from W<sub>1 </sub>pixels to W<sub>2 </sub>pixels by rotating the image to an angle α in accordance with the equation cos α=(W<sub>2</sub>/W<sub>1</sub>), or</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">W<sub>2</sub>=W<sub>1 </sub>cos α. Similarly, an image height is reduced from H<sub>1 </sub>pixels to H<sub>2 </sub>pixels according to the equation cos α=(H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>1</sub>), or H<sub>2</sub>=H<sub>1 </sub>cos α. In the present embodiment, the image is rotated twice (e.g., clockwise and then counterclockwise), so that the final reduced image is returned to its original position. Accordingly, the image may be first rotated α/2 in a first direction, and then α/2 in the opposite direction to achieve the desired reduction. Thus, using the two step process, the image width will be reduced from W<sub>1 </sub>pixels to W<sub>2 </sub>pixels to W<sub>3 </sub>pixels, where W<sub>1</sub>&gt;W<sub>2</sub>&gt;W<sub>3</sub>, and the image height will be reduced from H<sub>1 </sub>pixels to H<sub>2 </sub>pixels to H<sub>3 </sub>pixels, where H<sub>1</sub>&gt;H<sub>2</sub>&gt;H<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Where no skewing is desired between the original image <b>28</b> and the reduced image <b>32</b>, W<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2 </sub>can be readily determined. For instance, for relatively small rotations, the desired reduction can be achieved by selecting W<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2 </sub>to be approximately a mid-point, e.g., W<sub>2</sub>≈½(W<sub>1</sub>+W<sub>3</sub>). As the amount of rotation increases, W<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2 </sub>will deviate more from the mid-point. In addition, if there is a skewing issue, then W<sub>2 </sub>can be can be adjusted accordingly, i.e., the amount of rotation in the first and second direction can be made unequal to compensate for the skew. For instance, if the original image having pixel coordinates of W<sub>1 </sub>and H<sub>1 </sub>was skewed 3 degrees clockwise, and a 33 degree total rotation was desired to achieve W<sub>3 </sub>and H<sub>3</sub>, the first rotation could be 18 degrees counterclockwise, followed by a second clockwise rotation of 15 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">To achieve the desired reduction result, new pixel values are calculated in a two step process. The first calculation reduces the number of pixels P<sub>1 </sub>in the original image, i.e., W<sub>1</sub>×H<sub>1</sub>, to an intermediate reduced image having P<sub>2 </sub>pixels, i.e., W<sub>2</sub>×H<sub>2</sub>, (first rotation). The second calculation reduces the number of pixels in the intermediate reduced image, i.e., P<sub>2 </sub>pixels, to the final reduced image <b>32</b> having P<sub>3 </sub>pixels, i.e., W<sub>3</sub>×H<sub>3</sub>, (second rotation). The reduction/rotation algorithm for both steps calculates each new pixel in a target image using weighted sums of neighboring pixels in the initial image. An exemplary algorithm for reducing an initial image to a target image may be implementing as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>V</i><sub>o</sub><i>=K</i><sub>h</sub><i>*K</i><sub>v</sub>(<i>V</i><sub>1</sub><i>+V</i><sub>4</sub><i>−V</i><sub>2</sub><i>−V</i><sub>3</sub>)+<i>K</i><sub>h</sub>(<i>V</i><sub>3</sub><i>−V</i><sub>4</sub>)+<i>K</i><sub>v</sub>(<i>V</i><sub>2</sub><i>−V</i><sub>4</sub>)+<i>V</i><sub>4</sub>,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">where V<sub>o </sub>is the new pixel value calculated for each pixel in the target image; V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>3 </sub>and V<sub>4 </sub>are neighboring pixels of the initial image that incorporate a portion of V<sub>o</sub>; and K<sub>h </sub>and K<sub>v </sub>are fractions that are functions of: (1) the number/coordinates of pixels in the target image, and (2) the position of the current pixel V<sub>o </sub>in the target image.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an example of a resulting target image superimposed on an initial image <b>42</b>. As can be seen, the target image <b>40</b> has been rotated by an angle α to effectuate some reduction. In this case it can be seen that a new pixel value V<sub>o </sub>(in the target image) is calculated as a function of the neighboring pixels V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>3 </sub>and V<sub>4 </sub>in the initial image. The process of identifying which neighboring pixels will be used for the calculation of V<sub>o </sub>is determined by pixel selection system <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). By knowing the angle of rotation α, it is a trivial process to identify the position of V<sub>o </sub>relative to the pixels of the initial image <b>42</b>, and therefore identify the neighboring pixels. Pixel selection system <b>18</b> can be implemented in any known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Constants K<sub>h </sub>and K<sub>v </sub>comprise incremental values between 0 and 1, which may be obtained from a table or generated dynamically. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, K<sub>h </sub>and K<sub>v </sub>are implemented in ⅛th increments, i.e., ⅛, ¼, ⅜, ½, ⅝, ¾, ⅞ and 8/8. K<sub>h </sub>values provide horizontal fractions (for each X coordinate in columns C<sub>0 </sub>to C<sub>N</sub>, where N is an integer), and K<sub>v </sub>values provide vertical fractions (for Y coordinate in rows R<sub>0 </sub>to R<sub>M</sub>). Increments of K<sub>h </sub>and K<sub>v </sub>are assigned to segments of pixels, for example, by dividing the number of pixels in each row or column of the image by eight (8). Thus, for example, a target image having a width of 80 pixels would have 10 pixels in each segment, i.e., 80/8=10. Thus, for pixels 1-10 (i.e., pixels corresponding to columns C<sub>0 </sub>to C<sub>9</sub>), K<sub>h</sub>=⅛; for pixels 11-20, K<sub>h</sub>= 2/8; for pixels 21-30, K<sub>h</sub>=⅜; and so on. In the case where the target number of pixels is not divisible by eight, the distribution may be made as close as possible to provide even segments.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">If the initial image has perpendicular sides, values for K<sub>v </sub>may be determined by the same formula as K<sub>h</sub>. That is, horizontal rows 1-10 (i.e., rows R<sub>0-9</sub>) of pixels, K<sub>v</sub>=⅛; rows 11-20, K<sub>v</sub>=¼; rows 21-30, K<sub>v</sub>=⅜, and so on. As horizontal rows are extracted, the vertical (R<sub>0 </sub>to R<sub>M</sub>) coordinate is incremented by one up or down depending on the direction of extraction, which allows for determination of an appropriate K<sub>v </sub>fraction.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If the initial image does not have perpendicular sides, increment numbers will vary for K<sub>h </sub>and K<sub>v </sub>depending on their respective skew angle. That is, values of K<sub>h </sub>and K<sub>v </sub>will be provided according to the respective skew angle in the respective horizontal and vertical directions.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The appropriate values for K<sub>h </sub>and K<sub>v </sub>may be stored in at least one lookup table based on the coordinates of the target image and pixel locations. Alternatively, K<sub>h </sub>and K<sub>v </sub>can be generated dynamically based on the inputted amount of size reduction, e.g., by dividing the vertical and horizontal coordinates of the reduced image by the number of desired segments (e.g., eight), and assigning fractions to each segment. This calculation could be calculated ahead of time when the amount of size reduction is first inputted, stored in a table, and downloaded to the hardware device to improve run-time speeds. As a further alternative, since the reduction can be associated with a skew angle, a lookup table may be based on skew angle. An exemplary K<sub>h </sub>lookup table for a target image having 80 pixels in width may take a form as follows:</p>
