<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a novel complex comprising a substituted 2quinolinol and a lanthanide ion, more specifically, to a novel long-life luminescent complex comprising a substituted 2-quinolinol and a lanthanide ion, the luminescence intensity of which can be controlled using a photo-induced electron transfer (PET).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Luminescent lanthanide complexes are known to have luminescent characteristics starkly different from those of ordinary luminescent organic compounds and have long life luminescence, sharp luminescence spectra and large Stokes shifts. (Richardson, F. S.; Chemistry Review, 1982, 82, 541-552; Ginya Adachi “Rare Earth Story, Magicians Among Leading Edge Materials,” Sangyo Tosho; Ginya Adachi “Rare Earth Chemistry,” Kagaku Dojin.) By utilizing the characteristics of this luminescence and measuring the luminescence using a time resolved measurement, the luminescence emitted solely by a lanthanide complex can uniquely be detected upon eliminating the luminescence from other organic compounds having short luminescence lifetime. This approach allows the background noise to be suppressed, and highly sensitive detection having a greater S/N ratio than that of a luminescence detection system based on the luminescence of an ordinary organic compound becomes possible. A variety of luminescent lanthanide complexes have been developed previously as labeling reagents and were used in time resolved immunoassays and time resolved DNA hybridizations, and an increase in detection sensitivities has been reported. (Morton, R. C., et al. Anal. Chem. 1990, 62, 1841; Seveus, L. et al., Microsc. Res. Tech. 1994, 28, 149; Mathis, G. Clin. Chem. 1993, 39, 1953-1959.) A probe capable of detecting a target analytical material with high sensitivity can be developed by using the luminescence of the luminescent lanthanide complex having the characteristics mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently an attempt was made to utilize a luminescent lanthanide complex itself as a sensor, and lanthanide complexes that change their luminescence characteristics depending upon the presence or absence of a target analytical material are being developed. (DeSilva, A. P. et al., Chem. Rev. 1997, 97, 1515; Bissell, R. A. et al. “In Luminescent Chemosensors for Ion and Molecule Recognition”; Garnik, A. W., Ed.; ACS Symposium Series 538; American Chemical Society; Washington, D.C., 1993; Chapter 4.) The main luminescence controlling methods involve either a change in the number of water ligands on lanthanide or a change in the chromophore itself.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Up to now, many luminescent probes have been developed in ordinary organic compounds, in which photo induced electron transfer has been used to control luminescence. The photo induced electron transfer principle is widely accepted as the mechanism for luminescence quenching and is caused by the transfer of electrons from electron donating locations to luminescent dye locations. If the luminescence from a luminescent lanthanide complex can be controlled using photo induced electron transfer, a probe capable of high sensitivity detection can be designed and developed using photo induced electron transfer as the luminescence controlling principle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Several attempts to control the luminescence from lanthanide complexes such as the one shown by the formula below (chemical formula 4) using photo induced electron transfer have been reported. (Chem. Comm. 2000, 473-474; Chem. Comm. 1997, 1891-1892.)</p>

Problems to be Solved by the Invention
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the previously reported lanthanide complexes that exhibit luminescence controlled using photo induced electron transfer (PET) do not have adequate quenching mechanisms and not enough change in luminescence could be achieved due to large levels of background luminescence. In addition, the lanthanide complexes emitted luminescence only in organic solvents due to inadequate coordination of the complexes on a lanthanide metal. By overcoming the deficiency, a probe based on a luminescent lanthanide complex having practical applications in many actual systems can be developed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The objective of the present invention is to present a luminescent lanthanide complex utilizing photo induced electron transfer as the luminescence controlling principle. This complex needs to form a stable complex with lanthanide in water and to function in water. In addition, this complex must be completely controllable and emit no luminescence at all when quenched.</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">Means to Solve the Problems</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inventors discovered that the problems described above were solved by a complex comprising a lanthanide ion and a substituted 2-quinolinol containing a sensor group and a complex group, and the present invention was completed.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">This complex is allowed to co-exist with a sample to be measured in a liquid phase, particularly in water. When the sample reacts with the amino groups in the sensor section, a change in the luminescence of this complex occurs. By observing the change, the nature of the sample can be characterized.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, when the electron donating nature of the amino group is high (for example, when the sensor section is aniline), no luminescence is emitted from a chromophore as shown on the left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>). When such a reaction induces a change in the amino group to a group having low electron donating nature (for example, into acetanilide), luminescence is emitted by the chromophore as shown on the right of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>). In a reverse situation, luminescence is quenched according to the reaction with a sample as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>). By studying such luminescence, one can find an interaction between the complex of the present invention and the target sample. (Refer to DeSilva, A. P. et al., 1997, 97, 1515 for information on such a PET sensor principle.)</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Based on such a principle, some examples can be shown below as examples in which a complex of the present invention is utilized as a probe. However, the applications are not restricted to the examples. The reaction mechanisms involved in each example are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">(1) A reaction group (a peptide: DEVD) capable of reacting with a hydrolase enzyme such as caspase is incorporated into a PET sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">This enables that the hydrolase enzymes such as caspase and the like can be specifically detected. The intra-cellular formation of a hydrolase such as caspase can be visualized. This application is very effective in analyzing the mechanisms of life related phenomena such as apoptosis. The tool can be applied to measuring the activity of a hydrolase such as caspase and can also be applied to the high throughput screening of interfering agents for a hydrolase such as caspase.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">No example of an application to a conventional organic luminescence probe has been published, but a complex of the present invention is an application target since it can definitely induce a change in luminescence intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">(2) A reaction group forming a coordinate bond to a zinc ion is incorporated into the PET sensor section.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This example makes the unique detection of Zn<sup>2+</sup> possible. The intra-cellular formation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> can be visualized. An example in which the Zn<sup>2+</sup> measurements are applied to an organic luminescence probe has been published. (Hirano, T., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2000, 122, 12399.)</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">(3) A reaction group containing added hydrogen ions is incorporated into a PET sensor section.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Changes in pH can be measured using intensity changes in long life luminescence. An example in which measurements of changes in pH are applied to an organic luminescent probe has been published. (Sellinger, B. K, Aust. J. Chem. 1977, 30, 2087.)</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">(4) A reaction group containing nitrogen monoxide is incorporated into a PET sensor section.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Unique detection of NO is possible. Intracellular NO formation can be visualized. Such an example can be applied to measure the activation of NO synthetase and can also be applied to high throughput screening of NO synthetase interfering agents.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Refer to Kojima, H. et al., Anal. Chem., 1998, 70, 2446. for an example in which a reaction with NO was applied to an organic luminescent probe.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Advantages of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although a PET mechanism has previously been used to control luminescence in ordinary organic compounds, a complex of the present invention offers a novel feature of being able to control a long life luminescence with about one million times longer lifetime compared to previous organic compounds by using a PET control on a lanthanide complex. Therefore, a time resolved luminescence measurement is made available which enables more precise measurement. Up to now, some examples of time resolved measurements using a lanthanide complex have been published, but no example in which the intensity of long life luminescence was controlled using a reaction with a target sample has been published. The present invention provides the first example in which a measurement of a long life luminescence according to a target sample becomes possible, and more extensive application is anticipated for the complex of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The examples of the present invention below are provided to illustrate the present invention, but they are not provided with the intention of restricting the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the examples below, DTPA that forms a stable one to one complex with lanthanide ions (Ln<sup>3+</sup>) was used as the chelate, and DTPA-cs124, a 2-quinolinol derivative, containing cs124 as a chromophore, represented by the formula (chemical formula 5) shown below,</p>

was used as the foundation skeleton. Then a lanthanide complex was designed and synthesized by incorporating a PET sensor to this skeleton. Aniline, which has a highly electron donating character, and acetanilide, which has a low electron donating nature, were selected as the PET sensors.
</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A PET sensor having a high electron donating characteristic did not emit luminescence since the electrons transferred to the chromophore. However, no electron transfer occurred from PET sensors having low electron donating character resulting in the emission of luminescence.</p>

<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The terbium (III) complex and europium (III) complex of Compound 15 both emitted intense luminescence. The luminescence intensity of the terbium (III) complex and europium (III) complex of DTPA-cs124 was almost identical. In addition, no change was observed in their luminescence lives. The luminescence characteristics did not change when the 4 position in a carbostyryl segment was changed to a benzyl group.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The terbium (III) complex and europium (III) complex of Compound 11 both emitted intense luminescence. However, neither the terbium (III) complex nor the europium (III) complex of Compound 8 emitted luminescence at all, and their luminescence lifetimes could not be measured. Raising the electron density of the position 4 substituent in the carbostyryl segment caused a photo induced electron transfer from the position 4 substituent to the carbostyryl, and the terbium (III) complex and europium (III) complex of Compound 8 did not emit luminescence at all.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The data presented indicated that the luminescence in lanthanide complexes, including terbium (III) and europium (III) complexes could be controlled. Stable complexes in water were formed, the luminescence could be completely controlled and the complexes clearly functioned in water. The results indicated that a highly sensitive probe for a variety of analytical target materials could be developed by using an electron donating segment formed through a photo induced electron transfer and changing its electron donating capability to provide a sensor for the analytical target materials.</p>
