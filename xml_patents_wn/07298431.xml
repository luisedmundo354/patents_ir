<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2003-0099291 filed on Dec. 29, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device and its fabricating method, and more particularly, to a liquid crystal display device and its fabricating method that reduces the number of mask processes in forming a thin film transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As demands for the information display device and the portable information display media is growing, research on a light-weight thin film type flat panel display (FPD) is becoming a trend of industry threatening the related art cathode ray tube (CRT) display device. One type of FPDs is a liquid crystal display (LCD), which displays an image using the optical anisotropy of liquid crystal material, is actively employed in notebook computers and a desktop monitors because of its high quality resolution, color display, and picture quality.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The LCD includes a color filter substrate (a first substrate), an array substrate (a second substrate), and a liquid crystal layer formed between the color filter substrate and the array substrate. A thin film transistor (TFT) is generally used as a switching device of the LCD and an amorphous silicon thin film or a polycrystalline silicon thin film is used as a channel layer of the TFT.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A fabrication process of the LCD generally requires a plurality of masking processes (namely, a photolithography process) for fabrication of the array substrate including the TFT. Accordingly, reducing the number of masking processes is necessary to increase a productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The structure of a general LCD will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view showing a portion of the array substrate of the related art LCD. An actual LCD has N×M pixels with N gate lines intersecting M data lines. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, only one pixel is shown in the drawing to simplify the explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As shown, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the array substrate <b>10</b> includes a pixel electrode <b>18</b> formed on a pixel region, gate lines <b>16</b> and data lines <b>17</b> arranged vertically and horizontally on the substrate <b>10</b> to define a pixel electrode, and a TFT (the switching device) formed at the intersection of the gate line <b>16</b> and the data line <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The TFT includes a gate electrode <b>21</b> connected to the gate line <b>16</b>, a source electrode <b>22</b> connected to the data line <b>17</b>, and a drain electrode <b>23</b> connected to the pixel electrode <b>18</b>. The TFT further includes a first insulation film (not shown) and a second insulation film (not shown) for insulating the gate electrode <b>21</b> and the source/drain electrodes <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>, and an active pattern <b>24</b> for forming a conductive channel between the source electrode <b>22</b> and the drain electrode <b>23</b>. The gate electrode <b>21</b> supplies a gate voltage at the conductive channel.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The source electrode <b>22</b> is electrically connected to a source region of the active pattern <b>24</b> and the drain electrode <b>23</b> is electrically connected to a drain region of the active pattern <b>24</b> through a plurality of first contact holes <b>40</b>A defined through the first insulation film and the second insulation film. A third insulation film (not shown) having a second contact hole <b>40</b>B is formed on the drain electrode <b>23</b> so that the drain electrode <b>23</b> and the pixel electrode <b>18</b> are electrically connected.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A process for fabricating the LCD as described above will now be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2F</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2F</figref> are sequential cross-sectional views showing a fabrication process of the LCD taken along line I-I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The TFT in the related art uses polycrystalline silicon as a channel layer. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an active pattern <b>24</b> made of a polycrystalline silicon thin film is formed on a substrate <b>10</b> using photolithography.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a first insulation film <b>15</b>A and a conductive metal material are disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>10</b> already provided with the active pattern <b>24</b>. Thereafter, the conductive metal material is selectively patterned using photolithography, thereby forming a gate electrode <b>21</b> over the active pattern <b>24</b>. The gate electrode <b>21</b> is insulated from the active pattern <b>24</b> by the gate insulation film <b>15</b>A interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Then, a high density impurity ion is injected into a desired portion of the active pattern <b>24</b>. The gate electrode <b>21</b> is used as a mask to form p+ or n+ source/drain regions <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B. The source/drain regions <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B make an ohmic contact with source/drain electrodes. Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the second insulation film <b>15</b>B is disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>10</b> already provided with the gate electrode <b>21</b>, thereafter, a portion of the first and second insulation films <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B are removed to form a first contact hole <b>40</b>A exposing a portion of the source/drain regions <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, a conductive metal material is disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>10</b> and then patterned by using photolithography process to form a source electrode <b>22</b> connected to the source region <b>24</b>A and a drain electrode <b>23</b> connected to the drain region <b>24</b>B through plurality of the first contact hole <b>40</b>A. In this case, a portion of the conductive metal layer forming the source electrode <b>22</b> extends in a first direction to be connected with the data line <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, after a third insulation film <b>15</b>C is disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>10</b>, a second contact hole <b>40</b>B is formed to expose a portion of the drain electrode <b>23</b> by photolithography. Finally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, a transparent conductive metal material is disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>10</b> already provided with the third insulation film <b>15</b>C, and patterned by photolithography, thereby forming the pixel electrode <b>18</b> connected with the drain electrode <b>23</b> within the second contact hole <b>40</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As described above, when fabricating the LCD, including the polycrystalline silicon TFT, a total of six photolithography processes are required to pattern the active pattern, the gate electrode, the first contact hole, the source/drain electrode, the second contact hole and the pixel electrode. The photolithography process is a series of processes to form a desired pattern on a thin film-deposited substrate, consisting of a plurality of processes including coating a photosensitive material, exposing the photosensitive material, and developing the photosensitive material. Accordingly, the plurality of photolithography processes contribute to a reduction in production yield and increase in TFT defects. Since a mask designed to form a pattern is costly, an, increase in the number of masks significantly increases the LCD fabrication cost.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a LCD device and fabricating method thereof that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An object of the present invention is to provide an LCD device and its fabrication method capable of reducing the number of masks by simultaneously patterning an active pattern and a data line to fabricate a thin film transistor.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An active matrix (AM) structure includes a driving mechanism to drive liquid crystal material of a pixel unit using a thin film transistor (TFT) as a switching device. In such active matrix structure, amorphous silicon or polycrystalline silicon is used as a channel layer of the TFT. A concept of an amorphous silicon thin film transistor technique was established by LeComber et al. of England in 1979 and then was put to practical use as a 3-inch liquid crystal portable TV in 1986. Recently, a TFT LCD having a size greater than 50 inches has been developed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">However, an electric mobility (˜1 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vsec) of the amorphous silicon thin film transistor is limited in its application to a peripheral circuit which requires a fast clock operation of 1 MHz or higher. Thus, integrating a pixel unit and a driving circuit unit on a glass substrate simultaneously by the polycrystalline silicon TFT is taking attention from researchers because the polycrystalline silicon TFT has greater field effect mobility than the amorphous silicon TFT.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The polycrystalline silicon thin film transistor technique has been applied to a compact module such as a camcorder since liquid crystal color TV was developed in 1982. Due to a low photo sensitivity and high field effect mobility, the polycrystalline silicon thin film transistor includes the driving circuit that can be directly fabricated on a substrate. In particular, increased mobility enhances an operation frequency of a driving circuit unit which determines the number of driving pixels. In addition, reduction of time taken to change a signal voltage of the pixel unit reduces a distortion of a transmission signal, thereby improving picture. Moreover, the polycrystalline silicon TFT can be driven with a voltage smaller than 10V compared to the amorphous silicon thin film transistor which requires a high driving voltage (˜25V), thereby saving a power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">However, due to an increased number of photolithography processes required to fabricate an LCD including the polycrystalline silicon TFT, the fabrication cost increases. To solve this problem, the number of photolithography processes, specifically, the number of masks used, needs to be reduced. Accordingly, the present invention provides a LCD device and its fabrication method in which first and second contact holes are formed masking process at the same time by simultaneously pattering the active pattern and the data line, thereby reducing the number of masks.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The LCD device and its fabrication method in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view showing a portion of an array substrate of a LCD device in accordance with a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention. A LCD device of the first embodiment includes N×M pixels formed by N gate lines and M data lines intersecting each other. For convenience, only a single pixel is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first embodiment of the present invention implements a polycrystalline silicon TFT using a polycrystalline silicon thin film as a channel layer. However, choice of channel layer is not limited thereto, and an amorphous silicon thin film can be also used as the channel layer. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, gate line <b>116</b> and data line <b>117</b> are formed on an array substrate <b>110</b>. The gate line <b>116</b> intersects data line <b>117</b>, thereby defining pixel regions.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A TFT, working as a switching device, is formed at the intersection of the gate line <b>116</b> and the data line <b>117</b>. A pixel electrode <b>118</b> connected to the TFT is formed in the pixel region to drive liquid crystal material (not shown). A common electrode of a color filter substrate (not shown) also is formed in the pixel region and connected to the TFT.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The TFT includes a gate electrode <b>121</b> connected to the gate line <b>116</b>, a source electrode <b>122</b> connected to the data line <b>117</b>, and a drain electrode <b>123</b> connected to the pixel electrode <b>118</b>. The TFT further includes the second and third insulation films (not shown) to insulate the gate electrode <b>121</b>, the source/drain electrodes <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, and an active pattern <b>120</b>B. An active pattern <b>120</b>B forms a conductive channel between the source electrode <b>122</b> and the drain electrode <b>123</b> where a gate voltage is supplied to the gate electrode <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The source electrode <b>122</b> is electrically connected to the source region of the active pattern <b>120</b>B within one of the plurality of first contact holes <b>140</b>A defined through the second and third insulation films, and the drain electrode <b>123</b> is electrically connected to the drain region of the active pattern <b>120</b>B within the other one of the plurality of first contact holes <b>140</b>A. A portion of the source electrode <b>122</b> is electrically connected to the data line <b>117</b> within the second contact hole <b>140</b>B defined through the first, second and third insulation films, and a portion of the drain electrode <b>123</b> is extended into the pixel region to form the pixel electrode <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">By patterning the active pattern <b>120</b>B and the data line <b>117</b> in the same masking process, and furthermore forming the pixel electrode <b>118</b>, the source/drain electrodes <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> from the same material, the number of masks can be reduced while fabricating the TFT. A fabrication process of the TFT will be described in detail next.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4E</figref> are sequential cross-sectional views taken along line III-III′ of the LCD of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5E</figref> are plan views showing a step-by-step fabrication process of an LCD according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 5A</figref>, the active pattern <b>120</b>B and the data line <b>117</b> are simultaneously patterned by a photolithography process (the first masking process) on the substrate <b>110</b>. The substrate <b>110</b> is made of a transparent insulation material such as glass.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The data line <b>117</b> includes a first data line pattern <b>120</b>A formed of a silicon layer <b>120</b> which also forms the active pattern <b>120</b>B and a second data line pattern <b>130</b>A formed of a conductive metal material. The conductive metal material pattern <b>130</b>B remains on the upper portion of the active pattern <b>120</b>B. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 5B</figref>, the first insulation film <b>115</b>A is disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>110</b>. Thereafter, the first insulation film <b>1115</b>A and the conductive metal material pattern <b>130</b>B are removed by the photolithography process (the second masking process), thereby exposing the surface of the active pattern <b>120</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The first and second masking processes, namely, the process of simultaneously forming the data line and the active pattern will be described in detail as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6E</figref> are cross-sectional view showing a process of simultaneously forming an active pattern <b>120</b>B and a data line <b>117</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a silicon layer <b>120</b> is disposed on the substrate <b>110</b>. The silicon layer <b>120</b> can be formed of an amorphous silicon thin film or a crystallized silicon thin film. In the first embodiment of the present invention, the TFT is formed by a crystallized polycrystalline silicon thin film. The polycrystalline silicon thin film is formed through several crystallization methods after the amorphous silicon thin film is deposited on the substrate <b>110</b>. The method of forming the polycrystalline silicon thin film will be described next.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">First, the amorphous silicon thin film is deposited by a low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) or a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Thereafter, a dehydrogenation process is performed to remove hydrogen atom existing in the amorphous silicon thin film, and then, crystallization is performed. The methods for crystallizing the amorphous silicon thin film include a solid phase crystallization (SPC) for heat-treating the amorphous silicon thin film at a high temperature in a furnace and an eximer laser annealing (ELA) method using laser. Laser crystallization, such as ELA, commonly uses a pulse form laser. Recently, a sequential lateral solidification (SLS) which improves the crystallization characteristics by growing crystal grains in a horizontal direction has been proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">SLS takes advantage of the fact that crystal grains grow in a vertical direction to a boundary face between liquid phase silicon and solid phase silicon (Robert S. Sposilli, M. A. Crowder, and James S. Im, Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. Vol. 452, 956˜957, 1997). In the SLS, the size of the silicon grains can be enhanced by growing grains laterally up to a certain length. Proper control of laser energy size and an irradiation range of laser beam are required to achieve this result.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A conductive metal material <b>130</b> such as aluminum, an aluminum alloy, tungsten (W), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr) or molybdenum (Mo) is deposited on the entire surface of the substrate <b>110</b>. The conductive metal material <b>130</b> forms the data line <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Thereafter, the first photosensitive film <b>170</b>A made of a photosensitive material, such as photoresist, is disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6C</figref>, after light is selectively irradiated and developed on the first photosensitive film <b>170</b>A, the conductive metal material <b>130</b> and the silicon layer <b>120</b> are patterned simultaneously to form the active pattern <b>120</b>B and the data line <b>117</b> through one-time masking process. At this time, the data line <b>117</b> includes the first data line pattern <b>120</b>A formed of the silicon layer which also forms the active pattern <b>120</b>B and the second data line pattern <b>130</b>A formed of the conductive metal material. The conductive metal material pattern <b>130</b>B having the same pattern as the active pattern <b>120</b>B remains on the upper portion of the active pattern <b>120</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, the first insulation film <b>115</b>A and the second photosensitive film <b>170</b>B are disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>110</b>. Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>, the second photosensitive film <b>170</b>B is exposed and developed using a mask whose size is as large as or larger than the active pattern <b>120</b>B to form the second photosensitive pattern <b>170</b>B′. Then, when the first insulation film <b>115</b>A and the conductive metal material pattern <b>130</b>B are removed using the second photosensitive film pattern <b>170</b>B′ as a mask, the active pattern <b>120</b>B is exposed. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 5C</figref>, the second insulation film <b>115</b>B are disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>110</b>. The second insulation film <b>115</b>B can be formed relatively thinner than the first insulation film <b>115</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">After the gate electrode <b>121</b> is formed at an upper portion of the active pattern <b>120</b>B where the second insulation film <b>115</b>B has been disposed (the third masking process), an impurity ion is injected to a certain region of the active pattern <b>120</b>B using the gate electrode <b>121</b> as a mask, thereby forming the source region <b>124</b>A, and drain regions <b>124</b>B, and channel region <b>124</b>C. In this case, the gate electrode <b>121</b> serves as an ion stopper which prevents an infiltration of a dopant into the channel region <b>124</b>C of the active pattern <b>120</b>B. The electrical characteristics of the active pattern <b>120</b>B vary according to a type of an injected dopant. If the injected dopant corresponds to a group III element such as boron, the active pattern <b>120</b>B operates as a P-type TFT, and if the injected dopant corresponds to a group V element, the active pattern <b>120</b>B operates as an N-type TFT. A process for activating the injected dopant can be performed after the ion injection process.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, when the gate electrode <b>121</b> is formed, the gate line <b>116</b> is formed substantially vertical to the data line <b>117</b>. In the first embodiment of the present invention, when the first insulation film <b>115</b>A is formed relatively thick on the upper portion of the data line <b>117</b>, a signal interference can be prevented at an intersection of the data line <b>117</b> and the gate line <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D and 5D</figref>, the third insulation film <b>115</b>C is disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>110</b> where the gate electrode <b>121</b> has been formed. Then, a portion of the second insulation film <b>115</b>B and the third insulation film <b>115</b>C are removed through photolithography to define a plurality of first contact holes <b>140</b>A to expose a portion of the source/drain regions <b>124</b>A and <b>124</b>B. A portion of the first, second and third insulation films <b>115</b>A, <b>115</b>B and <b>115</b>C are removed to define the second contact hole <b>140</b>B, thereby connecting the source region <b>124</b>A and the data line <b>117</b> electrically. The third insulation film <b>115</b>C is formed of a transparent organic insulation material such as benzocyclobutene (BCB) or an acrylic resin for a high aperture ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4E and 5E</figref>, after a transparent conductive material having an excellent transmittance such as ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) or an IZO (Indium Zinc Oxide) is disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>110</b>. At this time, a portion of the source electrode <b>122</b> is electrically connected to the data line <b>117</b> within the second contact hole <b>140</b>B, and a portion of the drain electrode <b>123</b> is extended into the pixel region to form the pixel electrode <b>118</b>. Furthermore, the source electrode <b>122</b> is electrically connected to the source region <b>124</b>A within the one of the plurality of first contact holes <b>140</b>A and the drain electrode <b>123</b> is electrically connected to the drain region <b>124</b>B within the other one of the plurality of first contact holes <b>140</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As mentioned above, in the fabrication process of the LCD in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention, the active pattern <b>120</b>B and the data line <b>117</b> are simultaneously patterned to define the first and second contact holes in one masking process, thus number of masking process is reduced compared to the fabrication process of the related art. Accordingly, increased production yield and a reduction of fabrication cost are achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Meanwhile, a one-time masking process for patterning the active pattern <b>120</b>B and the data line <b>117</b> simultaneously can be further reduced using a diffraction exposure and ashing technique. Diffraction exposure and ashing technique will now be described in a second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7D</figref> are cross-sectional views sequentially showing a fabrication process of an LCD in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the active pattern <b>220</b>B and the data line <b>217</b> are simultaneously formed on a substrate <b>210</b> using photolithography (the first masking process). The substrate <b>210</b> is made of a transparent insulation material such as glass. In the second embodiment of the present invention, the one-time masking process including the diffraction exposure and ashing process is implemented to form the active pattern <b>220</b>B and the data line <b>217</b>. In the one-time masking process of the second embodiment, a conductive metal material is absent from the upper portion of the active pattern <b>220</b>B, while the data line <b>217</b> and the active pattern <b>220</b>B are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The details of the one-time masking process in the second embodiment will be described with reference in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8D</figref> are cross-sectional views showing a process of simultaneously forming an active pattern and a data line by using a diffraction exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, a conductive metal material <b>230</b> forming a data line is disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>210</b> where a silicon layer <b>220</b> has already been disposed. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, a photosensitive film <b>270</b> formed of a photosensitive material such as photoresist is disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>210</b> already provided with the conductive metal material <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The photoresist includes a positive photoresist and a negative photo resist. The positive photoresist comprises a group of a Novolak based resin, wherein a region exposed to light source is dissolved in reaction with a developer. The negative photoresist comprises an acryl based monomer wherein an exposed region is not reacted with the developer. The photoresist further comprises a solvent serving to adjust viscosity, a photo active-based compound causing photo-sensing and a resin, and a chemically coupled material.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Thereafter, a diffraction mask <b>280</b> is positioned on the substrate <b>210</b> which is already provided with the photosensitive film <b>270</b> and photo-sensing is performed by light such as ultraviolet rays. In the second embodiment of the present invention, the positive photoresist is used as a photosensitive film <b>270</b>. However, a choice of photoresist for a photosensitive film is not limited to the positive photoresist only. The negative photoresist can be also used as a photosensitive film, and other suitable photosensitive material other than the photoresist can be also used.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">While using the positive photoresist, the first region (A) is completely covered to leave the photoresist as it is (leaving the relatively thick photosensitive film), the second region (B) has a slit pattern to form a relatively thin photoresist, and the third region (C) is removed, thereby forming a diffraction mask <b>280</b> including a slit pattern. The slit pattern serves to reduce strength of light incident on the substrate <b>210</b> by making the incident light diffracted. The slit pattern has a slit interval suitable for diffraction exposure. A slit interval narrower than resolution of an optical source is used for photo-sensing. In the second embodiment of the present invention, the slit pattern is used for the second region (B), but a semi-transmission film can be also used.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As fabrication process proceeds using the diffraction mask <b>280</b>, a first photoresist pattern <b>270</b>A having a first thickness remains at the first region (A), a second photoresist pattern <b>270</b>B having a second thickness thinner than the first photoresist pattern <b>270</b>A remains at the second region (B), and the photoresist is completely removed at the third region (C).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the conductive metal material <b>230</b> and the silicon layer <b>220</b> disposed at the third region (C) where photoresist pattern <b>270</b>A and <b>270</b>B are absent are removed to form the active pattern <b>220</b>B and the data line <b>217</b>. The data line <b>217</b> includes the first data line pattern <b>220</b>A formed of the silicon layer which also forms the active pattern <b>220</b>B, and the second data line pattern <b>230</b>A made of a conductive metal material. The conductive metal material pattern <b>230</b>B remains on the upper portion of the active pattern <b>220</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As a reference, the etching technique is a method for implementing a desired thin film pattern by selectively removing a portion of the thin film formed by photoresist using a physical or chemical reaction. In the etching process, a portion of the thin film where the photoresist pattern is absent is removed. The etching process includes dry etching using gas plasma and wet etching using a chemical solution.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>, a process of removing a portion of the first photoresist pattern <b>270</b>A having the first thickness is performed. To remove a portion of the first photoresist pattern <b>270</b>A, the ashing technique is used. The ashing technique oxidizes the photosensitive film by a gas, for example, oxygen. At this time, the first photoresist pattern <b>270</b>A having the first thickness disposed on the upper portion of the data line <b>217</b> is precisely controlled by the ashing method. A portion of the first photoresist pattern <b>270</b>A is removed to form the third photoresist pattern <b>270</b>A′ having the third thickness while the second photoresist pattern <b>270</b>B disposed on the upper portion of the active pattern <b>220</b>B is completely removed, thereby exposing the conductive metal material pattern <b>230</b>B. Thereafter, the conductive metal material pattern <b>230</b>B is removed using the third photoresist pattern <b>270</b>A′ having the third thickness as a mask, to expose the surface of the active pattern <b>220</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the first insulation film <b>215</b>A is disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>210</b>. After a gate electrode <b>221</b> formed of a conductive metal material is disposed at an upper portion of the active pattern <b>220</b>B which is already provided with the gate insulation film <b>215</b>A (the second masking process), an impurity ion is injected to a certain region of the active pattern <b>220</b>B using the gate electrode <b>221</b> as a mask to form a source region <b>224</b>A and a drain region <b>224</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the second insulation film <b>215</b>B is disposed at the entire surface of the substrate <b>210</b> where the gate electrode <b>221</b> is formed, then, a portion of the second and first insulation films <b>215</b>B and <b>215</b>A is removed through photolithography (the third masking process) to define a plurality of first contact holes <b>240</b>A and a second contact hole <b>240</b> B. The plurality of first contact holes <b>240</b>A exposes a portion of the source/drain regions <b>224</b>A and <b>224</b>B, and a second contact hole <b>240</b>B exposes the second data line pattern. Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, a transparent conductive metal material is disposed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">At this time, a portion of the source electrode <b>222</b> is electrically connected to the data line <b>217</b> within the second contact hole <b>240</b>B and a portion of the drain electrode <b>223</b> is extended into the pixel region to form the pixel electrode <b>218</b>. A source electrode <b>222</b> electrically connects with the source region <b>224</b>A within one of the plurality of first contact holes <b>240</b>A and a drain electrode <b>223</b> electrically connects with the drain region <b>224</b>B within another one of the plurality of first contact holes <b>240</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In this manner, the active pattern <b>220</b>B and the data line <b>217</b> are formed through one-time masking process using the diffraction exposure and ashing technique. Since process of forming a contact hole is eliminated, two masking processes required to form the contact hole can be reduced compared with the fabrication process of the related art. Accordingly, higher production yield and reduction of a fabrication cost are achieved by the simplified fabrication process.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As described, the method for fabricating an LCD in accordance with the present invention has the following advantages. Since the active pattern and the data line are simultaneously patterned, total number of mask process is reduced. Thus, the fabrication process and cost can be reduced. In addition, since the pixel electrode extends directly from a portion of the drain electrode and the pixel electrode does not need a contact hole to electrically connected with the drain electrode, the number of fabrication process and cost are further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the liquid crystal display device and its fabricatng method thereof without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
