<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to mechanical and electronic massage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Both professional massage therapy and massage devices are commonly used for both relaxation and therapeutic purposes. While massage devices offer significant convenience and cost advantages to the consumer when compared to professional massage therapy, there are a number of techniques not only completely unavailable from massage devices, but not available from all therapists.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The technique of compression of the fourth ventricle of the brain (CV4 technique, CV4 Massage, or simply CV4), in which the back of the subject's head is gently, slightly, and slowly compressed by the therapist, promotes relaxation and other physiological benefits, is such a technique.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As only certain therapists are capable of performing CV4, and there is no available device for performing the technique either, few who would benefit from this therapeutic technique have access to it. A device usable to perform CV4, either under the supervision of a therapist not personally able to perform the technique or independently by the subject, would make the benefits of this therapeutic technique available to many more people than it currently is.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This invention is such a device. It is a machine that anyone can use to perform the CV4 technique and receive its benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is a massage device comprising a base housing a motor and control system, a cushioned barrier mounted on the housing with a vertical projection at one end, and two cushioned compression rods linked to the motor, located so that when the user positions their head, the rods are in contact with either side of the occipital bone of the back of the user's head. When the device is activated, the compression arms are drawn together at a low speed, simulating the CV4 technique.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the preferred embodiment, the rods are slightly curved, but they may also be straight. Power in the preferred embodiment is provided by disposable batteries, but it may also be provided by an internal rechargeable battery or direct AC or DC power. Additionally, the device can include a remote for control during its use without needing to access controls on the base and other features, such as a warming element located in the vertical projection, both of which are included in the preferred embodiment.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the device comprises a base <b>1</b>, with vertical projection <b>2</b>, a barrier <b>3</b> mounted on the base, and two compression arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The preferred embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. includes a battery compartment <b>6</b>, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. an infrared heating element <b>7</b>. The remote control <b>8</b>, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. is the preferred control for the device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The base <b>1</b> and barrier <b>3</b> may be composed of nearly any material. The vertical projection <b>2</b>, in the preferred embodiment is plastic with an internally mounted infrared light. The compression arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> may be straight or slightly curved as they are in the preferred embodiment, and are metallic in the preferred embodiment, but may be composed of any material rigid enough to provide the compression necessary to the technique, and cushioned by soft rubber or other material The remote control <b>8</b> of the preferred embodiment has an on switch <b>801</b>, an off switch <b>802</b>, a heat-on switch <b>803</b>, a heat-off switch <b>804</b>, first program switch <b>805</b> and second program switch <b>806</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The motor and drive mechanism coupled to the compression rods may be of any sort capable of providing the necessary force for the technique. The control system can regulate the direction and speed of compression as in the preferred embodiment, an electronic system controlled by a remote. In other embodiments, controls may be incorporated into the base and control various aspects of the performance of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When operated, the user places their head so that their head rests upon the compression arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. The vertical projection <b>2</b> aids in the positioning of the head. The compression arms are drawn together by the motor so as to perform CV4 technique on the back of the user's head, and in the preferred embodiment, the infrared light is activated to provide warmth.</p>
