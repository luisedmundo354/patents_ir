<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/600,279, filed Aug. 10, 2004, the teachings and disclosure of which are hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference thereto.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to a tank level monitoring system, and more particularly, to a tank level monitoring system capable of automatically detecting a delivery event and a drain event of a product to/from the tank.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A tank or similar vessel is often employed at a factory, construction site, warehouse, and the like, to receive, store, and distribute a product. These tanks are adapted to accommodate a variety of different products such as, for example, gasoline, propane, fertilizer, chemicals, fuels, and the like. The tanks that hold these products are often being drained of, and subsequently replenished with, the product both during and outside of normal business hours.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unfortunately, the tanks described above can often be located in remote areas, are not adequately covered by surveillance, watched by owners and employees who use the tanks, and the like. Therefore, the vendors delivering the product to the tanks can either invoice the tank owner for more of the product than is actually delivered (i.e., with gasoline) or invoice for more of the product than is removed (i.e., with waste removal). Currently, such over-invoicing practices are difficult if not impossible to detect unless the tank owner is physically present to check the tank level immediately before and after the filling/drain operation. However, in most circumstances, this direct supervision is not available.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While constant reporting of parameters pertaining to such tanks would be ideal, such is often not practical or commercially feasible. For example, in cellular and satellite metering technology, each set of data that is sent has a cost. Since the typical approach is to read monitor data periodically and then send a report, a data report can be sent quite often (e.g., once an hour), which is expensive, or can be sent infrequently (e.g., once a day), which provides delayed and very limited knowledge about what has happened with monitored parameters. When battery-powered devices are used to monitor tank parameters, the cost noted above is significantly higher. For instance, each packet of data sent uses a portion of battery life and the expense involved in battery replacement in remote locations can be very high.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a system and method that can monitor a product level in a tank, accurately track, and generate an notification signal if a delivery and/or drain of the product occurs would be desirable. Such information may then be used to verify the invoicing of product into or out of the tank. The invention provides such a system and method. These and other advantages of the invention, as well as additional inventive features, will be apparent from the description of the invention provided herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The innovation in Centeron® products is that monitors can check the tank level frequently but report data very seldom unless there is an unexpected change in the tank level. For example, the tank level can be read every fifteen minutes, but scheduled reports can be sent once per day or once per week. After each reading, a set of programs check the level against predefined criteria. An alarm report is sent immediately if any alarm condition is discovered.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The following programs can be activated: The delivery detection, which detects delivery to the tank and reports level before and after delivery immediately after delivery end, the theft detection, which monitors tank level during a guard time (e.g., night, weekends, etc.) and send the alarm report when level was changed during the guard time, and the excessive usage detector, which monitors level between scheduled reports and sends the alarm report if the level change exceeds maximum accepted range. This technology improves the system of providing tank monitoring for battery powered cellular and satellite systems.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect, the invention provides a system for monitoring a level of product in a tank to detect at least one of a delivery and a drain operation. The system comprises a monitor and a data center. The monitor is operably coupled to the tank and adapted to detect the level of product in the tank at a first rate and at a second rate. The data center is in communication with the monitor and adapted to receive a user inputtable threshold level of change. The monitor detects the level of product in the tank at the first rate until the threshold level of change is detected. Then the monitor detects the level of product in the tank at the second rate. The data center generates an alarm signal to indicate that at least one of the delivery and the drain has occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, the invention provides a method of detecting at least one of a delivery and a drain of product in a storage tank. To begin, a product level in the tank is monitored at a first rate until a determination is made that at least one of the delivery or drain of product has begun. The product level in the tank is then monitored at a second rate until a determination is made that the at least one of the delivery or drain of product has ended. Next, information related to an amount of product delivered or drained during the at least one of the delivery or drain of the product is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another aspect, the invention provides a method of detecting at least one of a delivery and a drain of product to and from a storage tank. To begin, a user interface having user selectable options presented thereon is displayed. Thereafter, at least one of a delivery function selection and a user drain function selection is received. A user input threshold level of change for the at least one of the delivery function selection and the user drain function selection is then received. Thereafter, tank level monitoring at a first rate until the at least one of the delivery or drain functions is detected is initiated. Then, tank level monitoring at a second rate until the at least one of the delivery or drain functions has ended is initiated. Next, an alarm to indicate that the at least one selected function occurred is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other aspects, objectives and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">While the invention will be described in connection with certain preferred embodiments, there is no intent to limit it to those embodiments. On the contrary, the intent is to cover all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a system <b>10</b> capable of monitoring a level <b>12</b> of product <b>14</b> in a tank <b>16</b> using a monitor <b>18</b> is illustrated. As will be explained more fully below, in the system <b>10</b> of the present invention a method is provided that advantageously compares the level <b>12</b> of the product <b>14</b> in the tank <b>16</b> to one or more parameters that have been input or keyed in to a computer or data center <b>20</b> by a user or that have been predetermined. This computer or data center <b>20</b> may be a centralized facility which monitors and reports on numerous tank installations, may be a thin client that communicates with such a data center, or may be a stand alone computer at an installation or remote that receives information directly from the tank level monitor <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Once the particular levels at which a user desires to be notified or at which the user wants a particular function to be initiated have been input or preset, the system of the present invention monitors the tank level <b>12</b> in a normal manner. However, once these parameters have been exceeded, the system <b>10</b> initiates the special functionality provided by the method of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the method also generates an alarm signal that may be communicated to the user in a number of different ways as will be discussed more fully below. Through such a system and method, the user of the system and/or the owner of the tank <b>16</b> is well informed about the status of the product, the level of product, and the like even if the user is not in the vicinity of the tank through the special functionality provided by the system and methods of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Such special functionality includes detection and generation of an alarm signal if a delivery or drain of the product is detected as claimed herein, if a theft of the product is detected as claimed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/199,758, entitled THEFT DETECTION USING A LEVEL MONITORING SYSTEM, filed on even date herewith, or if an excessive rise or fall in the level of the product is detected as claimed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/199,982, entitled EXCESSIVE PRODUCT USAGE DETECTION USING A LEVEL MONITORING SYSTEM, filed on even date herewith, the teachings and disclosure of each are hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As in a typical tank level monitoring system, such as the Centeron® tank level monitoring system available from Robertshaw Industrial Products of Maryville, Tenn., the monitor <b>18</b> is operatively coupled to the tank <b>16</b> and designed to monitor the level <b>12</b> of the product <b>14</b> in the tank. The monitor <b>18</b> can be one of a variety of monitors such as, for example, a gauge monitor, a cellular monitor, a satellite communication monitor, a radar monitor, an ultrasonic monitor, a pressure monitor, a float monitor, a capacitance monitor, etc. Communications from and with these monitors <b>18</b> can be via wired communications, wireless radio frequency (RF) communications, cellular, satellite, etc. or a combination of these depending on the installation location, location of the computer/data center <b>20</b>, the user, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition to having the ability to observe the product <b>14</b> in the tank <b>16</b>, the monitor is able to relay information regarding the product to the user, e.g. temperature of the product in the storage tank <b>16</b>. Depending on the communication channel utilized by the particular monitor <b>18</b> and the cost/availability of data transfer over that channel, the monitor <b>18</b> may be required to store data and information regarding the product and perform logic operations between information transmission sessions. In such an embodiment, the monitor <b>18</b> is provided with, for example, a memory, a processing unit, and/or other components such that the monitor is considered to be a “smart” device. One such monitor is the Quicksilver™ cellular monitor, which provides only periodic cellular transmissions that may include information regarding many readings, operation of the tank, etc. based on the cost of cellular communications.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Since the product <b>14</b> in the tank <b>16</b> is typically a bulk commodity or material such as gasoline, propane, a fertilizer, a chemical, a fuel, a waste material, and the like, the monitor <b>18</b> is preferably configured to observe and/or measure such substances or a level <b>12</b> thereof. Additionally, the monitor <b>18</b> is able to measure and/or gauge the level <b>12</b> of the product <b>14</b> whether the level is constant or in flux since the tank <b>16</b> is typically called upon to store, temporarily hold, disperse, and deliver the product as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The computer or data center <b>20</b> can comprise a single computer, a server, a network of computers and/or servers, and the like. In general, the data center <b>20</b> can comprise almost any device that includes a microprocessor or other computing means. The data center <b>20</b> is well suited to make comparisons, store statistics, relay data, display information and/or perform logic calculations relating to the monitoring of tank levels and relaying that information to users. This information may be made available to such users via the Internet or other means. Upon the occurrence of certain provided conditions, the data center <b>20</b> generates an alarm signal (or simply an alarm or signal) that may be displayed or announced locally at the data center <b>20</b>, or may be relayed to a user. Such an alarm is preferably audible, visual, or both. The alarm can be relayed to a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pager, a handheld device, a cellular phone, a Blackberry device, and the like. Further, the alarm can be received as an electronic mail (e-mail) message sent over the Internet, as a text message sent via the short mail service (SMS), as a picture or image, as a call to a cell phone, and/or as video that is either delayed or sent in real-time.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the data center <b>20</b> provides and/or displays a user interface <b>22</b> such as a graphical user interface (GUI). As well known by those skilled in the art, the GUI often includes such features as dropdown menus, check boxes, icons, pointing devices, and inputtable fields. The user interface <b>22</b> provides a simple, user friendly platform for entering data and information into, for example, the data center <b>20</b>, and for displaying such information for a human user.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The interface <b>22</b> generated by the system of the present invention and depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> comprises a window <b>24</b> or “pop up” box under an Alarms tab <b>28</b>. The complete user interface window <b>24</b> includes a plurality of tabs <b>26</b> that may be selected to bring up or display other functional windows. In the disclosed illustration, the alarm tab <b>28</b> has been selected from the plurality of tabs <b>26</b> and, therefore, information pertaining to “alarms” is displayed for viewing and/or manipulation by a user of the data center <b>20</b> or remotely via, e.g., a thin client interface to the data center <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The alarm tab <b>28</b> displays one or more categories of alarms. In one embodiment of the system of the present invention, the alarm tab <b>28</b> is partitioned to separately display a delivery/drain alarm functionality section <b>30</b>, a theft alarm functionality section <b>32</b>, and an excessive usage alarm functionality section <b>34</b>. As will be explained more fully below, if the conditions of any of these alarms are met and/or violated and that particular alarm has been enabled, an alarm signal is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The delivery/drain alarm section <b>30</b> comprises a detect delivery selection icon <b>36</b>, a detect drain selection icon <b>38</b>, a level change threshold entry window <b>40</b>, an alarm status indicator <b>42</b>, and an enable alarm check box <b>44</b>. The detect delivery selection icon <b>36</b> and the detect drain selection icon <b>38</b> can be selected or deselected (e.g., by clicking a mouse over the icon) based on the desire of the user and/or customer. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the detect delivery selection icon <b>36</b> shows that the detect delivery option has been selected as evidenced by the indicia (e.g., black dot) within the selection icon. Conversely, the detect drain selection icon <b>38</b> shows that the detect drain option has not been selected as evidenced by the lack of any indicia within the selection icon.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The level change threshold entry window <b>40</b> allows a user of the system <b>10</b> to enter a threshold level of change <b>46</b> at which the Delivery/Drain alarm will be generated. The threshold level of change <b>46</b> can be keyed into the threshold entry window <b>40</b>, selected from a list of choices and/or recommendations in a menu, may be preset by the system and the like. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the threshold level of change <b>46</b> that has been input into the user interface <b>22</b> by a user or preset is “5.0” inches, although the units can be varied depending on the preference of the user of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The threshold level of change <b>46</b> is a figure that represents an amount of change that is tolerable for a given property of the product <b>14</b> in the tank <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The threshold level of change <b>46</b> displayed in the box <b>40</b> can have a variety of different units depending on the particular monitor <b>18</b> used by the system <b>10</b>. For example, the threshold level of change <b>46</b> might represent inches when a gauge monitor is used, a pressure when a pressure monitor is used, and the like. Also, the threshold level of change <b>46</b> can be represented in English and/or metric units.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The alarm status indicator <b>42</b> provides a visual representation regarding the condition of the alarm signal. For example, if the alarm signal has been triggered, the status indicator <b>42</b> may illuminate and provide other visual indications of an alarm, e.g. it may illuminate red and flash. In contrast, if the alarm signal has not been generated, the status indicator <b>42</b> may provide such a visual indication, e.g. be green and steady.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The enable alarm check box <b>44</b> generally provides a user with an “on/off” switch for the delivery/drain alarm <b>30</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the indicia (e.g., check mark) is displayed in the alarm check box <b>44</b>, the alarm is active. However, if the enable alarm check box <b>44</b> does not contain the indicia, the alarm <b>30</b> has been deactivated. As with the other check boxes in general, the enable alarm check box <b>30</b> can be toggled between “on” and “off” with a click of a mouse or a simple keyboard command.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The theft alarm section <b>32</b> comprises a temporal selection factors that allow a user to select different parameters for different days of the week. In the displayed embodiment, the theft alarm section <b>32</b> provides a Monday/Friday (normal work week) menu <b>48</b>, a Saturday menu <b>50</b>, and a Sunday menu <b>52</b> under an activation time category <b>54</b>, an all days menu <b>56</b> under a deactivation time category <b>58</b>, a level change threshold entry window <b>60</b>, an alarm status indicator <b>62</b>, and an enable alarm check box. <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The Monday/Friday menu <b>48</b>, the Saturday menu <b>50</b>, and the Sunday menu <b>52</b> each provide a list of user selectable activation times <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> that dictate a schedule of activation for the theft alarm <b>32</b>. This activation time would generally correspond to the close of business for that day after which product usage from the tank could be considered to be a result of theft. Similarly, the all days menu <b>56</b> provides a list of user selectable deactivation times <b>72</b> that dictate a schedule of deactivation for the theft alarm <b>30</b>, typically corresponding to the start of business. The times <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> in the menus <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>56</b> are formatted in either standard time (12 hour) and/or military time (24 hour) and are preferably incremented to include hours and minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The activation and deactivation times <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> in the activation and deactivation time categories <b>54</b>, <b>58</b> can be configured and/or selected such that the product <b>14</b> and product level <b>12</b> in the tank <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is observed or under surveillance at various times during a twenty-four hour period and during the week. As such, the theft alarm <b>32</b> is, for example, activated after normal business hours, deactivated during normal business hours, and then activated again after the business day is done. In other embodiments, the theft alarm <b>32</b> can be activated and deactivated at different times for each day of the week and/or weekend.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although the activation time category <b>54</b> is illustrated to include three menus <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, and the deactivation time category <b>58</b> is illustrated to include one menu <b>56</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, other arrangements can be used. For instance, the activation time category <b>54</b> can include menus for each day of the week, the deactivation time category <b>58</b> could be partitioned into two menus representing weekdays and weekends, or partitioned to include menus for each day of the week, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Similar to above, the level change threshold entry window <b>60</b> allows a user of the system <b>10</b> to enter a threshold level of change <b>74</b> at which the theft alarm functionality may be triggered. The threshold level of change <b>74</b> can be keyed into the threshold box <b>60</b>, selected from a list of choices and/or recommendations in a menu, preprogrammed into the system and the like. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the threshold level of change <b>74</b> that has been input into the user interface <b>22</b> by a user is “2.4” inches.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Again, the threshold level of change <b>74</b> is a figure that represents an amount of change that is tolerable for a given property of the product <b>14</b> in the tank <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The threshold level of change <b>74</b> displayed in the box <b>60</b> can have a variety of different units depending on the particular monitor <b>18</b> used by the system <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The excessive usage alarm section <b>34</b> comprises a check level rise check box <b>76</b>, a check level drop check box <b>78</b>, a level change threshold entry window <b>80</b>, an alarm status indicator <b>82</b>, and an alarm enable check box <b>84</b>. The check level rise check box <b>76</b> and the check level drop check box <b>78</b> can be selected or deselected based on the desire of the user. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each of the boxes <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> indicates that the check level rise and check level drop options have been selected as evidenced by the indicia (e.g., check mark) within the check box. By selectively choosing one or both of the check boxes <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, (e.g., by clicking with a mouse), the check level rise and check level drop options can be selected or deselected.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Similar to above, the level change threshold entry window <b>80</b> allows a user of the system <b>10</b> to enter a threshold level of change <b>86</b> (i.e., maximum change between reports) at which the excessive usage alarm functionality is triggered.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment of the system of the present invention, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the system <b>10</b> further comprises a device <b>88</b> (e.g., a computer, a monitor and a keyboard) that may interface with the data center <b>20</b> as a “thin client”. The thin client <b>88</b> communicates with the data center <b>20</b> via, e.g., the Internet to set and/or monitor the information provided thereby. As such, the thin client <b>88</b> displays, via the user interface <b>22</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the data stored in the data center <b>20</b> and permits the user to manipulate and/or view that data. The thin client <b>88</b> is typically remotely located with respect to the data center <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As illustrated in this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the system <b>10</b> may include a controller <b>90</b> depending on the type of tank level monitoring system is used. The controller <b>90</b> can be any one of the controllers commercially available from Robertshaw Industrial Products of Maryville, Tenn. In general, the controller <b>90</b> manages the flow of information from the monitor <b>18</b> to the data center <b>20</b>. In other words, the controller <b>90</b> acts an intermediary device capable of receiving information from the monitor <b>18</b>, wirelessly or via wired communication, and then relaying that signal to the data center <b>20</b> over a communications link <b>92</b>. This communications link <b>92</b> may be wired or wireless, and may include combinations of each, e.g. satellite link to a communications center that relays the information to the data center <b>20</b> via a telephone or other land line, etc. As illustrated, the controller <b>90</b> is capable of communicating with a plurality of monitors <b>18</b>, preferably accommodating each of the monitors simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As illustrated in this exemplary embodiment of the system of the present invention, the system <b>10</b> also includes a remote notification device <b>94</b>. The remote notification device <b>94</b> is, for example, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pager, a handheld device, a cellular phone, a Blackberry device, and the like. The device <b>94</b> is adapted to communicate (e.g., receive and send information, synchronize with) with the data center <b>20</b> and/or with the computer <b>88</b>. Since the device <b>94</b> is not tethered to any other piece of equipment and communicates wirelessly, the device is often remotely located relative to one or more of the data center <b>20</b>, the controller <b>90</b>, the monitor <b>18</b>, and the tank <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In those embodiments employing the remote notification device <b>94</b> and the thin client <b>88</b>, information pertaining to the monitor <b>18</b>, the tank <b>16</b>, the product <b>14</b>, the level of product <b>12</b>, as well as the alarm signals, can be transmitted to the device. The information can arrive and be received by the device <b>94</b> and the thin client <b>88</b> as an electronic mail (e-mail) message sent over the Internet, as a text message sent via the short mail service (SMS), as a picture or image, an audible alarm or message sent to the cell phone and/or as video that is either delayed or sent in real-time. As such, the user of the device <b>94</b> and/or the thin client <b>88</b> is able to be constantly appraised of events related to the tank <b>16</b>, product level <b>14</b> and/or product <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, the delivery drain alarm functionality and method of the present invention will be described. As indicated in the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, once the user starts <b>96</b> the process, the user chooses <b>98</b> either or both of the delivery detection and drain detection functions by selecting the appropriate detect delivery check box <b>36</b> and detect drain check box <b>38</b> on the user interface <b>22</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Thereafter, the user inputs <b>100</b> a threshold level of change <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), either at the data center <b>20</b> and/or by using the controller <b>90</b>, the thin client <b>88</b>, and/or the remote notification device <b>94</b>. The threshold level of change <b>46</b> can be input by keying in the data, selecting the level from a drop down menu including a list of choices, and the like. If not already done, the user next activates the delivery/drain alarm <b>102</b> using the enable check box <b>44</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">With the deliver/drain alarm <b>30</b> enabled, the monitor <b>18</b> begins to take product level readings <b>104</b> at a first rate illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as a regular measurement rate <b>106</b>. The first rate <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is determined by the user and/or determined by the data center <b>20</b>. After a reading <b>108</b> is taken, the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> calculates a difference between a new reading <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and the previous reading <b>108</b> as illustrated by block <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. That difference <b>110</b> is then compared at step <b>114</b> to the threshold level of change set in window <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. If the difference <b>110</b> has not reached and/or exceeded the threshold level of change, the monitor continues to take readings <b>104</b> as normal at the first rate. However, if the difference has reached and/or exceeded the threshold level of change, the previous reading is stored at step <b>118</b>. The previous reading stored by step <b>118</b> is preferably the reading <b>120</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that immediately precedes the last reading <b>122</b> taken by the monitor when the difference first reached and/or exceeded the threshold level of change.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, when the difference <b>116</b> in the readings has first reached and/or exceeded the threshold level of change, the monitor stores and/or records the reading <b>120</b> of the level of the product in the tank. In another embodiment, the monitor relays the reading <b>120</b> to the data center and, thereafter, the data center stores the reading.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">After the reading <b>120</b> has been stored at step <b>118</b>, the monitor begins to taking readings at step <b>124</b> at a second rate illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as rate <b>126</b>. Preferably, the second rate <b>126</b> provides readings more frequently than the first rate <b>106</b>. After the monitor has begun taking readings at the second rate <b>126</b>, a difference between individual readings (e.g., <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>) is calculated at step <b>128</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). When the difference of step <b>128</b> is no longer more than the threshold level of change or is no longer changing in the same direction (e.g. no longer increasing in a fuel storage tank or no longer decreasing in a waste storage tank) for a predetermined number of readings <b>136</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), this indicates that the fill or drain operation has been completed. That is, in the system illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, once the level stops increasing, it is determined that the fill operation has been completed. A final reading <b>138</b> of the level is then taken and recorded. In one embodiment, the monitor stores the final reading <b>138</b>. In another embodiment, the monitor relays the final reading <b>138</b> to the data center and, thereafter, the data center stores <b>140</b> the final reading. In the embodiment where the monitor has stored the start and final readings <b>120</b>, <b>138</b>, the monitor relays the start and final readings to the data center.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">After the data center <b>20</b> has received the relayed readings <b>120</b>, <b>138</b>, the data center automatically generates an alarm signal at step <b>142</b> that is audible, visual, or both to indicate to the user that a delivery or a drain operation has been accomplished. Alternatively, the alarm signal generated by step <b>142</b> may occur after step <b>114</b> has determined that a drain or fill operation has begun. In one embodiment, the alarm signal <b>142</b> includes the initial and final readings <b>120</b>, <b>138</b> taken by the monitor <b>18</b>. By generating the alarm signal <b>142</b>, the data center <b>20</b> has indicated to the user that the monitor <b>18</b> has detected either a drain or a delivery of the product <b>14</b>. The alarm function then resumes <b>144</b> by once again taking readings <b>104</b> at the first rate <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Several drain and delivery events can be detected during continued operation of the system <b>10</b>. In other words, the monitor <b>18</b>, data center <b>20</b>, and user can work together to continuously and/or continually monitor the level <b>12</b> of product <b>14</b> in the tank <b>16</b>. Thus, no matter what time of the day it is and what day of the week it is, the system <b>10</b> permits the tank <b>16</b> to be adequately monitored to detect and record drain and delivery events to prevent fraudulent invoicing for such operations.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>, the theft alarm function <b>32</b> method starts <b>146</b> and performs as follows. First, the desired activation times <b>54</b> are selected at step <b>148</b> by a user from one or more of the Monday/Friday menu <b>48</b>, the Saturday menu <b>50</b>, and the Sunday menu <b>52</b> on the user interface <b>22</b>. Similarly, the desired deactivation time <b>58</b> is selected from the all days menu <b>56</b>. The threshold level of change <b>74</b> is then input at step <b>150</b> by the user into the threshold level change box <b>60</b> via the user interface <b>22</b>. If not already done, the user next activates <b>152</b> the theft alarm <b>32</b> using the enable check box <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With the theft alarm enabled, it is determined <b>154</b> if the current time (i.e., present time) is between one of the activation times <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> and the deactivation time <b>72</b>. If the current time is not after one of the activation times <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> and before the deactivation time <b>72</b>, the level <b>12</b> of the product <b>14</b> in the tank <b>16</b> is not monitored <b>156</b> by the monitor <b>18</b> for purposes of the theft alarm function. In other words, the current time relates to a normal working period when the tank level is expected to be reduced as product is used during the working day.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">If the current time is after one of the activation times <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> and before the deactivation time <b>72</b>, the level <b>12</b> of the product <b>14</b> in the tank <b>16</b> is monitored <b>158</b> by the monitor <b>18</b> for theft detection. While the level <b>12</b> of the product <b>14</b> is being monitored <b>158</b>, it is determined at step <b>160</b> if a change in the level <b>12</b> of product <b>14</b> in the tank <b>16</b> has reached and/or exceeded the threshold level of change <b>74</b> set by the user. If the change in the level has not reached and/or exceeded the threshold level of change <b>74</b>, and if the current time <b>154</b> is still between one of the activation times <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> and the deactivation time <b>72</b>, the monitor <b>18</b> simply continues to monitor <b>158</b> the level <b>14</b> of product <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If, however, the change in the level <b>14</b> has reached and/or exceeded the threshold level of change <b>74</b>, an alarm signal is generated at step <b>162</b> to notify the user that a theft of the product <b>14</b> has occurred or is occurring. This is particularly beneficial since activation of the alarm <b>32</b> permits the product <b>14</b> in the tank <b>16</b> to be monitored and/or under surveillance outside of normal business hours. The monitor <b>18</b> keeps watch of the product <b>14</b> when that product does not normally get used.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Typically, the data center <b>20</b> is the component within the system <b>10</b> that generates the alarm signal <b>162</b>. In such an embodiment, prior to the alarm being generated <b>162</b>, the monitor <b>18</b> relays the fact that the change in the level <b>14</b> has reached and/or exceeded the threshold level of change <b>74</b> to the data center <b>20</b>. Thereafter, the data center <b>20</b> generates the alarm signal <b>162</b> and, in some cases, relays the change information and/or the alarm signal to the thin client <b>88</b> and the remote notification device <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another embodiment, the monitor <b>18</b> relays the reached and/or exceeded threshold information to the controller <b>90</b>. In such an embodiment, the controller <b>90</b> can generate the alarm signal <b>162</b> and then relay the information to the data center <b>20</b>. In other embodiments, the controller <b>90</b> relays the information to the data center <b>20</b> and/or the thin client <b>88</b> and the remote notification device <b>94</b> without having generated the alarm. In those instances, the data center <b>20</b> generates the alarm and relays the alarm signal, with or without the information, to one or more of the thin client <b>88</b> and the remote notification device <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Since several of the devices in the system <b>10</b> are able to generate the alarm signal, and the other devices are able to relay that signal, a user of the theft alarm <b>32</b> is quickly and conveniently notified if a theft of the product occurs or is occurring. This is true even if the user of the system <b>10</b> is remotely located with respect to the tank <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</figref>, the excessive usage alarm function <b>34</b> method starts <b>164</b> and performs as follows. First, the user selects at step <b>166</b> either or both of the check level rise check box <b>76</b> and the check level drop check box <b>78</b> on the user interface <b>22</b>. Thereafter, the user inputs <b>168</b> and/or keys in the level change threshold <b>86</b> desired. If not already done, the user next activates <b>170</b> the excessive usage alarm <b>34</b> using the enable check box <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">With the excessive usage alarm enabled, the monitor <b>18</b> takes an initial reading <b>172</b> of the level <b>12</b> of the product <b>14</b> in the tank <b>16</b>. In-one embodiment, the initial reading is stored by the monitor <b>18</b>. A predetermined amount of time after the initial reading has been taken, as determined by the normal scheduling of the monitor, the monitor <b>18</b> takes a later reading <b>174</b> of the level <b>12</b> of product <b>14</b> in the tank <b>16</b>. Again, in one embodiment, the monitor stores that reading. With the two readings recorded and/or stored, the monitor <b>18</b> then compares <b>176</b> the initial reading to the later reading. If the initial reading and the later reading differ by at least the threshold level of change <b>86</b> input by the user, an alarm signal is generated <b>178</b>. This alarm signal can be produced by the monitor <b>18</b> itself or, more preferably, created by the data center <b>20</b>. In the embodiment where the data center <b>20</b> generates the alarm signal, the monitor <b>18</b> relays the initial reading, the current reading, and/or the comparison information to the data center as soon as it is determined that the excessive usage has occurred. In embodiments that report level information only periodically, e.g. in embodiments using a cellular modem, this will only result in one additional report outside of the scheduled reports, yet provide immediate indication of the excessive usage. This allows the device to report less frequently (saving cost), yet still capture excessive level changes quickly and automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">If the initial reading and the later reading do not differ by more than the threshold level of change, the initial reading is replaced <b>180</b> by the most recently taken later reading and the monitor <b>18</b> takes a “new” later reading after another period of time has elapsed. Thereafter, the initial reading (which is the “old” later reading) and the “new” later reading are compared <b>176</b> to each other and, if the difference between the readings has reached or has exceeded the threshold level of change, the alarm signal is generated <b>178</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment, the monitor <b>18</b> takes an initial reading of the level <b>12</b> of the product <b>14</b> in the tank <b>16</b> and immediately relays the initial reading information to the data center <b>20</b>. The data center <b>20</b> then stores that initial reading. After a predetermined amount of time has elapsed (e.g., per a predetermined schedule), the monitor <b>18</b> takes a later reading of the level <b>12</b> of the product <b>14</b> in the tank <b>16</b> and immediately relays the later level reading to the data center <b>20</b>. With the two readings recorded and/or stored, the data center <b>20</b> compares the initial reading to the later reading. If the initial reading and the further reading differ by more than the threshold level of change input by the user, an alarm signal is generated by the data center <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Using the excessive usage alarm <b>34</b>, should a leak in the tank <b>16</b> and/or an unexpectedly high demand for product occur, a user is promptly notified by an alarm signal. Advantageously, the alarm signal can be relayed and/or transmitted to locations remote from the tank <b>16</b>. Therefore, even though a user of the system <b>10</b> is remotely located relative to the tank <b>16</b>, the user is advised if too much product <b>14</b> is being or has been used.</p>
