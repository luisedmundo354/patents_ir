No. 10/783,480 entitled âSingle-Frequency Narrow Linewidth 2 Î¼m Fiber Laserâ filed on Feb. 19, 2004 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,106,762 on Sep. 12, 2006, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates to glasses and fibers for laser applications and more specifically to Thulium-doped heavy metal oxide glasses for near 2 Î¼m lasers with high quantum efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2 Î¼m lasers are highly transmissive in air, relatively eye-safe, and highly absorptive in many natural substances such as organic tissue and water. Applications such as LIDAR, range finder, materials processing, and biomedical require low cost, robust and efficient 2 Î¼m, e.g. typically 1.7-2.1 Î¼m, lasers. As used herein the term â2 Î¼mâ laser refers to laser emission across the range of 1.7-2.1 Î¼m.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Most 2 Î¼m Thulium doped lasers use a crystalline host material. Crystalline materials exhibit good mechanical strength and chemical durability and through a phenomenon known as âcross-relaxationâ exhibit high quantum efficiency. Unfortunately crystalline materials are expensive and cannot be pulled into fibers, hence can only be used for free space solid-state lasers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Glass hosts, namely silica and fluoride glass, which can be pulled into fiber, have been developed for 2 Î¼m fiber lasers. Unfortunately, neither glass is a good host for Thulium doped laser applications. Silica glass has high phonon energy, approximately 1100 cm<sup>â1</sup>, and can only support limited doping concentrations, and thus exhibits poor quantum efficiency. Although fluoride exhibits low phonon energy of about 700 cm<sup>â1 </sup>and accept high rare-earth doping concentrations, fluoride glass is physically weak and chemically not durable, which limits the output power of the laser and seriously restricts practical application.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a host for highly efficient Thulium doped 2 Î¼m oxide glass and fiber lasers.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This is accomplished with a heavy metal oxide glass host selected from germanate, tellurite and bismuth oxide glasses. The host is heavily doped with Thulium ions, suitably at least 2Ã10<sup>20 </sup>ions/cm<sup>3</sup>, and preferably at least 4Ã10<sup>20 </sup>ions/cm<sup>3</sup>. Most typically, the Thulium ions will be introduced into the host glass as Thulium oxide of at least 2 wt. %, and preferably at least 4 wt. % to achieve the necessary ion concentrations and increase quantum efficiency. The concentration of Thulium ions is high enough that energy transferred by the phenomenon of cross-relaxation will enhance laser emission at 2 Î¼m and suppress emission at 1.5 Î¼m so that 2 Î¼m emission is dominant. The quantum efficiency is preferably at least 100%, and most preferably at least 150%.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, a germanate glass host comprises germanium oxide (GeO<sub>2</sub>) from 30% to 90% by weight, and preferably 40% to 80% by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a second embodiment, a tellurite glass host comprises tellurite oxide (TeO<sub>2</sub>) from 30% to 90% by weight, and preferably 40% to 80% by weight.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention provides a host for highly efficient Thulium doped 2 Î¼m oxide glass and fiber lasers.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a simplified energy level diagram <b>10</b> of triply ionized Thulium ions (Tm<sup>3+</sup>). 2 Î¼m laser oscillation of Thulium ions originates from <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub>-<sup>3</sup>H<sub>6 </sub>transition. Typically Thulium ions are excited from a <sup>3</sup>H<sub>6 </sub>level (ground state) to a <sup>3</sup>H<sub>4 </sub>level by a pump beam, suitably 790 nm pump, and then decay to a <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>level. It was reported in crystalline materials that the so-called cross-relaxation phenomenon can increase the quantum efficiency significantly. Thulium cross-relaxation is a non-radiative process in which an excited Thulium in the <sup>3</sup>H<sub>4 </sub>state (energy level around 12900 cm<sup>â1</sup>) decays to the <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>state (energy level around 6000 cm<sup>â1</sup>) and a neighboring ground-state Thulium ion is promoted to the <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>level, accompanied by the emission of phonons [L Esterowitz <i>Optical Engineering, Vol. </i>29(6), 1990]. The advantage of this cross-relaxation process is that a single Thulium ion excited to the <sup>3</sup>H<sub>4 </sub>level generates two Thulium ions in the <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>upper laser level. The quantum efficiency of pumping into the <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>state is nearly 200%. The probability of Tm<sup>3+</sup> cross relaxation is negligible for concentrations less than approximately 2 wt % but approaches unity for concentrations greater than approximately 5 wt % in Tm<sup>3+</sup> doped crystals.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with the present invention, heavy metal oxide glasses and fibers are doped with a high concentration of Thulium ions. Heavy metal oxide glasses such as germanate, tellurite and bismuth oxide exhibit low phonon energy thereby providing a high quantum efficiency of <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>level of Thulium ions. Critically, Thulium can be highly doped into these heavy metal oxide glasses. At these high dopant concentrations, the cross-relaxation phenomenon dramatically improves the quantum efficiency. For instance, germanate glass exhibits phonon energy of 900 cm<sup>â1</sup>, which is much lower than silica glass of 1100 cm<sup>â1</sup>. The doping concentration of Thulium ions in germanate glass can be up to 15 weight percent. In addition to high quantum efficiency, these glasses exhibit good mechanical properties and can be pulled into fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a heavy metal oxide glass host <b>12</b> selected from germanate glass <b>14</b>, tellurite glass <b>16</b> and bismuth glass <b>18</b> is heavily doped with Thulium ions <b>20</b>, suitably at least 2Ã10<sup>20 </sup>ions/cm<sup>3</sup>, and preferably at least 4Ã10<sup>20 </sup>ions/cm<sup>3 </sup>to increase quantum efficiency. The concentration of Thulium ions is high enough that most energy will be transferred to the lasing up-level of <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>by cross-relaxation energy transfer (<sup>3</sup>H<sub>4</sub>, <sup>3</sup>H<sub>6</sub>â<sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub>, <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub>) instead of radiative decay (<sup>3</sup>H<sub>4</sub>â<sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub>) thereby enhancing laser emission at 2 Î¼m and suppressing emission at 1.5 Î¼m so that 2 Î¼m emission is dominant. The quantum efficiency is preferably at least 100%, and most preferably at least 150%. Thulium ions can be introduced into glasses and fibers with Thulium oxide, Thulium fluoride or other format.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The fluorescence properties of Thulium ions in the Thulium doped germanate glasses <b>26</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Two broad emission bands <b>30</b> at 1.49 Î¼m and <b>32</b> at 1.8 Î¼m in the fluorescence spectra <b>34</b> are due to <sup>3</sup>H<sub>4</sub>â<sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>transition and <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub>â<sup>3</sup>H<sub>6 </sub>transition, respectively. To illustrate the relationship between doping concentration and relative fluorescence intensity of the â1.5 Î¼mâ and â2 Î¼mâ emission bands, the fluorescence spectra <b>34</b> at different doping concentrations from 0.5 to 10 wt. % were scaled so that the emission intensity at 1.8 Î¼m was normalized to 1.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At low dopant concentrations, such as 0.5 wt %, the normalized emission intensity <b>36</b> of 1.49 Î¼m band is much stronger than the normalized emission intensity <b>38</b> of 1.8 Î¼m band. At high dopant concentrations, especially higher than 2 wt %, the normalized emission intensity <b>38</b> of the 1.8 Î¼m band is stronger than the normalized emission intensity <b>40</b> of the 1.49 Î¼m band. Above 4 wt %, the 1.8 Î¼m band emission dominates the fluorescence spectrum and the emission intensity <b>42</b> of the 1.49 Î¼m band is highly suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At low concentrations, the emission intensity of the 1.49 Î¼m band is much stronger than the emission intensity of 1.8 Î¼m band because of the high rate of non-radiative decay caused by high phonon energy. A high doping concentration enhances the <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub>â<sup>3</sup>H<sub>6 </sub>transition (1.8 Î¼m) while suppressing the <sup>3</sup>H<sub>4</sub>â<sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>transition (1.47 Î¼m). The reason for this phenomenon is cross-relaxation: One Tm<sup>3+</sup> ion at energy level of <sup>3</sup>H<sub>4</sub>, jumps to the lower level of <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub>, by exciting another Tm<sup>3+</sup> ion from the level of <sup>3</sup>H<sub>6 </sub>to the level of 3F<sub>4 </sub>and generating one or two phonons. So two Tm<sup>3+</sup> ions will be excited to the upper laser level by absorbing one pumping photon, which makes Tm<sup>3+</sup> (under high concentration circumstance) have high quantum efficiency at 2 Î¼m emission region.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Since cross-relaxation transfer process is based on electric multipolar interaction mechanism, the distance between the Tm<sup>3+</sup> ions (i.e. doping concentration) is very critical. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows that there was almost no fluorescence of the <sup>3</sup>H<sub>4</sub>â<sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>transition, when the doping concentration was higher than 4 wt %. That means the rate of cross-relaxation is much bigger than the spontaneous emission rate of <sup>3</sup>H<sub>4</sub>â<sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>transition at high Tm<sup>3+</sup> doping level. So when the Tm<sup>3+</sup> doping level is higher than 4%, the cross-relaxation becomes the dominant channel to populate the upper level of a 2 Î¼m laser (<sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub>) and the pumping efficiency is significantly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the lifetime <b>50</b> of the <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>level of Tm<sup>3+</sup> drops from 4.77 ms to 0.4 ms with the increase of doping concentration from 0.5 wt. % to 10 wt. %. Lifetime is defined as the time required for the fluorescence to decrease to 1/e of its initial intensity. One reason is that when the doping concentration increases, reverse energy transfer (<sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub>, <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub>â<sup>3</sup>H<sub>4</sub>, <sup>3</sup>H<sub>6</sub>) will occur. When two excited Tm<sup>3+</sup> ions at <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>level are close enough, they will interact. One ion will nonradiatively decay to the ground state while the other ion will be excited to the <sup>3</sup>H<sub>4 </sub>level. Since this is a phonon-absorbing energy transfer process, its probability is much lesser than the probability of cross-relaxation which is a phonon-emitting process, because</p>

where n is the Bose-Einstein occupation number, n+1 and n are the probability of generating one phonon and absorbing one phonon. Another reason is that the emigration between ions at <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>level results in energy transfer to the glass defect. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows that for low doping concentrations (less than 1%), the lifetime of <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4 </sub>is only slightly reduced with increased doping. Therefore, at low doping levels both the glass defect and reverse energy transfer can be neglected. As the doping level continues to increase beyond 1%, the lifetime drops sharply. After the doping concentration is larger than 4%, the slope of decreasing the lifetime becomes smaller.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Thulium Doped 2 Î¼m Fiber Laser</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a 2 Î¼m fiber laser <b>60</b> includes a gain fiber <b>62</b>, single or multi mode, formed of a heavy metal oxide glass (germanate, tellurite, bismuth) host doped with triply ionized thulium oxide. Reflectors <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> are positioned at opposite ends of gain fiber <b>62</b> to form a resonant cavity that provides the feedback necessary to sustain laser emission <b>67</b>. A free space laser can be similarly configured using a block of Tm-doped heavy metal oxide glass and free space reflectors.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The reflectors may be formed by coating the ends of fibers <b>68</b>,<b>70</b> and butt-coupling them to gain fiber <b>62</b>, as shown, or by using coated mirrors or fiber gratings in sections of passive fiber butt coupled or fused to the ends of gain fiber <b>62</b>. The reflectivity of reflector <b>64</b> should be as close to 100% as possible to increase the efficiency of the laser. The reflectivity of reflector <b>66</b> is less than 100%, suitably 2-99% depending upon the pump power and target output power, such that power can be extracted from the cavity. Laser emission <b>67</b> can be either single and multi-transverse mode or single and multi-longitudinal mode depending upon the cavity design, e.g. length and gratings.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A pump <b>72</b>, e.g. a single-mode or multi-mode laser diode, illuminates gain fiber <b>62</b> at a wavelength, typically 800 nm, within the absorption band. The pump may be end-coupled, as shown, side-coupled or coupled at the output end via a WDM. The absorption band of triply ionized thulium occurs from 750 to 820 nm. Pumping of the doped glass populates the thulium upper level creating a population inversion. Spontaneous emission catalyzes the stimulated emission of the thulium ions in the upper level over a range of 1800 to 2000 nm. This emission is enhanced by the cross-relaxation effect as described above. The emission peak of thulium occurs at a wavelength of approximately 1800 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The output slope characteristic <b>80</b> (output power vs. absorbed pump power) for a 2 Î¼m fiber laser is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In this particular example, the gain fiber was a 2 cm long double-clad fiber having a core diameter of 7 Î¼m designed for use with a commercially available multi-mode 804 nm diode pump laser. The core host and inner cladding glasses were similar in composition to the germanate glasses listed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The core host was doped with 4 wt. % thulium-oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The inner cladding, which is matched to the core glass with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.15 confines the 2 Î¼m laser in the core. The outer cladding, which is matched to the inner cladding with a high NA, confines the pump laser in the inner cladding. A silicate glass was used as the outer cladding glass due to its low cost, low refractive index and better chemical and thermal stabilities. The fluorescence lifetime of the transition <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub>-<sup>3</sup>H<sub>6 </sub>(1.87 Î¼m) was measured to be 1.6 ms.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Two dielectric coated SMF-28 silica fibers were used as mirrors to form the fiber laser cavity. The reflectivities of the mirrors were 96.4% (high reflectivity) and 82% (partial reflectivity, output coupler), respectively, around 1.9 Î¼m. The transmission of the HR mirror at the pumping wavelength is 93.9%. The propagation loss of the fiber was measured to be 0.05 dB/cm. The coupling loss between the Thulium doped fiber and coated SMF-28 was measured as 0.79 dB.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the threshold absorbed power <b>82</b> was about 7.6 mW, which is quite low due to the high reflectivity of both cavity mirrors. The slope efficiency with respect to the absorbed pump power was 14.1%, which is quite high considering the high reflectivity of the output coupler.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Koechaner's model for slope efficiency of 3-level laser systems was used to calculated the quantum efficiency of the material,</p>

Ï is the slope efficiency. Î·<sub>Q </sub>is the quantum efficiency, defined as number of emission photons generated by one pump laser photon. Î»<sub>pump</sub>, Î»<sub>Laser </sub>are the wavelength of the pump and laser. 2Î±l is used to describe the round trip loss of the laser cavity except for loss of two cavity mirrors. R<sub>HR</sub>, R<sub>PR </sub>are the reflectivity of the cavity mirror. In this experiment, both the HR mirror and PR mirror were positioned very close to the end of the gain fiber, so the only loss of the cavity results from the propagation loss, which is 0.054 dB/cm.
</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to Koechaner's model, the calculated value of quantum efficiency of the fiber laser is 170%, which means every absorbed pump photon will generate 1.7 emission photons. In a cross-relaxation process, the theoretical maximum quantum efficiency is 200% instead of the traditional value of 100%. Such a high quantum efficiency of 170% is due to the high cross-relaxation energy transfer rate, which primarily depends on the doping concentration of Tm<sup>3+</sup> ions, and is the highest quantum efficiency reported in Tm<sup>3+</sup>-doped glasses. Another advantage of cross-relaxation is that the phenomenon does not generate a lot of phonons compared with other non-radiative decay processes. This is a very important feature especially for high power applications, in which thermal problems become the bottleneck on laser performance.</p>
