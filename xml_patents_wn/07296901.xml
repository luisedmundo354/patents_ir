<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a projection display, and more particularly to a projection display of the type that can project a viewing pupil having a limited area for the purpose of viewing a bright projected image.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The applicant has already filed patent applications concerning the inventions set forth in patent publications 1, 2, 3 or the like to come up with a 2D projection display, a 3D projection display, a projection display that enables a plurality of viewers to view separate projected images, or the like, each of which comprises a single or plural display devices, a single or plural projection optical systems including an aperture (exit pupil) for magnifying and projecting an image appearing on each display device, and a display panel comprising a Fresnel lens or Fresnel mirror located near images projected through such projection optical systems to form an aperture image of each projection optical system at a viewing pupil position and a diffuser plate or a hologram diffuser plate comprising a pit-and-projection diffusing surface having scatter action to magnify the aperture image of each projection optical system. Each one enables a viewer to view a bright projected image while the viewable pupil area is limited.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With such projection displays designed to project the viewing pupil having a limited area, it is impossible to view any bright, normal projected image as the viewer's eyes are off that limited pupil area.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, as long as one of both eyes of the viewer stays in the viewing pupil area especially in the horizontal direction, it is not necessarily easy for the viewer to take notice of another eye being off the limited pupil area.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In view of such problems with the prior art as described above, an object of the invention is to provide a projection display for projection of a viewing pupil having a limited area, which permits a viewer to take immediate notice of a viewer's own eye being off the limited pupil area so as to ensure facilitated viewing of a bright, normal projection image.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the invention, this object is achievable by the provision of a projection display comprising a single or plural display devices, a single or plural projection optical systems each of which has an aperture and is adapted to magnify and project an image appearing on each display device, and a display panel including image-formation means located near images projected through the projection optical systems for formation at a viewing pupil position of an aperture image of each projection optical system and diffuser means that has scatter action and is adapted to magnify the aperture image of each projection optical system into a viewing pupil, characterized in that:</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">a misalignment warning pupil is adjacent to or overlaps partly with said viewing pupil via said display panel, and a misalignment warning projector for issuing a misalignment warning is located on said display panel and adjacent to at least one of said projection optical systems.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably in this case, misalignment warning projectors are located adjacent to both left and right sides of at least one of said projection optical systems.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">There could also be provided a 3D projection display comprising a left display device for displaying a left parallactic image and a right display device for displaying a right parallactic image as well as a left projection optical system and a right projection optical system, wherein two misalignment warning projectors are located adjacent to both left and right sides of a set of said left and right projection optical systems.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, a Fresnel lens or mirror is used for the image-formation means.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With the inventive arrangement of the projection display wherein a misalignment warning pupil is adjacent to or overlaps partly with said viewing pupil via said display panel, and a misalignment warning projector for issuing a misalignment warning is located on said display panel and adjacent to at least one of said projection optical systems, it is possible for the viewer to take immediate notice of his or her own eye being off the limited viewing area, so that viewing of a bright, normal projected image can be facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part be apparent from the specification.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The invention accordingly comprises the features of construction, combinations of elements, and arrangement of parts which will be exemplified in the construction hereinafter set forth, and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The projection display of the invention is now explained with reference to its preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is generally illustrative in construction of one embodiment of the invention, specifically a 3D projection display <b>10</b> wherein two left and right 2D parallactic images appearing on two 2D display devices <b>11</b><sub>L</sub>, <b>11</b><sub>R </sub>are simultaneously projected onto a display panel <b>15</b> for 3D representation. Here <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) is illustrative in schematic of the construction of a transmission type projection display, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) is illustrative in schematic of the construction of a reflection type projection display. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>), for convenience, only the right-eye arrangement is shown; the left-eye arrangement is not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The 3D projection displays <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>) are each made up of display devices <b>11</b><sub>L</sub>, <b>11</b><sub>R</sub>, projection optical systems <b>12</b><sub>L</sub>, <b>12</b><sub>R</sub>, an image-formation optical system <b>13</b>, and a diffuser plate <b>14</b> that is in contact with, or slightly spaced away from, the viewing side of the image-formation optical system <b>13</b>. The image-formation optical system <b>13</b> and the diffuser plate <b>14</b> form together the display panel <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The left and right projection optical systems <b>12</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>12</b><sub>R </sub>are operable to project parallactic images appearing on the left and right display devices <b>11</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>11</b><sub>R </sub>onto the viewing side. Both the optical systems are located such that the parallactic images are projected onto the same display plane of the display panel <b>15</b>, while the image-formation optical system <b>13</b> is located near that same display plane. In this arrangement, the exit pupils <b>16</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>16</b><sub>R </sub>of the projection optical systems <b>12</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>12</b><sub>R </sub>are projected onto the viewing side. As the viewer has left and right eyes EL and ER in alignment with the positions of the projected exit pupil images, it permits the viewer to view the images appearing on the display devices <b>11</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>11</b><sub>R</sub>. The diffuser plate <b>14</b> acts to magnify the viewing pupils, and the image-formation optical system <b>13</b> and the diffuser plate <b>14</b> are located on the display plane position.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At the display plane position, the images projected through the projection optical systems <b>12</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>12</b><sub>R </sub>and displayed on the display devices <b>11</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>11</b><sub>R </sub>are formed. For the image-formation optical system <b>13</b> located on that image-formation position, a Fresnel lens (convex lens) is used in the case of the transmission type 3D projection display (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>)), and a Fresnel mirror (concave mirror) in the case of the reflection type 3D projection display (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>)). The diffuser plate <b>14</b>, for instance, may be a diffuser plate comprising a transparent substrate roughened on its surface to impart directivity thereto, a directional HOE scatter film, or a directional diffusing plane formed on the entrance surface of the Fresnel mirror or the exit surface of the Fresnel lens.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The Fresnel mirror, and the Fresnel lens is adapted to form the images of two exit pupils <b>16</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>16</b><sub>R </sub>on the viewing side. Each Fresnel plane is located at (or near) the display plane position, so that the projected image can be viewed with high resolution yet with no quality deterioration. The Fresnel mirror, and the Fresnel lens is located in a flat sheet form unlike a concave mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) is illustrative of the principles of how exit pupil images (viewing pupils) <b>21</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>21</b><sub>R </sub>are magnified in the 3D projection display <b>10</b> that is of the transmission type.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A diffuser plate <b>14</b> is located together with an image-formation optical system <b>13</b> at or near a planar form of display surface position of a display panel <b>15</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), the image-formation optical system <b>13</b> acts to form the images of exit pupils <b>16</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>16</b><sub>R </sub>of left and right projection optical systems <b>12</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>12</b><sub>R </sub>at given positions on the viewing side with the diameter, Φ<sub>0</sub>, of the exit pupils <b>16</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>16</b><sub>R </sub>changed to a magnitude of Φ<sub>0</sub>′. At the ext pupil image position, the eyeballs EL and ER of the viewer are located. Here, the diffuser plate <b>14</b> is designed to make use of its diffusion action to magnify the images of the exit pupils <b>16</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>16</b><sub>R </sub>(the images of the exit pupils <b>16</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>16</b><sub>R </sub>of the left and right projection optical systems <b>12</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>12</b><sub>R</sub>)—which should be formed with the magnitude of Φ<sub>0</sub>′— to viewing pupils <b>21</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>21</b><sub>R </sub>having a magnitude of Φ<sub>1</sub>′. It is noted that the left and right viewing pupils <b>21</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>21</b><sub>R </sub>magnified through the diffuser plate <b>14</b> are determined in terms of position and diameter in such a way as not to overlap each other. The diffuser plate <b>14</b> has only one diffusion action in the case of the transmission type 3D projection display because light transmits only once through the diffuser plate <b>14</b> located at the display plane position, and double diffusion actions in the case of the reflection type 3D projection display (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5)</figref>, because light transmits twice through a diffusing optical system located at the display plane position.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>b</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>c</i>) are illustrative of brightness distributions in left and right viewing pupils <b>21</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>21</b><sub>R</sub>. An in-pupil distribution is of two types, i.e., a uniform type as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>) and a type approximate to Gaussian distribution as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>c</i>). In any event, light intensity at a site where the left and right pupils overlap each other should be small enough to substantially eliminate any overlap. It is thus possible to present images at left and right projectors <b>20</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>20</b><sub>R </sub>to the left and right pupils EL and ER of the viewer in a mutually independent state, making 3D viewing possible without recourse to spectacles.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrative in construction of one embodiment of such a 3D projection display wherein a misalignment warning is indicated on the outside of viewing pupils <b>21</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>21</b><sub>R </sub>according to the invention. This 3D projection display is designed in the form of a transmission type 3D projection display as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>). In this transmission type 3D projection display, how left and right projectors <b>20</b><sub>L</sub>, <b>20</b><sub>R </sub>and a display panel <b>15</b> are constructed, and what relations they are located in is the same as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>), and in the left and right projectors <b>20</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>20</b><sub>R</sub>, the associated left and right projection optical systems <b>12</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>12</b><sub>R </sub>are adapted to project parallactic images appearing on the associated display devices <b>11</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>11</b><sub>R </sub>onto the same display plane of the display panel <b>15</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>). An image-formation optical system <b>13</b> in the display panel <b>15</b> is adapted to project the exit pupils <b>16</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>16</b><sub>R </sub>of the projection optical systems <b>12</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>12</b><sub>R </sub>on the viewing side. A diffuser plate <b>14</b> in the display panel <b>15</b> is adapted to magnify the pupil images of the exit pupils <b>16</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>16</b><sub>R </sub>to viewing pupils <b>21</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>21</b><sub>R</sub>. As the viewer has the pupils EL and ER of the left and right eyes positioned in the magnified and projected viewing pupils <b>21</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>21</b><sub>R</sub>, the viewer can obtain a 3D viewing of images appearing on the display devices <b>11</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>11</b><sub>R</sub>. According to the invention, a separate projector <b>30</b><sub>L </sub>is located on the outside of the left projector <b>20</b><sub>L </sub>(the side that faces away from the right projector <b>20</b><sub>R</sub>), and a separate projector <b>30</b><sub>R </sub>is located on the outside of the right projector <b>20</b><sub>R </sub>(the side that faces away from the left projector <b>20</b><sub>L</sub>). The left- and right-outer projectors <b>30</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>30</b><sub>R </sub>have the same construction, and each one comprises projection optical systems <b>31</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>31</b><sub>R </sub>having exit pupils <b>33</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>33</b><sub>R</sub>, respectively, and display portions <b>32</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>32</b><sub>R</sub>. The display portions <b>32</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>32</b><sub>R</sub>, when having no self-emitter, may have an illumination system (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The left- and right-outer projectors <b>30</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>30</b><sub>R </sub>are located such that the exit pupils <b>33</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>33</b><sub>R </sub>thereof are magnified and projected by way of the actions of an image-formation optical system <b>13</b> and a diffuser plate <b>14</b> that form together the display panel <b>15</b> to form warning pupils <b>41</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>41</b><sub>R </sub>that are adjacent to, or overlap slightly with, the outside of the viewing pupils <b>21</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>21</b><sub>R</sub>. Projection optical systems <b>31</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>31</b><sub>R </sub>in the left- and right-outer projectors <b>30</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>30</b><sub>R </sub>are adapted to project images of markings, characters or colors displayed on the associated display portions <b>32</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>32</b><sub>R </sub>onto the same display plane of the display panel <b>15</b> for the parallactic images. The markings, characters or colors displayed on the display portions <b>32</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>32</b><sub>R </sub>will be explained later.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Such being the arrangement, as long as the pupils EL and ER of both eyes of the viewer are positioned within the left and right viewing pupils <b>21</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>21</b><sub>R</sub>, the viewer can view normal left and right parallactic images for normal 3D viewing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Consider now that the head of the viewer moves in an arrow A direction and the right-eye ER is on the verge of coming off the right viewing pupil <b>21</b><sub>R</sub>. Then, the pupil of the right-eye ER receives a part of light coming from a right warning pupil <b>41</b><sub>R </sub>adjacent thereto, so that the viewer can see the markings, characters or colors displayed on the display portion <b>32</b><sub>R </sub>in the right-outer projector <b>30</b><sub>R</sub>. Here, if on the display portion <b>32</b><sub>R </sub>there is indicated a word of warning such as “Move over to the right”, an arrow pattern with projected images turning right on the display panel <b>15</b> or a simple across-the-plane red color, then the viewer can see such a word, arrow pattern or red color through the right eye EL. As a result, the viewer can take notice of the head being too close to the right in the arrow A direction to allow it to go back to the normal position.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Conversely, consider that the head of the viewer moves in an arrow B direction and the left-eye EL is on the verge of coming off the left viewing pupil <b>21</b><sub>L</sub>. Then, the pupil of the left-eye EL receives a part of light coming from a left warning pupil <b>41</b><sub>L </sub>adjacent thereto, so that the viewer can see the markings, characters or colors displayed on the display portion <b>32</b><sub>L </sub>in the left-outer projector <b>30</b><sub>L</sub>. Here, if on the display portion <b>32</b><sub>L </sub>there is indicated a word of warning such as “Move over to the right”, an arrow pattern with projected images turning left on the display panel <b>15</b> or a simple across-the-plane blue color, then the viewer can see such a word, arrow pattern or blue color through the left-eye EL. As a result, the viewer can take notice of the head being too close to the left in the arrow B direction to allow it to go back to the normal position.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">While a set of the projectors <b>30</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>30</b><sub>R </sub>for warning that the eyes of the viewer are off the normal position is located on the outside of the displaying projectors <b>20</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>20</b><sub>R </sub>in the above embodiment, it is understood that another set of similar projectors could be located in the vertical direction to warn that both eyes are off the normal position not only in the left-and-right direction but also in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">While the above embodiment has been explained with reference to the application of the warning projectors <b>30</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>30</b><sub>R </sub>to the transmission type 3D projection display, it is understood that they could also be applied to the reflection type projection display.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, warning projectors similar to the projectors <b>30</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>30</b><sub>R </sub>could be applied to a 2D projection display including only one displaying projector with only one viewing pupil being formed. That is, they could be located on the left and right sides, and optionally on the upper and lower sides, of the displaying projector to warn that the eyes of the viewer are off the normal positions.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring then to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown one construction of another embodiment of the projection display according to the invention. Specifically, misalignment warning projectors are located on the outside of viewing pupils <b>21</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>21</b><sub>2 </sub>in a projection display that enables a plurality of viewers to view separate projected images. That projection display for presenting separate projected images to a plurality of viewers is analogous to the 3D projection display of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. That is, the constructions of a plurality of separate projectors <b>12</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>12</b><sub>2 </sub>and display panel <b>15</b> and how they are located are pretty much the same as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, projection optical systems <b>12</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>12</b><sub>2 </sub>in a plurality (two in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2)</figref> of separate projectors <b>20</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>20</b><sub>2 </sub>are adapted to project separate 2D images appearing on the associated display devices <b>11</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>11</b><sub>2 </sub>onto the same display plane of the display panel <b>15</b>. An image-formation optical system <b>13</b> in the display panel <b>15</b> projects the exit pupils <b>16</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>16</b><sub>2 </sub>of the projection optical systems <b>12</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>12</b><sub>2 </sub>onto the viewer side, and a diffuser plate <b>14</b> in the display panel <b>15</b> magnifies the pupil images of the exit pupils <b>16</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>16</b><sub>2 </sub>to viewing pupils <b>21</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>21</b><sub>2</sub>. As separate viewers M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2 </sub>have the pupils of both eyes positioned within the respective magnified and projected viewing pupils <b>22</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>22</b><sub>2</sub>, they can separately view mutually different images appearing on the display devices <b>11</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>11</b><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Then, a projector <b>30</b><sub>R </sub>similar to the warning projector <b>30</b><sub>R </sub>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is located on the outside of one projector <b>20</b><sub>1 </sub>(the side that faces away from another projector <b>20</b><sub>2</sub>), and an exit pupil <b>33</b><sub>R </sub>of a projection optical system <b>31</b><sub>R </sub>thereof is magnified and projected under the actions of the image-formation optical system <b>13</b> and diffuser plate <b>14</b> in the display panel <b>15</b> into a warning pupil <b>41</b><sub>R </sub>that is adjacent to, or overlaps slightly with, the outside of the viewing pupil <b>21</b>, for the one projector <b>20</b><sub>1</sub>. Likewise, a projector <b>30</b><sub>L </sub>similar to the warning projector <b>30</b><sub>L </sub>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is located on the outside of another projector <b>20</b><sub>2 </sub>(the side that faces away from the one projector <b>20</b><sub>1</sub>), and an exit pupil <b>33</b><sub>L </sub>of a projection optical system <b>31</b><sub>L </sub>thereof is magnified and projected under the actions of the image-formation optical system <b>13</b> and diffuser plate <b>14</b> in the display panel <b>15</b> into a warning pupil <b>41</b><sub>L </sub>that is adjacent to, or overlaps slightly with, the outside of the viewing pupil <b>21</b><sub>2 </sub>for the another projector <b>20</b><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this embodiment, yet another projector <b>30</b><sub>C </sub>is also located between both projectors <b>20</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>20</b><sub>2</sub>, and an exit pupil <b>33</b><sub>C </sub>of a projection optical system <b>31</b><sub>C </sub>thereof is magnified and projected under the actions of the image-formation optical system <b>13</b> and diffuser plate <b>14</b> in the display panel <b>15</b> into a warning pupil <b>41</b><sub>C </sub>that is interposed between the viewing pupils <b>21</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>21</b><sub>2 </sub>for both projectors <b>20</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>20</b><sub>2 </sub>and is adjacent to, or overlaps slightly with, them.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As is the case with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, markings, characters or colors similar to those mentioned above are indicated on display portions <b>32</b><sub>L</sub>, <b>32</b><sub>C </sub>and <b>32</b><sub>R </sub>of the warning projectors <b>30</b><sub>L</sub>, <b>30</b><sub>C </sub>and <b>30</b><sub>R</sub>, so that, as long as the eyes of the viewers M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2 </sub>are positioned within the associated viewing pupils <b>21</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>21</b><sub>2</sub>, they can obtain a normal 3D viewing of the normal left and right parallactic images. However, as the eyes are on the verge of being off the viewing pupils <b>21</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>21</b><sub>2 </sub>in any of the left and right directions, the eye of any of the viewers M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2 </sub>receives a part of light coming from any one of the warning pupils <b>41</b><sub>L</sub>, <b>41</b><sub>C </sub>and <b>41</b><sub>R </sub>adjacent thereto, so that they can see the markings, characters or colors indicated on the display portions <b>32</b><sub>L</sub>, <b>32</b><sub>C </sub>and <b>32</b><sub>R </sub>of the associated projectors <b>30</b><sub>L</sub>, <b>30</b><sub>C </sub>and <b>30</b><sub>R</sub>. Consequently, each of the viewers M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2 </sub>can take notice of the head being off the viewing position to allow it to go back to the normal position.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is illustrative in schematic of the inventive projection display as applied to a display device in a surgical stereomicroscope. Operation or the like is performed while an affected site O is viewed under a surgical stereomicroscope <b>50</b>. A reflection type 3D projection display <b>10</b>′ according to the invention is affixed to the surgical stereomicroscope <b>50</b>, and the principles of 3D representations by the reflection type 3D projection display are the same as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>). As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, warning projectors <b>30</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>30</b><sub>R </sub>are located on both sides of a set of left and right projectors <b>20</b><sub>L </sub>and <b>20</b><sub>R </sub>in the reflection type projection display <b>10</b>′, so that a viewer M can take notice of being off a 3D viewing position to go back to the normal viewing position for ensuring a proper 3D viewing of the affected site O.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">While the inventive projection display has been explained with reference to some preferred embodiments, it is understood that the invention is by no means limited thereto, and many modifications may be possible.</p>
