<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to electronic systems and methods for locating buried or otherwise inaccessible pipes and other conduits by detecting electromagnetic emissions from an inserted source.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are many situations where is it desirable to locate buried pipes and other conduits. For example, prior to starting any new construction that involves excavation it is important to locate underground water pipes, sewer pipes, septic tanks, reservoirs, gas lines, fiber optic cable conduits, etc. As used herein the term “buried” refers not only to pipes and conduits below the surface of the ground, but in addition, to objects located inside walls, between floors in multi-story buildings or cast into concrete slabs, etc. If a back hoe or other excavation equipment severs a water main, gas line or a sewer line this can lead to extensive damage and messy cleanups. Serious injury or even death can result from inadvertently piercing a gas line during excavation when the gas is ignited.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Buried objects can be located by sensing an electromagnetic signal emitted by the same. Some buried cables such as power lines are already energized and emit their own long cylindrical electromagnetic field and can be located through a process referred to as “line tracing.” Metal pipes and conduits can be energized with an outside electrical source having a frequency typically in a range of approximately 4 Hz to 500 kHz in order to enable them to be located.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A sonde (also called a transmitter, beacon or duct probe) can also be used to locate buried pipes, conduits, horizontal directional drills and reservoirs. A sonde typically includes a coil of wire wrapped around a ferromagnetic core. The coil is energized at a desired frequency, typically in a range of approximately 4 Hz to 500 kHz. A sonde generates a different electromagnetic field than that produced by an energized line. A typical low frequency sonde does not strongly couple to other objects and thereby produce complex interfering fields that can occur during tracing. Therefore, a sonde can be localized to a single point. To take advantage of this feature, a sonde can be constructed as a self-contained unit that can be flushed down a pipe. Alternatively, a sonde can be coupled to a rugged camera head as part of a video pipe inspection system to thereby enable defects and blockages to be precisely located. An example of a hand-held portable locator that can be used to locate a sonde is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/268,641 filed Oct. 9, 2002 of Mark S. Olsson et al. entitled <smallcaps>OMNIDIRECTIONAL SONDE AND LINE LOCATOR</smallcaps>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Sondes are sometimes integrated into camera heads in video pipe inspection systems. They can also be attached to sewer snakes, drain cleaners and horizontal drill heads. Sondes are also available that are not attached to any guiding structures or remote power sources, but are flushed down a pipe, for example. These include battery powered float-type sondes that are buoyant and battery powered pill-type sondes which do not float and have an elongate configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Sondes that have heretofore been developed have not had a construction that optimizes both utility and durability.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first embodiment of our invention is illustrated in the form of a flexible-type sonde <b>10</b> that is configured for use as a component of a video pipe inspection system. See, for example, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/061,887 filed Jan. 31, 2002 of Mark S. Olsson et al. entitled <smallcaps>VIDEO PIPE INSPECTION SYSTEM EMPLOYING NON</smallcaps>-<smallcaps>ROTATING CABLE STORAGE DRUM</smallcaps>, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Said application is assigned to DeepSea Power and Light, the assignee of the present application. The flexible-type sonde <b>10</b> is surrounded by a tubular stainless steel coil spring (not illustrated). The flexible-type sonde <b>10</b> connects a plurality of conductors extending from the distal end of a resilient flexible video push cable (not illustrated) to the rear end of a rugged video camera head (not illustrated). One or more steel cables (not illustrated) provide a connection between a termination assembly connected to the distal end of the push cable and the rear end of the video camera head to enable the camera head to be pulled out of the pipe in the case of jams. The flexible-type sonde <b>10</b> includes an elongate ferromagnetic core <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a coil <b>14</b> made of suitably insulated wire that surrounds a short intermediate segment of the core <b>12</b>. A waterproof housing <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) surrounds and supports the coil <b>14</b>. An electronic drive circuit <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is mounted inside the housing <b>16</b> for supplying the coil <b>14</b> with an oscillating electric signal that will induce the core <b>12</b> to emit electromagnetic signals at a predetermined optimum strength and frequency, (e.g. 512 Hz) that can be remotely detected.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The flexible-type sonde <b>10</b> may also be a component of a video pipe inspection system with means for mechanically or electronically leveling the video image, such as that disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/858,628 filed Jun. 1, 2004 of Mark S. Olsson et al. entitled <smallcaps>SELF</smallcaps>-<smallcaps>LEVELING CAMERA HEAD</smallcaps>, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Said application is also assigned to DeepSea Power and Light, the assignee of the present application.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The core <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is approximately four inches in length and three-sixteenths inches in diameter and is made of flexible wire rope made of a plurality of individual bundles <b>12</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of parallel fine gauge wires of low carbon steel providing the core <b>12</b> with high magnetic permeability. Other high magnetic permeability/low loss flexible material could be used for the core <b>12</b> besides low carbon steel. The strands of wire in each of the bundles <b>12</b><i>a </i>are helically arranged and the bundles <b>12</b><i>a </i>are also helically wrapped. By way of example only, and not by way of limitation, the steel wire in the bundles <b>12</b><i>a </i>may have a diameter of approximately five thousandths of an inch. The steel wire is coated with black oxide to limit eddy loss. The rearward and forward segments of the core <b>12</b> that extend on either side of the coil <b>14</b> can flex or bend under relatively minor forces a substantial distance away from the central longitudinal axis of the core <b>12</b>. The resiliency of the core <b>12</b> and the surrounding plastic jacket <b>20</b> ensures that the core <b>12</b> will return to its straight configuration after it is bent. The flexible nature of the core <b>12</b> allows a long effective length which produces a large dipole moment and increased effective radiated power while still enabling the core <b>12</b> to bend and negotiate tight turns as the rugged video camera head and trailing flexible-type sonde <b>10</b> are forced down a pipe with the push cable. The wire rope core <b>12</b> is surrounded by a waterproof jacket <b>20</b> made of a suitable insulating plastic material. A pair of insulating plastic cylindrical end caps <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>) are tightly press fit over the ends of the jacket <b>20</b> and the wire rope core <b>12</b> and provide waterproof seals over the ends of the jacket <b>20</b>. Optionally the end caps <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are bonded to the ends of the jacket <b>20</b> with adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An insulated springy electric coil cord <b>26</b> has rearward and forward segments <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>that loosely surround the core <b>12</b> and have ends that are over molded by the housing <b>16</b>. The coil cord <b>26</b> contains conductors for supplying power to the electronic drive circuit <b>18</b> and the video camera head. The coil cord <b>26</b> also contains a conductor for transmitting a video signal from the video camera head. The conductors in the coil cord <b>26</b> are illustrated diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref> and denoted with the reference numeral <b>27</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the conductors of the cord segments <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>are shown diagrammatically as a single metal core, although it will be understood that there are multiple separately insulated conductors within the cord <b>26</b>. The rearward segment <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the coil cord <b>26</b> has a multi-pin male electrical connector <b>28</b> operatively connected thereto. The forward segment <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the coil cord <b>26</b> has a multi-socket female electrical connector <b>30</b> operatively connected thereto. The springy rearward and forward segments <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the coil cord <b>26</b> manage or accommodate slack in the interconnect between the distal end of the push cable and the rear end of the video camera head.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The coil <b>14</b> is wound about a cylindrical plastic bobbin <b>31</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) slipped over the waterproof jacket <b>20</b> that surrounds the core <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the coil <b>14</b> may be directly wound on top of the waterproof jacket <b>20</b> to allow the coil <b>14</b> to be formed without the use of a separate bobbin to thereby minimize the build height of the coil <b>14</b>. The housing <b>16</b> comprises a solid mass of suitable plastic material that is injection molded over the electronic drive circuit <b>18</b> and the coil <b>14</b> to provide a rugged, waterproof enclosure. The electronic drive circuit <b>18</b> includes a ring-shaped circuit board assembly <b>32</b> with a central aperture. A cylindrical extension <b>34</b> of the bobbin <b>31</b> snugly extends through the central aperture in the circuit board assembly <b>32</b>. The circuit board assembly <b>32</b> is supported by the bobbin extension <b>34</b> and is positioned adjacent the rear end of the coil <b>14</b>. The plane of the circuit board assembly <b>32</b> is substantially normal or perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the coil <b>14</b>. The location of the electronic drive circuit <b>18</b> inside the assembly that comprises the flexible-type sonde <b>10</b> provides a self-contained operable unit that can be more easily repaired or replaced in the case of failures, instead of providing the electronic drive circuit for the coil <b>14</b> with the control system at the proximal end of the push cable.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A plastic clip <b>36</b> fits snugly over the rear end of the cylindrical extension <b>34</b> after the circuit board assembly <b>32</b> has been installed. The clip <b>36</b> retains the rearward segment <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the coil cord <b>26</b>. A similar clip <b>38</b> is integrally formed on the forward end of the bobbin <b>31</b> and retains the forward segment <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the coil cord <b>26</b>. The over molding of the plastic housing <b>16</b> serves to firmly lock the bobbin <b>31</b>, circuit board assembly <b>32</b>, coil <b>14</b>, and coil cord segments <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>firmly in position and ensures that the electronic drive circuit <b>18</b> and the electrical connections are free from stresses and moisture that could damage or impair their proper operation.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Thus the core <b>12</b>, coil <b>14</b> and electronic drive circuit <b>18</b> are substantially co-axial relative to the central longitudinal axis of the core <b>12</b>. The coil <b>14</b> is centered about the core <b>12</b> for maximum electromagnetic signal generating efficiency. This concentric architecture also minimizes the foot print or volume occupied by the flexible-type sonde <b>10</b> which yields a compact design required for video pipe inspection equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram of the electronic drive circuit <b>18</b> of the sonde of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The electronic drive circuit <b>18</b> includes various electronic components that are supported and interconnected on the printed circuit board assembly <b>32</b>, including a micro-computer <b>40</b>. A voltage regulator <b>42</b> is connected to the input power conductor <b>44</b> and return power conductor <b>46</b> in the coil cord <b>26</b> and supplies DC power to the micro-computer <b>40</b>. The micro-computer <b>40</b> is connected to a frequency reference <b>48</b> and controls an output bridge <b>50</b>. The output bridge <b>50</b> is used to drive the coil <b>14</b> at a predetermined frequency, such as 512 Hz, so that the electromagnetic signals emitted by the ferromagnetic core <b>12</b> have sufficient strength to enable the buried flexible-type sonde <b>10</b> to readily be located with a hand-held locator. The power signal to the video camera head, which is routed through the flexible-type sonde <b>10</b> via conductors <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>, can be modulated to encode commands recognized by the micro-computer <b>40</b> that will turn the transmitting function ON and OFF. This is accomplished with the aid of high pass filter network <b>52</b>. If desired, the flexible-type sonde <b>10</b> can be shut down remotely from a control system connected to the proximal end of the push cable in order to limit interference with the video signal transmitted along conductor <b>54</b> in the coil cord <b>26</b>. When MOSFET devices in the output bridge <b>50</b> switch OFF a diode <b>56</b> prevents energy from feeding back into the input power conductor <b>44</b>. Instead, this energy is momentarily stored in a capacitor <b>58</b>. The diode <b>56</b> and capacitor <b>58</b> are arranged to recover a portion of the energy stored in the coil <b>14</b> at the end of each cycle and deliver it back into the coil <b>14</b> at the start of the next cycle instead of this energy being dissipated by the internal resistance of the return conductor <b>46</b>. This arrangement results in a significant increase in the output power of the coil <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The electronic drive circuit <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the flexible-type sonde <b>10</b> is supported on the printed circuit board assembly <b>32</b> within the waterproof housing <b>16</b>. However other electronic drive circuit means can be utilized such as a circuit board assembly remote from the flexible-type sonde <b>10</b> such as that associated with the inner or proximal end of a push cable as disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/061,887 previously incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> a float-type sonde <b>100</b> includes a water-tight generally spherical float housing made of upper and lower hemispherical plastic shells <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> and a BUNA O-ring <b>106</b> that seals a joint between the shells <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. The shells <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> could be glued or screwed together. By way of example, the water-tight buoyant housing formed by the joined plastic shells <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> may have an outer diameter of approximately one and one-half inches. The small size and round shape of the float-type sonde <b>100</b> facilitates rolling of the float-type sonde <b>100</b> through both small and large diameter pipes. A rigid cylindrical elongate ferromagnetic core <b>108</b> has a coil <b>110</b> made of suitably insulated wire that surrounds the core <b>108</b>. The core <b>108</b> and coil <b>110</b> are supported on a circuit board assembly <b>112</b> mounted within the float housing. A plastic half-cylinder case <b>114</b> snugly encases the core and coil <b>110</b> and its hook-shaped legs <b>114</b><i>a </i>snap into rectangular apertures <b>112</b><i>a </i>in the circuit board assembly <b>112</b>. A battery holder <b>116</b> mounted beneath the circuit board assembly <b>112</b> holds two coin cell lithium batteries <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">An electronic drive circuit <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) including electronic components interconnected on the circuit board assembly <b>112</b> is powered by the batteries <b>118</b> for supplying the coil <b>110</b> with an electric signal. The signal is designed to induce the ferromagnetic core <b>108</b> to emit electromagnetic signals at a predetermined strength and frequency that can be remotely detected. The float-type sonde <b>100</b> is designed with a predetermined buoyancy and a center of gravity so that an axis of the dipole of an electromagnetic field generated by the core <b>108</b> is automatically oriented in a generally vertical direction normal to axis D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as the float-type sonde <b>100</b> floats in a body of liquid. This is achieved by locating the relatively heavy lithium coin cell batteries <b>118</b> on one side of the circuit board assembly <b>112</b> so that they extend mostly within one-half of the spherical float housing. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> about three-quarters of the length of the batteries <b>118</b> extend to the right side of the vertical axis of a screw eye <b>132</b> discussed hereafter. The circuit board assembly <b>112</b> is a generally planar structure that substantially spans the equator of the float housing. The equator of the float housing is defined by the mating joint of the upper and lower hemispherical shells <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. When the float-type sonde <b>100</b> floats in a liquid, such as water in a pipe, the central longitudinal axis of the core <b>108</b> extends vertically, i.e. perpendicular to the surface of the water in the case of a partially full pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The float-type sonde <b>100</b> includes waterproof switch means for activating the electronic drive circuit <b>120</b>. In the illustrated embodiment the switch means includes a push button switch <b>122</b> that is manually actuable by flexing a top circular flat portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the upper plastic shell <b>102</b> of the float housing. A decal or label <b>124</b> is adhesively adhered to the portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>to identify this location and function to the user. The flexing is accomplished by squeezing the float-type sonde <b>100</b> between the thumb as it overlies the portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the upper shell <b>102</b> and the index and middle fingers as they overlie the underside of the lower shell <b>104</b>. The switch means further includes a three-legged plastic flexure member <b>126</b> that transfers a manual inward deflection of the portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the upper shell to depress and actuate the push button switch <b>122</b>. The flexure member <b>126</b> includes three legs <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b </i>and <b>126</b><i>c </i>that have lower ends that lock into aperture <b>128</b> in the circuit board assembly <b>112</b>. An upstanding projection <b>126</b><i>d </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) in the center of the flexure member <b>126</b> engages the underside of the flexible portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the upper shell <b>102</b>. An actuating finger <b>126</b><i>e </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the flexure member <b>126</b> has a lower end that pushes downwardly on the central reciprocating spring biased button of the push button switch <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The float-type sonde <b>100</b> further includes means for providing illumination that is mounted behind a transparent portion of the float housing. In the illustrated embodiment an LED <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is mounted on the circuit board assembly <b>112</b>. The LED <b>130</b> is energized using power from the batteries <b>118</b> to indicate an operational status of the electronic drive circuit <b>120</b>, such as ON or OFF. The upper shell <b>102</b> can be made of transparent polycarbonate plastic or a clear window can be mounted in an aperture in the upper shell <b>102</b> adjacent the LED <b>130</b>. By way of example, the portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>can be depressed to turn the float-type sonde <b>100</b> ON which will be indicated by an initial flash of the LED <b>130</b> followed by a steady illumination of the LED <b>130</b>. A subsequent depression of the portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>can turn the float-type sonde <b>100</b> OFF at which time the LED <b>130</b> will cease being illuminated. Preferably the portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>must be depressed for a predetermined sufficiently long time period, e.g. several seconds, to ensure against inadvertent triggering of the electronic drive circuit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The float-type sonde <b>100</b> includes attachment means for allowing a string to be attached to the water-tight float housing for withdrawing the sonde <b>100</b> from a pipe. In the embodiment shown, the attachment means includes the screw eye <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) that has a threaded shank <b>132</b><i>a </i>screwed into a cylindrical sleeve <b>134</b> formed in the lower shell <b>104</b>. The curved part <b>132</b><i>b </i>of the screw eye <b>132</b> is positioned inside an outwardly opening curved receptacle <b>136</b> formed in the lower shell <b>104</b>. The term “string” as used herein includes not only natural fiber strings and cord, but in addition, synthetic lines such as fishing line, small plastic or metal chain, and small gauge wire.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram of the electronic drive circuit <b>120</b> of the float-type sonde <b>100</b>. The batteries <b>118</b> supply DC power through a voltage regulator <b>138</b> to a micro-computer <b>140</b>. The micro-computer <b>140</b> responds to closure of the push button switch <b>122</b> and uses a frequency reference <b>142</b> and a bridge drive circuit to drive an output bridge <b>144</b>. The output bridge <b>144</b> in turn drives the coil <b>110</b>. The micro-computer <b>140</b> selectively energizes the LED <b>130</b> to indicate the status of the electronic drive circuit <b>120</b> to the user. A diode <b>146</b> and a capacitor <b>148</b> are connected between the output bridge <b>144</b> and the batteries <b>118</b> and prevent power from feeding back into the batteries <b>118</b> when MOSFET devices in the output bridge <b>120</b> turn OFF. The diode <b>146</b> and capacitor <b>148</b> are arranged to recover a portion of the energy stored in the coil <b>110</b> at the end of each cycle and deliver it back into the coil <b>110</b> at the start of the next cycle instead of this energy being dissipated by the internal resistance of the batteries <b>118</b>. This results in a significant increase in the output power of the coil <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> a pill-type sonde <b>200</b> includes a cylindrical hollow tube <b>202</b> that removably receives a AAA battery <b>204</b>. The tube <b>202</b> is made of ferromagnetic material, preferably low carbon steel, so that it can function as the core of an electromagnetic transmitter. A coil <b>206</b> made of suitably insulated wire is wound directly around the steel tube <b>202</b> between forward and rearward radial flanges formed on the steel tube <b>202</b>. A cylindrical plastic terminal holder <b>208</b> fits over the forward end of the steel tube <b>202</b> and includes a central positive battery terminal <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). A plastic spacer <b>212</b> engages a circuit board assembly <b>214</b> that also engages the terminal holder <b>208</b>. Components forming an electronic drive circuit <b>216</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) are mounted and interconnected on the circuit board assembly <b>214</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>). The circuit board assembly <b>214</b> has a generally planar disc shape and it extends substantially perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis of the steel tube <b>202</b>. The electronic drive circuit <b>216</b> is longitudinally spaced from an end of the steel tube <b>202</b> instead of surrounding the exterior of the tube <b>202</b> in order to minimize the overall outer diameter of the pill-type sonde <b>200</b>. Alternatively, the electronic drive circuit could abut an end of the steel tube <b>202</b> if the functions of the terminal holder <b>208</b> and spacer <b>212</b> were integrated therein. A small outer diameter for the pill-type sonde <b>200</b> is desirable so that it can be pushed down the interior of small diameter pipes and negotiate tight turns.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The electronic drive circuit <b>216</b> is connected to the coil <b>206</b> for driving the same with an oscillating electric signal to induce the steel tube <b>202</b> to emit electromagnetic signals with the optimum frequency and strength for tracing. The steel tube <b>202</b> preferably has a longitudinally extending gap or slot <b>217</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) that extends its entire length to reduce eddy losses in the core <b>202</b>. The electronic drive circuit <b>216</b> is connected to the positive battery terminal <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) and to a negative battery terminal in the form of a conical coil spring <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A female threaded cylindrical stainless steel end cap <b>220</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) screws over a male threaded rear segment <b>202</b><i>a </i>of the steel tube <b>202</b>. The circumferential outer surface of the steel end cap <b>220</b> is knurled to facilitate manual twisting thereof. The coil spring <b>218</b> surrounds and engages a central hub portion <b>220</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the steel end cap <b>220</b> to hold the same in position and to provide an electrical connection to the negative contact of the battery <b>204</b>. The steel end cap <b>220</b> includes an outwardly opening female threaded bore <b>222</b> with standard sized threads to permit the end of a conventional sewer snake (not illustrated) to be connected thereto so that the pill-type sonde <b>200</b> can be pushed down a pipe. The end cap <b>220</b> may be configured so that the pill-type sonde <b>200</b> cannot be coupled to a snake, but instead may rely upon flowing liquid or other pushing means to move the pill-type sonde <b>200</b> down the pipe. A cylindrical plastic spacer <b>224</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>) surrounds and retains the larger diameter outer periphery of the coil spring <b>218</b> and prevents electrical contact between this outer periphery and the radially outward portion of the steel end cap <b>220</b> as well as the threaded rear segment <b>202</b><i>a </i>of the steel tube <b>202</b>. An outer water-tight housing <b>226</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) is formed by over molding a layer of transparent polyurethane plastic over the circuit board assembly <b>214</b>, coil <b>206</b> and steel tube <b>202</b>, except for the rear portion of the threaded rear segment <b>202</b><i>a </i>over which the steel end cap <b>220</b> is screwed. This plastic material is slightly compliant and therefore provides a degree of shock protection resulting from impacts with the hard pipe wall. A label <b>227</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) made of high temperature resistant material is wrapped around the coil <b>206</b> before over molding the plastic housing <b>226</b>. The label <b>227</b> contains graphic and/or text user instructions, serial number, technical specifications and/or trademarks. The label <b>227</b> may be read through the transparent plastic material that forms the housing <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A replaceable split metal wear ring <b>228</b> is clamped in an annular groove <b>229</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) formed in the plastic housing <b>226</b> between a dome-shaped forward portion <b>226</b><i>a </i>and a cylindrical portion <b>226</b><i>b </i>thereof. The metal wear ring <b>228</b> absorbs the most aggressive contact with the wall of the pipe and lessens the wear on the plastic housing <b>226</b>. An O-ring <b>230</b> is seated in an inwardly opening annular groove in the forward end of the steel end cap <b>220</b>. The O-ring <b>230</b> is squeezed between a smaller diameter rear shoulder <b>226</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the plastic housing <b>226</b> and the steel end cap to provide a water-tight seal.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The shape of the plastic terminal holder <b>208</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) and the recessed position of the central positive battery terminal <b>210</b> ensure that a circuit with the electronic drive circuit <b>216</b> can only be completed if the battery <b>204</b> is inserted in the proper orientation. This feature not only protects components in the electronic drive circuit <b>216</b> from reverse voltage, but also enables the battery <b>204</b> to be stored inside the pill-type sonde <b>200</b> by inserting it into the steel tube <b>202</b> in a direction opposite to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> so that no electrical circuit is completed and the pill-type sonde <b>200</b> remains in an OFF state and does not discharge the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The steel tube <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) provides a return electrical path between the electronic drive circuit <b>216</b> on the circuit board assembly <b>214</b> and the negative terminal of the battery <b>204</b>, but only when the steel end cap <b>220</b> is fully screwed onto the threaded rear segment <b>202</b><i>a</i>. This makes the coils of the coil spring <b>218</b> collapse on themselves as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> at which time one or more of the smaller diameter coils in the center of the conical coil spring <b>218</b> contact(s) the central hub portion <b>220</b><i>a </i>of the steel end cap <b>220</b>. The forward smaller diameter portion of the conical spring <b>218</b> is always in engagement with the negative contact of the battery <b>204</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>. Thus the combination of the steel end cap <b>220</b>, spacer <b>224</b>, coil spring <b>218</b>, threaded rear segment <b>202</b><i>a</i>, steel tube <b>202</b> provide a water proof manually actuable ON/OFF coil spring switch generally denoted <b>234</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> illustrates the ON state of the coil spring switch and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> illustrates the OFF condition of the coil spring switch. The mating faces of the steel end cap <b>220</b> and the rear shoulder <b>226</b><i>c </i>of the plastic housing <b>226</b> that extend perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis of the pill-type sonde <b>200</b> are preferably formed with radial knurling (not illustrated) that provides a locking action to maintain the coil switch in its ON condition.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a block diagram of the electronic drive circuit <b>216</b>. The battery <b>204</b> supplies DC power through a boost voltage regulator <b>231</b> to a micro-computer <b>233</b>. Typically a single AAA battery cell will supply 0.9 to 1.5 volts DC power and this signal is converted to a five volt DC signal for the micro-computer <b>233</b>. The micro-computer <b>233</b> responds to closure of the coil spring switch <b>234</b> and uses a frequency reference <b>235</b> to control an output bridge <b>236</b>. The output bridge <b>236</b> in turn drives the coil <b>206</b>. The micro-computer <b>233</b> also selectively energizes an LED <b>237</b> to indicate the status of the electronic drive circuit <b>216</b> to the user. The LED <b>237</b> is mounted on the circuit board assembly <b>214</b> and when energized its illumination is readily visible to the user through the transparent plastic housing <b>226</b>. Alternatively, the housing <b>226</b> could be made of opaque material and a transparent window could be provided in the same adjacent the LED <b>237</b>. A diode <b>238</b> prevents power from being fed back into the battery <b>204</b> when MOSFET devices in the output bridge <b>236</b> turn OFF and instead this power is momentarily stored in a capacitor <b>239</b>.

This significantly increases the power output of the coil <b>206</b>. As an alternative to the coil switch <b>234</b>, or in addition to the coil switch <b>234</b>, the electronic drive circuit <b>216</b> may be provided with a magnetic switch <b>240</b>.

The pill-type sonde <b>200</b> is inserted into the protective outer case <b>242</b> and a male threaded plastic closure plug <b>246</b> is screwed into the female threaded forward end of the protective outer case <b>242</b>. An O-ring <b>248</b> provides a friction lock between the plug <b>246</b> and the protective outer case <b>242</b> to prevent the cap <b>246</b> from loosening during use. Substantial torque and sometimes violent motion is imparted to the protective outer case <b>242</b> as the drain cleaning machine is used to force the protective outer case <b>242</b> down a pipe.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The electronic drive circuit could be modified so that the sondes would emit electromagnetic signals at different selected frequencies, either selectively or simultaneously. This can be done to counteract the fact that certain pipe materials tend to attenuate one electromagnetic frequency more than another. A dual frequency waveform could be utilized to drive the coil. Since the sondes described herein use a micro-computer to drive the coil, complex waveforms can be generated by making software changes. Higher harmonics of a square wave driven sonde can be utilized as an efficient way to transmit more than one frequency at a time. The radiated power of pre-selected harmonic frequencies can be increased, such as odd harmonics, to enhance the ability to locate the sonde in particular environments. Pulse width modulation could be utilized to generate a wide variety of waveforms with good control of multiple frequencies, their harmonics and their inter-modulation products.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Sondes incorporating our improvements could also be constructed that would emit swept frequency or pseudo-random frequency electromagnetic signals. The LED in the sonde can indicate not only the ON or OFF status of the sonde, but in addition, the operating frequency of the sonde. A method of locating a multi-frequency sonde can entail detecting a fundamental frequency and at least one of its higher harmonics. This can be accomplished using the difference in detected amplitude between the detected frequencies to determine if the sonde is in an electrically conductive or electrically non-conductive pipe. The results of this analysis can be displayed to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> illustrate waveforms that may be used for the drive signals for the coils of the sondes disclosed herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a waveform produced by clipping after analog addition. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a waveform produced by clipping after analog multiplication. The waveforms of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> incorporate a broad band wave form output in addition to the primary output frequency. The broadband waveform is produced by using a pseudo-random sequence to modulate the primary output frequency. The pseudo-random sequence appears as broadband noise under frequency analysis. This allows a conventional locator which would ignore the added broadband signal, to find the sonde without difficulty. However, a more sophisticated locator can be provided that will analyze the attenuation pattern of the broadband waveform relative to the primary frequency and determine the composition of the pipe containing the sonde, e.g. plastic versus cast iron. Such a sophisticated locator could also determine soil composition, density and moisture content. Other forms of modulation, such as frequency modulation or phase modulation, could be used to accomplish similar objectives.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Using a square wave to drive one of the sondes generates a sine wave at the fundamental frequency of the sonde, in addition to all of the odd harmonics (or odd integer multiples) of the fundamental frequency. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates a drive waveform produced by clipping after analog multiplication which reduces harmonic content in the waveform and thereby increases the amount of energy available for detection by a conventional locator. This is accomplished by decreasing the amount of energy that is dissipated out-of-band. Since a conventional locator only detects energy over a narrow frequency range, energy in the harmonics is wasted.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a three state waveform generated with intelligent clipping that has a 512 Hz component, a modulated 8,192 Hz component, and 32,768 Hz component, with minimized spurious harmonics. This technique can be used to either determine the composition of the pipe containing the sonde or the soil. It also allows a locator to find the sonde using any of these frequencies. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> also illustrates amplitude modulation of one of the output frequencies by a sub-harmonic. Signals having a waveform such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> can be used to drive the coil of a sonde or can be directly connected to a wire to search for jacket defects or to a pipe to find coating holidays. The concepts described in the past several paragraphs are not limited to use in sondes but are also applicable to use in transmitters used to locate pipes and cables via line tracing.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">While we have described and illustrated several embodiments of an improved sonde, variations and modifications thereof will occur to those skilled in the art. For example, a sonde could be constructed incorporating our improvements that would utilize electronic drive circuit means including a motor that rotates permanent magnets to generate electromagnetic signals at very low frequencies, such as 4 Hz, which can be difficult to generate with conventional electrical circuitry. Low frequencies are particularly useful in the case where the pipe in which the sonde will be located is made of ductile iron. Therefore the protection afforded our invention should only be limited in accordance with the scope of the following claims.</p>
