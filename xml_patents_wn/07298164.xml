<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a test circuit of the display and, more particularly, to a test circuit of the liquid crystal display (LCD).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is two mainly test structures in the traditional thin-film transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT-LCD): one is full contact test and the other is shorting bar test.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a traditional structure of the full contact test. The test circuit includes a plurality of scanning lines <b>101</b> and a plurality of data lines <b>102</b>, and the scanning lines and the data lines are vertically crossed each other. The test structure includes two input signals to test the circuit; one is an image signal <b>103</b> and the other is a scanning signal <b>104</b>, and these two signals test the circuit by the respective test points <b>105</b> and <b>105</b>′. The working mode is when the scanning signal <b>104</b> opens one of the scanning lines <b>101</b>, the image signal tests the points between the previous scanning line and each data lines <b>102</b> one by one. Even the full contact test can receive the whole test information, it is necessary to have different test platform when the size of the panels is different. The cost of production is increased and this is a big limitation of the production of the smallest corrective structure in the test platform, such as the full contact test.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a traditional structure of the shorting bar test. Wherein the test structure is the same as the previous test structure, and also includes a plurality of scanning lines <b>201</b> and a plurality of data lines <b>202</b>. And there are two input signals in the test structure: the image signal <b>203</b> and the scanning signal <b>204</b>. These two signals test the circuit by the respective test point <b>205</b> and <b>205</b>′. The difference is the shorting bar used a fixed amount of the data lines to connect the metal lines <b>206</b> and <b>206</b>′ in the production process, and improve the problem that the accuracy is not enough in the test platform. There is a shorting bar test method disclosed in the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 5,825,196. At first, the first sub-pixel is connected to the first shorting bar, the second sub-pixel is connected to the second shorting bar, the third sub-pixel is connected to the third shorting bar, and then the signal is provided only to the first shorting bar. This picture is showing the color what the first sub-pixel should be displayed. And the signal is provided to the second shorting bar and the third shorting bar in sequence. Therefore, the drawback can be found. However, the simplification of the design causes the detail of the picture cannot be tested. The completeness of the test value is questionable. Moreover, after the test is done, the places of short must be opened by laser or other methods. It will increase the burden of the production process and has unpredictable result.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the previous description, it is necessary to have a test structure used in the display device. It can have accurate test by the need, and solve the problem of the difficulty of the productive standard in the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The purpose of the present invention is to provide a test system in a display device, and achieve the sharing of the test platform by the design of the multiplex control circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another purpose of the present invention is to provide a test system and achieve the accurate test, such as full contact test or fast test like shorting bar, of a display device.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The following is the detail description of the present invention. It should be noted and appreciated that the process steps and structures described below do not cover a complete process flow and structure. The present invention can be practiced in conjunction with various fabrication techniques that are used in the art, and only so much of the commonly practiced process steps are included herein as are necessary to provide an understanding of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The test system of the display of the present invention includes a plurality of first test points in the substrate and is electrically connected to the driving circuit. Wherein the driving circuit is electrically connected to a plurality of signal lines, and a plurality of first test points are respectively passed through the switches and are electrically connected to the second test points. The numbers of the second test points are less than which of the first test points. After the test was done, there is an input signal into the switch to turn off the connection between the test point and the driving circuit. Another application of the present invention is a driving circuit with a plurality of IC pads passed through the switches and connected to the test points. The numbers of the test points are less than the numbers of the IC pads.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">One of the embodiments of the present invention is showing a test system of a display in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The driving circuit is connected to the picture display region <b>304</b> to transfer the image signals by the chosen test points. The choice of the test point is based on the need of the users. For example, when the user needs higher quality test, there are more test points being used. When the user considers the cost of the test, there are less test points being used. It should be noted that the multiplex control circuit <b>301</b> is not intended to limit at here. It could be a combination of a plurality of the multiplex control circuit, and there is at least one path to transfer the image signal to the test point and switch in each multiplex control circuit. And each image signal can be transferred to the multiplexer <b>303</b> and the multiplex control circuit <b>301</b> can provide a perfect interface, which is used to drive and switch signals and respectively transfer to the scanning driving circuit <b>302</b> and the multiplexer <b>303</b>. The scanning driving circuit <b>301</b> is disposed in the glass plate and provides the parallel scanning and sequence signals by the driving signal of the scanning driving circuit <b>301</b>. And the driving signal can also be inputted to the scanning driving circuit <b>302</b> by itself. The multiplexer <b>303</b> collects the test signals by using the switching signal of the multiplex control circuit <b>301</b> and transfers the image signal to the picture display region <b>304</b>. The picture display region <b>304</b> determines the position of the display picture by the driving signal of the driving circuit <b>302</b> and the test signal from multiplexer <b>303</b>. And the picture would be shown by the image signals from multiplexer <b>303</b>. It should be noted that the pixel units are not shown in the picture display region. However, one of ordinary skill in the art should know a complete dots matrix display and the structure of the surrounding circuit. A plurality of signal lines includes the signal carrying different color signals. For example, when the test signals are transferred from the test points to the multiplexer and the test signal was inputted to a signal line by the multiplexer, there are usually three sets to display the red signal, green signal or blue signal in the signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a view drawing illustrating the multiplexer <b>42</b> and a portion circuit of the multiplex control circuit in the test system of the display. The multiplexer <b>42</b> includes IC pad set <b>421</b> for using electrically connected to the panel. The IC pad sets includes a plurality IC pads whose number is determined by the resolution of the picture display region and the pitch is determined by the size of IC. In order to simplify the description, the following example will use IC pad <b>4211</b> and IC pad <b>4212</b> to describe. In the drawing, the test point set <b>411</b>, test point set <b>413</b>, test point set <b>415</b>, and test point set <b>417</b> of the multiplexer control circuit are not showing all of the test points. There are only test point <b>4111</b> and test point <b>4112</b> being chosen in the following description. And the switch set <b>412</b>, switch set <b>414</b>, and switch set <b>416</b> are not shown all of the switches, and there are only switch <b>4121</b> and switch <b>4122</b> being chosen in the following description. The number of the test point set <b>411</b> and the IC pad set <b>421</b> are the same and are corresponding each other. It should be noted that the interval of the test points <b>4111</b> and test points <b>4112</b> is flexible and adjustable. A proper interval is adjusted within the useful region to provide the probe card test in a system. For example, when the production of the probe card is hard to fix 30 mm of the interval of the test point set, the test point set <b>411</b> adjust its interval to be 50 mm to fix the productive standard of the probe card. Moreover, when the test method is to input image signals from the probe card to the test point set <b>411</b>, it is substantially identical to the method of the full contact test. The method is not only to test the drawback of the pixel by the monocolor picture but also to achieve the purpose of test quality of the panel by showing the gray scale, cross talk, or flicker pattern in the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">And the switch set <b>412</b> is controlled by the control circuit <b>418</b>. The switch set is electrically connected to the test point set <b>411</b> and the test point set <b>413</b>. For example, the test point <b>4111</b> is through the switch <b>4121</b> electrically connected to the test point <b>4131</b>. The switch <b>4121</b>, in the present embodiment of the invention, can be an NMOS TFT device or a PMOS TFT device. It is not limited that the test point set <b>411</b> is through the switch set <b>412</b> electrically connected to the test point set <b>413</b>. In the present embodiment, the test point <b>4111</b> and test point <b>4112</b> are through the switch <b>4121</b> and switch <b>4122</b> electrically connected to the test point <b>4113</b>, respectively. Therefore, the number of the test point set <b>413</b> is half of the number of the test point set <b>411</b>. Of course, the number of the test point set <b>413</b> may also be one third of the number of the test point set <b>411</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the present embodiment, the test point set <b>511</b> includes test points <b>5111</b>, test points <b>5112</b>, and test points <b>5113</b>. The test points <b>5111</b>, test points <b>5112</b>, and test points <b>5113</b> are through the switches <b>5121</b>, switches <b>5122</b> and switches <b>5123</b> of the switch set <b>512</b> electrically connected to the test point <b>5131</b>, respectively. It should be noted from the structure that the number of the test point set <b>513</b> is one third of the number of the test point set <b>511</b>. That means that the test point set <b>511</b> and test point set <b>513</b> are connected by the switch, but the number of the test point set <b>513</b> is determined by the need of the customers. For example, when the customers need more accurate reports to maintain the quality of the products, more test point sets can be used (such as test point set <b>511</b>). Or when customers request to reduce the cost of the production and only want to test the main function of the products, then fewer test point sets can be used (such as test point sets <b>513</b>). Therefore, the numbers of the test points are determined by the test function of the completeness and the test speed. Furthermore, to develop a layer structure control signals are included in the applications of the present invention. Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the test point set <b>413</b> is through the switch set <b>414</b> electrically connected to the test point set <b>415</b> and the test point set <b>415</b> is through the switch set <b>416</b> electrically connected to the test point set <b>417</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The test mode signal <b>419</b> is inputted into the control circuit <b>418</b> to determine which test point set can be use. In the present embodiment of the invention, the test point set <b>411</b> is used to test and the multiplex output <b>1</b>, multiplex output <b>2</b> and multiplex output <b>3</b> of the control circuit are not activated. In another embodiment of the present invention, the test point set <b>413</b> is used to test, and multiplex output <b>2</b> and multiplex output <b>3</b> of the control circuit are not activated. For example, when the switch sets <b>412</b>, switch set <b>414</b>, and switch set <b>416</b> are the switches consist of NMOS, the test mode signal <b>419</b> is a high voltage (logic 1), the multiplex output <b>1</b> is closed (short), the multiplex output <b>2</b> and the multiplex output <b>3</b> are opened disconnected. It should be noted from the circuit structure that the switch <b>4121</b> and switch <b>4122</b> are turned on, and the test point <b>4111</b> and test point <b>4112</b> are short to be connected to the test point <b>4131</b>. It is appreciated that the test mode signal is used to determine which test point being used to test in the present invention. And the test mode signal <b>419</b> is limited to be usually in high voltage (logic 1). For example, when the switch signal is a PMOS, the test mode signal <b>419</b> is in low voltage (logic 0).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, is another embodiment of the present invention, the multiplexer includes IC pads for using electrically connected to the contact windows of the other systems. The IC pad set <b>421</b> includes a plurality of IC pads. In order to simplify the description, there are only IC pad <b>4211</b>, IC pad <b>4212</b>, IC pad <b>4213</b>, and IC pad <b>4214</b> described herein. The multiplex control circuit <b>61</b> includes a switch set <b>6111</b>, switch set <b>6112</b>, switch set <b>6113</b>, switch set <b>6114</b>, and the test point <b>6121</b> to describe. The control signal turns on the switch <b>611</b> in the present embodiment, and the switch <b>6111</b>, switch <b>6112</b>, switch <b>6113</b> and switch <b>6114</b> are conducted. And the IC pad <b>4211</b>, IC pad <b>4212</b>, IC pad <b>4213</b>, and IC pad <b>4214</b> are through the switch <b>6111</b>, switch <b>6112</b>, switch <b>6113</b>, and switch <b>6114</b> electrically conducted to the test point <b>6121</b>. Finally, the test signal is inputted into the test point <b>6121</b>. It is necessary to describe that there is no limited through the switch sets electrically connected to the IC pad sets and test points. There may be two or five IC pads electrically connected to a test point. How many IC pads needed to be connected is determined by the users' need of the quality of the products and the cost of the test. And the multiplexer can be made by the low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) process to form on the substrate.</p>
