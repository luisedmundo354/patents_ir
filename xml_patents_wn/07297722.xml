<p id="p-0005" num="0014">Recently, there is an increasing interest in polymeric materials having nano-sized spherical structures, and their applications are extended to electro-, bio- and functional polymers and other additives.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0015">According to a recent tendency of reduction in a metal line pitch resulting from high-density integration of semiconductor devices, several problems including propagation delay, cross talk, power dissipation, etc., may occur. To solve such problems, a method of reducing RC (resistance×capacitance) delay may be considered first of all. Particularly, used is a method of reducing resistance of a metal line material and reducing conductance between metal lines. For the purpose of carrying out such a method, copper (Cu) with good conductivity is generally used as a metal line material. Otherwise, materials with good insulation property are generally used between metal lines. Most insulating materials that are currently used are formed of silicon oxides having a dielectric constant of 4.0. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the dielectric constant to 2.2, preferably to 2.0, or less.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0016">A method for introducing pores into an insulating film has been researched so as to obtain a thin insulating film having a dielectric constant of 2.2 or less. A material used for such pore generation is referred to as a porogen (or pore generator: pore-generating organic polymer), which generates pores particularly by calcination. Linear polymeric polycaprolactone and polyacrylate, branched polyester having multiple side-branches, etc., have been used as pore generators. However, they are not suitable for such use and thus there is a need to improve them.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0017">In the case of branched polymer or dendrimer used for generating pores, it is difficult to control the molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, microstructure, etc., and thus to generate micropores having a uniform size. Additionally, although there is an example that crosslinked nanoparticles have been used to form nanopores, it is also found to be difficult to form nanoparticles having a uniform size. Moreover, there is a possibility of pyrolysis residues being present.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSER OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0021">Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel radially multi-branched polymer that is prepared with ease, and has a narrow molecular weight distribution and an easily controllable fine nano-structure. It is another object of the present invention to provide an insulating film obtained by using the above-described radially multi-branched polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0022">Although conventional pore generators have a linear or bar-shaped structure, the present inventors intended to provide a pore generator having a spherical structure if possible, so as to inhibit phase separation, to generate pores having a small size and uniform distribution and to improve the strength and/or dielectric constant of an insulating film.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0023">In order to provide a pore generator having a spherical structure, a pore generator consists of a central molecule and side-branches. A benzyl group is selected as a central molecule, because it shows a high reactivity upon bonding of side-branches and is capable of free rotation, and thus provides a uniform molecular weight distribution and improved productivity and facilitates mass production. Further, side-branches are bonded to the central molecule as symmetrically as possible, a pore generation material having a spherical structure is provided and one example is a radially multi-branched polymer represented by the following formula (I).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0024">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a radially multi-branched polymer having a central molecule (A) to which side-branches (B) are bonded in at least three positions, wherein the radially multi-branched polymer is represented by the following formula (I) and has a polyalkylene oxide, a polyacrylate, a polyester, a polyamide or a derivatives thereof as a side-branch. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a low dielectric insulating film obtained by using the radially multi-branched polymer as a porogen:

<p id="p-0018" num="0037">When an organopolysiloxane and a porogen are dissolved in an organic solvent to form a solution, it is preferable that both components are mixed well with each other. The most important factor for such mixing is the interaction between both components. Therefore, suitable heteroatoms as described above have to be used in positions of R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>4</sub>, Q, W, Z, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0038">The radially multi-branched polymer according to the present invention has an average molecular weight of 500 to 100,000, preferably 500 to 50,000. When the molecular weight is less than 500, efficient pore generation cannot be accomplished. On the other hand, when the molecular weight is greater than 100,000, compatibility with a matrix resin decreases and micropores having a very small size is hardly formed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0039">According to simulation works, when the molecular weight is 10,000 or more, stereostructural shape of the radially multi-branched polymer is changed from a sphere into an ellipsoid. Therefore, it is more preferable that the radially multi-branched polymer has a spherical structure and a molecular weight of 500 to 10,000.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0040">Meanwhile, side-branches having a low molecular weight can provide a porogen having a low molecular weight, while side-branches having a high molecular weight can provide a porogen having a high molecular weight. For example, side-branches having a molecular weight of about 340 can provide a hexa-branched porogen having a molecular weight of about 3500. For another example, side-branches having a molecular weight of about 1,000 can provide a porogen having a molecular weight of about 10,000. It is possible to control molecular weight in this manner for a tri-, tetra- and penta-branched porogens, too. Further, pores with various sizes may be formed by varying the molecular weight of a porogen. For example, a hexa-branched porogen represented by formula (I), and having a molecular weight of about 3500 may form pores having a size of about 2 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0041">Additionally, the radially multi-branched polymer has at least three branches, preferably at least four branches and more preferably at least six branches. It is preferable that the radially multi-branched polymer includes symmetrically linked side-branches in order to provide a spherical structure. The more the branches are, the more the structure approaches a sphere. Further, as the number of branches increases, the polymer branches are limited in movement, thereby inhibiting phase separation. Therefore, it is possible to form a microporous insulating film having a small size and uniform distribution. According to calculation of molecular structures, a hexa-branched polymer is shown to have a three-dimensional spherical structure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0042">The radially multi-branched polymer porogen represented by formula (I) according to the present invention may be prepared by any known synthetic procedures including a nucleophilic substitution reaction represented by the following reaction scheme 1 or 2; a nucleophilic substitution reaction, followed by a benzene ring formation reaction in the presence of a metal catalyst such as Co<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>8 </sub>(reaction scheme 3); or an esterification reaction represented by the following reaction scheme 4 or 5.</p>

<heading id="h-0031" level="1">Evaluation of Insulating Films Comprising Linear Porogen and Radially Multi-branched Porogens</heading>
<p id="p-0097" num="0116">In order to compare physical properties of an insulating films manufactured by using a linear porogen with those of an insulating film manufactured by using a radially multi-branched polymer porogen, the following experiment was performed.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0117">Insulating films manufactured by using the radially multi-branched polymer porogens according to Examples 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were used. Additionally, insulating films of Comparative Examples 1 to 3 manufactured by using a linear porogen and a tetra-branched porogen prepared according to Korean Patent Application No. 2002-80196, as control. The condition of each cured insulating film was observed with an optical microscope and an electron microscope. Further, dielectric characteristics of each film were determined by measuring the dielectric constant in the manner of MIS (metal/insulator/semiconductor).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0118">The cured film of Comparative Example 1 using a linear polypropyleneglycol dibutyl ether having a molecular weight of 3500 as a porogen showed a slight striation pattern and partial phase separation, and thus a completely transparent film cannot be obtained. Similarly, the cured film using a tetra-branched porogen of Comparative Example 2 showed a slight striation pattern and partial phase separation, and thus a completely transparent film cannot be obtained. Additionally, the cured film using a tetra-branched porogen of Comparative Example 3 showed a clear striation pattern and complete phase separation (See, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). On the other hand, each of the cured films manufactured by using porogens according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention was a transparent film having excellent coatability with no phase separation (See, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0119">Further, as can be seen from the following Table 3, the cured film of Example 2 using a sphere-shaped radially hexa-branched polypropyleneglycol ether as a porogen has excellent film coatability and non-phase separation behavior compared to Comparative Example 1 using a linear polypropyleneglycol ether, even though both porogens have a similar molecular weight. Moreover, when insulating films according to Example 2 and Comparative Example 1 are manufactured to have a similar dielectric constant, insulating film of Example 2 shows higher strength. Similarly, when insulating films according to Example 6 and Comparative Example 2 (each using a tetra-branched porogen) are manufactured to have a similar dielectric constant, insulating film of Example 6 shows higher strength. Meanwhile, the cured film of Comparative Example 3 obtained by using a tetra-branched porogen showed complete phase separation and thus it was not possible to measure the dielectric constant and strength.</p>
