<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-066121 filed Mar. 9, 2005, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a piston operable to force frictional coupling elements of a clutch or brake device provided in an automatic transmission, against each other to place the clutch or brake device in its engaged state.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A known automatic transmission includes clutches and brakes each of which is provided with frictional coupling elements in the form of a plurality of friction plates, so that the automatic transmission is automatically shifted by selectively engaging and releasing the clutches and brakes. The frictional coupling elements are forced against each other by a piston, to place each clutch or brake in its engaged state. JP-9-32919A and JP-10-89380A disclose an example of such a piston, which includes two piston members, namely, a first piston member forming a cylindrical portion of the piston, and a second piston member forming a bottom portion of the piston. In the piston disclosed in those publications, the first piston member has axial cutouts formed in one of its opposite axial end portions, while the second piston member has engaging jaws fitted in the axial cutouts, and a retainer ring is fitted in a circumferential groove formed in the inner circumferential surface of the first piston member, in contact with the second piston member, so that the first and second piston members are fixed to each other into the piston. The circumferential groove consists of a plurality of arcuate grooves that are spaced apart from each other by the axial cutouts in the circumferential direction of the first piston member.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the piston disclosed in JP-9-32919A, an axial movement of the piston causes a load to be applied from the second piston member to the circumferential groove of the first piston member through the retainer ring. The engaging formed on the second piston member extend in the radial direction of the piston and are abuttable onto the retainer ring, so that the load is applied from the engaging jaws to the retainer ring upon the axial movement of the piston. The retainer ring is merely fitted in the circumferential groove of the first piston member, in contact with the second piston member having the engaging jaws fitted in the axial cutouts of the first piston member, without any member supporting the retainer ring on its side remote from the engaging jaws, the application of the load from the second piston member to the circumferential groove of the first piston member through the retainer ring causes a stress concentration on the portions of the circumferential groove that are adjacent to the axial cutouts in the circumferential direction of the first piston member. Accordingly, those portions of the circumferential groove tend to elastically deform due to the stress concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To prevent the elastic deformation of the circumferential groove of the first piston member in the piston of JP-9-32919A, therefore, the retainer ring must have a sufficiently large thickness, undesirably resulting in an increase in the size of the piston.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention was made in the light of the background art discussed above. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a small-sized piston for an automatic transmission, which includes a first piston member forming its cylindrical portion and a second piston member forming its bottom portion that are fixed to each other by a retainer ring.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object indicated above may be achieved according to the principle of the present invention, which provides a piston for an automatic transmission, comprising: a first piston member forming a cylindrical portion of the piston and having a plurality of axial cutouts and a circumferential groove formed in one axial end portion thereof; a second piston member forming a bottom portion of the piston and having a plurality of radially extending engaging jaws fitted in the plurality of axial cutouts; and a retainer ring which is fitted in the circumferential groove and held in abutting contact with the engaging jaws, whereby the first and second piston members are fixed to each other, and wherein at least one of the plurality of engaging jaws of the second piston member cooperates with the retainer ring to form a gap therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the piston of the present invention constructed as described above, at least one of the radially extending engaging jaws of the second piston member held in abutting contact with the retainer ring cooperates with the retainer ring to form or define the gap therebetween. In the presence of this gap, a load is not applied to the retainer ring from the engaging jaws, that is, from the circumferential portions of the second piston member which correspond to the axial cutouts, when the retainer ring is forced by the second piston member upon an axial movement of the piston. Accordingly, the gap formed between the engaging jaw and the retainer ring prevents a stress concentration on the portions of the circumferential groove of the first piston member which are adjacent to the axial cutouts, so that the required thickness of the retainer ring can be reduced, leading to size reduction of the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first preferred form of this invention, each of the above-indicated at least one of the plurality of engaging jaws has a shoulder portion including a radially outer part and a radially inner part which are formed such that the radially outer part is spaced from the radially inner part in an axial direction of the second piston member away from the retainer ring, the shoulder portion cooperating with the retainer ring to form said gap.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a second preferred form of this invention, axially inner ends of the plurality of axial cutouts are defined by respective radial end surfaces which are parallel to a radial direction of the first piston member and which are spaced apart from the circumferential groove in an axial direction of the first piston member away from axially outer ends of the axial cutouts, the plurality of engaging jaws consisting of at least one elastically biasing jaw which is inclined in the axial direction of the second piston member toward the radial end surfaces and each of which is held in abutting contact with the radial end surface of a corresponding one of the plurality of axial cutouts, and at least one non-elastically-biasing jaw which is not held in abutting contact with the radial end surface of the corresponding axial cutout, each of the at least one non-elastically-biasing jaw cooperating with the retainer ring to define a first gap therebetween, while each of the at least one elastically biasing jaw cooperating with the retainer ring to define a second gap therebetween, a dimension of the first gap in the axial direction of the piston being smaller than a dimension of the second gap in the axial direction of the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the piston according to the second preferred form of the invention, each elastically biasing jaw inclined in the axial direction of the second piston member toward the radial end surface of the corresponding axial cutout is held in abutting contact with the radial end surface, so that the first piston member is axially biased by each elastically biasing jaw. The at least one elastically biasing jaw is effective to minimize a relative axial rattling displacement of the first and second piston members of the piston, which would take place due to dimensional errors of the piston members even where the dimensional errors are held within predetermined tolerances. Accordingly, the at least one elastically biasing jaw reduces a degree of deterioration of durability of the first piston member and frictional coupling elements (friction plates) of a clutch or brake device, which may take place due to unnecessary abutting contacts of the first piston member with the frictional coupling elements. Therefore, the at least one elastically biasing jaw is effective to reduce a power loss of the automatic transmission due to a dragging phenomenon of the clutch or brake device in which the frictional coupling elements are forced against each other by the piston while the clutch or brake device is not required to be placed in its engaged state.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The piston according to the second preferred form of the invention is further advantageous owing to the axial dimension of the first gap formed between the non-elastically-biasing jaw and the radially outer end portion of the retainer ring, which axial dimension is smaller than the axial dimension of the second gap formed between the elastically biasing jaw in the form of the second engaging jaw and the retainer ring. This dimensional relationship between the first and second gaps is advantageous upon assembling of the first and second piston members. Namely, the elastic and non-elastically-biasing jaw may deform during the assembling, due to a relative axial movement of the first and second piston members. Even in the event of this deformation of the elastic and non-elastically-biasing jaw biasing jaws, the non-elastically-biasing jaw are brought into abutting contact with the retainer ring before the elastically biasing jaws are brought into abutting contact with the retainer ring. When the non-elastically-biasing jaw is brought into abutting contact with the retainer ring, the first piston member is prevented from being further moved in the axial direction relative to the second piston member, so that subsequent elastic deformation of the elastically biasing jaw is prevented, whereby plastic deformation of the elastically biasing jaw is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Although at least one of the plurality of engaging jaws (two or more engaging jaws) of the second piston member is required to cooperate with the retainer ring to form a gap therebetween, it is desirable that all of the engaging jaws cooperate with the retainer ring to form respective gaps therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the piston according to the first preferred form of the invention, the radially outer and inner parts of the shoulder portion are formed such that the radially outer part is spaced apart from the radially inner part in the axial direction of the second piston member away from the retainer ring. In this case, each engaging jaw which partly defines the gap may have a thickness equal to the thickness of the respect of the second piston member. However, the gap may be formed between the retainer ring and a portion of the engaging jaw which has a smaller thickness than the other portion of the engaging jaw. The shoulder portion of the engaging jaw may be formed by forming the second piston member by bending a planar blank or workpiece by a press-forming operation, for example, or by machining a blank or workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each of the above-indicated at least one of the plurality of engaging jaws may consist of a single straight portion which extends radially outwardly of the second piston member and which is bent at a proximal end thereof with respect to a radial direction of the second piston member such that a distal end of the single straight portion is spaced from the proximal end in an axial direction of the second piston member away from said retainer ring.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The inner end of the gap as seen in the radial direction of the second piston member may be located outwards of the inner circumferential surface of the first piston member in which the circumferential groove is formed. However, the inner end of the gas is preferably located inwards of the inner circumferential surface of the first piston member. This arrangement is effective to reduce the stress concentration on the circumferential portions of the circumferential groove that are adjacent to the axial cutouts. If the inner end of the gap is located considerably inwards of the inner circumferential surface of the first piston member, the surface area of the engaging jaw in abutting contact with the retainer ring is accordingly reduced, so that the load to be applied to the retainer ring from the second piston member is not uniform in the circumferential direction of the retainer ring. Therefore, the inner end of the gap is preferably located inwards of the inner circumferential surface of the first piston member, but as close as possible to the inner circumferential surface of the first piston member.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The at least one elastically biasing jaw provided in the piston according to the second preferred form of the invention need not be provided according to the principle of this invention. In the second preferred form, the at least one elastically biasing jaw is provided as well as the at least one non-elastically-biasing jaw. Each elastically biasing jaw is inclined in the axial direction of the second piston member toward the radial end surface of the corresponding axial cutout. Namely, each elastically biasing jaw includes the radially outer and inner parts which are formed such that the radially outer part is spaced from the radially inner part in the axial direction of the second piston member toward the radial end surface and away from the retainer ring. The elastically biasing jaw may have the shoulder portion provided in the first preferred form of the invention described above, or may consist of the single straight portion described above. Irrespective of the configuration of the elastically biasing jaw, the gap is formed between this elastically biasing jaw and the retainer ring, and the elastically biasing jaw functions as the at least one engaging jaw provided according to the principle of the present invention described above. The engaging jaw is considered to be the elastically biasing jaw when the amount of gap partially defined by the engaging jaw in abutting contact with the radial end surface is relatively large. In other words, the amount of gap partially defined by the elastically biasing jaw is larger than that partially defined by the non-elastically-biasing jaw.</p>

The input shaft <b>22</b> is a turbine shaft of a torque converter driven by a drive power source such as an engine of an automotive vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The clutch drum <b>16</b> consists of a radially inner boss portion <b>26</b> and a radially outer drum portion <b>28</b>. The radially inner boss portion <b>26</b> is a generally cylindrical member which has a substantially constant outside diameter and which is fitted on an axially extending cylindrical portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the casing <b>24</b>. The radially inner boss portion <b>26</b> includes a thin-walled axial end portion <b>26</b><i>a </i>on the side of the radially inner piston <b>20</b>.

The flange portion <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the input shaft <b>22</b> and the tapered and stepped portion <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the axial end portion <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the radially inner boss <b>26</b> cooperate to partially define an oil sump <b>30</b>, which is formed radially inwardly of the tapered and stepped portion <b>26</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The radially outer drum portion <b>28</b> is a cylindrical member consisting of an inner cylindrical portion <b>28</b><i>a</i>, an outer cylindrical portion <b>28</b><i>c</i>, and an annular bottom portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>which connects the corresponding axial ends of the inner and outer cylindrical portions <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>c</i>. The radially outer drum portion <b>28</b> is closed at its one axial end by the annular bottom portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>and is open at the other axial end.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The inner cylindrical portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>is fitted on the thin-walled axial end portion <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the radially inner boss portion <b>26</b>, and the end face of the inner cylindrical portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>which is on the side of the radially inner piston <b>20</b> is flush with the corresponding end face of the axial end portion <b>26</b><i>a</i>. The radially inner boss portion <b>26</b> and radially outer drum portion <b>28</b> are welded to each other at the inner circumferential surface of the inner cylindrical portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>and the outer circumferential surface of the axial end portion <b>26</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the radially outer drum portion <b>28</b> as well as the radially inner boss portion <b>26</b> is rotated with the input shaft <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The annular bottom portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>of the radially outer drum portion <b>28</b> extends generally in the radial direction of the input shaft <b>22</b>, and is connected at its radially inner end to the axial end of the inner cylindrical portion <b>28</b><i>a </i>which is on the side of the radially outer clutch piston <b>18</b>. The outer cylindrical portion <b>28</b><i>c </i>extends from the radially outer end of the annular bottom portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>in the axial direction (in the right direction as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The outer cylindrical portion <b>28</b><i>c </i>holds a plurality of inwardly extending friction plates <b>32</b> of the first set of frictional coupling elements <b>12</b>, and a plurality of inwardly extending friction plates <b>38</b> of the second set of frictional coupling elements <b>14</b>, such that the friction plates <b>32</b> are splined to a portion of the inner circumferential surface of the outer cylindrical portion <b>28</b><i>c</i>, which portion is relatively near the axial open end of the outer cylindrical portion <b>28</b><i>c</i>, and such that the friction plates <b>38</b> are splined to a portion of the inner circumferential surface which is relatively near the annular bottom portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>and relatively remote from the above-indicated axial open end. The friction plates <b>32</b>, <b>38</b> extend from the inner circumferential surface of the outer cylindrical portion <b>28</b><i>c </i>in the radially inward direction of the clutch drum <b>16</b>. The first set of frictional coupling elements <b>12</b> consist of the above-indicated inwardly extending friction plates <b>32</b> and a plurality of outwardly extending friction plates <b>34</b>, which are alternately arranged in the axial direction of the clutch drum <b>16</b>. Similarly, the second set of frictional coupling elements <b>14</b> consist of the above-indicated inwardly extending friction plates <b>38</b> and a plurality of outwardly extending friction plates <b>40</b>, which are alternately arranged in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The outwardly extending friction plates <b>34</b> of the first set of frictional coupling elements <b>12</b> are splined to the outer circumferential surface of a ring gear <b>36</b> of the automatic transmission <b>8</b> which functions as a clutch hub. The outwardly extending friction plates <b>40</b> of the second set of frictional coupling elements <b>14</b> are splined to the outer circumferential surface of a clutch hub <b>42</b>. The clutch hub <b>42</b> is fixedly fitted at its inner circumferential surface on a sun gear <b>44</b> which is fixedly fitted on the input shaft <b>22</b>, so that the clutch hub <b>42</b> is rotated with the sun gear <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The radially outer piston <b>18</b> consists of: a first piston member <b>46</b> which is disposed radially outwardly of the outer cylindrical portion <b>28</b><i>c </i>of the radially outer drum portion <b>28</b> and which forms a cylindrical portion of the piston <b>18</b>; an annular second piston member <b>48</b> which engages one of the opposite axial end portions of the first piston member <b>46</b> and which forms a bottom portion of the piston <b>18</b>; and a retainer ring <b>50</b> which is fixed to the above-indicated one axial end portion of the first piston member <b>46</b> and which is provided to prevent removal of the second piston member <b>48</b> from the first piston member <b>46</b>. The retainer ring <b>50</b> is fitted at its radially outer portion in a circumferential groove <b>51</b> formed in the inner circumferential surface of the first piston member <b>46</b>. The circumferential groove <b>51</b> consists of a plurality of arcuate grooves which are spaced apart from each other by a plurality of axial cutouts <b>68</b> (which will be described) in the circumferential direction of the first piston member <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The second piston member <b>48</b> of the radially outer piston <b>18</b> is axially slidable at its inner circumferential surface on the radially inner boss portion <b>26</b>. The second piston member <b>48</b> and the annular bottom portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>of the radially outer drum portion <b>28</b> cooperate to define a first hydraulic pressure chamber <b>52</b> to which a working oil is fed through an oil passage <b>54</b> formed through the radially inner boss portion <b>26</b>, so that the radially outer piston <b>18</b> is axially movable such that the second piston member <b>48</b> is moved away from the annular bottom portion <b>28</b><i>b </i>of the radially outer drum portion <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">On one of opposite axial sides of the second piston member <b>48</b> which is remote from the first hydraulic pressure chamber <b>52</b>, there is disposed a balancer <b>58</b> such that the balancer <b>58</b> is fitted at its inner circumferential surface on the outer circumferential surface of the radially inner boss portion <b>26</b>. The balancer <b>58</b> cooperates with the second piston member <b>48</b> of the radially outer piston <b>18</b> to define a second hydraulic pressure chamber <b>60</b>. A return spring <b>62</b> is interposed between the balancer <b>58</b> and the second piston member <b>48</b>, to bias the balancer <b>58</b> and second piston member <b>48</b> in opposite axial directions away from each other. The axial position of the balancer <b>58</b> biased by the return spring <b>62</b> in the axial direction away from the radially outer piston <b>18</b> is determined by abutting contact of the balancer <b>58</b> at its radially inner end portion with a retainer ring <b>64</b> fixed to the outer circumferential surface of the radially inner boss portion <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The radially inner boss portion <b>26</b> has an oil passage (not shown) for communication between the second hydraulic pressure chamber <b>60</b> and the oil sump <b>30</b>, so that the working oil is introduced into the second hydraulic pressure chamber <b>60</b> through this oil passage. Accordingly, the second hydraulic pressure chamber <b>60</b> functions as a canceling chamber for canceling a centrifugal hydraulic pressure developed in the first hydraulic pressure chamber <b>52</b>. The working oil is discharged from the second hydraulic pressure chamber <b>60</b> into a space on the axial side of the balancer <b>58</b> remote from the second hydraulic pressure chamber <b>60</b>, through an axial groove <b>65</b> formed through an axial portion of the radially boss portion <b>26</b> on which the balancer <b>58</b> is fitted.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first piston member <b>46</b> of the radially outer piston <b>18</b> is formed by pressing, and consists of a cylindrical portion <b>48</b><i>a </i>disposed radially outwardly of the outer cylindrical portion <b>28</b><i>c </i>of the radially outer drum portion <b>28</b>, and a presser portion <b>46</b><i>b </i>formed to extend from one axial end of the cylindrical portion <b>46</b><i>a </i>which is remote from the second piston member <b>48</b>. The presser portion <b>46</b><i>b </i>extends generally in the radially inward direction and is inclined in the axial direction toward the first set of frictional coupling elements <b>12</b>, such that the radially inner end of the presser portion <b>46</b><i>b </i>is opposed to the nearest friction plate <b>32</b> of the first set of frictional coupling elements <b>12</b>. When the first hydraulic pressure chamber <b>52</b> is not supplied with the pressurized working oil, there is left a small amount of clearance between the radially inner end of the pressure portion <b>46</b><i>b </i>and the above-indicated nearest friction plate <b>32</b>. The outer cylindrical portion <b>28</b><i>c </i>of the radially outer drum portion <b>28</b> has a retainer ring <b>56</b> fixed to its inner circumferential surface to prevent an axial movement of the first set of frictional coupling elements <b>12</b> toward the second set of frictional coupling elements <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring next to the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> taken in the direction of arrow-headed line A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown the second piston member <b>48</b> of the radially outer piston <b>18</b>. The second piston member <b>48</b> is also formed by pressing, and has a plurality of first engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a </i>and a plurality of second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b</i>, for example, four first engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a </i>and four second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b</i>, which extend radially outwardly from the outer circumference of the second piston member <b>48</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The first and second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b </i>are alternately arranged with a predetermined spacing distance in the circumferential direction of the second piston member <b>48</b>. These first and second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b </i>are collectively referred to simply as engaging jaws <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The cylindrical portion <b>46</b><i>a </i>of the first piston member <b>46</b> has the plurality of axial cutouts <b>68</b> indicated above, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> which is a view taken in a direction of arrow-headed line B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. These cutouts <b>68</b> are formed in an axial end part of the cylindrical portion <b>46</b><i>a </i>at which the first piston member <b>46</b> is fixed to the second piston member <b>48</b>. The cutouts <b>68</b> extend from the end of the above-indicated axial end part of the cylindrical portion <b>46</b><i>a</i>, in the axial direction of the first piston member <b>46</b>, and are formed through the wall thickness of the cylindrical portion <b>46</b><i>a</i>. The engaging jaws <b>66</b> of the second piston member <b>48</b> are held in engagement with the respective axial cutouts <b>68</b>, which are spaced apart from each other in the circumferential direction of the first piston member <b>46</b>, with the same spacing distance as the engaging jaws <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to the enlarged cross sectional views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, there are respectively shown one of the first engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a </i>and its vicinity, and one of the second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b </i>and its vicinity. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, each of the first and second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b </i>is bent in an axial direction of the first piston member <b>46</b> away from the retainer ring <b>50</b>, so that the thus bent first and second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b </i>provide respective first and second shoulder portions <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> on the side of the retainer ring <b>50</b>. The first and second shoulder portions <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> cooperate with the radially outer portion of the retainer ring <b>50</b> to define respective first and second gaps <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> therebetween. Each of the shoulder portions <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> includes a radially inner part and a radially outer part which are formed such that the radially outer part is spaced from the radially inner part in the axial direction of the second piston member <b>48</b> away from the retainer ring <b>50</b>. The second piston member <b>48</b> has a constant thickness in the radial direction. That is, the thickness of each engaging jaw <b>66</b> is equal to the thickness of the rest of the second piston member <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The amount of bending of the first engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a </i>is smaller than that of the second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b</i>, so that a dimension d<b>1</b> of the first gap <b>74</b> in the axial direction of the radially outer piston <b>18</b> is smaller than a dimension d<b>2</b> of the second gap <b>76</b> in the axial direction. In this arrangement, each first engaging jaw <b>66</b><i>a </i>is spaced apart from a radial end surface <b>68</b><i>a </i>which is parallel to the radial direction of the first piston member <b>46</b> and which defines the axially inner end of the corresponding axial cutout <b>68</b>. The radial end surface <b>78</b><i>a </i>is spaced apart from the circumferential groove <b>51</b> in the axial direction of the first piston member <b>46</b> away from the axially outer end of the corresponding axial cutout <b>68</b>. On the other hand, each second engaging jaw <b>66</b><i>b </i>is held in abutting contact with the radial end surface <b>68</b><i>a</i>, while biasing the first piston member <b>46</b> in the axial direction away from the retainer ring <b>50</b>, so that the second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b </i>function as elastically biasing jaws. In this respect, the first engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a </i>are referred to as non-elastically-biasing jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">If all of the engaging jaws <b>66</b> of the second piston member <b>48</b> were the first engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a</i>, without the second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b </i>functioning as the elastically biasing jaws, the first and second piston members <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> would be displaceable relative to each other in their axial direction by a distance equal to a gap S left between the radial end surfaces <b>68</b><i>a </i>and the engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a</i>. In the present embodiment, however, the second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b </i>the radially outer end portions of which are held in abutting contact with the radial end surfaces <b>68</b><i>a </i>bias the first piston member <b>46</b> in the axial direction, thereby minimizing or preventing a relative axial rattling displacement between the first and second piston members <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first and second shoulder portions <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> are located at different positions in the radial direction of the second piston member <b>48</b>, and the radially inner ends of the first and second gaps <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are accordingly located at different positions in the radial direction. Described in detail, the radially inner end of the first gap <b>74</b> is located slightly inwards of the inner circumferential surface of the cylindrical portion <b>46</b><i>a </i>of the first piston member <b>46</b> (in which the circumferential groove <b>51</b> is formed), while the radially inner end of the second gap <b>76</b> is located near and slightly outwards of the inner circumference of the retainer ring <b>50</b>. Since the radially inner end of the first gap <b>74</b> is located slightly inwards of the inner circumferential surface of the first piston member <b>46</b>, the amount of a load which is applied to the retainer ring <b>50</b> from the circumferential portions of the second piston member <b>48</b> corresponding to the first engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a </i>is almost equal to the amount of a load which is applied to the retainer ring <b>50</b> from the circumferential portions of the second piston member <b>48</b> not corresponding to the first and second jaws <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the load to be applied from the second piston member <b>48</b> to the retainer ring <b>50</b> is made more uniform in the circumferential direction of the retainer ring <b>50</b>, in the present embodiment than in an arrangement in which the radially inner ends of the first gaps <b>74</b> were located near or radially inwards of the inner circumference of the retainer ring <b>50</b>, like the radially inner ends of the second gaps <b>76</b>. The radial position of the radially inner ends of the second gaps <b>76</b> and the radial position of the second shoulder portions <b>72</b> are determined by a required elastic force to be generated by the second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b</i>, and may be located outwards of the radial positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, provided the elastic force to be generated is held within a predetermined suitable range.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the radially outer piston <b>18</b> according to the present embodiment of this invention, the first gaps <b>74</b> are formed between the first engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a </i>and the radially outer end portion of the retainer ring <b>50</b>, while the second gaps <b>76</b> are formed between the second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b </i>and the retainer ring <b>50</b>, so that the engaging jaws <b>66</b> do not force the retainer ring <b>50</b> upon application of an axial load from the second piston member <b>48</b> to the retainer ring <b>50</b> when the radially outer piston <b>18</b> is axially moved to engage the clutch device <b>10</b>. Therefore, the present radially outer piston <b>18</b> does not suffer from a stress concentration on the circumferential portions of the circumferential groove <b>51</b> of the first piston member <b>46</b> which are adjacent to the axial cutouts <b>68</b>, so that the thickness of the retainer ring <b>50</b> can be made comparatively small.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, the axial dimension d<b>1</b> of the first gaps <b>74</b> formed between the non-elastically-biasing jaws in the form of the first engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a </i>and the radially outer end portion of the retainer ring <b>50</b> is smaller than the axial dimension d<b>2</b> of the second gaps <b>76</b> formed between the elastically biasing jaws in the form of the second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b </i>and the retainer ring <b>50</b>. This dimensional relationship between the first and second gaps <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> is advantageous upon assembling of the first and second piston members <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. Namely, the first and second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b </i>may deform during the assembling, due to a relative axial movement of the first and second piston members <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. Even in the event of this deformation of the engaging jaws <b>66</b>, the first engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a </i>are brought into abutting contact with the retainer ring <b>50</b> before the second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b </i>are brought into abutting contact with the retainer ring <b>50</b>. When the first engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a </i>are brought into abutting contact with the retainer ring <b>50</b>, the first piston member <b>46</b> is prevented from being further moved in the axial direction relative to the second piston member <b>48</b>, so that subsequent elastic deformation of the second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b </i>is prevented, whereby plastic deformation of the second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b </i>is prevented, so that the second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b </i>can function as the elastically biasing jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is shown a second piston member <b>82</b> of a piston according to a second embodiment of this invention. The second piston member <b>82</b> has a plurality of first engaging jaws <b>80</b> one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this embodiment, each first engaging jaw <b>80</b> is inclined at its proximal end in the axial direction of the second piston member <b>82</b> away from the retainer ring <b>50</b>. This first engaging jaw <b>80</b> consists of a single straight portion which extends radially outwardly of the second piston member <b>82</b> and which is bent at its proximal end with respect to the radial direction of the second piston member <b>82</b> such that the distal end of the single straight portion is spaced from the proximal end in the axial direction away from the retainer ring <b>50</b>. The engaging jaw <b>80</b> is not considered to have a shoulder portion, in that the first engaging jaw <b>80</b> does not include a radial portion parallel to the radial direction of the second piston member <b>82</b>. In this embodiment, too, a gap <b>84</b> is formed between each first engaging jaw <b>80</b> and the radially outer end portion of the retainer ring <b>50</b>. The first engaging jaws <b>80</b> are held in abutting contact with the radial end surfaces <b>68</b><i>a</i>, and may be considered to function as elastically biasing jaws, like the second engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there is shown a second piston member <b>48</b> of a piston according to a third embodiment of this invention. The second piston member <b>48</b> in the third embodiment is constituted as same as the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> except a thickness of the engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a</i>. The engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a </i>has a smaller thickness than the other portion of the engaging jaws <b>66</b><i>a </i>and the second piston member <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the illustrated embodiments, the radially outer piston is used for the clutch device <b>10</b>, the principle of this invention is equally applicable to a piston used for a brake device of an automatic transmission of a vehicle.</p>
