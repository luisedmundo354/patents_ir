<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosures made herein relate generally to pet food and water dishes, and particularly to pet food and water dishes designed to provide food or water to pets when confined within and transported in a pet carrier or crate. The disclosures herein more particularly relate to pet food and water dishes which incorporate features to prevent contents from spilling over the side of the dish during transmit and which also provide a means of securely fastening the dish to the side of the pet carrier or crate.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Pet food and water dishes of various designs are known and are commonly used. Often pet owners or trainers choose to travel with their pet, sometimes perhaps to visit family, to travel to a distant destination for a vacation, or just perhaps to transport the animal from one location to another, perhaps even to a park or outdoor wooded location for exercise. Additionally, sometimes it may be necessary to transport a pet on public transportation. Pet owners transporting their pets using public transportation means such as planes, trains and busses usually have limited options in transporting their pet. In such cases laws and regulations may require pets to be placed into a pet carrier or some other type of cage, for health, safety and cleanliness reasons, as well as to allow transport of the pet in the luggage area of a plane or bus. Often such excursions with the family pet can take a considerable amount of time during which it is prudent and humane to provide to the animal within the cage a ready supply of drinking water and food in a pet dish. When transporting the pet in a cage, the cage can be subject to substantial jostling and bumping which can result in the spillage of food or water from the pet feeding dish resulting in soiling of the cage as well as the environment surrounding the cage. As pet owners know, typical pet dishes with their low sidewalls, broad flat bottoms and wide top openings easily spill their contents when bumped or tipped, and as such are unsuitable for use in pet carriers and cages. Additionally, typical pet dishes do not provide a means of securely mounting the dish to the cage wall and so are free to slide and move within the cage.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therefore, a spill resistant water and food dish for pets that is designed for use within a pet carrier or cage, that provides a means of removably securing the dish to a side wall of a pet carrier or cage, that incorporates features to prevent the spillage of food and drinking water into the cage and surrounding environment, such a pet food or water dish design would be useful and novel.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, embodiments of the inventive disclosures made herein comprise various embodiments of a spill resistant food and water dish for pets, a dish design that is particularly suited for use with a pet carrier or cage. Pets may typically be cats or dogs, but this disclosure is not limited to use with cats and dogs and is applicable for use with a wide variety of and various sizes of animals.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A first and at least one embodiment of the inventive disclosures made herein comprises a cage mountable spill resistant feeding dish for a household pet animal comprising a feeding dish for holding food or water, the dish comprising: an elongated ‘D’ shaped dish base structure having one or more cavities therein designed to receive an ice pack or ice to keep the pet food or water chilled. The elongated ‘D’ shaped dish base structure forms a ‘U’ shaped exterior sidewall and a substantially flat rectangular back wall having one or more voids there-through into the ice pack cavity. The back wall is attached on opposite edges to opposing edges of the ‘U’ shaped sidewall. The ‘D’ shaped top surface of the dish base has a closed bottom depression for holding food or water therein, the depression having cylindrical side walls. A raised cylindrical ring is formed on the top surface of the dish structure, the ring having a cylindrical inside surface joining the cylindrical walls of the depression. The outside surface of the raised ring has a circumferentially threaded portion to receive and threadably engage a feeding dish cover. The back wall of the dish base is provided with a means for removably and supportively mounting the dish to a side wall of a cage or animal carrier. The feeding dish cover of the present invention is provided with features to reduce the opportunity for and chance of spillage of food and water from the dish. The feeding dish cover comprises a generally cylindrical sidewall having circumferential threads on a lower portion of an inside surface. The cover sidewall and threads are sized and fitted to threadably and removably engage the threaded section of the cylindrical ring of the dish base so as to provide a partial closure over the food or water in the dish. The cover having an ‘O’ shaped top wall further having an inner circumferential edge and an outer circumferential edge, the outer edge attached to the top edge of the cover sidewall. A truncated cone shaped surface having an outer circumferential edge and an inner circumferential edge defining a hole where the cone is truncated, the outer edge of the cone shaped surface secured to the inner surface of the cover sidewall, the inner circumferential edge of the cone sized and adapted to permit the animal to access food in the dish through the feeding hole in the center of the cone, the cone sloping downwardly from periphery edges towards the hole to encourage displaced food to drain back into the dish through the feeding hole.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The variations of the spill resistant dish, cover and access hole can be made in any size to suit the physical head, mouth dimensional requirements of any particular animal. In particular, the feeding hole in the cover cone must be sufficient to allow the animal to reach food or water within the bowl, but not so large as to permit the contents of the bowl to splash out. Additionally a rubber ‘O’ ring or gasket seal is provided between the cover and the threaded ring of the dish base to provide a leak-proof seal between the cover and the dish.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment of the inventive disclosures made herein, the cage mountable spill resistant food feeding dish for a household pet animal comprises a feeding dish for holding food or water, the dish comprising: a generally cylindrical side wall; a threaded section on an upper portion of an outside surface of the side wall; a bottom wall peripherally secured to a bottom edge of said sidewall, said bottom wall together with the sidewall forming a closed bottom dish. A feeding dish cover comprises a generally cylindrical sidewall, the cover sidewall having circumferential threads on a lower portion of an inside surface, the cover sidewall and threads sized and fitted to threadably and removably engage the threaded section of the feeding dish sidewall. The feeding dish cover having an ‘O’ shaped top wall having an inner circumferential edge and an outer circumferential edge, the outer edge attached to a top edge of the cover sidewall. The feeding dish cover further comprising a truncated cone shaped surface having an outer circumferential edge and an inner circumferential edge defining a hole where the cone is truncated, the outer edge of the cone shaped surface secured to the inner surface of the cover sidewall, the inner circumferential edge of the cone sized and adapted to permit the animal to access food in the dish through the feeding hole in the cone, the cone sloping downwardly towards the hole to encourage displaced food to drain back into the dish through the hole. Additionally, a dish holder is provided that is adapted for removably mounting to an interior side wall of an animal travel cage, the dish holder comprising: a top surface having a general ‘D’ shape with a cylindrical depression therein, the depression sized and adapted to supportively and retentively receive the separate removable feeding dish, the elongated ‘D’ shape forming a ‘U’ shaped sidewall and together with a substantially flat rectangular back wall, the back wall having a threaded hole and one or more voids through the back wall into the ice pack cavity, the voids to receive ice packs to maintain dish contents chilled for an extended time. Also provided is a means of removably and supportively mounting dish holder back wall to the side wall of the cage. A rubber ‘O’ ring or gasket seal is provided between the cover and the threaded ring of the dish base to provide a leak-proof seal between the cover and the dish. As in the first embodiment, the dimensions of the spill resistant dish, cover and access hole can be made in any size to suit the size of the animal.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In at least one of the embodiments of the spill resistant pet dish in accordance with the inventive disclosure herein, the means of mounting the dish holder back wall to the side wall of the cage utilizes a threaded hole through the back wall of the dish holder; and a threaded screw with a flat head having ridges to allow finger tightening of the screw, the screw sized and configured to threadably, retentively and removably engage the threaded hole in the back wall. To secure the dish holder base to the cage or pet carrier wall, the screw is inserted through the sidewall of the cage and then received into the threaded hole on the back wall of the dish holder. The screw is then finger tightened to removably secure the dish holder in place on the sidewall of the cage or pet carrier. The invention is not limited to this example means of securing the pet dish to a cage wall. Other means of removably mounting the spill resistant pet dish to a pet carrier or cage wall, as would be know to one skilled in the art, may be utilized without deviating from the intention of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various embodiments of the spill resistant dish may be realized by use of molded hard plastic or the use of particularly suitable metallic materials such as stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Use of the spill resistant pet dish is not confined to use with a pet cage or carrier. Embodiments of the spill resistant pet dish may be used on the floor alone, without a cage or pet carrier, for example while traveling. The flat bottom of the spill resistant dish together with the spill resistance features discussed above provide a pet food and water dish that can be advantageously utilized by placing on the floor or ground to provide food or water to a pet, for example, on the floor of a moving vehicle such as a camper, boat or van.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In at least one embodiment of the inventive disclosures made herein, components of the spill resistant dish comprises a plastic having added photoluminescent pre-coloured compounds of the type utilized for direct injection molding into the plastic. The resulting photoluminescent or glow in the dark plastic enables the spill resistant dish to be readily located in the dark. Photolumiscent phosphors are available in various grades, high grades proving illumination in the dark for up to 12 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an objective of the inventive disclosure made herein to provide a pet dish which is designed for removably mounting to the interior of a pet carrier or cage.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is another objective of the inventive disclosure made herein to provide a pet dish which is designed to minimize or eliminate spillage of food or water from the dish, and thereby reduce soiling of the case and surrounding environment from pet feeding dish spills.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is another objective of the inventive disclosure made herein to provide a pet dish which provides a cavity in the base of the dish into which ice packs or ice can be placed to maintain pet food or water in a chilled condition.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is another objective of the inventive disclosure made herein to provide a pet dish which can be removed from the cage or carrier and used independently and placed on the floor or ground for pet feeding, particularly in a moving vehicle or boat wherein the spill resistant features of the disclosed pet dish are advantageous to minimize or eliminate spillage of food or water from the dish.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The above discussed objects and other objects of the invention made herein are intended to be illustrative of the invention and are not meant in a limiting sense. Many possible embodiments of the invention may be made from the inventive disclosures herein and will be readily evident upon study of the specification and accompanying drawings.

More specific details about the spill prevention features of this inventive disclosure are provided further down below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and to the spill resistant features of the present inventive disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is sectional view of the feeding dish cover <b>12</b> in which one half of the cover has been cut away along an axis of symmetry through the center of the cover as an aid in illustration of other spill prevention features of the present embodiment. Feeding dish cover <b>12</b> comprises a cylindrical outside sidewall <b>13</b>, an ‘O’ shaped cover top wall <b>14</b>, a spill limiting inside sidewall <b>15</b>, an inner cone shaped surface <b>18</b>, and outer cone shaped surface <b>19</b>, a rubber or pliable gasket <b>21</b> provides a water tight seal between the ledge <b>23</b> of the cover and the dish, and a feeding access hole <b>20</b>. In use, food or water is present below the cover and features of the cover cooperate to prevent water and food from splashing out of the dish through the feeding hole when the dish is bumped or displaced. As discussed earlier, gasket <b>21</b> provides a water tight seal between the cover and the food or water in the pet dish. The region over the perimeter portions of the food dish are covered by the inner cone shaped surface <b>18</b>. In the case of water in the dish, bumping or jarring the dish causes a wave-like feature in the water that would tend to splash or ride over the dish walls at the perimeter sidewall of the dish. With the feeding dish cover installed on the dish, the water tends to splash against the inner cone shaped surface <b>18</b> near the periphery side walls, and is deflected back into the bowl. Liquids or food that may become displaced from the bowl through the feeding access hole <b>20</b> tend to have low velocity if they manage to escape through the center region of the bowl. This low escape velocity in a region over the center of the dish can be illustrated with a thought experiment based on every day experiences. An experiment with a glass half full of water will demonstrate that when the glass is displaced horizontally a wave is created in the glass, the wave moving along the direction of displacement. This wave causes the water level on the side of the glass nearest the direction of the displacement to initially drop in level, and similarly the water level on the opposite side of the glass initially rises in level. More importantly, one can observe that the water at the center of the glass along a line perpendicular to the direction of displacement does not substantially rise or fall in level, meaning no to low displacement or velocity for water or food particles in that region. This low energy or low displacement region lies under the feeding hole in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. By this arrangement food or water ejected from a horizontal bump or horizontal movement of the pet feeding dish will tend to have low velocity even if ejected at the center feeding hole. The outer cone shaped surface <b>19</b> and spill limiting inside cover sidewall <b>15</b> will tend to capture spills and return the material to the feeding dish with the aid of gravity, thereby reducing or elimination spillage.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the depicted embodiment the pet dish is formed integrally with the base. A variation of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> embodiment yields another embodiment of the present inventive disclosure. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> embodiment is modified to have a pet dish as a separate bowl that is removable from the base through the hole in the ‘D’ shaped top surface <b>22</b>. The cover <b>12</b> is threadably engaged onto mating threads on the removable dish outside sidewall, permitting the dish with the cover to be removed from the base and used separately from the elongated ‘D’ shaped base structure <b>2</b>. In this case the base structure serves only to support the dish and cover in a cage or carrier, and serves also as a holder for ice packs or ice to keep the contents of the dish chilled.</p>
