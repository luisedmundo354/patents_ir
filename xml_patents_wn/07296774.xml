<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to a U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/533,923, entitled SYSTEM FOR REMOTELY ADJUSTING THE VIEWING ANGLE OF A MONITOR, filed Jan. 2, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention is directed to a support arm capable of adjusting the viewing angle of a monitor remotely and/or automatically to allow a viewer to watch the monitor more comfortably at the desired viewing angle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. General Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Flat screen monitors such as computer monitors and plasma televisions (collectively referred to as “monitor(s)”) are becoming popular because they can be mounted onto a wall to save floor space and for their aesthetically pleasing appearance. In particular, monitors are generally mounted to a wall with a mechanical support arm then fixed in a desired orientation to maximize the viewing angle of the monitor. To later adjust the viewing angle of the monitor, however, a viewer generally tilts the monitor manually to a new viewing angle so that the viewer may more comfortably view the monitor from a different location. For instance, a monitor may be fixed to a wall in a family room to allow the family members or one viewer to view the monitor at the desired viewing angle. As the viewer moves from one area to another area, such as from the family room to the kitchen, the viewer may not be able to view the monitor. In addition, in situations where the monitor is mounted in a remote location or high above the floor, it may be inconvenient for the viewer to adjust the viewing angle of the monitor. As such, there is a need for adjusting the viewing angle of a monitor so that a viewer may view the monitor comfortably from a variety of locations.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">INVENTION SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This invention provides a support arm to couple a monitor to a surface such as a wall or ceiling to remotely or automatically adjust the viewing angle of the monitor. The support arm includes at least one motor along a pivot axis in the support arm. The motor may be activated by a processor based on the control signal provided by the remote control. The support arm may include a plurality of pivot axes with a motor in each of the pivot axis to adjust the viewing angle along at least one plane such as the vertical and/or horizontal plane. The support arm may be also provided with a tracking device that follows the movement of the viewer to adjust the viewing angle of the monitor corresponding to the movement of the viewer. The support arm may also receive periodic signal from the remote control to determine the location of the remote control. Based on the periodic signal, the processor may adjust the viewing angle of the monitor towards the location of the remote control.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other systems, methods, features and advantages of the invention will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within the description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">This invention is generally directed to remotely controlling the viewing angle of the monitor that is mounted onto a surface or in a remote area. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a viewing angle adjustment system <b>2</b> including a support arm <b>10</b> having a plurality of arms <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. The two arms <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> may be coupled along the pivot axis <b>16</b>. Along the pivot axis <b>16</b>, the two arms <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> may form a housing <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B, respectively, adapted to house an electric motor. The electric motor may be a servo motor capable of pivoting or rotating the housing <b>18</b>A relative to the housing <b>18</b>B, thereby actuating the arm <b>12</b> relative to the arm <b>14</b>. A variety of different types of motors known to one skilled in the art may be used in the pivot axis. In addition, on the opposite end of the housing <b>18</b>A, the arm <b>12</b> may have a housing <b>20</b> adapted to pivotally couple an adaptor <b>30</b> about the pivot axis <b>24</b>. Along the pivot axis <b>24</b>, the adaptor <b>30</b> and the housing <b>20</b> may enclose another electric motor. Likewise, on the opposing end of the housing <b>18</b><i>b</i>, the arm <b>14</b> may have a housing <b>22</b> adapted to enclose an electric motor capable of pivoting about the pivot axis <b>26</b>. The housing <b>22</b> may be pivotally coupled to a bracket <b>28</b> which is adapted to mount onto a surface, such as walls and ceilings. The housing <b>20</b> is pivotally coupled to an adaptor <b>30</b> which couples the monitor <b>32</b> to the support arm <b>10</b>. In addition, the adaptor <b>30</b> may have an electric motor capable of pivoting the monitor <b>32</b> along the pivot axis <b>34</b>. In general, the pivot axes <b>16</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b> pivot along the vertical axis and the pivot axis <b>34</b> pivots along the horizontal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Based on the input data from a viewer, the processor <b>35</b> provide a control signal to each of the motors that needs to rotate to orient the monitor <b>32</b> at a desired viewing angle. The processor <b>35</b> may calculate the rotation of each of the motors, if any, so that the monitor <b>32</b> may be moved from an initial viewing position to a new desired viewing position with minimal delay or through least amount of movements by the arms <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Besides the remote control <b>35</b>, the processor <b>35</b> may also be provided within the support arm <b>10</b> such as in the bracket <b>28</b>, for example. If the processor <b>35</b> is located within the remote control <b>36</b>, the input data from a viewer may be processed by the processor <b>35</b> to send a control signal to the receptor <b>50</b> to efficiently rotate each of the motors in the support arm <b>10</b> to orient the monitor <b>32</b> to the desired viewing angle. The receptor <b>50</b> may receive the control signal from the remote control <b>36</b> and forward the control signal to the motors within the support arm to adjust the viewing angle of the monitor accordingly. If the processor <b>35</b> is located on the support arm <b>10</b>, then the remote control <b>36</b> may send the input data from the viewer to the receptor <b>50</b>, which is then processed by the processor <b>35</b> to efficiently rotate the motors accordingly. This way, a viewer may adjust the viewing angle of the monitor remotely by using the control button <b>38</b> on the remote control <b>36</b>. For instance, a viewer may activate the control button <b>38</b> either to the left position or to the right position to pivot the viewing angel of the monitor <b>32</b> to the clockwise or counter clockwise direction, respectively, when viewed from the top.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a top view of the support arm <b>10</b> coupling the monitor <b>32</b> to a wall <b>13</b>. The monitor <b>32</b> may be pivoted about the horizontal plan in a variety of ways. For instance, the monitor <b>32</b> may be pivoted along one of the pivot axis <b>16</b>, <b>24</b> or <b>26</b> to pivot the monitor either in the clockwise or counter clockwise direction. Alternatively, a combination of motors along the pivot axes <b>16</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b> may be activated to adjust the viewing angle of the monitor to a desired direction. The motor along the pivot axis <b>24</b> may be activated to pivot the monitor <b>32</b> either in the clockwise or counter clockwise direction along the pivot axis <b>24</b>. The motor along the pivot axis <b>16</b> may be activated to pivot the monitor <b>32</b> along an arc about the pivot axis <b>16</b> with the length of the arm <b>12</b> being the radius of the arc. Likewise, the motor along the pivot axis <b>26</b> may be activated to pivot the monitor <b>32</b> along an arc about the pivot axis <b>26</b> with the straight distance between the pivot axes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> being the radius of the arc. With a variety of ways to reposition the monitor to the desired viewing angle, the processor <b>35</b> may calculate the rotation of each of the motors, if any, so that the monitor <b>32</b> may be moved from an initial viewing position to a new desired viewing position with minimal delay or through least amount of movements by the arms <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A memory <b>37</b> may be provided with the processor <b>35</b> to store the desired movement of the monitor <b>32</b> along the horizontal plan desired by the viewer. That is, the remote control <b>36</b> may be provided with a teach function <b>39</b> that allows the viewer to input the desired movement of the monitor <b>32</b> along the horizontal plan to the processor <b>35</b> which is then stored to the memory <b>37</b>. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a first position of the monitor <b>32</b> to define the position of the monitor <b>32</b> along an X and Y plane; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a second position of the monitor <b>32</b> along the X and Y plane. A viewer may desire the viewing angle of the monitor <b>32</b> to follow the movement from the first position to the second position. In this example, a viewer may initiate the teach function <b>39</b> from the first position, then move the monitor <b>32</b> to the second position so that the processor <b>35</b> may store in the memory <b>37</b> the desired X and Y coordinates of the arc movement of the monitor through the X and Y plane. In this instance, the motor along the pivot axis <b>26</b> may be activated to rotate the arm <b>14</b> in a clockwise direction to move the monitor <b>32</b> along the arc movement that follows from the first position to the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A memory <b>37</b> may be provided with the processor <b>35</b> to store the desired movement of the monitor <b>32</b> along the horizontal plan desired by the viewer. That is, the remote control <b>36</b> may be provided with a teach function <b>39</b> that allows the viewer to input the desired movement of the monitor <b>32</b> along the horizontal plan to the processor <b>35</b> which is then stored to the memory <b>37</b>. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a first position of the monitor <b>32</b> to define the position of the monitor <b>32</b> along an X and Y plane; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a second position of the monitor <b>32</b> along the X and Y plane. A viewer may desire the viewing angle of the monitor <b>32</b> to follow the movement from the first position to the second position. In this example, a viewer may initiate the teach function <b>39</b> from the first position, then move the monitor <b>32</b> to the second position so that the processor <b>35</b> may store in the memory <b>37</b> the desired X and Y coordinates of the arc movement of the monitor through the X and Y plane. In this instance, the motor along the pivot axis <b>26</b> may be activated to rotate the channel <b>14</b> in a clockwise direction to move the monitor <b>32</b> along the arc movement that follows from the first position to the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The desired first position and the second position may vary depending on the viewer but each viewer may teach the desired arc movement to the processor <b>35</b>. This may involve activating one or more motors in the axes <b>16</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b>. The desired movement of the monitor <b>32</b> may be provided so that the support arm <b>10</b> and the monitor <b>32</b> may avoid an impeding object that is near the monitor such as a book shelf, column, lamp, or an adjacent wall. Once the desired arc movement of the monitor is stored into the memory <b>37</b>, the processor <b>35</b> may follow the desired arc movement when the viewer activates the control button to the right or left position. In addition, the teach function <b>39</b> may be also used to define certain boundaries so that the movement of the monitor is limited to a certain area. This may be done to prevent the monitor from running into adjacent walls, for example. Accordingly, a viewer may adjust the viewing angle of the monitor to the left along the X and Y plane by pressing on the control button <b>38</b> to the left which causes the monitor <b>32</b> to move to the left, and if the desired arc movement has been programmed into the memory <b>37</b>, then the movement of the monitor <b>32</b> may follow the stored arc movement. Once the monitor is at the desired viewing angle along the X and Y plane, the viewer may depress the control button <b>38</b> to stop of the movement of the monitor <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Once the monitor <b>32</b> is adjusted for the desired viewing angle along the X and Y plane, the viewing angle of the monitor <b>32</b> may be also adjusted along the vertical plane or X and Z plane. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate the side view of the monitor <b>32</b> along the support arm <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrate the monitor <b>32</b> in the first position along the X and Z plane; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the monitor <b>32</b> in the second position along the X and Z plane, where the viewing angle of the monitor <b>32</b> is in counter clockwise position relative to the first position. To pivot the monitor <b>32</b> in the X and Z plane, the viewer may move the control button <b>38</b> either to the upward position or downward position to activate the motor along the pivot axis <b>34</b> to pivot the monitor <b>32</b> corresponding to the clockwise or counter clockwise direction along the vertical or X and Z plane. This way, a viewer may use the control button <b>38</b> to adjust the viewing angle of the monitor <b>32</b> along the X and Y plane and the X and Z plane.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> illustrate a top view of the support arm <b>10</b>, where <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the support arm <b>10</b> in a retracted position; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the support arm <b>10</b> in the expanded position. If the viewer desires to extend the monitor away from the bracket <b>28</b> or the wall <b>13</b>, the viewer may hold down the control button <b>38</b> and move the control button upwards to send the control signal to the processor <b>35</b> to activate the motors in the pivot axes <b>16</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b> to extend the monitor <b>32</b> from the retracted position to the expanded position. On the other end, if the viewer desires to retract the support arm <b>10</b>, then the viewer may hold down the control button <b>38</b> and moves the control button <b>38</b> downward which activates the motors along the pivot axes <b>16</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b> to move the monitor <b>32</b> towards the bracket <b>28</b>. Note that for convenience, when the monitor <b>32</b> is turned off or when not being used, the support arm <b>10</b> may retract the monitor <b>32</b> so that it is flush to a wall. The next time the monitor is turned on, however, the processor may extend the support arm <b>10</b> to the previous position before the monitor was turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> illustrate moving the monitor <b>32</b> laterally along the Y axis in an X and Y plane while maintaining a constant X. To move the monitor <b>32</b> laterally along the Y axis, a viewer may hold down the control button <b>38</b> and move the control button <b>38</b> either to the left or to the right to send the corresponding control signal to the processor <b>35</b>. Based on the lateral control signal, the processor <b>35</b> may control the motors along the pivot axes <b>16</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b> to move the monitor <b>32</b> along the Y axis while maintaining a constant X.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The number of pivot axes provided with the support arm <b>10</b> may vary. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the support arm <b>10</b> having a bracket <b>28</b> with one pivot point <b>40</b> that rotates the monitor <b>32</b> about the pivot point in a variety of directions. That is, the pivot point <b>40</b> may rotate the monitor <b>32</b> both in X and Y plane and in the X and Z plane. In addition, the bracket <b>28</b> may be telescopic so that the bracket may extend to move the monitor <b>32</b> along the X axis. The bracket <b>28</b> of the support arm <b>10</b> may be also attached to a ceiling or any other surface to mount the monitor to the surface. The support arm <b>10</b> may be also provided with pivot axes that pivot along the X and Z plane so that the monitor <b>32</b> may be moved up and down along the Z axis.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates that the support arm <b>10</b> may be equipped with a tracking device <b>40</b> to follow the movement of a viewer. The tracking device may be placed on the outer perimeter of the monitor and communicateably coupled to the processor <b>35</b> to adjust the viewing angle of the monitor <b>32</b> based on the movement of the viewer. The remote control <b>36</b> may be provided with a tracking mode button <b>42</b> to activate the tracking mode. Once the tracking mode button <b>42</b> is activated, the tracking device <b>40</b> may monitor the movement of the viewer and provide movement information to the processor <b>35</b>. Based on the movement information, the processor <b>35</b> may control the motors along the pivot axes so that the viewing angle of the monitor <b>38</b> may substantially follow the movement of the viewer. That is, the processor <b>35</b> adjusts the viewing angle of the monitor automatically based on the tracking information provided by the tracking device <b>40</b> to follow the movement of the viewer so that the viewer may conveniently view the monitor from a variety of locations. The tracking mode <b>42</b> may be generally utilized when one viewer is watching the monitor. A variety of tracking device, method, and system known to one skilled in the art may be used to follow the movement of the viewer. For instance, such methods as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,477, entitled Tracking System, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,610, entitled Audio-visual object localization and tracking system and method therefore, which are incorporated by reference, may be used to track the movement of the viewer. With regard to U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,610, the visual object detector without the audio detection method may be used as well with this invention. Other methods such as radar triangulation method and heat detection system may be used in this invention to detect the movement of the viewer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> also illustrates that the remote control <b>36</b> may have a follow mode button <b>48</b> to adjust the viewing angle of the monitor <b>32</b> to automatically follow the location of the remote control <b>36</b>. Once the follow mode <b>48</b> is activated, the remote control <b>36</b> may send periodic signals to the receptor <b>50</b> to detect the location of the remote control <b>36</b>. The location of the remote control is then sent to the processor <b>35</b> to control the motors along the pivot axes to adjust the viewing angle of the monitor <b>32</b>. A variety of tracking devices, methods, and systems known to one skilled in the art may be used to follow the movement of the remote control <b>36</b>. For instance, such methods as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,477 may be used to monitor the movement of the remote control. Other methods such as triangulation and GPS systems may be used to determine the location of the remote control based on the signal provided by the remote control <b>36</b>. This way, a viewer may place the remote control <b>36</b> at a desired location within a viewing area so that the viewing angle of the monitor <b>36</b> may be automatically adjusted for the viewer.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">This invention may be used in a variety of applications. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates that the viewing angle of a monitor <b>32</b> for a video phone <b>60</b> may be adjusted so that the speaker may move around the viewing area while speaking. With the video phone <b>60</b>, the monitor <b>32</b> may be mounted or placed on top of a table <b>62</b>. As the speaker moves around the viewing area, the monitor <b>32</b> or the support arm <b>64</b> may be provided with a tracking device <b>40</b> to follow the movement of the speaker. This may allow the speaker the freedom to move while speaking at the same time. Alternatively, the tracking device <b>40</b> may operate by tracking the voice of the speaker. With the video phones, the monitor may be pivotally coupled to the support arm <b>64</b> having a first arm <b>66</b> and a second arm <b>68</b> coupled to each other along a pivot axis <b>70</b> capable of pivoting along the vertical plane or the X and Y plane. The support arm <b>64</b> may also include the adapter <b>30</b> for coupling the monitor <b>32</b> for the video phone <b>60</b> to the support arm <b>64</b>. The adaptor <b>30</b> may pivot about the pivot axis <b>34</b> as discussed above to rotate the monitor <b>32</b> clockwise or counter clockwise direction along the X and Y plane. The first arm <b>66</b> may also rotate along the horizontal plane or around the Y axis so that the monitor <b>32</b> may rotate around 360 degrees on the table <b>62</b> to adjust the viewing angle of the monitor so that the speaker may view the monitor <b>32</b>. Alternatively, the support arm <b>10</b> as described above may be used to adjust the viewing angle of a monitor on top of a table.</p>
