<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an upsetting method and an upsetting apparatus used in manufacturing a product having a diameter expanded portion, such as, e.g., an arm, a connecting rod, or a piston for vehicles (e.g., cars, railroad vehicles, etc.).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, upsetting is executed to expand a diameter of a processing scheduled portion of a bar-shaped raw material by pressurizing the raw material in the axial direction thereof. In this upsetting, if the material buckles during the upsetting, the obtained product (upsetting manufactured product) becomes poor in shape (e.g., wrinkles, scratches, etc.), which causes degradation in value as a product. Therefore, in order to prevent the occurrence of such buckling, the following upsetting method is conventionally known.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">That is, in this method, a raw material is secured to a fixing die, and the processing scheduled portion of the raw material is inserted into an insertion hole formed in a guide to be held in a buckling prevention state. Subsequently, the guide is moved in a direction opposite to a punch moving direction while pressurizing the processing scheduled portion of the raw material in the axial direction with a punch, to thereby radially expand the processing scheduled portion of the raw material exposed between the tip end portion of the guide and the fixing die (see Patent Documents 1 to 4).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this upsetting method, in cases where the diameter expansion scheduled portion of the raw material is expanded within a cavity (molding dented portion) of a closed-die, this upsetting method is classified into the category of a constrain upsetting method. According to this constrain upsetting method, it is possible to manufacture a preform having a configuration as close as possible to a desired product configuration. Consequently, there is an advantage that the material yield can be improved and the number of manufacturing steps can be reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the upsetting, a raw material made of, for example, an extruded material is used. In the case of manufacturing an upsetting manufactured product by the above-mentioned conventional constrain upsetting method using the raw material, the raw material is initially extruded by an extruder. Thereafter, the obtained raw extruded material is conveyed to a constrain upsetting apparatus and set thereto. And then, upsetting is executed to this set raw material. In other words, the step of manufacturing the raw material and the step of upsetting the raw material were performed separately, and therefore the upsetting manufactured product was low in productivity.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present invention has the following effects.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the invention of Item [1], the step of manufacturing the extruded raw material and the step of upsetting the extruded raw material can be performed continuously, which improves the productivity of the upsetting manufactured product.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, since the extrusion force of the extruder is used as a force for pressurizing the extruded raw material in the axial direction to expand the diameter of the exposed portion (i.e., the diameter expansion scheduled portion) of the extruded raw material, a punch and its driving device for pressurizing the raw material in the axial direction, which was used in a conventional upsetting method, are not required separately. Therefore, the upsetting apparatus can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Since the exposed portion of the extruded raw material is expanded in diameter in the cavity of the closed-die, a preform having a shape as close as possible to a desired product can be manufactured, which in turn can improve the material yield and can reduce the number of manufacturing steps.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Furthermore, by moving the plurality of divided members in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material at a speed slower than the extrusion speed with the extruded raw material clamped by and between the clamping portions of the plurality of divided members while filling up the cavity with the material of the exposed portion of the extruded raw material, the flow of the material in the cavity is distributed. Therefore, the corner portion in the cavity of the closed-die can be filled up with the material without excessively increasing the extrusion force of the extruder. This prevents the defect that a non-filled up portion is generated in the cavity, which in turn can obtain a high quality upsetting manufactured product having no underfill defect.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, since the corner portion in the cavity of the closed-die can be filled up with a material without excessively increasing the extrusion force of the extruder, the load applied to the closed-die during the processing can be reduced, resulting in an extended service life of the closed-die.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to the invention of Item [2], buckling of the extruded raw material can be prevented assuredly, resulting in a favorable diameter expansion of the exposed portion of the extruded raw material.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to the invention of Item [3], the cross-sectional area of the exposed portion of the extruded raw material can be increased at the early stage of the diameter expansion. Therefore, buckling limit length of the exposed portion of the extruded raw material can be extended, which in turn can assuredly prevent occurrence of buckling.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to the invention of Item [4], when a clamped portion of the extruded raw material or a portion of the extruded raw material located ahead of the clamped portion in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction is cut as a cutting scheduled portion, since the portion of the extruded raw material is not moving, the portion of the extruded raw material can be cut easily.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, since the cutting of the extruded raw material can be performed while extruding the extruded raw material with the extruder, the installation space for the upsetting apparatus can be saved.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to the invention of Item [5], the extruded raw material can be clamped firmly.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to the invention of Item [6], the extrusion raw material can be clamped firmly and assuredly.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to the invention of Item [7], the productivity of the upsetting manufactured product can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to the invention of Item [8], a high quality upsetting manufactured product with no shape defect, such as, e.g., underfill, wrinkles, or scratches, can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the invention of Items [9] to [13], an upsetting apparatus used suitably for the upsetting method according to the present invention can be provided.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, some embodiments of the present invention will be explained below with reference to the drawings. In the embodiments, for convenience of explanation, “front” means a forward side with respect to an extruding direction of an extruded raw material, and “rear” means a direction opposite to the extruding direction of the extruded raw material.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are figures for explaining an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the reference numeral “<b>10</b>” denotes an upsetting apparatus according to this embodiment. This upsetting apparatus <b>10</b> is a constrain upsetting apparatus in detail. “<b>1</b>” denotes an extruded raw material.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the reference numeral “<b>5</b>” denotes an upsetting manufactured product processed with the upsetting apparatus <b>10</b>. In this upsetting manufactured product <b>5</b>, one diameter expanded portion <b>6</b> is formed at a part of the axial direction thereof (in detail, at an end portion). This upsetting manufactured product <b>5</b> is used as a preform for manufacturing various products, such as, e.g., an arm, a connecting rod, or a piston for vehicles (cars, railroad vehicles, etc.). As an arm for vehicles, a straight arm, a knuckle, etc., having a connecting portion (for example, a bush mounting portion) to be connected to another component can be exemplified concretely.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 2A</figref> to <b>2</b>C, the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is made of solid bar-shaped aluminum or aluminum alloy extruded material. The extruded raw material <b>1</b> is circular in cross-section, and constant in diameter along the axial direction (i.e., extruding direction).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the present invention, the substance of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is not limited to aluminum or aluminum alloy, and can be metal, such as, e.g., brass, copper, and stainless steel, or can be plastic. Moreover, the cross-sectional shape of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is not limited to a circular shape, and can be a polygon, such as, e.g., a square or a hexagon. Moreover, the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is not limited to a solid member, and can be a hollow member.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The diameter of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is, for example, 16 mm. In the upsetting manufactured product <b>5</b>, for example, the diameter expanded portion <b>6</b> is 60 mm in maximum diameter and 45 mm in length. In the present invention, however, the diameter of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> and the dimension of each portion of the upsetting manufactured product <b>5</b> are not limited to the above-mentioned dimensions. For example, the diameter of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> and the dimension of each portion of the upsetting manufactured product <b>5</b> can be set depending on the manufacture of products, such as, e.g., an arm, a connecting rod, or a piston for vehicles so that the purposes of the present invention can be attained.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The upsetting apparatus <b>10</b> is equipped with an extruder <b>11</b>, a closed-die <b>20</b>, and a cutting device <b>40</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The extruder <b>11</b> is for manufacturing the extruded raw material <b>1</b>. This extruder <b>11</b> has a container portion <b>12</b>, an extrusion nozzle <b>13</b>, and a stem <b>16</b>. In the container portion <b>12</b>, a billet B of aluminum or aluminum alloy is loaded. The stem <b>16</b> is for pressurizing the billet B loaded in the container portion <b>12</b> in the extruding direction from the rear side. The extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> is projected from the container portion <b>12</b> in the extruding direction. In this extrusion nozzle <b>13</b>, a forming hole <b>14</b> communicated with the inside of the container portion <b>12</b> is extended in the axial direction (i.e., the length direction) of this extrusion nozzle <b>13</b>. Moreover, the external diameter of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> is set constant along the axial direction. At the tip end portion of this extrusion nozzle <b>13</b>, an extrusion opening <b>15</b> as an outlet of the forming hole <b>14</b> is formed. The cross-sectional shape of the extrusion opening <b>15</b> (i.e., forming hole <b>14</b>) is formed into a shape corresponding to the cross-sectional shape of the extruded raw material <b>1</b>, i.e., a circular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The closed-die <b>20</b> has a closed-cavity <b>25</b> for forming a prescribed portion of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> into a designed shape. Furthermore, this closed-die <b>20</b> is divided into two portions along the axial direction thereof (i.e., extruding direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b>), i.e., a pair of right and left closed-die divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>. Both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> are disposed at right and left sides of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> of the extruder <b>11</b> in an opposed manner. Both the divided members <b>21</b> are <b>21</b> are the same in structure.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">At the divided portion of the front wall portion of each divided member <b>21</b>, a clamping portion <b>22</b> for clamping the extruded raw material <b>1</b> having a dented groove (dented portion) of a semi-circular shape as seen from the front is provided. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, in a state in which both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> are combined so that the closed-dies <b>20</b> are formed, the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> clamp the extruded raw material <b>1</b>. In the state in which the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is clamped by and between the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>, the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is fitted in the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>. At each of the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>, a biting protrusion <b>23</b> for biting the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is provided as a slip prevention means with respect to the extruded raw material <b>1</b>. Therefore, the diameter of the clamping portion <b>22</b> is set to be slightly smaller than the diameter of the extruded raw material <b>1</b>. Therefore, when the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is clamped by and between the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>, the biting protrusion <b>23</b> of the clamping portion <b>22</b> of each divided member <b>21</b> bites into the clamped portion <b>3</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b>, which prevents the slip of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this embodiment, although the biting protrusion <b>23</b> is provided at the clamping portion <b>22</b> of each of the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>, the present invention allows to provide the biting protrusion <b>23</b> only at the clamping portion <b>22</b> of any one of the divided members <b>21</b>. As a means for preventing the slip of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> in the axial direction, another means different from the biting protrusion <b>23</b> can be provided at the clamping portion <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Furthermore, at the divided portion of the back wall portion of each divided member <b>21</b>, a dented portion <b>26</b> which is to be brought into contact with the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> is provided. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, in the state in which both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> are combined mutually, the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> is fitted in the fitting hole formed by the combination of the dented portions <b>26</b> and <b>26</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The upsetting apparatus <b>10</b> is equipped with a divided member combining device <b>200</b> which combines both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> so that the closed-die <b>20</b> is formed, and a driving device <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The divided member combining device <b>200</b> has a pair of right and left fluid pressure cylinders (e.g., hydraulic or gas cylinders) <b>29</b> and <b>29</b> as a driving source for moving both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> in the approach direction and in the separation direction as well. Each divided member <b>21</b> is connected to a rod <b>29</b><i>a </i>of the fluid pressure cylinder <b>29</b>. Each divided member <b>21</b> is secured to a cradle <b>27</b> movable on an LM guide rail <b>28</b> extended in a direction perpendicular to the extruding direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>). Both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> are installed on the common movable stage <b>32</b> via the corresponding cradles <b>27</b> and rails <b>28</b>. This movable stage <b>32</b> is installed so that it can move forward and rearward in the extruding direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b>. The reference numeral “<b>33</b>” denotes a rail for the movable stage <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">This divided member combining device <b>200</b> is configured to move both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> in the approach direction by operating the fluid pressure cylinders <b>29</b> and <b>29</b>, to thereby combine both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> to form a closed-die <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Furthermore, this divided member combining device <b>200</b> is configured to move both the combined divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> in the separation direction by operating the fluid pressure cylinders <b>29</b> and <b>29</b>, to thereby detach both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> to divide the closed-die <b>20</b> into two pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The driving device <b>30</b> is for moving both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> while keeping the combined state in a forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> at a speed slower than the extrusion speed. As the driving source of this driving device <b>30</b>, two fluid pressure cylinders (e.g., hydraulic or gas cylinder) <b>31</b> and <b>31</b> are connected to the movable stage <b>32</b>. And as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the driving device <b>30</b> is configured to move both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> together with the movable stage <b>32</b> in a forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> at a predetermined speed by operating both the fluid pressure cylinders <b>31</b> and <b>31</b> so as to retreat the rods <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>a</i>. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, this driving device <b>30</b> is configured to return (move) both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> moved in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of extruded raw material <b>1</b> to the respective initial positions by operating both the fluid pressure cylinders <b>31</b> and <b>31</b> so as to protrude the rods <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the present invention, the driving device <b>30</b> can be configured to move the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> in the rearward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> at a speed slower than the extrusion speed. Furthermore, in this case, the driving device <b>30</b> can be configured to return (move) the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> moved in the rearward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of extruded raw material <b>1</b> to the initial position.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The cutting device <b>40</b> is configured to cut (in detail, shear) a clamped portion <b>3</b> clamped with the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> or a portion of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> located ahead of the clamped portion <b>3</b> in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction to separate the diameter expanded portion <b>6</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> from the extruded raw material <b>1</b>. The cutting device <b>40</b> has a cutting blade (in detail, shearing blade) <b>41</b> and a cutting die <b>42</b> corresponding to the cutting blade <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The cutting blade <b>41</b> and the cutting die <b>42</b> are opposed with each other at the right and left sides of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> at the front of both divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> (i.e., the closed-die <b>20</b>). Connected to each of the cutting blade <b>41</b> and the cutting die <b>42</b> is a fluid pressure cylinder (e.g., a hydraulic or gas cylinder) <b>43</b> as a driving source. And as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>, by protruding the rods <b>43</b><i>a </i>by operating the fluid pressure cylinders <b>43</b>, the cutting scheduled portion of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is clamped by and between the cutting blade <b>41</b> and the cutting die <b>42</b> and cut (sheared) with the cutting blade <b>41</b>. On the other hand, by retreating the rod <b>43</b><i>a </i>of the fluid pressure cylinder <b>43</b>, the cutting blade <b>41</b> and the cutting die <b>42</b> returns to their respective original positions. The cutting blade <b>41</b> and the cutting die <b>42</b> are fixedly attached to the frame <b>44</b> via the corresponding fluid pressure cylinders <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Next, the upsetting method using the aforementioned upsetting apparatus <b>10</b> will be explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Initially, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> of the closed-die <b>20</b> are arranged in a separated state. Subsequently, a heated billet B loaded in the container portion <b>12</b> of the extruder <b>11</b> is pressurized with the stem <b>16</b> in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction, to thereby extrude the extruded raw material <b>1</b> from the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b>. In this embodiment, the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is extruded horizontally for example.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, in the state in which the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is extruded from the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the tip end portion of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b>, both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> are mutually combined with the divided member combining device <b>200</b> such that the tip end portion of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> is arranged in the cavity <b>25</b>. Thus, the closed-die <b>20</b> is formed. At the same time, the extruded raw material <b>1</b> extruded from the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> is clamped by and between the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>. [Clamping Step]. Then, the biting protrusion <b>23</b> of the clamping portion <b>22</b> of each divided member <b>21</b> bites into the clamped portion <b>3</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b>, thereby preventing the slip of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> in the axial direction. On the other hand, on the clamped portion <b>3</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b>, a bite mark <b>7</b> corresponding to the biting protrusion <b>23</b> is formed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Subsequently, while filling the cavity <b>25</b> of the closed-die <b>20</b> with the material of the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> exposed between the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> and the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>, in the state in which the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is clamped by and between the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided member <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>, namely, in the state in which both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> are combined mutually, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> are moved with the driving device <b>30</b> in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> at a speed slower than the extrusion speed with the driving device <b>30</b>. Thereby, the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is expanded in diameter in the cavity <b>25</b> of the closed-die <b>20</b> [Diameter Expansion Step].</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As mentioned above, while filling the cavity <b>25</b> of the closed-die <b>20</b> with the material of the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b>, by moving both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> at a speed slower than the extrusion speed, the flow of the material in the cavity <b>25</b> is distributed. Therefore, the corner portion of the cavity <b>25</b> of the closed-die <b>20</b> can be filled up with the material without excessively increasing the extrusion force of the extruder <b>11</b>. Therefore, any defect that a non-filled up portion (i.e., a portion not filled up with the material) is generated in the cavity <b>25</b> can be prevented. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the generation of a defective shape, such as, underfill, resulting in a high quality upsetting manufactured product <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Furthermore, since the corner portion in the cavity <b>25</b> of the closed-die <b>20</b> can be filled up with the material without excessively increasing the extrusion pressure of the extruder <b>11</b>, the load applied to the closed-die <b>20</b> during the processing can be reduced. Therefore, the service life of the closed-die <b>20</b> can be extended.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the present invention, it is necessary and sufficient that the traveling speed of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> driven by the driving device <b>30</b> is slower than the extrusion speed of the extruded raw material <b>1</b>, i.e., less than 1 time to the extrusion speed of the extruded raw material <b>1</b>. The speed difference of the traveling speed of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> and the extrusion speed of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> can be defined depending on the shape of the diameter expanded portion <b>6</b>, i.e., the shape of the cavity <b>25</b>. Moreover, the speed difference can be fixed or changed. For example, the speed difference can be increased at the portion where the amount of the diameter expansion is large, and the speed difference can be decreased at the portion where the amount of the diameter expansion is small. That is, the traveling speed of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> is arbitrarily set depending on the shape of the cavity <b>25</b> of the closed-die <b>20</b>, and can be set to a speed at which the cavity <b>25</b> can be filled up with the material so as not to cause a non-filled up portion in the cavity <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Here, at the clamping step, it is preferable to clamp the extruded raw material <b>1</b> with the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> at the position where the length of the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is less than the buckling limit length of the exposed portion <b>2</b>. With this, the buckling of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> can be prevented assuredly, and the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> can be favorably expanded in diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">At the diameter expansion step, it is preferable to set a time lag between the initiation of clamping the extruded raw material <b>1</b> with the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided member <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> and the initiation of moving both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, at the clamping step, the extrude draw material <b>1</b> is clamped by and between the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>. While keeping the clamping state, i.e., while keeping the state in which both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> are combined with each other, both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> are made to stand-by at the position (i.e., initial position) without moving both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>. This stand-by time corresponds to the time lag. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, during this time lag, the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is slightly expanded in diameter in the cavity <b>25</b>. After the time lag has passed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> are moved in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> at a speed slower than the extrusion speed. By setting the time lag as mentioned above, the cross-sectional area of the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> can be increased at the early stage of the diameter expansion. Therefore, the buckling limit length of the exposed portion <b>2</b> can be increased, which in turn can prevent buckling more assuredly.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">At the diameter expansion step, when the material of the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is completely introduced into the cavity <b>25</b> of the closed-die <b>20</b> to form a designed shape (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>), the traveling speed of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> is conformed to (i.e., synchronized with) the extrusion speed of the extruded raw material <b>1</b>, and both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> are separated by moving both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> in the separation direction with the divided member combining device <b>200</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>. This releases the clamping of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> by the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided member <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> [Clamp Releasing Step]. Then, the diameter expanded portion <b>6</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> moves in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction by the extrusion force of the extruder <b>1</b>. In this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, when the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is expanded into a designed shape, the position of the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> and the position of the rear end of the cavity <b>25</b> are coincided with each other. In the present invention, however, when the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is expanded into a designed shape, the position of the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> can be positioned ahead of the rear end of the cavity <b>25</b>. In this case, the material of the exposed portion <b>2</b> fills the cavity <b>25</b> in a manner such that the material surrounds the outside of the tip end portion of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b>. Furthermore, in this case, it is preferable that the tip end portion of the external peripheral surface of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> is formed into an inwardly tapered shape toward its tip end since the tip end portion of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> can be easily pulled out from the material in the cavity <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, both the divided member <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> are returned (moved) to their initial positions by the driving device <b>30</b> while keeping the separated state [Return Step].</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>, both the divided member <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> are combined by the divided member combining device <b>200</b> to thereby form the closed-die <b>20</b> again and simultaneously clamp the extruded raw material <b>1</b> with the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> [Clamping Step]. Then, the diameter expansion step, the clamp releasing step, and the return step mentioned above are repeated in this order.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In this embodiment, while the clamping step, the diameter expansion step, the clamp releasing step, and the return step are repeatedly performed, the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is continuously being extruded from the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> at a predetermined speed. In the present invention, however, during these steps, the extrusion of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> can be stopped. Moreover, the extrusion speed of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> can be constant, or can be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In cases where the upsetting is repeated as mentioned above, even at the second and subsequent diameter expansion step, in the same manner as in the first diameter expansion step, a time lag is set between the initiation of clamping the extruded raw material <b>1</b> by the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> and the initiation of moving both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>. During this time lag, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>, the clamped portion <b>3</b> (i.e., the previously clamped portion <b>3</b>) of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> clamped by and between the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> at the previous diameter expansion step which is a portion located ahead of the clamped portion <b>3</b> (i.e., the currently clamped portion <b>3</b>) of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> clamped by and between the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided member <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> is cut (i.e., sheared) with the cutting device <b>40</b> [Cutting Step]. This cutting process will be detailed as follows. That is, the cutting blade <b>41</b> and the cutting die <b>42</b> of the cutting device <b>40</b> are moved so as to approach with each other to clamp the cutting scheduled portion (i.e., the previously clamped portion <b>3</b>) of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> by and between the cutting blade <b>41</b> and the cutting die <b>42</b>, and then the cutting scheduled portion is cut with the cutting blade <b>41</b>. In cases where this cutting step is performed at the third or subsequent diameter expansion step, the diameter expanded portion <b>6</b> will be separated from the extruded raw material <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In this embodiment, the cutting scheduled portion of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is the clamped portion <b>3</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> clamped by and between the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> at the previous diameter expansion step as mentioned above. Since a bite mark <b>7</b> is formed at this clamped portion <b>3</b>, this clamped portion <b>3</b> can be easily cut as a cutting scheduled portion with the cutting device <b>40</b>. In the present invention, it is preferable that the slip prevention means is a means capable of forming a bite mark which facilitates the cutting operation. As such a slip prevention means, a biting protrusion of a V-shaped cross-section (e.g., a wedge shape) formed on the clamping portion <b>22</b> of the divided member <b>21</b> and/or a biting protrusion capable of forming a bite mark (preferably, a biting protrusion of a V-shaped cross-section) having a length more than half of the entire peripheral length of the clamped portion <b>3</b> thereon formed on the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>, can be exemplified.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">By performing this cutting step every diameter expansion step, an upsetting manufactured product <b>5</b> having one diameter expanded portion <b>6</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can be obtained. If this cutting step is performed every other diameter expansion step or every three or more diameter expansion step among the diameter expansion steps to be repeatedly performed, an upsetting manufactured product having two or more diameter expanded portions <b>6</b> (not illustrated) can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The upsetting manufactured product <b>5</b> obtained as mentioned above can be used as a preform having a shape as close as possible to the desired product shape.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">According to the upsetting method of the above-mentioned embodiment, the step for manufacturing an extruded raw material <b>1</b> and the step for upsetting the extruded raw material <b>1</b> can be performed continuously. Therefore, the productivity of the upsetting manufactured product <b>5</b> can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Furthermore, since the extrusion force of the extruder <b>11</b> is used as a force for pressurizing the extruded raw material <b>1</b> in the axial direction to expand the diameter of the exposed portion <b>2</b> (i.e., the diameter expansion scheduled portion) of the extruded raw material <b>1</b>, a punch and its driving device for pressurizing a raw material in the axial direction, which was used in a conventional upsetting method, are not required separately. This simplifies the upsetting apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Since the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is expanded in diameter in the cavity <b>25</b> of the closed-die <b>20</b>, the preform having a shape as close as possible to the desired product shape can be manufactured, which can improve the material yield and reduce the number of manufacturing steps.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Moreover, the clamping step, the diameter expansion step, the clamp releasing step, and the return step are performed repeatedly in order, which can further improve the productivity of the upsetting manufactured product <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Furthermore, by cutting the extruded raw material <b>1</b> during the time lag, the following effects can be attained. That is, if the cutting scheduled portion of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is moving at the time of cutting the cutting scheduled portion, various problems such as, e.g., deformation of a cut end or a cut section, may occur. Therefore, in order to solve such problems, in this embodiment, the cutting of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is performed during the time lag. With this, since the cutting scheduled portion of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is not moving at the time of cutting the cutting scheduled portion of the extruded raw material <b>1</b>, the cutting scheduled portion can be cut well without causing such problems, and the cutting scheduled portion can be cut easily as well.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Furthermore, since the cutting of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> can be performed while extruding the extruded raw material <b>1</b> with the extruder <b>11</b>, the space for installing the upsetting apparatus <b>10</b> can be saved.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Moreover, since the biting protrusion <b>23</b> for biting the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is provided at each of the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided member <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> as a slip prevention means, the slip of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> can be prevented and the extruded raw material <b>1</b> can be clamped assuredly.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Since the extruded raw material <b>1</b> would not be buckled, a high quality upsetting manufactured product free from defective shapes, such as, e.g., wrinkles or scratches, can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Although the above explanation is directed to one embodiment of the present invention, the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">For example, in the present invention, a cutting blade can be provided at the clamping portion <b>22</b> of at least one divided member <b>21</b> of both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> as a cutting device, so that the cutting blade cuts the clamped portion <b>3</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> in the state in which the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is clamped by both the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of both the divided member <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Furthermore, in the present invention, the dividing number of the closed-die <b>20</b> is not limited to two, and can be three, four, or more.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Moreover, in the aforementioned embodiment, the extruding direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> by the extruder <b>11</b> is horizontal. In the present invention, however, the extruding direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> can be, for example, a vertical direction such as a downward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Moreover, in the aforementioned embodiment, at the diameter expansion step, the position of the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> is fixed, and the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is expanded in the cavity <b>25</b> by moving the plurality of divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> at a speed slower than the extrusion speed in the state in which the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is clamped by and between the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of the plurality of divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>. In the present invention, however, in addition to the above, at the diameter expansion step, in the state in which the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is clamped by and between the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of the plurality of divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> with the positions of the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> fixed, the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> can be expanded in the cavity <b>25</b> by moving the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> in the rearward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> at a speed slower than the extrusion speed.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The above-mentioned two upsetting methods can be summarized as follows. Namely, in the present invention, at the diameter expansion step, while filling the cavity <b>25</b> with the material of the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> exposed between the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> and the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of the plurality of divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> by extruding the extruded raw material from the extrusion opening <b>15</b> by the extruder <b>11</b>, in the state in which the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is clamped by and between the clamping portions <b>22</b> and <b>22</b> of the plurality of divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>, the exposed portion <b>2</b> of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> is expanded in diameter in the cavity by moving the plurality of divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> relative to the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> at a speed slower than the extrusion speed</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Moreover, in the aforementioned embodiment, the driving device is for moving both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> at a speed slower than the extrusion speed with the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> combined. Moreover, this driving device <b>30</b> is configured to return (move) both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> moved in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> to the initial position. In the present invention, however, other than the above, the driving device <b>30</b> can be for moving the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> in the rearward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> at a speed slower than the extrusion speed. Furthermore, in this case, the driving device <b>30</b> can be configured to return (move) the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> in the rearward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> to the initial position.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The aforementioned upsetting apparatus can be summarized as follows. That is, in the present invention, the driving device <b>30</b> can be for moving the plurality of divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> by the extruder <b>11</b> relative to the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> at a speed slower than the extrusion speed. Furthermore, the driving device <b>30</b> can be configured to return the plurality of divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> moved in the forward direction with respect to the extrusion direction of the extruded raw material <b>1</b> relative to the extrusion opening <b>15</b> of the extrusion nozzle <b>13</b> to the initial position.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Furthermore, a supporting member (not illustrated) for supporting the extruded raw material <b>1</b> can be arranged between both the divided members <b>21</b> and <b>21</b> (i.e., the closed-die <b>20</b>) and the cutting device <b>40</b>, as a means for preventing bending (e.g., deflection) due to its own weight, etc., of the extruded raw material <b>1</b>. In this case, it is preferable that the supporting member can be moved together with the extruded raw material <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Moreover, in the present invention, the upsetting can be performed with mold release agent or lubricant applied to the inner surface of the cavity <b>25</b> of the closed-die <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">While the present invention may be embodied in many different forms, a number of illustrative embodiments are described herein with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as providing examples of the principles of the invention and such examples are not intended to limit the invention to preferred embodiments described herein and/or illustrated herein.</p>
