<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a wireless communication network, a device may include or be attached to a dipole antenna in order to receive and/or transmit communications over the network. However, there may be a need to receive and/or transmit signals at different frequencies. In a traditional network, such a device would need to include a dipole antenna set to accommodate the various frequencies. The dipole antenna set includes multiple antennas of varying lengths in order to receive and/or transmit the communications at the different frequencies. These dipole sets are very expensive and tend to include antenna lengths which the user does not need.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a universal dipole which may include (a) a feed line coupled to a first fitting; a balun coupled to a second fitting, (b) a first variable length antenna element coupled to the first fitting and (c) a second variable length antenna element coupled to the second fitting. In addition, the universal dipole may include (d) a support plate holding the feed line and the balun at a fixed spacing. The support plate includes a short circuit path between the feed line and the balun. Furthermore, the universal dipole may include (e) a sliding short assembly attachable between the feed line and the balun to create a short circuit at variable distances along the feed line and the balun.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention may be further understood with reference to the following description and the appended drawings, wherein like elements are provided with the same reference numerals. A dipole antenna is a straight electrical conductor which measures one-half of the wavelength of interest from end to end. The conductor is generally connected at the center to a radio-frequency (“RF”) feed line to propagate the received signal to the device which is attached to the antenna or in the opposite direction for a signal which is to be transmitted. The feed line may be an unbalanced line such as a coaxial cable. Where such an unbalanced feed line is used, a balun may be inserted where the feed line joins the antenna to balance the signal.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Since the dipole antenna has an ideal measurement of one-half the wavelength of interest, signals of different frequencies require dipole antennae of different lengths. Similarly, the different signals require baluns of differing lengths. Thus, in a traditional antenna system dipole sets having antennas of different lengths are provided to accommodate signals at different frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The exemplary embodiments of the universal dipole of the present invention alleviate the need to supply expensive dipole sets when the device attached to the antenna is to transmit and/or receive signals at different frequencies. The exemplary embodiments of the universal dipole allow for a single adjustable dipole antenna to accommodate signals of varying frequencies, i.e., the lengths of the antenna and the balun are adjustable to accommodate the different wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a first exemplary embodiment of the universal dipole <b>1</b>. The universal dipole <b>1</b> will be described and include various dimensions for the receipt and transmission of signals for the Advanced Mobile Phone System (“AMPS”) which uses the 800 MHz frequency band (approximately 824-849 MHz), the Global System for Mobile Communication (“GSM”) which uses the 900 MHz frequency band, the Digital Cellular System (“DCS”) which uses the 1800 MHz frequency band, the Personal Communication Services (“PCS”) which uses the 1900 MHz frequency band and the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (“ISM”) frequency bands of 2.4 GHz. Those of skill in the art will understand that these frequency bands were selected only for exemplary purposes and that a universal dipole according to the present invention may be constructed and used for any number of frequency bands.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The universal dipole <b>1</b> includes antenna elements <b>5</b>, a center section <b>10</b>, a feed line <b>20</b> and a balun <b>25</b>. The antenna elements <b>5</b> are constructed of one or more straight pieces of conducting material. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the antennal elements <b>5</b> are constructed of two (2) conducting elements <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>. Each of the conducting elements <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> includes a threaded male end and a threaded female end. A first conducting element <b>6</b> may be secured to the center section <b>10</b> by screwing the threaded male end into a threaded female fitting of the center section <b>10</b>. A second conducting element <b>7</b> may be secured to the first conducting element <b>6</b> by screwing the male end of the second conducting element <b>7</b> into the female end of the first conducting element <b>6</b>. Thus, the length of the antenna elements <b>5</b> may be varied using any number of conducting elements <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, including the use of no conducting elements.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the examples provided below, the different universal dipole embodiments will include embodiments with no conducting elements, one conducting element and two conducting elements. However, there may be embodiments where any number of conducting elements are combined to provide the desired length for the antenna elements <b>5</b> of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Those of skill in the art will understand that threaded male and female ends of conducting elements <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> are only one exemplary manner of securing multiple conducting elements. Other examples include fitted ends, releaseable compression fittings, radial screws or thumbscrews, etc. Any manner of releaseably connecting one or more conducting elements such that the length of the antenna element <b>5</b> may be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An example of a conducting element <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> may be a male/female aluminum hexagonal standoff of the size 4-40 3/16 by 1 inch. The hex standoff material is commercially available in various sizes and in a male/female configuration allowing for easy attachment and removal to each other and the center section <b>10</b>. However, any type of conducting material that is generally used in an antenna may be used for the conducting elements <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>. In addition, the length and diameter may be varied based on the desired response of the universal dipole. Furthermore, in one exemplary embodiment, the conducting elements <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> of various lengths may be covered in shrink tubing. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, conducting elements <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> may be covered in shrink tubing which makes them one integral antenna element <b>5</b> that is attached and removed in one piece from the center section <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a hexagonal standoff <b>50</b> which may be used as the conducting element <b>6</b> of the universal dipole <b>1</b>. The hexagonal standoff <b>50</b> includes a male end <b>51</b> which may be screwed into the center section <b>10</b> and a hexagonal body <b>52</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the hexagonal standoff <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This view shows the hexagonal body <b>52</b> and the threaded female end <b>53</b> which may accept the male end <b>51</b> of another hexagonal standoff.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows two connected hexagonal standoffs <b>50</b> and <b>55</b> which may be used as conducting elements <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> of the universal dipole <b>1</b>. In this example, hexagonal standoff <b>50</b> includes the same threaded male end <b>51</b> and hexagonal body <b>52</b> as described above. However, the male end (not shown) of hexagonal standoff <b>55</b> is screwed into the female end (not shown) of hexagonal standoff <b>50</b> creating a longer antenna element <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The center section <b>10</b> is also constructed of a conducting material, e.g., brass. The center section <b>10</b> is constructed of a conducting material because it contributes to the length of the universal dipole antenna <b>1</b>. For example, for particular wavelengths, there may be no conducting elements <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> attached to the center section <b>10</b>. The center section <b>10</b> may contribute the entire length of the antenna <b>1</b>. The center section <b>10</b> may include two fittings <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> which are connected via a connector <b>13</b> which may be soldered, welded, etc. to hold the fittings <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> in relation to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each of the fittings <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> may include a threaded female portion or other connection device to accept the conducting elements <b>6</b> of the antenna elements <b>5</b>. The fitting <b>11</b> will include an opening for insertion of the balun <b>25</b> and the fitting <b>12</b> will include an opening for the insertion of the feed line <b>20</b>. The fittings <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> may also include a manner of securing the balun <b>25</b> and the feed line <b>20</b> to the respective fittings <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, e.g., a compression screw, a compression fitting, a solder accepting portion, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b> may be a conductor such as a semi-rigid coaxial cable, e.g., RG-141. As described above, the feed line <b>20</b> is to conduct the received signals from the antenna elements <b>5</b> to the attached device or conduct the signals to be transmitted from the device to the antenna elements <b>5</b>. The feed line <b>20</b> may also include a connector <b>23</b> (e.g., an SMA connector) for the feed line <b>20</b> to be connected to the device. The balun <b>25</b> is used to balance the RF current distribution on the antenna elements <b>5</b>. While the feed line <b>20</b> is shown as being connected to the fitting <b>12</b>, the center conductor of the feed line <b>20</b> is also connected to the fitting <b>11</b> in order to balance the signals received from each of the antenna elements <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The further elements of the universal dipole <b>1</b> include spacers <b>15</b>, a support plate <b>40</b>, and a sliding short assembly <b>45</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a top view of the spacers <b>15</b> which may be used to construct the universal dipole <b>1</b>. The spacers <b>15</b> may be constructed from a rigid or semi-rigid non-conducting material (e.g., plastic, ceramic, etc.). The spacers <b>15</b> include vias <b>60</b> and <b>61</b> for the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b> to be fed through. The spacers <b>15</b> are used to maintain a fixed distance relationship between the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The spacers <b>15</b> may also add to the rigidity of the universal dipole <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The support plate <b>40</b> further maintains the fixed distance between the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b> and adds support and rigidity to the universal dipole <b>1</b>. The support plate <b>40</b> also creates a short circuit between the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b>. As described above, the operating characteristics of the universal dipole <b>1</b> depend on the length of the antenna elements <b>5</b> and the relationship between the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b>. The support plate <b>40</b> provides a short circuit path between the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b> which defines the maximum distance relationship between the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sliding short assembly <b>45</b> provides for a movable assembly that places the short circuit between the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b> at variable positions. The sliding short assembly <b>45</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in its storage position. As described above, the support plate <b>40</b> defines the maximum distance relationship between the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b>. The storage position is greater than this maximum distance and is used for the storage of the sliding short assembly <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When in use, the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> is moved into position along the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b>. For example, the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> may be moved into position <b>30</b> on the feed line <b>20</b> and position <b>35</b> on the balun <b>25</b> to create the short circuit at this distance which is shorter than the maximum distance presented by the support plate <b>40</b> short circuit. Similarly, the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> may be moved into position <b>31</b> on the feed line <b>20</b> and position <b>36</b> on the balun <b>25</b> to create the short circuit at this distance.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The variable feed line <b>20</b> and balun <b>25</b> short circuit distance may be used in conjunction with the variable antenna element <b>5</b> distance to create the desired operating characteristics of universal dipole <b>1</b>. Examples of such variable distances will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The exemplary feed line <b>20</b> and balun <b>25</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> show two variable positions <b>30</b>, <b>31</b> and <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, respectively. However, it should be understood that the feed line <b>20</b> and balun <b>25</b> may have any number of variable positions where the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> may be attached to create the short circuit between the feed line <b>20</b> and balun <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a side view of an exemplary sliding short assembly <b>45</b> of the universal dipole <b>1</b>. The exemplary sliding short assembly <b>45</b> includes a top portion <b>70</b> and a bottom portion <b>80</b> which are both constructed of a conducting material. The top portion <b>70</b> may be attached to the bottom portion <b>80</b> by, for example, a screw inserted into the respective vias <b>72</b> and <b>82</b>. As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when attached the top portion <b>70</b> and the bottom portion <b>80</b> form two vias <b>75</b> and <b>77</b>. The screw may be loose to allow the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> to be moved into position on the feed line <b>20</b> and balun <b>25</b>, e.g., positions <b>30</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>31</b>, <b>36</b>. The screw may then be tightened to allow the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> to clamp down on the feed line <b>20</b> and balun <b>25</b>, such that the inner faces (<b>74</b>, <b>84</b> and <b>76</b>, <b>86</b>) of the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> forming the vias <b>75</b> and <b>77</b> contact the feed line <b>20</b> and balun <b>25</b> creating the short circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The sliding short assembly <b>45</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is only exemplary and those of skill in the art will understand that there are numerous embodiments of assemblies which may be secured to the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b> to create a short circuit at variable distances.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Also, as described above, the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b> may be constructed of coaxial cable which may have an insulating jacket. Where the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b> are constructed from coaxial cable having an insulating jacket, the insulation may have to be stripped at the various locations along the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b> where the permanent short circuit of the support plate <b>40</b> is created and the variable locations where the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> may be attached in order that the support plate <b>40</b> and/or the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> contact the outer conductor of the coaxial cable.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an exemplary process <b>100</b> for constructing the universal dipole <b>1</b> including exemplary dimensions as described above. In step <b>105</b> the two (2) spacers <b>15</b> are placed on the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b>. In step <b>110</b>, the ends of the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b> are inserted into the respective fittings <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> of the center section <b>10</b>. The feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b> are secured to the center section <b>10</b> by, for example, tightening a screw into the fittings <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> which compresses the fittings <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> onto feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In step <b>115</b>, the support plate <b>40</b> is secured to the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b>. The support plate <b>40</b> may be installed at 4.92 inches from the bottom of the center section <b>10</b>. This is the location of the permanent short between the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b>. The support plate <b>40</b> may be secured by soldering the support plate <b>40</b> to the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b>. The first spacer <b>15</b> may then be positioned at the top edge of the support plate <b>40</b> and the second spacer may be positioned at the lower edge of the center section <b>10</b> (step <b>120</b>). The spacers <b>15</b> may be secured to the outside of the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b> using, for example, an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In step <b>125</b>, the center conductor of the feed line <b>20</b> is connected to the fitting <b>11</b> to which the balun <b>25</b> is connected. As described above, the feed line is connected to the balun <b>25</b> portion of the center section <b>10</b> in order to balance the signal received from the antenna elements <b>5</b>. The connection may be accomplished by bending the center conductor of the feed line <b>20</b> and fitting it into a slot (not shown) of the fitting <b>11</b>, trimming the conductor, as required, and soldering the conductor to the fitting <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The next step <b>130</b> is to assemble the antenna elements <b>5</b>. As described above, the length of the antenna elements <b>5</b> depend on the wavelength of the signals of interest. Using the example of the aluminum hex standoffs described above for the conducting elements <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, the AMPS/GSM band would use two (2) standoffs for each of the antenna elements <b>5</b>, the DCS/PCS band would use one (1) standoff for each of the antenna elements <b>5</b> and the ISM band would not require any standoffs, i.e., the fittings <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> of the center section <b>10</b> provide the required element length for the ISM band. As described above, the conducting elements <b>6</b> may be secured to the fittings <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and any additional conducting elements <b>7</b> may be secured to the conducting elements <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The sliding short assembly <b>45</b> is then placed at the required location (step <b>135</b>). For example, for the AMPS/GSM band, the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> may stay in the storage position because the permanent short of the support plate <b>40</b> is used. The DCS/PCS band may have the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> create a short circuit at a distance of 2.44 inches from the bottom edge of the center section <b>10</b>, e.g., the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> is placed between position <b>31</b> of the feed line <b>20</b> and position <b>36</b> of the balun <b>25</b>. The ISM band may have the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> create a short circuit at a distance of 1.14 inches from the bottom edge of the center section <b>10</b>, e.g., the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> is placed between position <b>30</b> of the feed line <b>20</b> and position <b>35</b> of the balun <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At the end of process <b>100</b>, an exemplary universal dipole <b>1</b> is complete. However, as described above, the universal dipole <b>1</b> may be altered by changing the lengths of the antenna elements <b>5</b> and the position of the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> to accommodate various bands of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Furthermore, the various configurations of the universal dipole <b>1</b> may be tested to verify that the operating characteristics match the expected characteristics. The universal dipole <b>1</b> may be tested against both the expected VSWR (S<b>11</b>) and the Antenna Patterns. VSWR (S<b>11</b>) is the scattering parameter designation for the transmission coefficient of return loss which is designated as reflected power/incident power.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref> show exemplary VSWR (S<b>11</b>) plots against which the universal dipole <b>1</b> according to the present invention maybe tested to determine that its operating characteristics match the desired characteristics. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-15</figref> show exemplary antenna pattern against which the universal dipole <b>1</b> according to the present invention maybe tested to determine that its operating characteristics match the desired characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a second exemplary embodiment of a universal dipole <b>200</b> according to the present invention. The universal dipole <b>200</b> has the same elements as the exemplary universal dipole <b>1</b>, except that there is no sliding short assembly <b>45</b> and switch elements <b>205</b> and <b>210</b> have been added. The switch element <b>205</b> spans between locations <b>30</b> and <b>35</b> and the switch element <b>210</b> spans between locations <b>31</b> and <b>36</b>. The switch elements <b>205</b> and <b>210</b> are conductors which contain a normally open switch. In the normal position, the switch elements <b>205</b> and <b>210</b> do not effect the universal dipole <b>200</b>. However, when a user of the universal dipole <b>200</b> closes one of the switches of the switching elements <b>205</b> and <b>210</b>, the user can create a short circuit between the feed line <b>20</b> and the balun <b>25</b> at the desired location. Thus, the switch elements <b>205</b> and <b>210</b> act in the same manner as the sliding short assembly <b>45</b> of universal dipole <b>1</b>, except that the switch elements <b>205</b> and <b>210</b> may be permanently mounted to the feed line <b>20</b> and balun <b>25</b>. The switching elements <b>205</b> and <b>210</b> may be connected to the outer conductor of the feed line <b>20</b> and balun <b>25</b> by soldering to form an electrical connection so that when the switch is closed, a short is formed at the location.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Again, in the exemplary universal dipole <b>200</b>, two switching elements <b>205</b> and <b>210</b> are shown. However, a universal dipole according to the present invention may include any number of switching elements at various locations along the feed line <b>20</b> and balun <b>25</b> to create a short circuit at various lengths. Thus, to carry through with the examples from above, switching element <b>210</b> may be permanently connected at a distance of 2.44 inches from the bottom edge of the center section <b>10</b> to accommodate the DCS/PCS band and switching element <b>205</b> may be permanently connected at a distance of 1.14 inches from the bottom edge of the center section <b>10</b> to accommodate the ISM band.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The present invention has been described with the reference to the above exemplary embodiments. One skilled in the art would understand that the present invention may also be successfully implemented if modified. Accordingly, various modifications and changes may be made to the embodiments without departing from the broadest spirit and scope of the present invention as set forth in the claims that follow. The specification and drawings, accordingly, should be regarded in an illustrative rather than restrictive sense.</p>
