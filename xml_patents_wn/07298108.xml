<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A driver comprises a direction-switching means which switches a rotation direction of a rotary driving source based on a direction instruction signal, a current amplifier/limiter which converts a voltage outputted from the direction-switching means into a corresponding current and which limits the current to a preset reference current I<sub>MAX </sub>(threshold value), a current sensor which detects the current supplied to the rotary driving source, and a current loop which feeds back a detection signal supplied from the current sensor to an upstream side of the current amplifier/limiter.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention:</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a control system for an electric actuator, which is capable of appropriately protecting a rotary driving source for driving the electric actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art:</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, when an installation type industrial robot is used, a base is fixed by bolts or the like. When a tip end of the robot is excessively pressed or smashed by malfunctioning of the interlock or the like, the operation of the robot is stopped by detecting an overcurrent condition. That is, it is principally intended to prevent the robot and the workpiece from being destroyed, by detecting the overcurrent condition of the installation type industrial robot. The positional deviation of the robot itself is not taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the above, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2002-66969 discloses a technical concept which is directed to prevent an automatic or unmanned transport vehicle from floating even when a tip end of a robot arm is excessively pressed to or smashed against surrounding equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">That is, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2002-66969 discloses a control apparatus which executes an operation for limiting current flowing to a servo motor for driving a joint of the robot arm if joint torque applied to the joint of the robot arm meets a predetermined limit value, when the tip end of the robot arm is moved based on attitude control and position control of the robot arm.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, when the technical concept disclosed in the Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2002-66969 is applied, for example, to an electric actuator for converting a rotary motion of a motor into a rectilinear motion of a slider or the like, it is necessary to provide a detector such as an encoder and a resolver, and a control circuit in order to control, for example, the position and the operation speed of the slider, in which the production cost becomes expensive.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A general object of the present invention is to provide a control system for an electric actuator, wherein the control system makes it possible to limit current to be applied to a rotary driving source by using a simple circuit, even when high load is applied to the rotary driving source which is provided in order to drive the electric actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative example.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a schematic block diagram illustrating an arrangement of the driver <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The driver <b>18</b> includes a direction-switching means <b>34</b> which switches the rotation direction of the rotary driving source <b>12</b> into a forward or backward direction by switching the polarity of the voltage in accordance with the direction instruction signal derived from the controller <b>20</b>, and a current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b> which converts a voltage outputted from the direction-switching means <b>34</b> into a corresponding current and which limits the current with reference to the preset reference current I<sub>MAX </sub>(threshold value).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The driver <b>18</b> further includes a current sensor (current-detecting means) <b>38</b> which is provided on the downstream side of the current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b> and which detects the current to be supplied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b>, and a current loop <b>40</b> which feeds back a detection signal from the current sensor <b>38</b> to the upstream side of the current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b> is provided with a comparing means <b>44</b> which compares the preset reference current I<sub>MAX </sub>stored in a storage means <b>42</b> with the detection signal of the current value supplied from the current sensor <b>38</b> via a detection line <b>41</b>, and a current limit means <b>46</b> which limits the current to be supplied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b> so that the current does not exceed the reference current I<sub>MAX</sub>, for example, when a high load is applied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b> and the current to be supplied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b> exceeds the reference current I<sub>MAX</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The driver <b>18</b> has an unillustrated circuit board. For example, the current sensor <b>38</b> is preferably composed of a small resistor arranged on the circuit board. The driver <b>18</b> is connected to a power source <b>86</b> via a connector.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The control system <b>10</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention, into which the driver <b>18</b> is incorporated, is basically constructed as described above. Next, its operation, function, and effect will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At first, the direction instruction signal from the controller <b>20</b> is introduced into the driver <b>18</b>. The driver <b>18</b> switches the rotation direction of the rotary driving source <b>12</b> into any one of the forward and backward directions by switching the polarity of the voltage based on the direction instruction signal. The voltage, which corresponds to the current supplied from the direction-switching means <b>34</b> to the rotary driving source <b>12</b>, is inputted into the current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b> converts a voltage outputted from the direction-switching means <b>34</b> into a current which is supplied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b>. Accordingly, the rotary driving source <b>12</b> is driven and rotated in the predetermined direction.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The rotary motion of the rotary driving source <b>12</b> is transmitted to the ball screw shaft <b>30</b> connected to the drive shaft of the rotary driving source <b>12</b>. The rotary motion is converted into the rectilinear motion through screw engagement between the ball screw shaft <b>30</b> and the unillustrated ball screw nut. The rectilinear motion is transmitted to the slider <b>14</b>. Therefore, for example, the rod <b>32</b> extends outside integrally with the slider <b>14</b> to press an unillustrated workpiece to a predetermined position.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the workpiece is pressed at the predetermined position by the rod <b>32</b>, and high load is applied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b>, after the slider <b>14</b> reaches the stroke end, the rotation of the drive shaft of the rotary driving source <b>12</b> is stopped and restricted. In this situation, torque, which is outputted from the drive shaft of the rotary driving source <b>12</b>, is proportional to the current applied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b>. Therefore, when the rotary motion is restricted, the current (overcurrent), which exceeds the predetermined value, may be undesirably applied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b>, causing burnout of the rotary driving source <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Accordingly, in the embodiment of the present invention, the detection signal from the current sensor <b>38</b> for detecting the current to be supplied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b> is introduced into the current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b> via the detection line <b>41</b>. The current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b> compares the detection signal from the current sensor <b>38</b> with the preset reference current I<sub>MAX </sub>stored in the storage means <b>42</b> by the comparing means <b>44</b>. Further, the current to be supplied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b>, is limited not to exceed the reference current I<sub>MAX </sub>by the current limit means <b>46</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described above, in the embodiment of the present invention, the value of current to be supplied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b> is checked by the current sensor <b>38</b>, and then the current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b> limits the current applied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b> to be equal to or lower than the reference current I<sub>MAX</sub>. As a result, even when the high load is applied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b>, and the drive shaft of the rotary driving source <b>12</b> in an ON state is stopped and restricted, the rotary driving source <b>12</b> can be prevented from being burnt out due to overcurrent, because the current supplied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b> is limited not to exceed the preset reference current I<sub>MAX</sub>. The torque, of course, can be controlled by limiting the current applied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the embodiment of the present invention, it is unnecessary to provide a detector such as an encoder and a resolver, and a control circuit to control operation speed and position of the slider <b>14</b>. The rotary driving source <b>12</b> can be prevented from being burnt out by using a simple circuit such as the current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b>, making it possible to reduce production cost.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this arrangement, it is preferable that the driver <b>18</b> is applied to the driving apparatus (electric actuator) in which only the pressing action by the rod <b>32</b> and the rotation direction of the rotary driving source <b>12</b> are controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Though not restrictive, the present invention has been explained based on the embodiment where a workpiece is pressed by the rod <b>32</b> of the electric actuator <b>16</b>, and applicable, for example, to transporting, caulking, pushing or supporting the workpiece by the rod <b>32</b> of the electric actuator <b>16</b>, to grip the workpiece by an unillustrated electric chuck, or to clamp the workpiece by an electric clamp as described later on.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The modified embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is constructed as follows. That is, a vacuum port <b>130</b> is connected to the electric actuator <b>16</b> to obtain a vacuum state in the space between the rod <b>32</b> and a cover <b>132</b> surrounding the rod <b>32</b> to remove dust which may be generated during the sliding movement of the rod <b>32</b>. A dust seal <b>134</b>, which contacts and presses the circumferential wall surface of the rod <b>32</b>, may be provided at the tip end of the cover <b>132</b> as well (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The modified embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> is constructed as follows. That is, a plurality of needle shafts <b>140</b> made of resin, preferably three on one side and six in total on both sides, extend in the axial direction between the frame <b>100</b> and the slider <b>14</b> in the electric actuator <b>16</b> in place of the guide shafts <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b</i>. Such an electric actuator <b>16</b> can be produced more inexpensively.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In each of the modified embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 16</figref> described above, the rod <b>32</b> moves forward and backward two-dimensionally. However, a plurality of the electric actuators <b>16</b> can be combined three-dimensionally to perform the three-dimensional action. Such an arrangement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the modified embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the electric actuators <b>16</b> are attached along the X axis, the Y axis, and the Z axis, respectively, to make the rod <b>32</b> of the electric actuator <b>16</b> for the Z axis move three-dimensionally from a big point of view.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">That is, when a high load is applied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b> as a result of, for example, the workpiece-transporting operation, the workpiece-gripping operation, or the clamping operation as described above, and the rotation of the drive shaft of the rotary driving source <b>12</b> is stopped and restricted, the current to be supplied to the rotary driving source <b>12</b> is limited not to exceed the reference current I<sub>MAX</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Next, an explanation will be made about Comparative Example 1 and Comparative Example 2 to be compared with the embodiments of the present invention. The same components as those of the embodiments of the present invention are designated by the same reference numerals, and detailed explanation thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a relay circuit <b>50</b> concerning Comparative Example 1. In this arrangement, when a plurality of the relay circuits <b>50</b> are combined, it is possible to switch the direction of rotation of the rotary driving source <b>12</b>. However, when the drive shaft of the rotary driving source <b>12</b> is stopped and restricted, current exceeding capacity of the rotary driving source <b>12</b> may be supplied and cause burnout thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a servo circuit <b>60</b> concerning Comparative Example 2. The servo circuit <b>60</b> has a detector such as a resolver and an encoder <b>62</b>, comprising a control circuit for feedback-controlling speed by a speed loop <b>64</b> and a speed amplifier/limiter <b>66</b>, and a control circuit for positioning by a position loop <b>68</b> and a position amplifier/limiter <b>70</b>. Therefore, the servo circuit <b>60</b> concerning Comparative Example 2 requires highly accurate control circuits for controlling, for example, the position and the speed. Therefore, the servo circuit <b>60</b> is expensive, and the production cost becomes high.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">On the contrary, the embodiment of the present invention makes it possible to incorporate part of functions of the relay circuit <b>50</b> concerning Comparative Example 1 and the servo circuit <b>60</b> concerning Comparative Example 2 at a low cost. Further, in the embodiment of the present invention, the electric actuator <b>16</b> can be operated in accordance with the ON/OFF control in the same manner as the solenoid-operated valve, and thus the electric actuator <b>16</b> can be used as a direction-controlling apparatus optimally, for example, for pressing, transporting, etc. Further, in the embodiment of the present invention, it is unnecessary to provide a detector such as an encoder additionally provided outside the rotary driving source <b>12</b>. Therefore, it is possible to reduce size and weight.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the embodiment described above, the relationship between the rotary driving source <b>12</b> and the ball screw shaft <b>30</b> is not explained in detail. Of course, the both may be directly connected to one another. However, a mechanism for switching speed reducing ratio may also be interposed therebetween. As for such a speed reducing ratio-switching mechanism, SMC KABUSHIKI KAISHA has proposed “an apparatus for automatically switching speed reducing ratio” as Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-170263. With reference thereto in this application, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, helical gears are used as a sun gear <b>216</b>, planet gears <b>218</b>, and an internal gear <b>220</b>. Accordingly, when a load, which exceeds a predetermined torque, is applied to the internal gear <b>220</b>, the internal gear <b>220</b> is moved in the direction toward the input shaft or the direction toward the output shaft, while being rotated in the direction different from that of the sun gear <b>216</b>, and thus the speed reducing ratio is automatically switched.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Various embodiments are also conceived in relation to the direct connection between the rotary driving source <b>12</b> and the ball screw shaft <b>30</b> as described above. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, the output shaft, i.e., the input shaft of the ball screw shaft <b>30</b> is directly connected to the input shaft, i.e., the output shaft of the rotary driving source <b>12</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, a viscous coupling <b>230</b> is interposed between the input shaft and the output shaft. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, a powder clutch <b>240</b> is interposed between the input shaft and the output shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, even in an arrangement in which the viscous coupling <b>230</b> is interposed, fluid resistance can be increased/decreased by screwing an adjusting screw <b>250</b> to press one disk disposed on the side of the output shaft in order to adjust the rotational force of the rotary driving source <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In an arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>, a magnet <b>260</b> is provided for a rotor <b>261</b> between the input shaft and the output shaft. A plate member <b>264</b> made of aluminum or copper is attached inside a casing <b>262</b>. The plate member <b>264</b> is moved back and forth by an adjusting screw <b>266</b> to make rotational resistance variable by changing magnetic fluxes of the magnet <b>260</b>. In an arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref>, a coil <b>267</b> is attached around a rotor <b>261</b>. A resistance value of a resistor <b>268</b> is changed with respect to the coil <b>267</b> in order to control the rotation of the rotor <b>261</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20D</figref>, a rotor <b>261</b> may be simply tightened by a brake <b>270</b> to control ON/OFF of the rotation of the rotor <b>261</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the embodiment described above, the rotary driving source <b>12</b> and the slider <b>14</b> are connected to one another by the ball screw shaft <b>30</b> to transmit the rotational force of the rotary driving source <b>12</b>. However, there is no limitation to the ball screw shaft <b>30</b> as described above. For example, as described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2005-106284, the slider <b>14</b> may be displaced by a belt <b>300</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The present invention is also usable for structures in which a rotary driving source <b>12</b> and a ball screw shaft <b>30</b> are juxtaposed as in an electric clamp apparatus as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref> (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 2001-105332 and 2002-219625), or a hydraulic cylinder <b>302</b> is juxtaposed (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2005-54862, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, the driver <b>18</b><i>a </i>has a casing <b>121</b> provided with a plurality of fins <b>119</b> protruding from a broad side surface. A plurality of control terminals <b>123</b>, which are electrically connected to the controller <b>20</b> via a cable, are provided at an upper portion of the casing <b>121</b>.

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Those provided on a narrow width side surface of the driver <b>18</b><i>a </i>are a torque-setting trimmer <b>125</b> with which the rotational torque (thrust force) of the rotary driving source <b>514</b> can be arbitrarily set externally by regulating the angle of rotation in a predetermined direction by using, for example, a plus screwdriver, a plurality of display lamps <b>127</b><i>a </i>to <b>127</b><i>d </i>which are recognizable in accordance with the light emission of unillustrated LEDs, and a plurality of manual switches which make it possible to perform, for example, the test operation in accordance with the manual operation.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The manual switches include a PHASE direction-switching switch <b>129</b> which indicates two directions of the A-PHASE direction (elongating direction of the piston rod <b>524</b>) and the B-PHASE direction (shrinking direction of the piston rod <b>524</b>) in accordance with the ON/OFF operation, an ON/OFF switch <b>131</b> which energizes and deenergizes the driver <b>18</b><i>a</i>, and a SET switch <b>133</b> in which the initial setting is established when the switch is turned OFF and the external thrust force can be selected by using the torque-setting trimmer <b>125</b> when the switch is turned ON.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The rotational speed of the rotary driving source <b>514</b> can be controlled by arbitrarily changing the application voltage, which is applied from the power source <b>523</b> to the driver <b>18</b><i>a</i>, by using, for example, an unillustrated resistor, a transformer, or an internal circuit, or by incorporating the rotary driving source <b>514</b> into an unillustrated bridge circuit to provide an electronic governor (not shown) for feeding back the unbalanced voltage of the bridge circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">A flange <b>137</b>, through which attachment holes <b>135</b> are formed, is formed on a side surface opposite to the narrow width side surface on which the manual switches and other components are provided as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The other portions of the driver <b>18</b><i>a </i>are constructed in the same manner as the driver <b>18</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and detailed explanations thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The control system <b>10</b><i>a</i>, into which the driver <b>18</b><i>a </i>according to the modified embodiment is incorporated, is basically constructed as described above. Next, its operation, function, and effect will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">At first, the direction instruction signal (binary signal) is introduced into the driver <b>18</b><i>a </i>from the controller <b>20</b>. The driver <b>18</b><i>a </i>switches the polarity of the voltage based on the direction instruction signal. Accordingly, the rotation direction of the rotary driving source <b>514</b> is switched to the forward or backward direction. The voltage, which corresponds to the current supplied from the direction-switching means <b>34</b> to the rotary driving source <b>514</b>, is inputted into the current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b> converts the voltage outputted from the direction-switching means <b>34</b> into the corresponding current which is supplied to the rotary driving source <b>514</b>. Accordingly, the rotary driving source <b>514</b> is driven and rotated in the predetermined direction, and the rotary driving force of the rotary driving source <b>514</b> is transmitted to the feed screw shaft <b>518</b> by the coupling member <b>528</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The feed screw shaft <b>518</b>, which is rotated in the predetermined direction, is screwed to the screw hole <b>550</b> of the sliding nut <b>552</b> which functions as the feed nut. Accordingly, the sliding nut <b>552</b> and the piston <b>522</b> are displaced in the axial direction integrally with the piston rod <b>524</b> by the guidance of the pair of guide rods <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the piston rod <b>524</b> is displaced toward the outside integrally with the piston <b>522</b>, and the piston rod <b>524</b> arrives at the stroke end, thereby pressing the unillustrated workpiece to the predetermined position.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, when the piston <b>522</b> does not arrive at both stroke ends, and the operation for pressing the workpiece W is performed at an intermediate position therebetween, then the impact is transmitted to the piston <b>522</b> via the socket <b>526</b> which abuts against the workpiece W, the piston rod <b>524</b>, and the connecting member <b>560</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In this situation, the end portion of the piston damper <b>556</b><i>a</i>, which contacts the connecting member <b>560</b>, is deformed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, and thus the impact is received. Further, the sliding nut <b>552</b>, which is provided in the piston <b>522</b>, slides slightly in the axial direction of the feed screw shaft <b>518</b> with respect to the piston <b>522</b> (see two-dot chain lines shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>). Accordingly, the impact is desirably absorbed.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In other words, the piston <b>522</b> and the connecting member <b>560</b>, which are connected to each other, are provided displaceably in the axial direction of the feed screw shaft <b>518</b> in response to the impact applied to the piston rod <b>524</b>. The slight displacement of the piston <b>522</b> and the connecting member <b>560</b> is absorbed by the piston damper <b>556</b><i>a </i>which has elasticity and which is installed to the end of the sliding nut <b>552</b>. Accordingly, the impact is desirably absorbed.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In this situation, the sliding nut <b>552</b> is not displaced in relation to the feed screw shaft <b>518</b>, because the sliding nut <b>552</b> is screwed to the feed screw shaft <b>518</b>. Further, the impact is prevented from being transmitted to the screw engagement portion of the sliding nut <b>552</b> and the feed screw shaft <b>518</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to desirably protect the screw engagement portion of the sliding nut <b>552</b> and the feed screw shaft <b>518</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Therefore, even when the workpiece W is pressed against the piston rod <b>524</b> at the intermediate position between both stroke ends, the impact, which is applied to the piston rod <b>524</b>, is smoothly absorbed by the relative sLiding displacement between the piston <b>522</b> and the sliding nut <b>552</b> and the elastic piston damper <b>556</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, it is possible to avoid deterioration of the durability of the electric actuator <b>511</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Further, when the impact is caused at the forward movement stroke end of the piston rod <b>524</b>, the impact is absorbed more preferably, because of the synergistic buffering effect of the piston damper <b>556</b><i>a </i>and abutment of the annular flange section <b>566</b> of the connecting member <b>560</b> against the second end damper <b>536</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Similarly, when the impact is generated at the backward movement stroke end of the piston rod <b>524</b>, the impact is absorbed more preferably, because of the synergistic buffering effect of the piston damper <b>556</b><i>b </i>and abutment of the end surface of the annular member <b>568</b> and the piston <b>522</b> against the first end damper <b>536</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As described above, the buffering mechanism is provided, which includes the pair of piston dampers <b>556</b><i>a</i>, <b>556</b><i>b </i>provided for the piston <b>522</b>, and the first and second end dampers <b>536</b><i>a</i>, <b>536</b><i>b </i>provided for the housing <b>512</b> and the rod cover <b>516</b>. Accordingly, the impact on the piston <b>522</b> can be preferably buffered at any arbitrary position including both stroke ends and the intermediate position therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The electric actuator can be used as an actuator driven by the motor usable in the same manner as the air cylinder even in an environment in which compressed air is absent or compressed air cannot be used.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In this case, the phrase “in the same manner as the air cylinder” refers, for example, to the fact that the electric actuator is driven in accordance with the ON/OFF control, no controller is required, it is possible to press the piston <b>522</b>, the electric actuator can be driven without any sensor, and it is possible to control the speed and the thrust force.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Further, the predetermined rigidity is maintained by the pair of parallel guide rods <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b </i>without the need for a rigid body. Accordingly, the number of parts is decreased, the production cost is reduced, and it is possible to realize a light weight.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Furthermore, an impact absorber (damper) is generally arranged at a portion where parts collide with each other in the driving apparatus. However, when the property, size, and displacement amount of the damper are set so that the impact value upon collision is not more than 5 G, preferably not more than 2 G, then it is possible to improve the durability of the damper, thereby improving the durability of the electric actuator. The strength of each part can be reduced by suppressing the impact value, and hence it is possible to reduce size and weight of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As for the method for producing the housing <b>512</b> and the rod cover <b>516</b>, it is preferable to use, for example, integrated molding based on aluminum die casting, plate deep drawing, or stacked steel plates integrally formed by stacking a plurality of steel plates.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">As for the feed screw shaft <b>518</b>, it is preferable to use, for example, a slide screw shaft made of resin, a slide screw shaft made of metal, a ball screw shaft, or a timing belt suspended between pulleys.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">When the workpiece W is pressed to a predetermined position by the piston rod <b>524</b> and a high load is applied to the rotary driving source <b>514</b> after the piston <b>522</b> and the piston rod <b>524</b> arrive at the stroke end, the rotation of the drive shaft of the rotary driving source <b>514</b> is stopped and restricted. In this situation, the torque, which is outputted from the drive shaft of the rotary driving source <b>514</b>, is proportional to the current applied to the rotary driving source <b>514</b>. Therefore, when the drive shaft is restricted, the current (overcurrent), which is not less than the predetermined current value, is applied to the rotary driving source <b>514</b>. When the overcurrent is generated, the rotary driving source <b>514</b> may undesirably burn out.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Accordingly, the detection signal, which is fed from the current sensor <b>38</b> for detecting the current to be supplied to the rotary driving source <b>514</b>, is introduced into the current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b> via the detection line <b>41</b>. The current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b> compares, by the comparing means <b>44</b>, the preset reference current I<sub>MAX </sub>stored in the storage means <b>42</b> with the detection signal supplied from the current sensor <b>38</b>. Further, the current, which is to be supplied to the rotary driving source <b>514</b>, is limited by the current limit means <b>46</b> so that the current does not exceed the reference current I<sub>MAX </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The current value, which is used when the rotary driving source <b>514</b> is controlled, is limited, for example, to not more than 0.6 A when the drive shaft of the rotary driving source <b>514</b> is stopped and restricted, and not more than 0.2 A during the driving state with no load. Accordingly, the rotary driving source <b>514</b> is able to have a long service life.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As described above, in the driver <b>18</b><i>a </i>of the present embodiment, the value of the current supplied to the rotary driving source <b>514</b> is monitored by the current sensor <b>38</b>, and the current amplifier/limiter <b>36</b> is used to limit the current applied to the rotary driving source <b>514</b> to be not more than the reference current I<sub>MAX</sub>. As a result, even when the high load is applied to the rotary driving source <b>514</b>, and the drive shaft of the rotary driving source <b>514</b> in the ON state is stopped and restricted, the current supplied to the rotary driving source <b>514</b> is limited to be not more than the preset reference current I<sub>MAX</sub>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the rotary driving source <b>514</b> from burning out by the overcurrent. It is a matter of course that the torque, which is proportional to the application current, can be limited by limiting the application current to be supplied to the rotary driving source <b>514</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Next, a modified embodiment of the electric actuator is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 to 38</figref>.

<p id="p-0150" num="0149">An electric actuator <b>580</b> according to the present modified embodiment is different from the electric actuator <b>511</b> in that the pair of guide rods <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b </i>is not provided, a lengthy cylindrical tube <b>586</b> is provided to connect a cylindrical housing <b>582</b> and a stepped cylindrical rod cover <b>584</b>, and a piston <b>590</b> is accommodated in a hollow section <b>588</b> of the tube <b>586</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> shows a motor driver characteristic in relation to the number of revolutions and the torque (current value). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, when the current is limited, then the motor (rotary driving source <b>514</b>) can be prevented from burning out, and it is possible to limit the torque. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> shows a load-speed control characteristic in relation to the relationship between the number of revolutions and the torque (current value). When the current value is set corresponding to the load, the current limits (for example, Limits 1 to 4) are set. In this case, the load is based on, for example, the generator and the internal viscous resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In the foregoing description, the motor includes, for example, at least DC motors, coreless motors, brushless DC motors, linear motors, and voice coil motors.</p>

It is possible to form a network together with other control apparatuses. For example, remote operation and diagnosis can be performed via the internet or the portable terminal (including portable telephones) by using the network.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Further, a direction control apparatus of the composite type body makes it possible to control a plurality of motors by using one direction control apparatus. The direction control apparatus can be driven, for example, by a battery and a cell (including a fuel cell) instead of an ordinary power source.</p>
