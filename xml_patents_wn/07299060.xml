<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to telecommunications and, more particularly, to methods and systems for wirelessly bridging a mobile station with a landline station.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most mobile stations have a two-line capability and can engage in three-way calling. Such three-way calling typically works as follows. A subscriber using a mobile station is engaged in a call with a first party, party A (who may be on either a landline station or a mobile station). The subscriber then places party A on hold, such as by pressing the “SEND” key on the mobile station, in order to try to connect a second party, party B. With party A on hold, the subscriber dials the telephone number of party B (who may be on either a landline station or a mobile station) using the mobile station's keypad. When party B answers, the subscriber is then able to join the two calls together within the mobile station, such as by pressing the “SEND” key. In this way, a subscriber engaged in a call with party A may add party B into the conversation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One disadvantage with such three-way calling is that it requires additional resources of the wireless telecommunications network. For example, the network typically has to allocate a second wireless traffic channel in order to connect the second party to the mobile station. Of course, adding the second party to the three-way call also typically uses the resources of the landline or wireless network serving the second party. Because of the use of additional resources, wireless telecommunications networks often charge subscribers extra for three-way calling.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a first principal aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a method of facilitating wireless communication between a mobile station and a landline station. The mobile station is able to send and receive calls via a wireless telecommunications network, and the landline station is able to send and receive calls via a landline telecommunications network. In accordance with the method, the mobile station wirelessly transmits a bridging signal to a transceiver independently of the wireless telecommunications network. The transceiver is communicatively coupled to the landline telecommunications network. In response to the bridging signal, the landline station is alerted independently of the landline telecommunications network. A user may answer the alert by taking the landline station off-hook, at which point a wireless communication link between the mobile station and the landline station may be established independently of the landline and wireless telecommunications networks.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a second principal aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a method of facilitating wireless communication between a mobile station and a landline station. The mobile station is able to send and receive calls via a wireless telecommunications network, and the landline station is able to send and receive calls via a landline telecommunications network. In accordance with the method, a predetermined instruction is received from a user. In response to the predetermined instruction, a wireless communication link is established between the landline station and the mobile station, via a transceiver communicatively coupled to the landline telecommunications network, independently of the landline and wireless telecommunications networks. Thus, if the mobile station is engaged in a call via the wireless telecommunications network, the landline station may be included in the call via the wireless communication link. Similarly, if the landline station is engaged in call via the landline telecommunications network, the mobile station may be included in the call via the wireless communication link.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a third principal aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a system for facilitating wireless communication between a mobile station and a landline station. The mobile station is able to send and receive calls via a wireless telecommunications network, and the landline station is able to send and receive calls via a landline telecommunications network. The system comprises an antenna, a wireless transmitter communicatively coupled to the antenna, a wireless receiver communicatively coupled to the antenna, a telephone line interface communicatively coupled to the landline telecommunications network, a multiplexer, a controller, and a user interface. The user interface, which is coupled to the controller, enables a user to enter a predetermined instruction. The multiplexer, which is controlled by the controller, selectively interconnects the wireless transmitter, wireless receive, and telephone line interface. The system provides a first communication pathway for communicatively coupling the landline station to the landline telecommunications network and a second communication pathway for communicatively coupling the mobile station with the landline station, via a wireless communication link, independently of the landline telecommunications network. In response to the predetermined instruction, the system wirelessly transmits a bridging signal to the mobile station, independently of the wireless telecommunications network.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention, in its preferred embodiments, provides a “home zone” within which a mobile station may wirelessly bridge with a landline station, independently of both the wireless telecommunications network and the landline telecommunications network. In this way, the mobile station and the landline station may communicate without using the resources of the wireless and landline networks. The mobile station may add the landline station as a third party to a call, or the landline station may add the mobile station as a third party to a call, without using additional network resources.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an exemplary embodiment, the “home zone” is defined by the wireless coverage area (which may be on the order of 100 meters) of a transceiver that is communicatively coupled to the landline telecommunications network. The transceiver may be a cordless base unit, and the landline station may be a cordless handset of the cordless base unit. The mobile station, while engaged in a call via a wireless telecommunications network, may wirelessly transmit a bridging signal to the transceiver, in order to include the landline station in the call independently of the landline telecommunications network. While the landline station is engaged in a call via the landline telecommunications network, the transceiver may wirelessly transmit a bridging signal to the mobile station, in order to include the mobile station in the call independently of the wireless telecommunications network.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXEMPLARY ARCHITECTURE</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified block diagram of an exemplary telecommunications system <b>10</b> in which exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be employed. System <b>10</b> includes a wireless telecommunications network, exemplified by a mobile switching center (MSC) <b>12</b> and a base transceiver station (BTS) <b>14</b>. MSC <b>12</b> may be connected to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) <b>16</b>. BTS <b>14</b> may be connected to MSC <b>12</b>, in many cases via a base station controller (BSC) and/or other networks or systems. BTS <b>14</b> provides a wireless coverage area, within which BTS <b>14</b> may communicate with one or more mobile stations, such as mobile station <b>18</b>, over an air interface. Mobile station <b>18</b> may be a wireless telephone, a wirelessly equipped personal digital assistant (PDA), or other wireless device. The wireless communication between BTS <b>14</b> and mobile station <b>18</b> may occur in cellular or PCS frequency band, and it may occur in a digital format, such as CDMA, TDMA, GSM, or 802.11x, or in an analog format, such as AMPS. In this way, mobile station <b>18</b> is able to use the wireless telecommunications network, comprising MSC <b>12</b> and BTS <b>14</b>, to send and receive calls.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">PSTN <b>16</b> is also connected to a landline telecommunications network, which may include one or more service switching points (SSPs), such as SSP <b>20</b>. SSP <b>20</b>, in turn, may be connected to a plurality of landline stations, which may be located in customers' premises, such as homes or businesses. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the customer's premises includes a cordless base unit (CBU) <b>22</b> and a wireline telephone <b>24</b> connected to SSP <b>20</b>, via a telephone line <b>25</b>. CBU <b>22</b>, in turn, may communicate with one or more cordless handsets, such as cordless handset <b>26</b>. Thus, cordless handset <b>26</b> and wireline telephone <b>24</b> are landline stations on telephone line <b>25</b> and may use the landline telecommunications network (exemplified by SSP <b>20</b>), to send and receive calls.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">CBU <b>22</b> includes an antenna <b>28</b> that provides a cordless-wireless coverage area, within which CBU <b>22</b> can communicate with cordless handset <b>26</b> over an air interface. CBU <b>22</b> may use a cordless telephone frequency band, such as the 2.4 GHz cordless telephone frequency band, for cordless-wireless communications with handset <b>26</b>. Alternatively, CBU <b>22</b> may use some other frequency band, which may or may not be a cordless telephone frequency band. The cordless-wireless communications between CBU <b>22</b> and handset <b>26</b> may be encrypted. For example, the cordless-wireless communications may use a digital spread spectrum (DSS) technology, such as frequency-hopping. Moreover, CBU <b>22</b> may be able to communicate with a plurality of cordless handsets by using distinct cordless-wireless channels for each handset. For example, CBU <b>22</b> may have access to eight cordless-wireless channels and, thus, be able to communicate with eight cordless handsets. The cordless-wireless channels may be defined, for example, by different frequencies, different time slots, and/or different spreading codes.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Within the cordless-wireless coverage area provided by antenna <b>28</b>, CBU <b>22</b> may also use one of its available cordless-wireless channels to communicate with mobile station <b>18</b> over an air interface. Moreover, CBU <b>22</b> may be able to selectively provide two different types of communication pathways for mobile station <b>18</b>. In particular, CBU <b>22</b> may provide a first communication pathway to communicatively couple mobile station <b>18</b> and/or cordless handset <b>26</b> to telephone line <b>25</b>. CBU <b>22</b> may also be able to provide a second communication pathway to communicatively couple mobile station <b>18</b> with cordless handset <b>26</b> (via a wireless communication link), independently of the landline telecommunications network. In this way, CBU <b>22</b> may wirelessly bridge mobile station <b>18</b> with cordless handset <b>26</b> without involving the landline network. Moreover, as described in more detail below, this wireless bridging may occur while mobile station <b>18</b> is engaged in a call via the wireless telecommunications network and/or while cordless handset <b>26</b> is engaged in a call via the landline telecommunications network.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary CBU <b>22</b> in more detail. CBU <b>22</b> is connected to telephone line <b>25</b> via a telephone line interface <b>30</b>. Antenna <b>28</b> may be connected to a transmit system <b>32</b> and a receive system <b>34</b>. CBU <b>22</b> may also include an audio block <b>36</b>, which may include one or more speakers, microphones, codes, and/or other audio components. A multiplexer (MUX) <b>38</b> may be connected to telephone line interface <b>30</b>, transmit system <b>32</b>, receive system <b>34</b>, and audio block <b>36</b>, so as to selectively interconnect these components. MUX <b>38</b> may use time domain multiplexing and/or other types of multiplexing.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, MUX <b>38</b> may connect transmit system <b>32</b> and receive system <b>34</b> to telephone line interface <b>30</b>. In this way, CBU <b>22</b> may provide a communication pathway to communicatively couple mobile station <b>18</b> and/or cordless handset <b>26</b> with telephone <b>25</b>. Thus, in this configuration, telephone line interface <b>30</b> may receive signals over telephone line <b>25</b> and send them to transmit system <b>32</b>, via MUX <b>38</b>. Transmit system <b>32</b> then transmits the signals through antenna <b>28</b> to mobile station <b>18</b> and/or cordless handset <b>26</b>, using one or more cordless-wireless channels. Similarly, antenna <b>28</b> may receive signals over an air interface from mobile station <b>18</b> and/or cordless handset <b>26</b>, and receive system <b>34</b> sends the signals to telephone line interface <b>30</b>, via MUX <b>38</b>. Telephone line interface <b>30</b> then transmits the signals over telephone line <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another configuration, MUX <b>38</b> may connect transmit system <b>32</b> to receive system <b>34</b>, so as to provide a communication pathway to communicatively couple mobile station <b>18</b> with cordless handset <b>26</b>. In this configuration, the communications between CBU <b>22</b> and mobile station <b>18</b> may occur over an air interface using a first cordless-wireless channel (or channels), and the communications between CBU <b>22</b> and cordless handset <b>26</b> may occur over an air interface using a second cordless-wireless channel (or channels). Thus, within the cordless-wireless coverage area of CBU <b>22</b>, mobile station <b>18</b> may transmit signals to CBU <b>22</b> using the first cordless-wireless channel(s). Receive system <b>34</b> receives the signals from mobile station <b>18</b>, via antenna <b>28</b>. In this configuration, MUX <b>38</b> interconnects receive system <b>34</b> and transmit system <b>32</b>. Thus, transmit system <b>32</b> receives the signals from receive system <b>34</b> and transmits them through antenna <b>28</b> to cordless handset <b>26</b>, using the second cordless-wireless channel(s). In a similar manner, cordless handset <b>26</b> may transmit signals using the second cordless-wireless channel(s). Within CBU <b>22</b>, receive system <b>34</b> receives the signals from cordless handset <b>26</b>, and transmit system <b>32</b> transmits the signals to mobile station <b>18</b>, using the first cordless-wireless channels. Finally, MUX <b>38</b> may connect transmit system <b>32</b>, receive system <b>34</b>, and telephone line interface <b>30</b> so as to effectively join the two communication pathways. In this way, mobile station <b>18</b> and cordless handset <b>26</b> may both participate in a call over telephone line <b>25</b>, as described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">MUX <b>38</b> may be controlled by a controller <b>40</b>. Controller <b>40</b> may control CBU <b>22</b> in accordance with software programmed in CBU <b>22</b>. For example, controller <b>40</b> may include a processor that executes machine language instructions stored in data storage to control MUX <b>38</b>. Controller <b>40</b> may control MUX <b>38</b> in accordance with instructions from a user. In particular, CBU <b>22</b> may include a user interface <b>42</b> coupled to controller <b>38</b>. User interface <b>42</b> may include a keypad, other buttons or controls, a touch screen, a voice recognition system, and/or other user input devices with which a user may enter instructions. User interface <b>42</b> may also include a display or other devices to convey information to the user. Controller <b>40</b> may receive instructions that a user has input by means of user interface <b>42</b>. Alternatively, controller <b>40</b> may receive user instructions transmitted to CBU <b>22</b> over an air interface, such as from cordless handset <b>26</b>. Controller <b>40</b> may then control MUX <b>38</b> or other aspects of the operation of CBU <b>22</b> in response to the user instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, in some embodiments, a user may be able to use user interface <b>42</b> and audio block <b>36</b> so as to use CBU <b>22</b> itself, i.e., without using cordless handset <b>26</b>, to send and receive calls via telephone line <b>25</b>. Thus, CBU <b>22</b> may be able to act as a landline station, even without a cordless handset, such as cordless handset <b>26</b>. In other embodiments, CBU <b>22</b> may lack the functionality to send and receive calls.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A user may also be able to control CBU <b>22</b> to control its wireless communications with mobile station <b>18</b>. For example, user interface <b>42</b> may include a “mobile alert” button that, when pressed, causes CBU <b>22</b> to alert mobile station <b>18</b> by wirelessly transmitting a bridging signal. Alternatively, user interface <b>42</b> may include a keypad or other input device with which the user may enter instructions that cause CBU <b>22</b> to transmit the bridging signal to mobile station <b>18</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, a user may be able to use a keypad <b>44</b> or other user interface on cordless handset <b>26</b> to cause CBU <b>22</b> to alert mobile station <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary mobile station <b>18</b> in more detail. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, mobile station <b>18</b> may use separate antennas and separate transmit/receive systems for communicating with BTS <b>14</b> and communicating with CBU <b>22</b>. In particular, mobile station <b>18</b> may include a first transmit/receive system <b>50</b> connected to a first antenna <b>52</b>, for communicating with BTS <b>14</b>, and a second transmit/receive system <b>54</b> connected to a second antenna <b>56</b>, for communicating with CBU <b>22</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, antenna <b>52</b> is an external antenna and antenna <b>56</b> is an internal antenna, but other configurations may be used. An audio block <b>58</b>, which may include one or more speakers, microphones, codecs, and other audio components, may be selectively connected to transmit/receive system <b>50</b>, transmit/receive system <b>54</b>, or both, via a multiplexer (MUX) <b>60</b>. MUX <b>60</b>, in turn, may be controlled by a controller <b>62</b>. Controller <b>62</b> may control MUX <b>60</b> in accordance with software programmed in mobile station <b>18</b>. For example, controller <b>62</b> may include a processor that executes machine language instructions stored in data storage to control MUX <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Controller <b>62</b> may control MUX <b>60</b> in accordance with user instructions entered by a user interface <b>64</b>. User interface <b>64</b> may include a keypad with a plurality of keys with which the user may input alphanumeric characters and other symbols, such as “*” and “#”. The keypad may also include one or more function keys, such as “SEND” and “END”. Thus, the user may control aspects of the operation of mobile station <b>18</b>, such as the connections of MUX <b>60</b>, by entering appropriate keypad sequences. Alternatively, user interface <b>64</b> may include a touch screen, voice recognition system, or other user input devices with which the user may enter instructions to control mobile station <b>18</b>. User interface <b>64</b> may also a display or other devices for conveying information to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> cordless base unit <b>22</b> is used to wirelessly bridge mobile station <b>18</b> with a landline station (e.g, to cordless handset <b>26</b>), more generally, a transceiver may be used for the wireless bridging. The transceiver may provide a first communication pathway for communicatively coupling the landline telecommunications network (exemplified by SSP <b>20</b>) to one or more landline stations. The landline stations may, for example, include cordless handsets, wired extensions, and/or other telephony devices. Moreover, a landline station may be integrated into the transceiver. The transceiver may provide a second communication pathway for communicatively coupling mobile station <b>18</b> to one or more landline stations, independently of the landline network. In this regard, the transceiver may use an antenna to communicate with mobile station <b>18</b>, and the transceiver may use the same or a different antenna to communicate with cordless handsets. In addition, although the frequency band that the transceiver uses to communicate with mobile station <b>18</b> may be one that is used for cordless telephones, other frequency bands could be used.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXEMPLARY OPERATION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref> show examples of wireless bridging between mobile station <b>18</b> and CBU <b>22</b>, using telecommunications system <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In an exemplary embodiment, mobile station <b>18</b> is able to originate a call through the landline telecommunications network by wirelessly bridging with CBU <b>22</b>, as summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The process may begin when the user of mobile station <b>18</b> dials digits to originate a call, such as by using a keypad of user interface <b>64</b>, as indicated by step <b>100</b>. The user may then have the option of routing the call through either the wireless telecommunications network (exemplified by BTS <b>14</b> and MSC <b>12</b>) or the landline telecommunications network (exemplified by SSP <b>20</b>) by wirelessly bridging to CBU <b>22</b>. Thus, whether the call is routed through the wireless network or through the landline network may depend on whether the user presses the “SEND” key, as indicated by step <b>102</b>. If the user presses the “SEND” key, then mobile station <b>18</b> may use antenna <b>52</b> to transmit to BTS <b>14</b> and, thereby, route the call through the wireless network, as indicated by step <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">However, the user may have the option of causing mobile station <b>18</b> to route the call through the landline network instead, by entering a predetermined instruction, such as by using a keypad of user interface <b>64</b> to enter “*77” (or other predetermined keypad sequence), as indicated by step <b>106</b>. In response to “*77” or other predetermined instruction, mobile station <b>18</b> may use antenna <b>54</b> to wirelessly transmit a bridging signal, as indicated by step <b>108</b>. Whether mobile station <b>18</b> is able to wirelessly bridge to CBU <b>22</b> in this way, may depend on whether mobile station <b>18</b> is within the “home zone,” as indicated by step <b>110</b>. As noted above, the “home zone” may be defined by the wireless coverage area provided by antenna <b>28</b> of CBU <b>22</b>. If mobile station <b>18</b> is not within the “home zone,” i.e., is out of range for successful wireless communication with CBU <b>22</b>, then mobile station <b>18</b> may instead route the call through the wireless network, as indicated by step <b>112</b>. In this regard, mobile station <b>18</b> may include an antenna strength indicator to indicate the proximity of mobile station <b>18</b> to CBU <b>22</b>. For example, the antenna strength indicator may be an icon displayed on a display of user interface <b>64</b>. If mobile station <b>18</b> is out of range, then mobile station <b>18</b> may instead originate the call through the wireless network automatically, or mobile station <b>18</b> may provide the user with one or more alternative options.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Whether mobile station <b>18</b> is able to wirelessly bridge to CBU <b>22</b> may also depend on whether CBU <b>22</b> is busy, as indicated by step <b>114</b>. CBU <b>22</b> may be busy because the telephone line to SSP <b>20</b> is being used by either cordless handset <b>26</b> or wireline telephone <b>24</b>. However, if CBU <b>22</b> has access to more than one telephone line to SSP <b>20</b>, then CBU <b>22</b> may be able to complete the wireless bridge with mobile station <b>18</b>, even though cordless handset <b>26</b> or wireline telephone <b>24</b> is engaged in a call.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">If CBU <b>22</b> is busy, then mobile station <b>18</b> may instead route the call through the wireless network, as indicated by step <b>116</b>. Mobile station <b>18</b> may do this automatically, or mobile station <b>18</b> may provide the user with one or more alternative options. In addition, if CBU <b>22</b> is busy, mobile station <b>18</b> may, but need not, provide a “busy” indication to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">If CBU <b>22</b> is not busy, then mobile station <b>18</b> may successfully complete the wireless bridge with CBU <b>22</b> and may originate the call through the landline network (exemplified by SSP <b>20</b>) via CBU <b>22</b>, as indicated by step <b>118</b>. At that point, mobile station <b>18</b> may act like any other cordless extension in communication with CBU <b>22</b>. Thus, other extensions connected to the telephone line to SSP <b>20</b>, such as cordless handset <b>26</b> and wireline telephone <b>24</b>, may join in on the call.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, while mobile station <b>18</b> uses one line for the call via the landline network, as described above, mobile station <b>18</b> may also be able to use a second line to originate or receive a call via the wireless network. Moreover, the mobile station user may be able to join the two calls together within mobile station <b>18</b>, by entering a predetermined instruction, such as “*88” or some other keypad sequence. In this way, mobile station <b>18</b> may be able to engage in three-way calling without using additional resources of the wireless network, e.g., an additional wireless channel.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an exemplary embodiment, mobile station <b>18</b> is able to wirelessly bridge with a landline station, such as cordless handset <b>26</b>, in order to include the landline station in a call carried by the wireless telecommunications network, as summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The process may begin with mobile station <b>18</b> engaged in a call via the wireless network (exemplified by BTS <b>14</b> and MSC <b>12</b>), as indicated by step <b>200</b>. Mobile station <b>18</b> may have either originated or received the call. Mobile station <b>18</b> may use antenna <b>52</b> for communicating with BTS <b>14</b> for this call.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">To include a landline station, such as cordless handset <b>26</b>, in the call, the mobile station user may enter a predetermined instruction, such as by using a keypad of user interface <b>64</b> to enter “*77” or other keypad sequence, as indicated as step <b>202</b>. In response, mobile station <b>18</b> wirelessly transmits a bridging signal, as indicated by step <b>204</b>. Mobile station <b>18</b> may use a different antenna for transmitting the bridging signal than for communicating with BTS <b>14</b>. Thus, if mobile station <b>18</b> uses antenna <b>52</b> to communicate with BTS <b>14</b>, mobile station <b>18</b> may use antenna <b>56</b> to transmit the bridging signal.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Whether mobile station <b>18</b> is able to complete the wirelessly bridge, may depend on whether mobile station <b>18</b> is within the “home zone,” as indicated by step <b>206</b>. If mobile station <b>18</b> is not within the “home zone,” then mobile station <b>18</b> may be unable to complete the wireless bridge, as indicated by step <b>208</b>. As noted above, mobile station <b>18</b> may include an antenna strength indicator to indicate the proximity to CBU <b>22</b>, i.e., whether mobile station <b>18</b> is within the “home zone” provided by CBU <b>22</b>. However, mobile station <b>18</b> may provide alternative indications to the user that mobile station <b>18</b> is out of range. Whether mobile station <b>18</b> is able to complete the wireless bridge may also depend on whether CBU <b>22</b> is busy, as indicated by step <b>210</b>. If CBU <b>22</b> is busy, then mobile station <b>18</b> may be unable to complete the wireless bridge, as indicated by step <b>212</b>. If CBU <b>22</b> is busy, then mobile station <b>18</b> may, but need not, provide a “busy” indication to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If mobile station <b>18</b> is within the “home zone” and CBU <b>22</b> is not busy, then mobile station <b>18</b> may be able to complete the wireless bridge. In response to the bridging signal from mobile station <b>18</b>, CBU <b>22</b> alerts the landline station, as indicated by step <b>214</b>. The alert may involve “ringing” cordless handset <b>26</b> and/or CBU <b>22</b>, particularly if CBU <b>22</b> can itself function as a landline station. More generally, the alert may involve a visible indication, such as a flashing light or displaying text or graphics, a tactile indication, such as a vibration, an audible indication, such as ringing, beeping, or buzzing, or some other type of user-discernible indication from cordless handset <b>26</b> and/or CBU <b>22</b>. Moreover, this alert occurs independently of the landline communications network (exemplified by SSP <b>20</b>). In particular, the alert is generated or initiated by CBU <b>22</b>, rather than by SSP <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A landline station user may then answer the alert, as indicated by step <b>216</b>, such as by causing CBU <b>22</b> and/or cordless handset <b>26</b> to go off-hook. At that point, a wireless communication link is established between mobile station <b>18</b> and the landline station, e.g., cordless handset <b>26</b>. Moreover, this wireless communication link is established independently of the landline network (exemplified by SSP <b>20</b>). In particular, CBU <b>22</b> communicatively couples mobile station <b>18</b> with the landline station without involving the landline network.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With the wireless communication link to the landline station established, the mobile station user may carry on the conversations on the two lines independently, e.g., by alternating between the two lines. However, the mobile station user may also be able to conference the two lines together, such as by entering “*88” on a keypad of user interface <b>64</b>, as indicated by step <b>218</b>. In response to the “*88” or other keypad instruction, mobile station <b>18</b> conferences the two lines together, e.g., by using MUX <b>60</b>. In this way, the landline station is joined to the call being carried by the wireless network, as indicated by step <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Although in the process summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> mobile station <b>18</b> is engaged in a wireless network call before transmitting the wireless bridging signal, the wireless network call could occur afterward. Thus, mobile station <b>18</b> may first establish the wireless communication link with the landline station and then either originate or receive a call via the wireless telecommunications network.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Beneficially, this process of establishing the wireless communication link between mobile station <b>18</b> and the landline station occurs independently of the landline network.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an exemplary embodiment, a landline station, such as CBU <b>22</b> and/or cordless handset <b>26</b>, is able to wirelessly bridge with mobile station <b>18</b>, in order to include mobile station <b>18</b> in a call carried by the landline telecommunications network, as summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The process may begin with the landline station engaged in a call via the landline network (exemplified by SSP <b>20</b>), as indicated by step <b>300</b>. To include mobile station <b>18</b> in the call, the landline station user may enter a predetermined instruction, such as by using user interface <b>42</b>, as indicated by step <b>302</b>. For example, the user may press a “mobile alert” button of user interface <b>42</b>, or the user may use a keypad of user interface <b>42</b> to enter a keypad sequence, such as *77 or *78. In this regard, the user may enter different instructions to contact different types of mobile stations or to contact a selected one of a plurality of mobile stations within the “home zone.” For example, the user may enter *77 to contact a mobile station from one manufacturer and may enter *78 to contact a mobile station from another manufacturer. The user may also be able to enter the predetermined instruction remotely, such as by using keypad <b>44</b> or other user interface of cordless handset <b>26</b>. In response to the user's instructions, CBU <b>22</b> wirelessly transmits a bridging signal, as indicated by step <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Whether CBU <b>22</b> is able to complete the wireless bridge to mobile station <b>18</b> may depend on whether mobile station <b>18</b> is within the “home zone,” as indicated by step <b>306</b>.

CBU <b>22</b> and/or cordless handset <b>26</b> may, but need not, provide an “out of range” indication to the landline station user. Whether CBU <b>22</b> can wirelessly bridge to mobile station <b>18</b> may also depend on whether mobile station <b>18</b> is busy, as indicated by step <b>310</b>. In this regard, if mobile station <b>18</b> is a two-line mobile station, then mobile station <b>18</b> may not be busy even if already engaged in a call, e.g., a call carried by the wireless telecommunications network. If mobile station <b>18</b> is busy, then CBU <b>22</b> may be unable to complete the wireless bridge, as indicated by step <b>312</b>. CBU <b>22</b> and/or cordless handset <b>26</b> may, but need not, provide a “busy” indicate to the landline station user.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In response to the bridging signal, mobile station <b>18</b> may provide a user-discernible indication that mobile station <b>18</b> is being alerted, as indicated by step <b>314</b>. The user-discernible indication may involve a visible indication, such as a flashing light or displaying text or graphics, a tactile indication, such as a vibration, an audible indication, such as ringing, beeping, or buzzing, or some other type of user-discernible indication. The mobile station user may then answer, as indicated by step <b>316</b>. At that point, a wireless communication link is established between mobile station <b>18</b> and the landline station, and mobile station <b>18</b> may act like a cordless extension of CBU <b>22</b>.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Moreover, if mobile station <b>18</b> is already engaged in a call on another line, e.g., a call carried by the wireless network, then the mobile station user may be able to conference the two calls together within mobile station <b>18</b>.
