<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Refrigeration systems incorporating a vapor-compression cycle may be utilized to condition the environment of open or closed compartments or spaces. The vapor-compression cycle utilizes a compressor to compress a phase-changing working fluid (e.g., a refrigerant), which is then condensed, expanded and evaporated. Compressing the working fluid generates heat, which, in cooling applications, is waste heat that is discharged to ambient from the compressor and condenser. Because the waste heat is not used or recovered, the lost energy of the waste heat represents an inefficiency of most refrigeration systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In heating applications, such as in a heat pump system, heat stored in the compressed working fluid is extracted through the condenser to heat a space or compartment. Because efficiency of the heat pump system decreases with ambient temperature, heating may be supplemented at low ambient temperatures by a radiant electrical heat source. Radiant electrical heat sources, however, are typically inefficient and, thus, lower the overall efficiency of the heating application.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some cooling applications, an air flow may be chilled to a very low temperature to reduce the humidity. The low temperature required to remove humidity, however, may be too low for the conditioned space or compartment within a space or compartment to be. In these cases, the dehumidified chilled air may be reheated by electric radiant heat or hot-gas bypass heat to an appropriate temperature while maintaining the low humidity level. Use of radiant electrical heat and a hot gas bypass heat to reheat over-chilled air represents inefficiencies in this type of cooling application.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A vapor-compression cycle or circuit may be used to meet the temperature or load demands for conditioning one or more spaces or compartments. Waste heat generated by components of the vapor-compression circuit may be used to generate an electric current that may power other components of the vapor-compression circuit. A thermoelectric device may be placed in heat-transferring relation with the generated waste heat and produce the electrical current, which may be used to generate an electric current to power another device or another thermoelectric device. The other devices may include sensors, switches, controllers, fans, valves, actuators, pumps, compressors, etc. The other thermoelectric device may provide cooling or heating of a fluid in heat-transferring relation therewith to supplement the vapor-compression circuit and facilitate the conditioning of the space or compartment. The utilization of the generated waste heat as an energy source for powering other components or loads may improve the efficiency of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present teachings disclose a method of operating a refrigeration system including transferring heat generated in the system through a thermoelectric device, generating an electric current with the heat flowing through the thermoelectric device, and powering a load with the generated electric current. The load may be another device or another thermoelectric device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A refrigeration system may be operated by supplying power to a thermoelectric device in a heat-transferring relation with a working fluid flowing through a vapor-compression circuit downstream of a condenser. A first heat flow may be generated with the thermoelectric device. The first heat flow may be transferred to a first fluid medium. A second heat flow may be transferred from the first fluid medium to a second fluid medium.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the teachings, their application, or uses. In describing the various teachings herein, reference indicia are used. Like reference indicia are used for like elements. For example, if an element is identified as <b>10</b> in one of the teachings, a like element in subsequent teachings may be identified as <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, etc., or as <b>10</b>′, <b>10</b>″, <b>10</b>′″, etc. As used herein, the term “heat-transferring relation” refers to a relationship that allows heat to be transferred from one medium to another medium and includes convection, conduction and radiant heat transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thermoelectric elements or devices are solid-state devices that convert electrical energy into a temperature gradient, known as the “Peltier effect,” or convert thermal energy from a temperature gradient into electrical energy, known as the “Seebeck effect.” With no moving parts, thermoelectric devices are rugged, reliable and quiet.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In use, power is applied from a battery or other DC source to the thermoelectric device, which will have a relatively lower temperature on one side, a relatively higher temperature on the other side, and a temperature gradient therebetween. The lower and higher relative temperature sides are referred herein as a “cold side” and “hot side,” respectively. Further, the terms “cold side” and “hot side” may refer to specific sides, surfaces or areas of the thermoelectric devices.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one application, the hot and cold sides of the thermoelectric device may be placed in heat-transferring relation with two mediums. When power is applied to the thermoelectric device, the resulting temperature gradient will promote heat flow between the two mediums through the thermoelectric device. In another application, one side of the thermoelectric device may be placed in heat-transferring relation with a relatively higher temperature medium providing a heat source and the other side placed in heat-transferring relation with a relatively lower temperature medium providing a heat sink, whereby the resulting hot and cold sides generate electric current. As used herein, the term “heat transfer medium” may be a solid, a liquid or a gas through which heat may be transferred to from. Thermoelectric devices can be acquired from various suppliers. For example, Kryotherm USA of Carson City, Nev. is a source for thermoelectric devices.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">One or more thermoelectric devices may generate electric current from waste heat generated in a vapor-compression circuit using the “Seebeck effect.” The electric current generated may be used to power other electrical devices or other thermoelectric devices, which may generate a temperature gradient using the “Peltier effect” to transfer heat therethrough. A power supply may be used to supply a current flow to a thermoelectric device to provide a desired temperature gradient thereacross through the “Peltier effect” and transfer heat therethrough to a desired medium.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>a </i>uses waste or excess heat Q<sub>waste </sub>to generate an electric current I that is used to form a temperature gradient across a second thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>b </i>to produce recovered heat Q<sub>recovered</sub>. Hot side <b>22</b><i>a </i>of thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>a </i>is in heat-transferring relation to a source of waste heat Q<sub>waste</sub>. Cold side <b>24</b><i>a </i>of thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>a </i>is in heat-transferring relation to a heat sink that Q<sub>waste </sub>can be expelled thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The temperature gradient formed across first thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>a </i>generates an electric current I that is supplied to a second thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>b</i>. The electric current flowing therethrough generates a temperature gradient across second thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>b </i>resulting in a hot side <b>22</b><i>b </i>and a cold side <b>24</b><i>b</i>. The temperature gradient causes a recovered heat Q<sub>recovered </sub>to flow through thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>b</i>. Hot side <b>22</b><i>b </i>of second thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>b </i>is in heat-transferring relation with a medium into which recovered heat Q<sub>recovered </sub>is conducted, while cold side <b>24</b><i>b </i>of second thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>b </i>is in heat-transferring relation to a heat source. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a first thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>a </i>is exposed to waste heat Q<sub>waste </sub>to cause a second thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>b </i>to generate recovered heat Q<sub>recovered</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The electric current generated by a thermoelectric device <b>20</b> may also be used to activate or drive an electrical device or meet an electrical load (hereinafter referred to as load <b>26</b> and/or “L”) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Again, waste heat Q<sub>waste </sub>is utilized to generate a temperature differential between hot and cold sides <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and generate electric current I. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, thermoelectric device <b>20</b> is placed in heat-transferring relation to a source of waste heat Q<sub>waste </sub>and a heat sink to generate electric current I that is used to power load <b>26</b>. Load <b>26</b> is utilized generically herein to refer to any type of device requiring an electric current. Such devices, by way of non-limiting example, include compressors, pumps, fans, valves, solenoids, actuators, sensors, controllers and other components of a refrigeration system. The sensors may include, such as by way of non-limiting example, pressure sensors, temperature sensors, flow sensors, accelerometers, RPM sensors, position sensors, resistance sensors, and the like and may be represented by “S” in the drawings. The various valves, solenoids and actuators may be represented by “V” in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a power supply <b>28</b> is connected to a thermoelectric device <b>20</b> to generate a desired heat Q<sub>desired</sub>. Power supply <b>28</b> may supply a current flow I to thermoelectric device <b>20</b> to cause a temperature gradient to be formed between hot and cold sides <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The temperature gradient generates a desired heat Q<sub>desired</sub>. Hot side <b>22</b> may be placed in heat-transferring relation with a medium into which heat Q<sub>desired </sub>is conducted. Power supply <b>28</b> may modulate current flow I to maintain a desired temperature gradient and produce a desired heat Q<sub>desired</sub>. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a power supply <b>28</b> provides an electric current I within thermoelectric device <b>20</b>, which generates a source of desired heat Q<sub>desired</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Thermal enhancing devices or thermal conductors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> may be placed in heat-transferring relation with sides <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of one or more thermoelectric devices <b>20</b> to enhance or facilitate heat transfer through the thermoelectric device <b>20</b> and a medium, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A thermoelectric device <b>20</b> having one or more thermal conductors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> is referred to herein as a thermoelectric module (TEM) <b>33</b>, which may include multiple thermoelectric devices <b>20</b>. Thermal conductors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> may be referred to herein as hot and cold thermal conductors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, respectively. It should be appreciated, that the terms “hot” and “cold” are relative terms and serve to indicate that that particular thermal conductor is in heat-transferring relation with the respective hot or cold side of a thermoelectric device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Heat transfer may be enhanced by increasing the heat-conductive surface area that is in contact with the medium into which the heat is to be conducted. For example, micro-channel tubing may accomplish the enhancing of the heat flow. The fluid medium flows through the micro channels therein and the hot or cold side of the thermoelectric device is placed in heat-transferring contact with the exterior surface of the tubing. When the medium is a gas, such as air, the thermal conductor may be in the form of fins which may accomplish the enhancement of the heat transfer to/from the medium.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">To enhance heat transfer, the thermal conductor may be shaped to match a contour of a heat source. For example, when it is desired to place a thermoelectric device in heat-transferring relation with a curved surface, the thermal conductor may have one surface curved so that it is complementary to the surface of the solid through which the heat is to be conducted while the other side of the thermal conductor is complementary to the hot or cold side of the thermoelectric device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Enhanced heat transfer may be accomplished through heat-conducting materials, layers or coatings on the thermoelectric device <b>20</b>. Thermal conductors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> may include materials, layers or coatings having a high thermal conductivity whereby heat transfer through the thermoelectric device <b>20</b> is conducted efficiently. By way of non-limiting example, materials having a high thermal conductivity include aluminum, copper and steel. Moreover, heat-conducting adhesives may also be used as thermal conductors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. Regardless of the form, the thermal conductors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> have a high thermal conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a vapor-compression cycle or circuit, a compressor <b>34</b> compresses a relatively cool working fluid (e.g., refrigerant) in gaseous form to a relatively high temperature, high-pressure gas. The compressing process generates waste heat Q<sub>waste </sub>that is conducted through the compressor to ambient. Waste heat Q<sub>waste </sub>may be utilized by a thermoelectric device <b>20</b> to power another thermoelectric device <b>20</b>, and/or a load <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a schematic view of portions of an exemplary compressor, in this case an orbital scroll compressor <b>34</b> by way of a non-limiting example, generally includes a cylindrical hermetic shell <b>37</b> having welded at the upper end thereof a cap <b>38</b> and at the lower end thereof a base <b>58</b>. A refrigerant discharge passage <b>39</b>, which may have a discharge valve (not shown) therein, is attached to cap <b>38</b>. Other major elements affixed to shell <b>37</b> include a transversely extending partition <b>40</b> that is welded about its periphery at the same point that cap <b>38</b> is welded to shell <b>37</b>, upper and lower bearing assemblies (not shown) and a motor stator <b>41</b> press-fitted therein. A driveshaft or crankshaft <b>42</b> is rotatably journalled in the upper and lower bearing assemblies. The lower portion of shell <b>37</b> forms a sump <b>43</b> that is filled with lubricating oil which gets internally distributed throughout compressor <b>34</b> during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Crankshaft <b>42</b> is rotatably driven by an electric motor including stator <b>41</b>, with windings passing therethrough, and a rotor <b>44</b> press-fitted on crankshaft <b>42</b>. Upper and lower surfaces of rotor <b>44</b> have respective upper and lower counterweights <b>45</b>, <b>46</b> thereon. An Oldham coupling (not shown) couples crankshaft <b>42</b> to an orbiting scroll member <b>47</b> having a spiral vane or wrap <b>48</b> on the upper surface thereof. A nonorbiting scroll member <b>49</b> is also provided having a wrap <b>50</b> positioned in meshing engagement with wrap <b>48</b> of orbiting scroll member <b>47</b>. Nonorbiting scroll member <b>49</b> has a center-disposed discharge passage <b>51</b> that is in fluid communication with a discharge muffler chamber <b>52</b> defined by cap <b>38</b> and partition <b>40</b>. An inlet port <b>53</b> on shell <b>37</b> allows refrigerant to flow into a suction side or inlet chamber <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Compressor <b>34</b> also includes numerous sensors, diagnostic modules, printed circuit board assemblies, solenoids, such as internal and external capacity modulation solenoids, switches, such as a switch to change resistance of motor <b>36</b> to provide a first resistant for start-up and a second resistance for continuous operation, and other electrically-actuated devices or loads <b>26</b>. These electrical devices may be internal or external to the compressor and may be stationary or rotating with the rotating components of the compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">During operation, motor <b>36</b> causes rotor <b>44</b> to rotate relative to stator <b>41</b>, which causes crankshaft <b>42</b> to rotate. Rotation of crankshaft <b>42</b> causes orbiting scroll member <b>47</b> to orbit relative to nonorbiting scroll member <b>49</b>. Working fluid within suction chamber <b>54</b> is pulled into the space between wraps <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> and progresses toward the central portion due to the relative movement therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Pressurized working fluid is discharged from scroll members <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> through discharge passage <b>51</b> and flows into discharge chamber <b>52</b>. The working fluid within discharge chamber <b>52</b> is at a relatively high temperature and pressure. Compressed high-temperature, high-pressure working fluid flows from discharge chamber <b>52</b> through discharge passage <b>39</b> and onto the other components of the vapor-compression circuit within which compressor <b>34</b> is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">During operation, waste heat Q<sub>waste </sub>is generated throughout compressor <b>34</b>. This waste heat Q<sub>waste </sub>may be conducted to a thermoelectric device <b>20</b>. Waste heat Q<sub>waste </sub>may be generated by rotor <b>44</b>, which gets hot when rotated and is cooled by the internally distributed lubricant and the working fluid (suction gas) within suction chamber <b>54</b>. The heat flow from rotor <b>44</b> to the lubricant and/or suction side working fluid represents a source of waste heat Q<sub>waste </sub>that may be conducted to a thermoelectric device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a TEM <b>33</b><i>a</i>, which may be attached to rotor <b>44</b>, includes a thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>a </i>with hot side <b>22</b><i>a</i>. Hot side <b>22</b><i>a </i>is in heat-transferring relation to rotor <b>44</b> while cold side <b>24</b><i>a </i>is in heat-transferring relation with the lubricant and working fluid within suction chamber <b>54</b>. The temperature differential between the hot and cold sides <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>a </i>causes a heat Q<sub>a </sub>to flow through TEM <b>33</b><i>a</i>, which generates an electric current that is supplied to a load <b>26</b><i>a</i>. Attached to moving rotor <b>44</b>, TEM <b>33</b><i>a </i>powers load <b>26</b><i>a </i>that is also rotating with rotor <b>44</b> or shaft <b>42</b>. For example, load <b>26</b><i>a </i>may include a resistance switch that changes the resistance of the rotor so that a higher resistance is realized for a startup and a lower resistance is realized during nominal operation, a temperature sensor, an RPM sensor, and the like. While TEM <b>33</b><i>a </i>is shown as being attached to the upper portion of rotor <b>44</b>, it should be appreciated that TEM <b>33</b><i>a </i>can be attached to other portions of rotor <b>44</b>, such as a middle, lower or internal portion, made integral with upper or lower counterweight <b>45</b>, <b>46</b>, or in direct contact with lubricant within sump <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Partition <b>40</b>, which separates the relatively hot discharge gas within discharge chamber <b>52</b> from the relatively cooler suction gas within suction chamber <b>54</b>, conducts waste heat Q<sub>waste</sub>, which may be used to generate electrical power within a thermoelectric device <b>20</b>. By attaching a TEM <b>33</b><i>b </i>to partition <b>40</b> with hot thermal conductor <b>30</b><i>b </i>in heat-transferring relation with partition <b>40</b> and cold thermal conductor <b>32</b><i>b </i>in heat-transferring relation with the suction gas within suction chamber <b>54</b>, waste heat Q<sub>b </sub>may be transferred from partition <b>40</b> through TEM <b>33</b><i>b </i>and into the suction gas within suction chamber <b>54</b>. Waste heat Q<sub>b </sub>generates an electric current in thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>b </i>of TEM <b>33</b><i>b</i>. TEM <b>33</b><i>b </i>may be connected to an internal electric load <b>26</b><i>b</i>, or an external electric load <b>26</b><i>b</i><sub>2</sub>. TEM <b>33</b><i>b </i>may be attached in a fixed manner to a stationary component, such as partition <b>40</b>, which facilitates the attachment to stationary loads either internal or external to compressor <b>34</b>. By positioning thermoelectric device <b>20</b> in heat-transferring relation with a stationary component conducting waste heat Q<sub>waste</sub>, an electric current to power a load <b>26</b> either internal or external to compressor <b>34</b> may be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Waste heat Q<sub>waste </sub>from the relatively hot discharge gas within discharge chamber <b>52</b> is conducted through cap <b>38</b> to the ambient environment within which compressor <b>34</b> is located. A TEM <b>33</b><i>c </i>may be attached to cap <b>38</b> with a hot thermal conductor <b>30</b><i>c </i>in heat-transferring relation with the exterior surface of cap <b>38</b> and the cold thermal conductor <b>32</b><i>c </i>in heat-transferring relation with the ambient environment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, cold thermal conductor <b>32</b><i>c </i>includes fins over which the ambient air flows and hot thermal conductor <b>30</b><i>c </i>includes a contoured surface matched to the exterior contour of cap <b>38</b>. Hot thermal conductor <b>30</b><i>c </i>has a greater surface area in contact with cap <b>38</b> than in contact with hot side <b>22</b><i>c </i>of thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>c</i>. The temperature differential between the ambient air and cap <b>38</b> causes waste heat Q<sub>c </sub>to flow through TEM <b>33</b><i>c </i>and generate an electric current that powers load <b>26</b><i>c</i>, which may be external (<b>26</b><i>c</i><sub>1</sub>) or internal (<b>26</b><i>c</i><sub>2</sub>) to compressor <b>34</b>. Thermoelectric device <b>20</b> may be placed in heat-transferring relation to the relatively hot discharge gas in discharge chamber <b>52</b> (via cap <b>38</b>) and the relatively cold ambient environment to provide a temperature gradient that may be used to generate electric current to power a load.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Because of the temperature differential between discharge gas within discharge passage <b>39</b> and the ambient environment, a TEM <b>33</b><i>d </i>attached to discharge passage <b>39</b> with the hot thermal conductor <b>30</b><i>d </i>in heat-transferring relation to discharge passage <b>39</b> and the cold thermal conductor <b>32</b><i>d </i>in heat-transferring relation to the ambient environment causes heat Q<sub>d </sub>to flow through TEM <b>33</b><i>d</i>. The thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>d </i>of TEM <b>33</b><i>d </i>generates electric current that may be used to power load <b>26</b><i>d</i>. Thus, a thermoelectric device <b>20</b> may be disposed in heat-transferring relation to the relatively hot gas within the discharge passage and the ambient environment to generate an electric current that can be used to power a load.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">During the compressing of the refrigerant between wraps <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> of orbiting and non-orbiting scroll members <b>47</b>, <b>49</b>, the temperature and pressure of the working fluid increases as it approach central discharge passage <b>51</b>. As a result, the temperature differential between the relatively cool suction gas on one side of orbiting scroll member <b>47</b> and the relatively hot discharge gas near discharge passage <b>51</b> generates waste heat Q<sub>e</sub>. A TEM <b>33</b><i>e </i>may be attached to orbiting-scroll member <b>47</b> adjacent or opposite to discharge passage <b>51</b>. Specifically, hot thermal conductor <b>30</b><i>e </i>of TEM <b>33</b><i>e </i>is placed in heat-transferring relation to a bottom surface of orbiting scroll member <b>47</b> generally opposite discharge passage <b>51</b>. Cold thermal conductor <b>32</b><i>e </i>of TEM <b>33</b><i>e </i>is disposed in heat-transferring relation to the suction gas and lubricant flowing within suction chamber <b>54</b>. As waste heat Q<sub>e </sub>flows through TEM <b>33</b><i>e</i>, the thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>e </i>of TEM <b>33</b><i>e </i>generates electric current that may be used to power load <b>26</b><i>e</i>. Thus, a thermoelectric device <b>20</b> may be disposed in heat-transferring relation to the discharge gas and suction gas adjacent the orbiting scroll member to generate electric current that can be used to power a load.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">During operation, stator <b>41</b> generates waste heat Q<sub>f </sub>that is transferred to the internally distributed lubricant and/or suction gas in the suction chamber <b>54</b>. A TEM <b>33</b><i>f </i>may be attached to stator <b>41</b> with the hot thermal conductor <b>30</b><i>f </i>in heat-transferring relation to stator <b>41</b> and cold thermal conductor <b>32</b><i>f </i>is in heat-transferring relation to the lubricant and/or suction gas in suction chamber <b>54</b>. The temperature differential between stator <b>41</b> and the lubricant and/or suction gas within suction chamber <b>54</b> causes waste heat Q<sub>f </sub>to flow through TEM <b>33</b><i>f</i>, wherein thermoelectric device <b>20</b><i>f </i>generates electric current that may be used to power load <b>26</b><i>f</i>. While TEM <b>33</b><i>f </i>is shown as being attached to the upper portion of stator <b>41</b>, it should be appreciated that TEM <b>33</b><i>f </i>can be attached to other portions of stator <b>41</b>, such as a middle, lower or internal portion, or in direct contact with lubricant within sump <b>43</b>. Thus, a thermoelectric device may be disposed in heat-transferring relation to the stator and the lubricant or suction gas to generate electric current that can be used to power a load.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The lubricant within sump <b>43</b> of compressor <b>34</b> is relatively hot (relative to the ambient environment) and heat waste Q<sub>g </sub>is conducted from the lubricant through shell <b>37</b> to the ambient environment. A TEM <b>33</b><i>g </i>may be positioned with cold thermal conductor <b>32</b><i>g </i>in heat-transferring relation to the ambient environment and hot thermal conductor <b>30</b><i>g </i>in heat-transferring relation to the lubricant within sump <b>43</b>. This may be accomplished by integrating TEM <b>33</b><i>g </i>within the wall of shell <b>37</b>.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a partial schematic view of a top portion of another exemplary compressor, in this case an orbital scroll compressor <b>34</b>′ having a direct discharge by way of non-limiting example is shown. Compressor <b>34</b>′ is similar to compressor <b>34</b> discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In compressor <b>34</b>′, however, discharge passage <b>39</b>′ communicates directly with discharge passage <b>51</b>′ of non-orbiting scroll member <b>49</b>′ such that the compressed working fluid (discharge gas) flows directly into discharge passage <b>39</b>′ from discharge passage <b>51</b>′. A muffler <b>56</b>′ is attached to discharge passage <b>39</b>′. The relatively hot compressed working fluid flows through muffler <b>56</b>′. Waste heat Q<sub>waste </sub>from the relatively hot discharge gas within muffler <b>56</b>′ is conducted through the walls of muffler <b>56</b>′ to the ambient environment within which compressor <b>34</b>′ is located. A TEM <b>33</b>′ may be attached to muffler <b>56</b>′ with hot thermal conductor <b>30</b>′ in heat-transferring relation with the exterior surface of muffler <b>56</b>′ and cold thermal conductor <b>32</b>′ in heat-transferring relation with the ambient environment. Cold thermal conductor <b>32</b>′ may include fins over which the ambient air flows and hot thermal conductor <b>30</b>′ may include a contoured surface matched to the exterior contour of muffler <b>56</b>′ to facilitate heat transfer. The temperature differential between the ambient air and muffler <b>56</b>′ causes waste heat Q to flow through TEM <b>33</b>′ and generate an electric current that powers load <b>26</b>′. Thus, thermoelectric device <b>20</b>′ may be placed in heat-transferring relation to the relatively hot discharge gas in muffler <b>56</b>′ (via the exterior surface of muffler <b>56</b>′) and the relatively cold ambient environment to provide a temperature gradient that may be used to generate electric current to power a load.</p>

The temperature differential between the discharge gas and ambient causes waste heat Q to flow from the discharge gas to the ambient environment through manifold <b>61</b>. Positioning a TEM <b>33</b> adjacent discharge manifold <b>61</b> with a hot thermal conductor <b>30</b> in heat-transferring relation to discharge manifold <b>61</b> and cold thermal conductor <b>32</b> in heat-transferring relation to the ambient air about discharge manifold <b>61</b> may generate electric current from waste heat Q flowing through thermoelectric device <b>20</b> within TEM <b>33</b>. The electric current may be used to power load <b>26</b>. Thus, in a multi-compressor system having a common discharge manifold, a thermoelectric device may be positioned between the relatively hot discharge gas in the manifold and the ambient environment to generate an electric current from the waste heat Q to power a load <b>26</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Refrigeration system <b>64</b> includes various loads <b>26</b> that require electricity to operate.

The various power requirements of refrigeration system <b>64</b> may be met by a power distribution member <b>75</b> which supplies current to power the various loads <b>26</b> of refrigeration system <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The power demands of the various loads <b>26</b> may be provided by a power supply <b>76</b>, which may provide both AC current and DC current, through power-distribution block <b>75</b>. The electric current may be supplied by individual connections directly to power supply <b>76</b>, through one or more power distribution devices, and/or through controller <b>74</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As the electric current production by one or more TEM <b>33</b> increases, the use of power supply <b>76</b> may be reduced.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An energy-storage device <b>78</b> may provide temporary startup power to one or more components of refrigeration system <b>64</b>. Energy-storage devices, such as rechargeable batteries, ultra capacitors, and the like, may store a sufficient quantity of power to meet the requirements, particularly at system startup, of some or all of the components of refrigeration system <b>64</b> up until the time TEM <b>33</b> is able to produce sufficient current to power those components.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a refrigeration system <b>164</b> includes a vapor-compression circuit <b>169</b> and TEM <b>133</b>.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Working fluid may exit compressor <b>165</b> at, by way of non-limiting example, 182° F. and arrive at TEM <b>133</b> at about 170° F. If the ambient environment is at say 95° F., a 75° F. temperature differential across TEM <b>133</b> produces waste heat Q<sub>102 </sub>to flow from the working fluid to the ambient through TEM <b>133</b>, which reduces the temperature of the working fluid prior to flowing into condenser <b>166</b>. Because the heat Q<sub>103 </sub>required to be extracted by condenser <b>166</b> to meet the needs of evaporator <b>168</b> is reduced, compressor <b>165</b> may operate more efficiently or at a lower capacity or at a lower temperature, such as by way of non-limiting example 115° F. Thermoelectric device <b>20</b> may power load <b>126</b> while de-superheating non-condensed working fluid thereby meeting part of all of the power demand and increasing the efficiency of the system. De-superheating the working fluid enables condenser <b>166</b> to operate more efficiently or be sized smaller than what would be required if no de-superheating were to occur, further helping thermoelectric device meet system power requirements.</p>
