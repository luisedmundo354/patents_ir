<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An engagement system having a spring lock design to initially attach the two halves of the system together. After which the use of a multi start Acme lead screw provides a, consistent, low torque means of engagement. Although the engager requires the use of lubrication, to be applied initially, the lube is contained in a sealed environment. This eliminates the risk of contamination to electrical components and eliminates the need to apply additional lube during the products life. Because the present invention allows the ACME threads to be “meshed” at all times, it also eliminates the possibly of cross-threading.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to an apparatus for securing and locking interfaces of two items releasably together and more particularly to an apparatus for securing and locking together an array of electrical connectors in a common frame.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Brief Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A variety of mass interconnect devices have been used in the past. One example of prior art interface systems was disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,329,005, entitled “Slide Cam Mechanism for Positioning Test Adapter in Operative Relationship with a Receiver,” which was assigned to Virginia Panel Corporation. In the '005 Patent, the receiver included an inner frame and outer walls. Between the outer walls and adjacent sides of the receiver frame were placed fixed hanger plates provided with straight slots and interior slides having coacting cam slots. The slides were driven by a hand lever and attached round torsion shaft with connected linkage having an over-dead-center locked position. Movement of the hand lever would cause the slides to move parallel to the outer walls and interior sides. Modules for holding various electrical contacts were mounted in the receiver parallel to the direction of movement of the slides.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The individual test adapter, or ITA, had four split roller dual bearings or rollers on common dry lube sleeves that would rotate oppositely during the camming action to minimize friction. The individual test adapter rollers rested on dwell shoulders of the cam slots and then descended through the straight slots during movement of the slides of the receiver to produce positive straight-on engagement of the test adapter and receiver multiple contacts. The slides had elongated linear guide bearings with dry lube pads for precision free movement. The slides were connected to a cylindrical torsion shaft via linkage. Like the receiver modules, the ITA modules were mounted in the system in a direction parallel to the ITA sides on which the rollers were located. When modules, pins, patchcords, and perhaps a cover are mounted to or on the interface test adapter, the assembly is sometimes referred to as a “fixture.”</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another prior art system has been known as the MAC Panel Series 06, or rotating latch, interface device. In the rotating latch type device, the camming is performed by plates that rotate rather than moving in a linear fashion. In the rotating latch devices, the connector modules have been mounted to the receiver and test adapter frame parallel to the plant of rotation of the rotating latches.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another prior art system sold by Virginia Panel Corporation included a receiver that included slides similar to those disclosed in the '005 patent but used pins at two corners, diagonal from one other, on the receiver. These pins inhibited vertical movement of the ITA in the receiver to produce straight-on engagement. This prior art system included machined side rails and a cylindrical torsion shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another prior interface device is known as the TTI Testron VG Series interface device. This device may be in a tabletop or a rack-mounted form. This VG Series device included a fixture support plate mounted to the receiver in a direction perpendicular to the face of the receiver. The receiver would be mounted directly to the test equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The TTI Testron fixture, or test adapter, would be engaged to the receiver by lifting the fixture onto a pair of hooks protruding from the face of the receiver and then resting the fixture on the support plate. A handle and gears were used to pull the hooks, and hence, the fixture, into the receiver to cause the electrical contacts in the receiver and the fixture to mate.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Yet another prior art test system was used prior to 1980 in connection with the federal government's F-16 program. That system had a slide plate on each side of the receiver, with each slide plate connecting to the engagement pins on the sides of a corresponding ITA frame and each slide plate being pulled into the receiver via a connection near the center of the slide plate. This system suffered from significant problems of the ITA tilting to some degree and thereby causing contacts to be crushed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Still other prior art engagement systems include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,966,023. In still other prior art engagement systems, others have incorporated the use of a screw together engager that utilizes a range of thread styles including standard, Acme and high pitch helical grooves. The amount of rotation to engage these ranges from 180° to several full turns. One example of such a screw type engager is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,562,458 entitled “Interface Engagement and Locking System.”</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The systems that utilize standard threads or single start Acme threads typically require several turns to fully engage. Although they do not need lubrication, they have a tendency to cross-thread easily. The systems that employ helical grooves typically only require 180° of rotation to achieve full engagement but require a high amount of torque and the use of lubrication to maintain an only somewhat smooth feel during the process of engaging and disengaging. Even with the use of lubrication, these systems show a consistent pattern of extremely high wear on some of the components involved in the engagement procedure. The torque and the wear issues worsen over the cycle life of the system. Also, considering the geometry of these systems, the lubrication is required to be applied in an area that threatens sensitive electronic components.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention incorporates a unique spring lock design to initially attach the two halves of the system together. After which the use of a multi start Acme lead screw provides a, consistent, low torque means of engagement. Although this engager requires the use of lubrication, to be applied initially, the lube is contained in a sealed environment. This eliminates the risk of contamination to electrical components and eliminates the need to apply additional lube during the products life. Because the present invention allows the ACME threads to be “meshed” at all times, it also eliminates the possibly of cross-threading.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref>. An engagement system in accordance with the present invention has a receiver <b>100</b> and a test adapter <b>200</b>. The receiver <b>100</b> has a frame <b>110</b> having mounting members <b>130</b> on each end and an opening <b>120</b> in which there is a spring lock bushing <b>140</b>. The test adapter <b>200</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, has a frame <b>210</b>, a plate <b>220</b>, a collar <b>230</b>, a cover <b>240</b> and a handle <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a preferred embodiment, the frame <b>210</b> is in the shape of a rectangle having two pairs of opposing sides. On the each of the pair of long sides is a pair of grooves <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> for use in releasably attaching the cover <b>240</b> to the frame <b>210</b> via tongue <b>246</b>. The frame further may have means such as holes <b>216</b> for mounting modules or connectors to the frame. The frame additionally has alignment pin bushings <b>820</b> for receiving a pair of guide pins <b>710</b> and a spring lock bushing <b>810</b> for receiving a spring lock pin <b>940</b> of an engagement mechanism <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The plate <b>220</b> has a pair of holes <b>224</b> through which, for example, screws (not shown) may be placed to secure the plate <b>220</b> to one of the short sides of the frame <b>210</b>. While screws are used in a preferred embodiment, any means for attaching may be used to attached the plate <b>220</b> to the frame <b>210</b>. The plate <b>220</b> may have additional features such as a recess <b>222</b> for placement of a label.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The collar <b>230</b> is attached to the plate <b>220</b> via, for example, screws (not shown) through holes <b>236</b>. The collar <b>230</b> has a clamp <b>232</b> that slides within a pair of grooves <b>233</b>, one on each of two sides of the collar <b>230</b>. When in use, patchcords go through the collar to pins mounted in the test adapter frame <b>210</b>. The clamp <b>232</b> may be tightened around the patch cords (not shown) via, for example, a screw <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The cover <b>240</b> has two open faces, one opposing the frame <b>210</b> and one opposing the plate <b>220</b> when the cover is attached to the frame <b>210</b> and plate <b>220</b>. The edge on each of the two parallel sides of the open face of the cover opposing the test adapter frame <b>110</b> has a tongue or tongues to mate with the grooves <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> in the frame <b>110</b>. The two parallel sides of the open face of the cover opposing the plate <b>220</b> has a lip <b>242</b> for placement within a lip <b>226</b> of the plate <b>220</b> when the cover is placed onto the frame <b>210</b> and plate <b>220</b>. The cover further has a hole <b>244</b> through a stem <b>256</b> of a handle <b>250</b> extends to attach to an engagement mechanism <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The handle <b>250</b> may have on it markings <b>252</b>, <b>254</b> for indicating whether the engagement mechanism is in an open or closed position. The cover likewise may have a marking <b>242</b> or markings to assist in indicate the open or closed position of the handle <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The locking mechanism <b>900</b> is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9(</figref><i>a</i>)-(<i>b</i>) in a disengaged position and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10(</figref><i>a</i>)-(<i>b</i>) in an engaged position. The locking mechanism <b>900</b> has a ring <b>920</b>, a lead screw drive <b>910</b> and a spring lock nut <b>930</b>. The spring lock nut <b>930</b> has two opposing flats <b>932</b> that are used to transfer torque from the engagement handle <b>250</b> to the spring lock nut <b>930</b>, a threaded hole <b>934</b> for a shoulder screw (not shown) that attaches the engagement handle <b>250</b> to the spring lock nut <b>930</b>, and a shoulder <b>914</b> that positions the engagement mechanism <b>900</b> within the ITA housing. There is a groove between ring <b>920</b> and lead screw drive <b>910</b> that is for a retaining ring (not shown) that positions the engagement mechanism <b>900</b> in the ITA Housing. Further, there are two ball plungers (not shown) that align with feature <b>912</b> to hold the handle <b>250</b> in the open position. The locking mechanism <b>900</b> further has a spring lock pin <b>940</b> and locking tabs <b>950</b>. In the preferred embodiment shown in the figures, four locking tabs <b>950</b> are shown, but a different number of locking tabs, such as one, two, three, or more locking tabs may be used. The locking tabs <b>950</b> are used to initially attach the test adapter <b>200</b> to the receiver <b>100</b> by placement of the spring lock pin <b>940</b> with a blind mate alignment rose <b>960</b> into the receiving means <b>810</b> in the receiver. When so placed, the locking tabs <b>950</b> latch into means, such as a groove or ridge <b>140</b>, within the receiving means <b>810</b> in the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">After that initial attachment of the test adapter <b>200</b> to the receiver <b>100</b>, a multi start Acme lead screw <b>946</b> within the lead screw drive <b>910</b> provides a, consistent, low torque means of engagement to draw the test adapter <b>200</b> into the receiver <b>100</b> and complete the connections between contact pins in the receiver and in the test adapter. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11(</figref><i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), the lead screw drive <b>910</b> has a spring lock pin <b>940</b> having a pin <b>942</b> and a spring <b>944</b> and an Acme lead screw <b>946</b>. The Acme lead screw threads engage with threads <b>911</b> on the interior of the lead screw drive housing <b>913</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The pin <b>942</b> is spring loaded and positions itself in the beginning of the lead screw operation to prevent the locking tabs from retracting. As the lead screw continues to the full engaged position the pin <b>942</b> travels with the locking tabs <b>950</b>. In the disengaged position the locking tabs <b>950</b> travel with the pin <b>942</b> until the end of the stroke, allowing the tabs <b>950</b> to be able to retract when the device is pulled away from the receiver frame, do to the back angle slope on the locking tabs.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Although this engager requires the use of lubrication, to be applied initially, the lube is contained in a sealed environment in the lead screw drive <b>910</b>. This eliminates the risk of contamination to electrical components and eliminates the need to apply additional lube during the products life. Because the present invention allows the ACME threads to be “meshed” at all times, it also eliminates the possibly of cross-threading.</p>
