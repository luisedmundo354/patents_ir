<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of driving a plasma display panel.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A plasma display panel (hereinafter abbreviated as a PDP or a panel) is a display device having excellent visibility and featuring a large screen, thinness and light weight. The systems of discharging a PDP include an alternating-current (AC) type and direct-current (DC) type. The electrode structures thereof include a three-electrode surface-discharge type and an opposite-discharge type. However, the current mainstream is an AC type three-electrode PDP, which is an AC surface-discharge type, because this type of PDP is suitable for higher definition and easy to manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, an AC type three-electrode PDP has a large number of discharge cells formed between a front panel and rear panel faced with each other. In the front panel, a plurality of display electrodes, each made of a pair of scan electrode and sustain electrode, are formed on a front glass substrate in parallel with each other. A dielectric layer and a protective layer are formed to cover these display electrodes. In the rear panel, a plurality of parallel data electrodes is formed on a rear glass substrate. A dielectric layer is formed on the data electrodes to cover them. Further, a plurality of barrier ribs is formed on the dielectric layer in parallel with the data electrodes. Phosphor layers are formed on the surface of the dielectric layer and the side faces of the barrier ribs. Then, the front panel and the rear panel are faced with each other and sealed together so that the display electrodes and data electrodes intersect with each other. A discharge gas is filled into an inside discharge space formed therebetween. In a panel structured as above, ultraviolet light is generated by gas discharge in each discharge cell. This ultraviolet light excites respective phosphors to emit R, G, or B color, for color display.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A general method of driving a panel is a so-called sub-field method: one field period is divided into a plurality of sub-fields and combination of light-emitting sub-fields provides gradation images for display. Now, each of the sub-fields has an initializing period, writing period, and sustaining period.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the initializing period, all the discharge cells perform initializing discharge operation at a time to erase the history of wall electric charge previously formed in respective discharge cells and form wall electric charge necessary for the subsequent writing operation. Additionally, this initializing discharge operation serves to generate priming (priming for discharge=excited particles) for causing stable writing discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the writing period, scan pulses are sequentially applied to scan electrodes, and write pulses corresponding to the signals of an image to be displayed are applied to data electrodes. Thus, selective writing discharge is caused between scan electrodes and corresponding data electrodes for selective formation of wall electric charge.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the subsequent sustaining period, a predetermined number of sustain pulses are applied between scan electrodes and corresponding sustain electrodes. Then, the discharge cells in which wall electric charge are formed by the writing discharge are selectively discharged and light is emitted from the discharge cells.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this manner, to properly display an image, selective writing discharge must securely be performed in the writing period. However, there are many factors in increasing discharge delay in the writing discharge: restraints of the circuitry inhibit the use of high voltage for write pulses; and phosphor layers formed on the data electrodes make discharge difficult. For these reasons, priming for generating stable writing discharge is extremely important.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the priming caused by discharge rapidly decreases as time elapses. This causes the following problems in the method of driving a panel described above. In writing discharge occurring a long time after the initializing discharge, priming generated in the initializing discharge is insufficient. This insufficient priming causes a large discharge delay and unstable wiring operation, thus degrading the image display quality. Additionally, when a long wiring period is set for stable wiring operation, the time taken for the writing period is too long.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Proposed to address these problems are a panel and method of driving the panel in which auxiliary discharge electrodes are provided and discharge delay is minimized using priming caused by auxiliary discharge (see Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 2002-297091, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, such panels have the following problems. Because the discharge delay of the auxiliary discharge itself is large, the discharge delay of the writing discharge cannot sufficiently be shortened. Additionally, because the operating margin of the auxiliary discharge is small, incorrect discharge may be induced in some panels.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, when the number of scan electrodes is increased for higher definition without shortening the discharge delay in the writing discharge sufficiently, the time taken for the writing period is too long and the time taken for the sustaining period is insufficient. As a result, luminance decreases. Additionally, increasing the partial pressure of xenon to increase the luminance and efficiency further increases the discharge delay and makes the writing operation unstable.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention addresses these problems and aims to provide a method of driving a plasma display panel capable of performing stable and high-speed writing operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">To address these problems, in the method of driving a plasma display panel of the present invention, the pulse width of scan pulses applied to scan electrodes in which writing operation is performed but no priming discharge is caused with the scanning of the scan electrodes is shorter than the pulse width of scan pulses applied to other scan electrodes in which writing operation is performed and priming discharge is caused with the scanning of the scan electrodes, in the writing period.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A method of driving a plasma display panel in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Exemplary Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view showing an example of a panel used for the exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic perspective view showing the structure of the rear substrate side of the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, front substrate <b>1</b> and rear substrate <b>2</b> both made of glass are faced with each other to sandwich a discharge space therebetween. In the discharge space, a mixed gas of neon and xenon for radiating ultraviolet light by discharge is filled.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">On front substrate <b>1</b>, a plurality of pairs of scan electrode <b>6</b> and sustain electrode <b>7</b> are formed in parallel with each other. Further, scan electrodes <b>6</b> and sustain electrodes <b>7</b> are alternately arranged in pairs like sustain electrode <b>7</b>—scan electrode <b>6</b>—scan electrode <b>6</b>—sustain electrode <b>7</b>—sustain electrode <b>7</b>—scan electrode <b>6</b>, etc. Scan electrode <b>6</b> and sustain electrode <b>7</b> are made of transparent electrodes <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>a, </i>and metal buses <b>6</b><i>b </i>and <b>7</b><i>b </i>formed on transparent electrodes <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>a, </i>respectively. Now, between one scan electrode <b>6</b> and the other scan electrode <b>6</b>, and one sustain electrode <b>7</b> and the other scan electrode <b>7</b>, light-absorbing layers <b>8</b>, each made of a black material, are provided. Projection <b>6</b><i>b</i>′ of metal bus <b>6</b><i>b </i>in one of adjacent scan electrodes <b>6</b> projects onto light-absorbing layer <b>8</b>. Dielectric layer <b>4</b> and protective layer <b>5</b> are formed to cover these scan electrodes <b>6</b>, sustain electrodes <b>7</b>, and light-absorbing layers <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">On rear substrate <b>2</b>, a plurality of data electrodes <b>9</b> is formed in parallel with each other. Dielectric layer <b>15</b> is formed to cover these data electrodes <b>9</b>. Further on the dielectric layer, barrier ribs <b>10</b> for partitioning the discharge space into discharge cells <b>11</b> are formed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each barrier rib <b>10</b> is made of vertical walls <b>10</b><i>a </i>extending in parallel with data electrodes <b>9</b>, and horizontal walls <b>10</b><i>b </i>for forming discharge cells <b>11</b> and forming clearance <b>13</b> between discharge cells <b>11</b>. In clearance <b>13</b> faced with projection <b>6</b><i>b</i>′ in scan electrode <b>6</b> among clearances <b>13</b>, priming electrode <b>14</b> is formed in the direction orthogonal to data electrodes <b>9</b>, to form priming cell <b>13</b><i>a. </i>In other words, priming electrodes <b>14</b> are not provided in all the clearances <b>13</b>, and are formed in priming cells <b>13</b> in every other one of clearances <b>13</b>. On the surface of dielectric layer <b>15</b> corresponding to discharge cells <b>11</b> and the side faces of barrier ribs <b>10</b>, phosphor layers <b>12</b> are provided. However, no phosphor layer <b>12</b> is formed on the side of clearances <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">When front substrate <b>1</b> is faced and sealed with rear substrate <b>2</b>, each projection <b>6</b><i>b</i>′ of metal bus <b>6</b><i>b </i>in scan electrode <b>6</b> formed on front substrate <b>1</b> that projects onto light-absorbing layer <b>8</b> is positioned in parallel with corresponding priming electrode <b>14</b> on rear substrate <b>2</b> and faced therewith in priming cell <b>13</b><i>a. </i>In other words, the panel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is structured to include priming cells <b>13</b><i>a, </i>each for performing priming discharge between projection <b>6</b><i>b</i>′ formed on the side of front substrate <b>1</b> and priming electrode <b>14</b> formed on the side of rear substrate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, dielectric layer <b>16</b> is further formed to cover priming electrodes <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Now, to facilitate causing priming discharge, phosphor layers <b>12</b> that hinder the discharge are not provided on priming cells <b>13</b><i>a. </i>Further, the interval between projection <b>6</b><i>b</i>′ in scan electrode <b>6</b> and corresponding priming electrode <b>14</b> is shorter than the interval between data electrode <b>9</b> and corresponding scan electrode <b>6</b>. Thus, the discharge-starting voltage of the priming discharge is lower than that of the writing discharge, and the priming discharge is more likely to occur.</p>

M columns of data electrodes D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m </sub>(data electrodes <b>9</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are arranged in the column direction. N rows of scan electrodes SC<sub>1 </sub>to SC<sub>n </sub>(scan electrodes <b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and n rows of sustain electrodes SU<sub>1 </sub>to SU<sub>n </sub>(sustain electrodes <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are alternately arranged in pairs in the row direction like sustain electrode SU<sub>1</sub>—scan electrode SC<sub>1</sub>—scan electrode SC<sub>2</sub>—sustain electrode SU<sub>2</sub>, etc. In this embodiment, projections <b>6</b><i>b</i>′ are provided only in odd-numbered scan electrodes SU<sub>1</sub>, SU<sub>3</sub>, etc. N/2 rows of priming electrodes PR<sub>1</sub>, PR<sub>3</sub>, etc. (priming electrode <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are arranged to be faced with the corresponding projections of these scan electrodes SU<sub>1</sub>, SU<sub>3</sub>, etc.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As described above, the panel used in the embodiment of the present invention, odd-numbered scan electrodes SC<sub>p </sub>are scan electrodes with projections <b>6</b><i>b</i>′ in which writing operation is performed and priming discharge is caused during the scanning of the odd-numbered scan electrodes.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Next, a driving waveform for driving the panel and timing of the driving waveform are described.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram showing a driving waveform in the method of driving the panel used for the exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, one field period is made of a plurality of sub-fields, each including an initializing period, writing period, and sustaining period. Because the same operation is performed in each sub-field, except for the number of sustain pulses in the sustaining period, operation in one sub-filed is described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the former half of the initializing period, each of data electrodes D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m</sub>, sustain electrode SU<sub>1 </sub>to SU<sub>n</sub>, and priming electrodes PR<sub>1 </sub>to PR<sub>n−1 </sub>is held at 0 (V). Applied to each of scan electrodes SC<sub>1 </sub>to SC<sub>n </sub>is a ramp waveform voltage gradually increasing from a voltage of V<sub>i1 </sub>not larger than discharge-starting voltage across the scan electrodes and sustain electrodes SU<sub>1 </sub>to SU<sub>n </sub>to a voltage of V<sub>i2 </sub>exceeding the discharge-starting voltage. While the ramp waveform voltage increases, first weak initializing discharge occurs between scan electrodes SC<sub>1 </sub>to SC<sub>n</sub>, and sustain electrodes SU<sub>1 </sub>to SU<sub>n</sub>, data electrodes D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m</sub>, and priming electrodes PR<sub>1 </sub>to PR<sub>n−1</sub>. Thus, negative wall voltage accumulates on scan electrodes SC<sub>1 </sub>to SC<sub>n</sub>, and positive wall voltage accumulates on data electrodes D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m</sub>, sustain electrodes SU<sub>1 </sub>to SU<sub>n</sub>, and priming electrodes PR<sub>1 </sub>to PR<sub>n−1</sub>. Now, the wall voltage on the electrodes is the voltage generated by the wall charge accumulating on the dielectric layers covering the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the latter half of the initializing period, each of sustain electrode SU<sub>1 </sub>to SU<sub>n </sub>is held at a positive voltage of Ve. Applied to each of scan electrodes SC<sub>1 </sub>to SC<sub>n </sub>is a ramp waveform voltage gradually decreasing from a voltage of V<sub>i3 </sub>not larger than discharge-starting voltage across the scan electrodes and sustain electrodes SU<sub>1 </sub>to SU<sub>n </sub>to a voltage of V<sub>i4 </sub>exceeding the discharge-starting voltage. During this application of the ramp voltage, second weak initializing discharge occurs between scan electrodes SC<sub>1 </sub>to SC<sub>n</sub>, and sustain electrodes SU<sub>1 </sub>to SU<sub>n</sub>, data electrodes D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m</sub>, and priming electrodes PR<sub>1 </sub>to PR<sub>n−1</sub>. Then, the negative wall voltage on scan electrodes SC<sub>1 </sub>to SC<sub>n </sub>and the positive wall voltage on sustain electrodes SU<sub>1 </sub>to SU<sub>n </sub>are weakened. The positive wall voltage on data electrodes D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m </sub>is adjusted to a value appropriate for writing operation. The positive wall voltage on priming electrodes PR<sub>1 </sub>to PR<sub>n−1 </sub>is also adjusted to a value appropriate for priming operation. Thus, the initializing operation is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the writing period, scan electrodes SC<sub>1 </sub>to SC<sub>n </sub>are once held at a voltage of Vc. Then, a voltage of Vq substantially equal to voltage change V<sub>c</sub>−V<sub>i4 </sub>is applied to priming electrodes PR<sub>1 </sub>to PR<sub>n−1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, scan pulse Va is applied to scan electrode SC<sub>1 </sub>of the first row. Then, priming discharge occurs between priming electrode PR<sub>1 </sub>and projection <b>6</b><i>b</i>′ in scan electrode SC<sub>1</sub>. The priming diffuses inside of discharge cells C<sub>1,1 </sub>to C<sub>1, m </sub>in the first row corresponding to scan electrode SC<sub>1 </sub>of the first row and discharge cells C<sub>2,1 </sub>to C<sub>2, m </sub>in the second row corresponding to scan electrode SC<sub>2 </sub>of the second row. Because the priming cells are structured to easily discharge as described above, in this discharge, high-speed and stable priming discharge with a small discharge delay is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At the same time, positive write pulse voltage Vd is applied to data electrode D<sub>k </sub>(k being an integer ranging from 1 to m) corresponding to the signal of an image to be displayed in the first row, among data electrodes D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m</sub>. Then, discharge occurs at the intersection of data electrode D<sub>k </sub>to which write pulse voltage Vd has been applied and scan electrode SC<sub>1</sub>. This discharge develops to the discharge between sustain electrode SU<sub>1 </sub>and scan electrode SC<sub>1 </sub>in corresponding discharge cell C<sub>1,k</sub>. Then, positive voltage accumulates on scan electrode SC<sub>1 </sub>and negative voltage accumulates on sustain electrode SU<sub>1 </sub>in discharge cell C<sub>1,k</sub>. Thus, the writing operation in the first row is completed. As described above, because the priming discharge and writing discharge sequentially occur in the scanning period in the first row, the pulse width of the scan pulse applied to scan electrode SC<sub>1 </sub>of the first row is the sum of time tp necessary for the priming discharge and time tw necessary for the writing operation, i.e. tp+tw.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Now, scan electrode SC<sub>1 </sub>of the first row is a scan electrode in which writing is performed and the priming discharge is caused with scanning of the scan electrode. The discharge in discharge cell C<sub>1,k </sub>occurs with the priming supplied from the priming discharge that has occurred between scan electrode SC<sub>1 </sub>and priming electrode PR<sub>1</sub>. For this reason, although there is a delay in starting the supply of the priming from the priming cell, stable discharge with a small discharge delay can be obtained after the supply of the priming.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, scan pulse voltage Va having a pulse width smaller than the pulse width of the pulse applied to the scan electrode of the first row is applied to scan electrode SC<sub>2 </sub>of the second row. At this time, positive write pulse voltage Vd is applied to data electrode D<sub>k </sub>corresponding to the signal of the image to be displayed in the second row, among data electrodes D<sub>1 </sub>to D<sub>m</sub>. Then, discharge occurs at the intersection of data electrode D<sub>k </sub>and scan electrode SC<sub>2</sub>. This discharge develops to the discharge between sustain electrode SU<sub>2 </sub>and scan electrode SC<sub>2 </sub>in corresponding discharge cell C<sub>2,k</sub>. Then, positive voltage accumulates on scan electrode SC<sub>2 </sub>and negative voltage accumulates on sustain electrode SU<sub>2 </sub>in discharge cell C<sub>2,k</sub>. Thus, the writing operation in the second row is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Now, the reason why the pulse width of the scan pulse applied to scan electrode SC<sub>2 </sub>of the second row is smaller than the first pulse width, i.e. tp+tw, is as follows. Scan electrode SC<sub>2 </sub>is a scan electrode in which writing is performed, but no priming discharge is caused during the scanning of the scan electrode SC<sub>2</sub>. Thus, the discharge in discharge cell C<sub>2,k </sub>occurs with sufficient priming already supplied from the priming discharge that has occurred between scan electrode SC<sub>1 </sub>and priming electrode PR<sub>1</sub>. Therefore, time tp necessary for the priming discharge need not be taken into account. At this time, of course, the discharge delay in the writing discharge is extremely small and stable discharge can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a similar manner, a scan pulse having the first pulse width of tp+tw is applied to scan electrode SC<sub>3 </sub>of the third row, and a write pulse is applied to data electrode D<sub>k</sub>. Then, priming discharge occurs between priming electrode PR<sub>3 </sub>and scan electrode SC<sub>3 </sub>first, and priming is supplied to discharge cells C<sub>3,1 </sub>to C<sub>3,m </sub>in the third row and discharge cells C<sub>4,1 </sub>to C<sub>4,m </sub>in the fourth row. Successively, writing discharge occurs in discharge cell C<sub>3,k </sub>corresponding to data electrode D<sub>k </sub>to which the write pulse voltage has been applied.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, a scan pulse having a pulse width of tw is applied to scan electrode SC<sub>4 </sub>of the fourth row, and a positive write pulse is applied to data electrode D<sub>k</sub>. Then, in corresponding discharge cell C<sub>4,k</sub>, stable writing discharge with an extremely a small discharge delay is caused by the influence of the priming already supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The similar writing operations are performed in discharge cells including C<sub>n,k </sub>of the n-th row, and the writing operations are completed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this manner, in the writing operation in each of discharge cells C<sub>p,1 </sub>to C<sub>p,m </sub>(p=odd number) in an odd-numbered row, a scan pulse having the first pulse width of tp+tw is applied to scan electrode SC<sub>p</sub>, and a write pulse is applied to data electrode D<sub>k</sub>. Then, priming discharge occurs between priming electrodes PR<sub>p </sub>and scan electrodes SC<sub>p </sub>first, and the priming is supplied inside of discharge cells C<sub>p,1 </sub>to C<sub>p,m </sub>and discharge cells C<sub>p+1,1 </sub>to C<sub>p+1,m</sub>. Successively, writing discharge occurs in discharge cell C<sub>p,k </sub>corresponding to data electrode D<sub>k </sub>to which the write pulse voltage has been applied.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, in the writing operation in each of discharge cells C<sub>p+1,1 </sub>to C<sub>p+1,m </sub>in even-numbered row, a scan pulse having a pulse width of tw is applied to scan electrode SC<sub>p+1 </sub>of the (p+1)-th row, and a write pulse is applied to data electrode D<sub>k</sub>. Then, in corresponding discharge cell C<sub>p+1, k</sub>, stable writing discharge having an extremely a small discharge delay is caused by the influence of the priming already supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the sustaining period, after scan electrodes SC<sub>1 </sub>to SC<sub>n </sub>and sustain electrodes SU<sub>1 </sub>to SU<sub>n </sub>are reset to 0 (V) once, a positive sustain pulse voltage of Vs is applied to scan electrodes SC<sub>1 </sub>to SC<sub>n</sub>. At this time, in the voltage on scan electrode SC<sub>1 </sub>and sustain electrode SU<sub>i </sub>in discharge cell C<sub>i,j </sub>in which writing discharge has occurred, the wall voltage accumulating on scan electrode SC<sub>i </sub>and sustain electrode SU<sub>i </sub>is added to sustain pulse voltage Vs. For this reason, the voltage exceeds the discharge-starting voltage and sustain discharge occurs. In a similar manner, by alternately applying sustain pulses to scan electrodes SC<sub>1 </sub>to SC<sub>n </sub>and sustain electrodes SU<sub>1 </sub>to SU<sub>n</sub>, sustain discharge operations are successively performed in discharge cell C<sub>i,k </sub>in which the writing discharge has occurred, the number of times of sustain pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As described above, unlike the writing discharge depending only on the priming in the initializing discharge in accordance with a conventional driving method, the writing discharge of the method of driving a panel in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention is performed with sufficient priming supplied from the priming discharge that has occurred during or immediately before the writing operation in respective discharge cells. This can achieve high-speed and stable writing discharge with a small discharge delay, and display a high-quality image.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, electrodes in the vicinity of the priming cells are priming electrodes <b>14</b> and scan electrodes <b>6</b> only. This also gives an advantage of stable action of the priming discharge itself because the priming discharge is unlikely to cause other unnecessary discharge, e.g. incorrect discharge involving the sustain electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Incidentally, respective electrodes of an AC type PDP are surrounded by the dielectric layers and insulated from the discharge space. For this reason, direct-current components make no contribution to discharge itself. Therefore, of course, even the use of a waveform in which direct-current components are added to the driving waveform of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention can provide similar effects.</p>
