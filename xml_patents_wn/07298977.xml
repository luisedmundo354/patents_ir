The light receiving/emitting module has an optical transmitter for optically transmitting data and an optical receiver for optically receiving data in one package.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above-mentioned conventional optical transmitter has a circuit configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In other words, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an input terminal <b>51</b> is connected to one terminal of a resistor <b>52</b>, and the other terminal of the resistor <b>52</b> is connected to the base of an NPN bipolar transistor <b>53</b> for driving a light emitting device.

The anode of the light-emitting diode <b>54</b> is connected to a power supply terminal <b>56</b>, and the other terminal of the resistor <b>55</b> is connected to a ground terminal <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the above-mentioned optical transmitter, when an optical transmission input signal applied to the input terminal <b>51</b> becomes high, the NPN bipolar transistor <b>53</b> conducts, a current flows from the power supply terminal <b>56</b> to the light-emitting diode <b>54</b>, and the light-emitting diode <b>54</b> emits light. In addition, when the optical transmission input signal applied to the input terminal <b>51</b> becomes low, the NPN bipolar transistor <b>53</b> shuts off, no current flows to the light-emitting diode <b>54</b>, and the light-emitting diode <b>54</b> stops light emission.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of this circuit configuration, when an optical transmission input signal having an amplitude V<sub>IN </sub>shown in the waveform (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, that is, the output signal from a system LSI, is input to the input terminal <b>51</b> of the optical transmitter, the optical output from the light-emitting diode <b>54</b> has the same waveform as that of the output signal from the system LSI as shown in the waveform (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the case when the potential of the input terminal <b>51</b>, that is, the optical transmission input signal, is fixed high as shown in the waveform (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> because of the software or the like of the system LSI, the NPN bipolar transistor <b>53</b> maintains conducting.

As a result, various problems, such as battery exhaustion and breakdown of the light-emitting diode <b>54</b>, are caused in PDAs and cellular phones.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, the configuration wherein the protection circuit is disposed in the preceding stage of the input terminal <b>51</b> of the optical transmitter is complicated, thereby causing a problem of high cost.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is intended to provide an optical transmitter capable of automatically stopping the light-emitting operation of a light-emitting device when the pulse width of an optical transmission input signal exceeds a predetermined value owing to a malfunction, such as the case when the optical transmission input signal is fixed high, capable of preventing battery exhaustion and breakdown of the light-emitting device due to the malfunction, and capable of attaining a configuration for the purposes simply at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The optical transmitter in accordance with the present invention comprises a high-pass filter for passing the high-frequency components of an optical transmission input signal having a pulse waveform, a binary circuit for binarizing the output signal of the high-pass filter so as to be returned to a pulse waveform, a light-emitting device for optical transmission, and a light-emitting device driving circuit for driving the light-emitting device depending on the output signal of the binary circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With this configuration, the optical transmission input signal having a pulse waveform is not directly input to the light-emitting device driving circuit; instead, the signal is once passed through the high-pass filter so that the pulse waveform is differentiated, the differentiated signal is binarized by the binary circuit so as to be returned to a pulse waveform, and then the signal is input to the light-emitting device driving circuit. Hence, the optical transmission input signal having a pulse width shorter than the predetermined time width determined by the time constant of the high-pass filter and the binarization threshold value of the binary circuit is output from the binary circuit while its pulse width is unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, with respect to the optical transmission input signal having a pulse width longer than the above-mentioned predetermined time width, when the signal is passed through the high-pass filter, its level lowers gradually; when the predetermined time passes, the level of the output signal of the high-pass filter becomes lower than the binarization threshold value of the binary circuit. As a result, even if the optical transmission input signal having a pulse width longer than the above-mentioned predetermined time width is input, a signal having a pulse width longer than the predetermined time width is not output from the binary circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Hence, in the case when the optical transmission input signal is fixed high because of software or the like, or in the case when the pulse width of the optical transmission input signal becomes longer than a pulse width assumed in an applicable communication system, the light-emitting diode emits light only during the period of time of the predetermined pulse width but does not emit light during the period of time longer than that.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, it is possible to prevent battery exhaustion of the battery for supplying electricity to the optical transmitter and to prevent breakdown of the light-emitting diode.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, as the configuration for the above-mentioned purpose, the high-pass filter and the binary circuit should only be provided, and the circuit constant of the high-pass filter should only be set properly depending on the time width of the optical transmission signal to be shuts off, whereby the configuration is simple and can be attained at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the above-mentioned optical transmitter in accordance with the present invention, the high-pass filter comprises an L-type circuit including a capacitor and a resistor, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With this configuration, since the high-pass filter comprises the capacitor and the resistor, the configuration is simple and can be attained at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the above-mentioned optical transmitter in accordance with the present invention, the binary circuit comprises two-stage inverters connected in series, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With this configuration, since the binary circuit comprises the two-stage inverters connected in series, the configuration is simple and can be attained at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the above-mentioned optical transmitter in accordance with the present invention, the inverters are formed of CMOS inverters, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With this configuration, since the inverters are formed of CMOS inverters, no standby current is required, and the power consumption can be made lower than that of the configuration wherein the inverters are formed of bipolar transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the above-mentioned optical transmitter in accordance with the present invention, the light-emitting device driving circuit comprises a bipolar transistor, for example. The output signal of the binary circuit is input to the base of the bipolar transistor, and the bipolar transistor interrupts the current supplied to the light-emitting device depending on the output signal of the binary circuit.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram showing the configuration of an optical transmitter in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The high-pass filter <b>21</b> comprises an L-type circuit including a capacitor <b>2</b> and a resistor <b>3</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The binary circuit <b>22</b> comprises two-stage inverters <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> connected in series, for example. The inverters <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> are each formed of a bipolar transistor, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The light-emitting device driving circuit <b>23</b> comprises an NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b> and resistors <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>. The NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b> interrupts the current supplied to the light-emitting diode <b>8</b> depending on the output signal of the binary circuit <b>22</b>, which is input to its base. The resistor <b>6</b> is inserted between the base of the NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b> and the binary circuit <b>22</b>. The resistor <b>9</b> is inserted between the emitter of the NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b> and a ground terminal <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The connection relationship among the devices of the optical transmitter will be described below specifically. One terminal of the capacitor <b>2</b> is connected to an input terminal <b>1</b>, one terminal of the resistor <b>3</b> and the input terminal of the inverter <b>4</b> are connected to the other terminal of the capacitor <b>2</b>, and the input terminal of the inverter <b>5</b> is connected to the output terminal of the inverter <b>4</b>. One terminal of the resistor <b>6</b> is connected to the output terminal of the inverter <b>5</b>, and the other terminal of the resistor <b>6</b> is connected to the base of the NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b>. The cathode of the light-emitting diode <b>8</b> is connected to the collector of the NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b>, and the anode of the light-emitting diode <b>8</b> is connected to a power supply terminal <b>10</b>. One terminal of the resistor <b>9</b> is connected to the emitter of the NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b>, and the other terminal of the resistor <b>3</b> and the other terminal of the resistor <b>9</b> are connected to the ground terminal <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For explanation of this embodiment, the node wherein the capacitor <b>2</b>, the resistor <b>3</b> and the input terminal of the inverter <b>4</b> are connected is designated by numeral <b>31</b>, and the node wherein the output terminal of the inventor <b>4</b> and the input terminal of the inverter <b>5</b> are connected is designated by numeral <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The waveform (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the waveform at the input terminal <b>1</b> at the time when a pulse waveform having a pulse width of 75 μ sec, for example, is input as the optical transmission signal to the input terminal <b>1</b>. Similarly, the waveform (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the waveform at the node <b>31</b>. Similarly, the waveform (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the waveform at the node <b>32</b>. Similarly, the waveform (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the optical power of the light-emitting diode <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The waveform (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the waveform at the input terminal <b>1</b> at the time when a pulse waveform having a pulse width of more than 75 μ sec, for example, is input as the optical transmission signal. Similarly, the waveform (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the waveform at the node <b>31</b>. Similarly, the waveform (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the waveform at the node <b>32</b>. Similarly, the waveform (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the optical power of the light-emitting diode <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, V<sub>IN </sub>is the amplitude of the optical transmission signal, and V<sub>T</sub>, is a threshold value at which the first-stage inverter <b>4</b> of the binary circuit <b>22</b> distinguishes between high and low levels.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the optical transmission input signal shown in the waveform (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is input to the input terminal <b>1</b>, voltage V<sub>31 </sub>shown in the waveform (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is output at the node <b>31</b>. The optical transmission input signal shown in the waveform (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a rectangular waveform signal having amplitude V<sub>IN</sub>, cycle T and duty 3/16. In addition, the voltage V<sub>31 </sub>shown in the waveform (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is represented by the following equation (1):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>V</i><sub>31</sub><i>=V</i><sub>IN</sub>*exp {−<i>t</i>/(<i>C</i><sub>2</sub><i>*R</i><sub>3</sub>)}  Equation (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
wherein C<sub>2 </sub>designates the capacitance value of the capacitor <b>2</b>, and R<sub>3 </sub>designates the resistance value of the resistor <b>3</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to Equation (1), the voltage V<sub>31 </sub>at the node <b>31</b> decreases gradually at an attenuation rate of time constant C<sub>2</sub>*R<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At this time, the capacitance value C<sub>2 </sub>of the capacitor <b>2</b> and the resistance value R<sub>3 </sub>of the resistor <b>3</b> are determined so that the voltage V<sub>31 </sub>at the node <b>31</b> does not become lower than the threshold value V<sub>T </sub>until the input signal having a predetermined pulse width returns to the low level.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, since the longest pulse in the IrDA standard is 75 μ sec (in the case of 2.4 kbps and duty 3/16), the capacitance value C<sub>2 </sub>of the capacitor <b>2</b> and the resistance value R<sub>3 </sub>of the resistor <b>3</b> are determined so as to satisfy the following equation (2):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>t=C</i><sub>2</sub><i>*R</i><sub>3</sub>*ln(<i>V</i><sub>IN</sub><i>/V</i><sub>T</sub>)≧75μ sec  Equation (2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the case when it is assumed herein that the power supply voltage V<sub>IN </sub>is 3.0 V and the threshold value V<sub>T </sub>is 1.4 V, and when it is assumed that, for example,
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>C</i><sub>2</sub>=100 pF and R<sub>3</sub>=1 MΩ<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Equation (2) can be satisfied.
</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Hence, the waveform (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the inversion of the optical transmission input signal, is output at the node <b>32</b>. Therefore, the light-emitting diode <b>8</b> emits light during the period of the same pulse width as that of the optical transmission input signal to be input, as shown in the waveform (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. When the pulse width of the optical transmission input signal is shorter than 75 μsec, the light-emitting diode <b>8</b> emits light during the same time as that of the pulse width.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, when the optical transmission input signal having a pulse width of 75 μ sec or more is input as shown in the waveform (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> because of the malfunction of the preceding-stage circuit (system LSI), the voltage V<sub>31 </sub>at the node <b>31</b> becomes lower than the threshold value V<sub>T </sub>at the time when 75 μsec has passed after the rising, as shown in the waveform (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Hence, the voltage at the node <b>32</b> returns to the high level at the time when 75 μ sec has passed after the rising of the optical transmission input signal, regardless of the pulse width of the optical transmission input signal. Therefore, the light-emitting diode <b>8</b> emits light only 75 μ sec at the longest, no matter how the pulse width of the optical transmission input signal is long.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As described above, the circuit system wherein the optical transmission input signal having a pulse width of 75 μ sec or more is not transmitted to the light-emitting diode <b>8</b> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">With this configuration, the optical transmission input signal having a pulse waveform is not directly input to the light-emitting device driving circuit <b>23</b>; instead, the signal is once passed through the high-pass filter <b>21</b> so that the pulse waveform is differentiated, the differentiated signal is binarized by the binary circuit <b>22</b> so as to be returned to a pulse waveform, and then the signal is input to the light-emitting device driving circuit <b>23</b>. Hence, the optical transmission input signal having a pulse width shorter than the predetermined time width determined by the time constant of the high-pass filter <b>21</b> and the binarization threshold value of the binary circuit <b>22</b> is output from the binary circuit <b>22</b> while its pulse width is unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">However, with respect to the optical transmission input signal having a pulse width longer than the above-mentioned predetermined time width, when the signal is passed through the high-pass filter <b>21</b>, its level lowers gradually; when the predetermined time passes, the level of the output signal of the high-pass filter <b>21</b> becomes lower than the binarization threshold value of the binary circuit <b>22</b>. As a result, even if the optical transmission input signal having a pulse width longer than the above-mentioned predetermined time width is input, a signal having a pulse width longer than the predetermined time width is not output from the binary circuit <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Hence, in the case when the optical transmission input signal is fixed high because of software or the like, the light-emitting diode <b>8</b> emits light only during the period of time of the predetermined pulse width but does not emit light during the period of time longer than that.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Therefore, various problems being caused when the level at the input terminal is fixed high or when the pulse width becomes longer than an assumed pulse width because of software or the like can be solved; for example, it is possible to prevent battery exhaustion of the battery for supplying electricity to the optical transmitter and to prevent breakdown of the light-emitting diode <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In addition, as the configuration for the above-mentioned purpose, the high-pass filter <b>21</b> and the binary circuit <b>22</b> should only be provided, and the circuit constant of the high-pass filter <b>21</b> should only be set properly depending on the time width of the optical transmission signal to be shuts off, whereby the configuration is simple and can be attained at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, since the high-pass filter <b>21</b> comprises the capacitor <b>2</b> and the resistor <b>3</b>, the configuration is simple and can be attained at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Still further, since the binary circuit <b>22</b> comprises the two-stage inverters <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> connected in series, the configuration is simple and can be attained at low cost.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a circuit diagram showing the configuration of an optical transmitter in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in this optical transmitter, the configuration of a light-emitting device driving circuit <b>24</b> differs from that of the light-emitting device driving circuit <b>23</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In other words, in this light-emitting device driving circuit <b>24</b>, an N-channel MOS transistor <b>12</b> is used instead of the NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b>. The other configurations are similar to those of the optical transmitter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the operating voltage of the optical transmitter is determined by the forward voltage of the light-emitting diode <b>8</b>, the terminal voltage of the resistor <b>9</b> and the collector-emitter voltage of the NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Since the operating current of the light-emitting diode <b>8</b> is determined by light emission power, it is assumed herein that the current is constant. Hence, the forward voltage of the light-emitting diode <b>8</b> and the terminal voltage of the resistor <b>9</b> become constant, whereby the lower limit of the operating voltage is determined by the collector-emitter voltage of the NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b>. Generally, the collector-emitter voltage of the NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b> is about 200 mV at the time of saturation.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">On the other hand, in the case of the circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the lower limit of the operating voltage is determined by the drain-source voltage of the N-channel MOS transistor <b>12</b> at the time of operation. This value, 10 mV, is lower than the collector-emitter voltage of the NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b>. Hence, the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can operate on a voltage lower than that of the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The effects other than that described above are similar to those of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As described above, with the configuration of this embodiment, since the drain-source voltage of the N-channel MOS transistor <b>12</b>, which determines the lower limit of the operating voltage, is lower than the collector-emitter voltage of the bipolar transistor, low-voltage operation is possible.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a circuit diagram showing the configuration of an optical transmitter in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in this optical transmitter, the configuration of a light-emitting device driving circuit <b>25</b> differs from that of the light-emitting device driving circuit <b>23</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In other words, in this light-emitting device driving circuit <b>25</b>, instead of the one-stage NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b>, a Darlington circuit having a twostage configuration wherein NPN bipolar transistors <b>17</b> and <b>7</b> are connected in series is used.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">More specifically, the base of the first-stage NPN bipolar transistor <b>17</b> is connected to the other terminal of the resistor <b>6</b>, and the collector of the NPN bipolar transistor <b>17</b> is connected to the power supply terminal <b>10</b>, and the emitter of the NPN bipolar transistor <b>17</b> is connected to the base of the NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b>. The other configurations are similar to those of the optical transmitter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the circuit configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the case when noise is generated at the output of the inverter <b>5</b> constituting the binary circuit <b>22</b> of the preceding stage, if the level of the noise becomes 0.3 V or more, the transistor <b>7</b> gradually starts operating, and the light-emitting diode <b>8</b> gradually starts light emission.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">However, in the circuit configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, even in the case when noise is generated at the output of the inverter <b>5</b>, since the NPN bipolar transistor <b>17</b> is inserted in the preceding stage of the NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b> in the form of the Darlington connection, the NPN bipolar transistors <b>17</b> and <b>7</b> do not gradually start operation unless the level of the noise becomes 1.0 V or more.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the configuration of this embodiment, the output signal of the binary circuit <b>22</b> is applied to the base of the first-stage NPN bipolar transistor <b>17</b>, instead of the base of the next-stage NPN bipolar transistor <b>7</b> that directly drives the light-emitting diode <b>8</b>. As a result, inverters having low current drive capability can be used as the inverters <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> constituting the binary circuit <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Furthermore, the output signal of the binary circuit <b>22</b> is applied between the two base-emitter junctions, being connected in series, of the first-stage and next-stage NPN bipolar transistors <b>17</b> and <b>7</b> constituting the Darlington circuit.

Hence, noise immunity can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The other effects are similar to those of the first embodiment.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a circuit diagram showing the configuration of an optical transmitter in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the present invention. In this optical transmitter, the configuration of a binary circuit <b>26</b> differs from that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In other words, CMOS inverters <b>40</b> and <b>50</b> are used instead of the inverters <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> formed of bipolar transistors. Furthermore, CMOS inverters can also be applied to the circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The inverters <b>40</b> and <b>50</b> have a circuit configuration described below. In other words, the gate of the P-channel MOS transistor <b>13</b> and the gate of the N-channel MOS transistor <b>15</b> are connected to the resistor <b>3</b> and the capacitor <b>2</b>. In addition, the drain of the P-channel MOS transistor <b>13</b> and the drain of the N-channel MOS transistor <b>15</b> are connected to the gate of the P-channel MOS transistor <b>14</b> and the gate of the N-channel MOS transistor <b>16</b>.
