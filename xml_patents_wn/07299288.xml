<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates in general to a method and system for multiple login contexts. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for enabling concurrent security connections in a heterogeneous network.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A user may access different networks to retrieve and send information based upon the task at hand. The user may access different networks within his company, especially if the company is large and covers multiple geographic areas. Even though the company may strive to have similar networks throughout the individual business areas, this may be difficult to accomplish in cases where a company purchases another company and attempts to integrate the two networks. The user may also access networks external to his company. For example, an engineer may be designing a system using a vendor's device. The engineer may access proprietary technical notes that are located on the vendor's network through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or other secure network.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A network may have varying degrees of logon complexity based on the security needs of the network. For example, a network that includes highly sensitive information may have a very complex login requirement which may include the use of biometric inputs and the use of dynamic encryption cards that synchronize random numbers with login servers at various points in time. A second network in the same company that does not include sensitive information may have a very simple login requirement, such as simply entering a user id and password. Each network may also have specific login security requirements. For example, one network may have a password requirement length of five alpha characters and another network may have a password requirement of eight characters in which two of them are numeric.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Networks may require a dynamic login method for user's logging in from a remote location in order to have an additional level of security. For example, the network may require that the user enter a number based on a pseudo-random code that changes numbers at specific time intervals, such as with an ACE™ card. The probability that a user encounters a unique logon requirement increases when the user accesses external networks. As mentioned before, some networks may require the contemporaneous entry of biometric information, such as the user's fingerprint or retina scan.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A challenge found in the current art is securely managing the different user id's and different passwords a user configures to access multiple networks. The user may not want to write down his user id's and passwords for security risk reasons. Logging on to many different networks during the workday is also time consuming and cumbersome. While a user may store login information in a secure place, such as an encrypted file on the user's computer, the repeated retrieval and maintenance of the information is troublesome.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, login security requirements are essential and may not be avoided. Login security requirements protect the network from malicious clients wanting to compromise or disrupt the network. What is needed, therefore, is a way to ensure a level of network security while providing a convenient means for client login in a heterogeneous network.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It has been discovered that by using a table of active credentials associated with various domains, clients may concurrently login to different security domains and conveniently maintain multiple associations with multiple servers.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A client maintains an association table that includes a list of active credentials. An active credential includes information such as user id and password information relating to a given domain. Each active credential corresponds to a domain that the client accesses. When the client requests access to a network resource or a domain, the client's computer system retrieves the corresponding active credential from the association table and sends it to a server that manages the requested domain. The server verifies the login information, and grants access for the requested network resource or a domain to the client.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A client may request access to a network resource or a domain that does not have an existing active credential stored in the association table. An active credential manager monitors the login exchanges between the client and the server that manages the requested domain. The active credential manager creates a new active credential associated with the requested domain and stores the login exchange information in the new active credential for future access requests.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Some situations may require the user to enter a dynamic data input for increased security reasons. For example, a user may log in to a domain from a remote location and the user may need to use an ACE™ card that shows a changing pseudo-random code. The active credential associated with this configuration includes a dynamic data description that specifies the user interface requirements in order to obtain the dynamic data during the log on sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations, and omissions of detail; consequently, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other aspects, inventive features, and advantages of the present invention, as defined solely by the claims, will become apparent in the non-limiting detailed description set forth below.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The following is intended to provide a detailed description of an example of the invention and should not be taken to be limiting of the invention itself. Rather, any number of variations may fall within the scope of the invention which is defined in the claims following the description.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram of a client accessing multiple resources. Client <b>100</b> accesses resource <b>145</b>, resource <b>175</b>, and resource <b>195</b> within domain A <b>130</b>, domain B <b>160</b>, and new domain <b>185</b>, respectively. Client <b>100</b> has active credentials corresponding to Domain A <b>130</b> and Domain B <b>160</b> stored in association table <b>110</b>. For example, resource <b>145</b> may be a printer that client <b>100</b> frequently accesses and resource <b>175</b> may be a time card system that client <b>100</b> accesses weekly. Association table <b>110</b> is located in a non-volatile storage area, such as a computer hard drive, accessible by the client.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Client <b>100</b> requests access to resource <b>145</b> that is within domain A <b>130</b>. Client <b>100</b> retrieves an applicable active credential from association table <b>110</b> that corresponds to domain A <b>130</b>. Client <b>100</b> sends active credential <b>120</b> to server X <b>140</b> which manages domain A <b>130</b>. Server X <b>140</b> grants access for Domain A to client <b>100</b> and client <b>100</b> accesses resource <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Server X <b>140</b> may allow access of domain A <b>130</b> to client <b>100</b> for a specific period of time, or may require client <b>100</b> to send authorization information each time client <b>100</b> access resource <b>145</b>. For example, resource <b>145</b> may be a printer that client <b>100</b> accesses many times during a day. Client <b>100</b> sends active credential <b>120</b> to server X <b>140</b> each time client <b>100</b> requests to print a document. The user of client <b>100</b> may not be bothered with sending authorization information since the authorization information is included in active credential <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Client <b>100</b> requests access to resource <b>175</b> that is within domain B <b>130</b>. Client <b>100</b> retrieves an applicable active credential from association table <b>110</b> that corresponds to domain B <b>160</b>. Client <b>100</b> sends active credential <b>150</b> to server Y <b>170</b> which manages domain B <b>160</b>. Server Y <b>170</b> grants access for Domain B to client <b>100</b> and client <b>100</b> accesses resource <b>175</b>. Server Y <b>170</b> may allow access of domain B <b>160</b> to client <b>100</b> for a specific period of time, or may require client <b>100</b> to send authorization information each time client <b>100</b> access resource <b>175</b>. For example, resource <b>175</b> may be a timecard system that the user of client <b>100</b> accesses once a week to enter the amount of hours the user worked during the week. Client <b>100</b> sends active credential <b>150</b> to server <b>170</b> each time the user of client <b>100</b> requests to enter timecard information. The user of client <b>100</b> may not be bothered with sending authorization information since the authorization information is included in active credential <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another embodiment, client <b>100</b> may be accessing domain B <b>160</b> from a remote location. Domain B may require a higher level of security for remote clients. An ACE™ card may be used that provides a changing pseudo-random code that a user may enter into active credential <b>150</b>. In addition to the other authorization information sent within active credential <b>150</b>, server Y <b>170</b> verifies that the pseudo-random code matches a pseudo-random code maintained by server Y <b>170</b> that corresponds to the client's userid. After authorization is complete, server Y <b>170</b> grants access to client <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Client <b>100</b> requests access to resource <b>195</b>. Client <b>100</b> accesses association table <b>110</b> and determines that an active credential is not defined that corresponds to new domain <b>185</b>. For example, domain <b>185</b> may be a vendor's domain and resource <b>195</b> includes technical notes of a device that the vendor manufactures. Client <b>100</b> contacts Server Z <b>190</b> which manages new domain <b>185</b> and requests access to new domain <b>185</b>. Client <b>100</b> defines new active credential <b>180</b> through a login process with Server Z <b>195</b> and stores information corresponding to new active credential <b>180</b> in association table <b>110</b> for future access requests to new domain <b>185</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an association table that includes a number of active credentials. Association table <b>200</b> includes various fields that are used to allow a client access to various resources. Domain field <b>210</b> includes information about the domain that corresponds to a given resource. For example, domain field <b>210</b> shows domain A, domain B, and domain C are registered in association table <b>200</b>. Server field <b>220</b> includes information about a server that controls the corresponding domain. For example, server X, server Y, and server Z correspond to domain A, domain B, and domain C, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">User id field <b>230</b> includes an applicable user id that allows the client to access the corresponding server. For example, JOHND, JDOE, and JOHNDOE are the user id's that correspond to server X, server Y, and server Z, respectively. Password field <b>240</b> includes an applicable password that corresponds to the user id in the same active credential. For example, XYZ12, 1XYZ789, and XYZ789 correspond to user id's JOHND, JDOE, and JOHNDOE, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Dynamic data field <b>250</b> includes information about dynamic information required for a given active credential. For example, active credential <b>260</b> requires users to enter dynamic data information corresponding to dynamic data description <b>270</b>. Data description <b>270</b> may inform the user to enter a pseudo-random code on his ACE™ card in order to access domain C.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Token field <b>280</b> includes additional security information, such as key <b>283</b> and security data structure <b>286</b>. Key <b>283</b> may include a shared private key or a public key/private key (i.e., a private key used to authenticate the client with a message deciphered by a server using the client's public key, or a public key corresponding to the server that is used to authenticate the server).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Host name field <b>290</b> can include an address of a host computer system. Examples of host computer system addresses include IP address <b>293</b> and string name <b>296</b> which each identify a host computer by an address. The host name can be used for delegation whereby a server computer system uses association table <b>200</b> in order to act on behalf of a client computer system (i.e., the client computer system delegates the server to perform certain actions that require the server to access one or more computer resources for which client authentication information is required).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart showing resources being accessed using active credentials. Processing commences at <b>300</b>, whereupon a resource request is received from user <b>315</b> (step <b>310</b>). Association table <b>325</b> is searched to find an active credential that matches the requested resource (step <b>320</b>). A determination is made as to whether an active credential is retrieved that is applicable to the requested resource (decision <b>330</b>). If the active credential is not applicable, decision <b>330</b> branches to “No” branch <b>332</b> whereupon a new active credential is defined (pre-defined process block <b>335</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> for further details). On the other hand, if the active credential is applicable, decision <b>330</b> branches to “Yes” branch <b>338</b> whereupon a determination is made as to whether the active credential has dynamic field requirements (decision <b>340</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">If the active credential has dynamic field requirements, decision <b>340</b> branches to “Yes” branch <b>342</b> whereupon the dynamic field is processed (pre-defined process block <b>345</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> for further details). On the other hand, if the active credential does not have dynamic field requirements, decision <b>340</b> branches to “No” branch <b>348</b> bypassing the dynamic input processing. After the security information has been gathered, a thread is created using the active credential that connects the user to the requested resource using the retrieved security information (step <b>350</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A determination is made as to whether the user requests more resources (decision <b>360</b>). If the user requests more resources, decision <b>360</b> branches to “Yes” branch <b>362</b> which loops back to receive another resource request. This looping continues until there are no more resource requests, at which point decision <b>360</b> branches to “No” branch <b>368</b>. The resources are used at step <b>370</b>. When the resources are no longer used, the resources are disconnected from the client's computer system at step <b>380</b>, and processing ends at step <b>390</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart showing a new active credential being created. Processing commences at <b>400</b>, whereupon a new active credential entry is created in association table <b>450</b>. Authorization data is retrieved during an authorization session between client <b>425</b> and server <b>430</b> (step <b>420</b>). Authorization data may include a user id, a password, a server name, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A determination is made as to whether the retrieved authorization data includes dynamic data. For example, the retrieved authorization data may request that the user enter a pseudo-random code or a biometric signature, such as a finger print scan. If the authorization data does not include dynamic data, decision <b>440</b> branches to “No” branch <b>442</b> whereupon the retrieved authorization data is stored in the corresponding active credential located within association table <b>450</b> (step <b>445</b>). On the other hand, if the authorization data is dynamic, decision <b>440</b> branches to “Yes” branch <b>448</b> whereupon the dynamic data is described (step <b>460</b>). For example, the dynamic data description may include the properties for a user interface to prompt the user for dynamic data, such as a pseudo-random code or a finger print scan. The dynamic data description is stored in association table <b>450</b> at step <b>470</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A determination is made as to whether there is more authorization data to retrieve (decision <b>480</b>). If there is more authorization data, decision <b>480</b> branches to “Yes” branch <b>482</b> which loops back to retrieve more authorization data. On the other hand, if there is not more authorization data, decision <b>480</b> branches to “No” branch <b>488</b> whereupon the new active credential is stored in association table <b>450</b> (step <b>490</b>), and processing returns at <b>495</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart showing dynamic input being received and stored with an active credential. Dynamic input processing commences at <b>500</b>, whereupon the active credential associated with a resource request is retrieved from association table <b>520</b> (step <b>510</b>). A user interface is constructed corresponding to the type of dynamic input required (step <b>530</b>). For example, the user interface may ask the user to enter a pseudo-random code that is shown on his personalized ACE™ card. Biometric technology may also be used whereby the user interface may request the user to place his thumb on a thumb print scanner.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Processing prompts user <b>550</b> for the dynamic input at step <b>540</b>. The dynamic input is received from user <b>550</b> (step <b>560</b>), and is stored in an active credential that is associated with the requested resource (step <b>570</b>). Using the example above, the thumbprint scanner digitizes the user's thumbprint and stores the digitized sample in the corresponding active credential.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A determination is made as to whether there is more dynamic data to corresponding to the active credential (decision <b>580</b>). If there is more dynamic data to describe, decision <b>580</b> branches to “Yes” branch <b>582</b> which loops back to select the next dynamic data description (step <b>585</b>). This looping continues until there is no more dynamic data to describe, at which point decision <b>580</b> branches to “No” branch <b>588</b>. Processing returns at <b>590</b>.</p>
