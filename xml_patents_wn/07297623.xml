<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to stacked poly-metal structures in semiconductor devices and to processes related to the formation of such structures. The present invention is particularly relevant to the wordline architecture of a DRAM cell, but is also related in a more general sense to the gate conductor architecture of a transistor. The present invention arises from the continuing need in the art for improvements to the materials and processes utilized in semiconductor device fabrication.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many conductors are particularly well suited for use in semiconductor devices. For example, tungsten and other metals are often used as a part of the wordline architecture of a DRAM cell. Unfortunately, many of these otherwise preferable conductors are also difficult to incorporate in certain device architecture because they are subject to severe degradation during the oxidation steps commonly utilized to construct many semiconductor devices. A number of processing techniques can limit this type of degradation. For example, in the context of the wordline architecture of a DRAM cell, manufacturing steps directed to the formation of oxidation barrier layers are introduced to protect the conductors of the wordline architecture from oxidation. The present invention is directed to improving these manufacturing steps by providing an etch stop layer in a silicon substrate of a semiconductor device. More specifically, the present invention is directed to improving manufacturing steps by providing an etch stop layer in a silicon substrate over which the wordline architecture of a DRAM cell is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a method of interfacing a poly-metal stack and a semiconductor substrate is provided where an etch stop layer is provided in a polysilicon region of the stack. The present invention also addresses the relative location of the etch stop layer in the polysilicon region and a variety of stack materials and oxidation methods. The etch stop layer may be patterned within the poly or may be a continuous conductive etch stop layer in the poly. The present invention also relates more broadly to a process for forming wordline architecture of a memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a semiconductor structure is provided comprising a poly-metal stack formed over a semiconductor substrate where the interface between an oxidation barrier placed over the stack and an oxidized portion of the stack lies along the sidewall of the poly-metal stack. A semiconductor structure is also provided where a conductive layer is present in the poly region of the poly-metal stack. The present invention also relates more broadly to a memory cell array and a computer system including the poly-metal stack of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide for improvements to the materials and processes utilized in semiconductor device fabrication. Other objects of the present invention will be apparent in light of the description of the invention embodied herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, a method of interfacing a poly-metal stack <b>100</b> and a semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. Initially, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a multi-layer poly-metal structure is formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>102</b>. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art of semiconductor fabrication, a variety of components may be utilized to form a poly-metal structure for use in a memory device. In the illustrated embodiment, the poly-metal structure initially includes a gate dielectric or other oxide layer <b>106</b>, a polysilicon layer or region <b>108</b>, a barrier layer <b>110</b>, a metal layer <b>112</b>, typically tungsten, and a silicon dioxide layer <b>114</b>. Conventional isolation regions <b>104</b> are also illustrated. The oxide layer <b>106</b> typically comprises a silicon dioxide layer. The present invention is particularly advantageous in the context of tungsten-based metal layers <b>112</b> because it relates to a process by which the metal layer may be shielded from oxidation in a precise manner.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an etch stop layer <b>122</b> is formed in the polysilicon region <b>108</b> of the poly-metal structure with the aid of a masking layer <b>120</b>. The etch stop layer <b>122</b> may be formed through ion implantation of oxygen or nitrogen, to form a SiOx or a SiNx etch stop layer <b>122</b> in the polysilicon region <b>108</b>. The patterned etch stop layer <b>122</b> may also be formed through implantation of carbon, fluorine or any other suitable material capable of forming an etch stop layer in cooperation with polysilicon. It is noted that the polysilicon region <b>108</b> is typically doped to render it conductive. It is also noted that the etch stop layer <b>122</b> is described herein as patterned in the sense that it forms a non-continuous layer relative to the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, portions of the poly-metal structure extending from an upper surface <b>124</b> of the poly-metal structure to the etch stop layer <b>122</b> are removed to form a partial poly-metal stack <b>101</b> including an exposed metal region <b>112</b>′ along a sidewall of the stack <b>101</b>. Portions of the polysilicon layer <b>108</b>, the barrier layer <b>110</b>, and the silicon dioxide layer <b>114</b> are also exposed along the sidewall of the stack <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Next, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the exposed metal region <b>112</b>′ is covered with an oxidation barrier layer or sidewall spacer <b>115</b>. The barrier layer <b>115</b> may comprise a nitride, an oxide, or a layer of oxide and a layer of nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Finally, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the etch stop layer <b>122</b>, or at least portions thereof, are removed to expose a region of the oxide layer <b>106</b> along the sidewall, forming a full poly-metal stack <b>100</b>. The poly-metal stack <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> are interfaced by subjecting the exposed regions of the oxide layer <b>106</b> and the polysilicon layer <b>108</b> to an oxidation process. The oxidation process forms an oxidized layer <b>118</b> along the exposed oxide and polysilicon regions. The oxidized layer <b>118</b> and the oxidation barrier layer <b>115</b> interface along the sidewall at a boundary <b>117</b> defined between upper and lower polysilicon regions <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B of the polysilicon layer <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The position of the etch stop layer <b>122</b> can be controlled with great precision. The position of the boundary <b>117</b> is a direct function of the position of the etch stop layer <b>122</b> and defines specific operating characteristics of the associated semiconductor device. Accordingly, the process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> is particularly advantageous in large scale, multi-cell semiconductor device manufacture because operational uniformity across the entire device may be optimized by controlling the point at which the boundary <b>117</b> lies along the sidewall of the stack <b>100</b> with great precision.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref> is similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> with the exception that the etch stop layer <b>122</b> is formed as a continuous layer of conductive material in the polysilicon layer <b>108</b>. The continuous layer may be formed by providing the polysilicon layer <b>108</b> in a plurality of structural layering steps and forming the etch stop layer <b>122</b> in the polysilicon region through an intermediate layering step. The conductive etch stop layer <b>122</b> may be formed from silicon and germanium or any other material or combination of materials suitable for use as a conductive etch stop layer. The dopant present in the polysilicon region <b>108</b> of the poly-metal structure may be used to form the conductive etch stop layer <b>122</b> by forming the etch stop layer <b>122</b> of a material that will accept transfer of a quantity of the dopant from the polysilicon region <b>108</b> to the etch stop layer <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Conventional CMOS integrated circuits utilizing clad silicide on moats suffer from potential leakage paths along the sidewall surface of the etched polysilicon gates, a region where the electrical field strength is high due to enhanced electric field lines at the edge of the polysilicon conductor. Many types of semiconductor devices, such as DRAMs and EPROMs minimize this problem by oxidizing the gate polysilicon after the gate etch to form a high quality interface at the edge of the polysilicon. Enhanced oxidation under the gate edge is often referred to as the smile effect. The irregular shape of the oxidized layer <b>118</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 9</figref> is intended to highlight the smile effect.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the context of the present invention, the poly-metal stack <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> of the present invention may be interfaced through selective or non-selective oxidation. Preferably, the poly-metal stack <b>100</b> and the semiconductor substrate are interfaced through oxidation by O<sub>2</sub>; H<sub>2</sub>O ; H<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O; H<sub>2 </sub>and O<sup>−</sup>; H<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2</sub>; H<sub>2 </sub>and activated O<sub>2</sub>; H<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>3</sub>; or combinations thereof. The oxidants may be accompanied by argon or helium. H<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O oxidants may be derived from catalytic conversion of H<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2</sub>. Activated O<sub>2 </sub>may be derived through activation by a remote plasma unit.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For the purposes of describing and defining the present invention, it is noted that an etch stop layer formed “in” the polysilicon region may be formed at a surface of the polysilicon region or within the polysilicon region between its upper and lower surfaces. A layer formed “at” a surface of a region may be formed directly on the surface or may be partially embedded in the region so as to define a portion of the surface of the region. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>, the etch stop layer <b>122</b> is formed within the polysilicon layer <b>108</b>. It should be further noted that, for the purposes of defining and describing the present invention, “on” a substrate or layer denotes formation in contact with the surface of the substrate or layer and “over” a substrate or layer denotes formation above or in contact with the surface of the substrate or layer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 12</figref>, it is noted that the etch stop layer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref> may be formed at an upper surface of the polysilicon region <b>108</b>. Similarly, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</figref>, the etch stop layer <b>122</b> may be formed at a lower surface of the polysilicon region <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For the purposes of defining and describing the present invention, it is noted that a poly-metal structure comprises a structure that includes a polysilicon region and a metal region. The poly-metal structure may include materials or regions in addition to the polysilicon region and the metal region. The polysilicon region may be doped or undoped and the metal region may be a pure metal, e.g. tungsten, or a metal-based material, e.g., tungsten, a tungsten-containing alloy, tungsten nitride, tungsten silicide, etc. As is noted above, a variety of components may be utilized to form a poly-metal structure for use in a memory device according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>10</b>-<b>13</b>, the poly-metal structure comprises a gate dielectric or other oxide layer <b>106</b>, a polysilicon layer or region <b>108</b>, a barrier layer <b>110</b>, a metal layer <b>112</b>, and a silicon dioxide layer <b>114</b>. However, it is noted that a variety of additional poly-metal structures fall within the scope of the present invention. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the silicon dioxide layer <b>114</b> may be replaced by a layer <b>114</b>′ of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>or any other suitable material. Similarly, the barrier layer <b>110</b>, which may comprise tungsten nitride, tungsten silicide, tungsten silicide nitride, titanium nitride, titanium silicide nitride, and combinations thereof may be replaced by one or more alternative layers or may be accompanied by additional layers of different materials.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, for example, the metal layer <b>112</b> may comprise tungsten and the barrier layer <b>110</b> may comprise tungsten nitride or tungsten silicide nitride. Alternatively, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a titanium nitride layer <b>111</b> may be provided between the polysilicon layer <b>108</b> and a tungsten nitride layer <b>110</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, it is noted that the metal layer <b>112</b> may comprise tungsten and the barrier layer may comprise a titanium nitride layer <b>111</b> or a titanium nitride layer <b>111</b> in combination with a titanium silicide nitride layer <b>113</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the poly-metal structure may be formed such that the metal layer <b>112</b> comprises tungsten and the barrier layer comprises tungsten silicide nitride <b>110</b> formed over tungsten silicide <b>109</b>. Finally, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, it is noted that a barrier layer <b>110</b>, e.g., tungsten nitride, may be interposed between a pair of metal layers <b>112</b>, e.g., tungsten. In many instances, a tungsten nitride layer may be interposed between the tungsten layer <b>112</b> and the barrier layer <b>110</b>.</p>
