<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Any issues associated with manufacture of a part are identified and highlighted on a part model. A software method and system then uses motion of the part model for communicating the manufacturability issues to the customer. The motion can include a repositioning of a part rendering to a preferred orientation position, a fly-around so the customer can appreciate the next zoom location, and then a zooming in on the issue desired to be shown. Alternatively or in conjunction with the zooming and fly-around motion, the orientation of the part rendering showing the manufacturability issues can be three-dimensionally manipulated such as with a click-drag-drop command of the customer's computer mouse. By adding a moveable aspect to the communication, customers can much better understand which changes are recommended or required of the part.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to software supported methods, systems and tools used in the design and fabrication of molds for custom plastic parts, and in presenting information to customers for the customer to make selections to help minimize the cost of the mold and running the customer's part.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Injection molding, among other types of molding techniques, is commonly utilized to produce plastic parts from molds. Companies and individuals engaged in fabricating molds are commonly referred to as “moldmakers.” The moldmaking art has a long history of fairly gradual innovation and advancement. Molds are designed pursuant to a specification of the part geometry provided by a customer; in many cases, functional aspects of the plastic part also need to be taken into account. Historically, moldmaking involves at least one face-to-face meeting between the moldmaker and the customer, with complex communication between the moldmaker and the customer and complex decisions made by the moldmaker regarding the construct of the mold. More recently, this process has been automated to a significant degree, to assist in transmitting information between the moldmaker and/or the moldmaker's computer system and the customer, thereby realizing significant efficiencies and corresponding price reductions in the manufacture of molds and custom molded parts.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such automation is described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11/338,052, 11/114,893, 11/074,388, 11/035,648, 10/970,130, 10/325,286 (now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,836,699), and 10/056,755 (now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,701,200).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While this automation has greatly improved the process of identifying manufacturability issues, communicating those issues to the customer and quoting manufacture of the mold and/or part, problems still remain. One particular remaining problem is a difficulty of customers in understanding where on a part a particular problem or needed change is located. With the face-to-face meetings between the moldmaker and the customer of the prior art, customers and moldmakers could work through the communication issues with pointing or similar gestures, on-the-fly sketches, and give-and-take dialogue characteristic of face-to-face communication. To automate the process so no moldmaker-customer face-to-face meeting is necessary, clear communication is vitally important. Sometimes the identified problem or needed change is on a small detail of the part. Sometimes the change is only well shown on an unusual viewing angle. Clearer methods of communication between the moldmaker and the customer are needed, particularly when communicating small details or unusual viewing angles. The clearer methods of communication should permit transmission via computer and without real-time face-to-face personal interaction.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is a software method and system for communicating manufacturability issues, which is particularly applicable to a customer's part to be injection molded. Rather than communicate solely using fixed images and text, the present invention utilizes motion of a part model in explaining what changes or adjustments should be made to the part to increase part quality, reduce injection molding expenses or make injection molding possible. In one aspect, portions of the part model are highlighted, and a flight pattern is provided which first shows the customer a recognizable orientation of the part and then flies to show the issue location. In another aspect, the part model provided to the customer is user manipulatable such as with a click-drag-drop command of the customer's computer mouse. By adding a moveable aspect to the communication, customers can much better understand which changes are recommended or required of the part.</p>

In all cases, this disclosure presents the illustrated embodiments of the present invention by way of representation and not limitation. Numerous other minor modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art which fall within the scope and spirit of the principles of this invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exemplary part <b>10</b> for discussion purposes of the inventive way to communicate issues associated with the manufacture of that part <b>10</b>. In this example, the part <b>10</b> is a “cam” part custom designed by a customer named John One. In part because the cam <b>10</b> is custom-designed (i.e., not a staple article of commerce) by or for this particular customer, the cam <b>10</b> includes numerous features, none of which have commonly accepted names. Without commonly accepted names for these features, verbal communication about changes to one or more features of the cam part <b>10</b> is difficult. The present invention is particularly contemplated as a better way to communicate changes or injection molding requirements of the part.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The quoting of the mold and/or manufacture for the part <b>10</b> may generally proceed with automated systems and methods such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/338,052, 11/114,893, 11/074,388, 11/035,648, 10/970,130, 10/325,286 (now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,836,699), and 10/056,755 (now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,701,200), all incorporated by reference herein. In these applications, a basic step is receiving customer part data comprising a CAD file for the part <b>10</b> to be molded, with the CAD file defining a part surface profile. The part <b>10</b> is custom designed by or for the customer, and its shape is unknown at the time the computer system housing the invention and software of the invention is finalized.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">While the software analysis of the customer's CAD file may be a stand-alone feature offered on a website or provided in other ways to the customer, in this example the context of receiving the customer's CAD file is that John One requested a quote, i.e., John One is interested in learning how much it would cost to injection mold twenty-five cams <b>10</b> for testing. John One provided his CAD file and filled out various menu fields associated with the requested quotation, including his name <b>12</b> and the part name <b>14</b>, how many cavities <b>16</b> will be included on the mold block, surface finishes <b>18</b> on the A-side and B-side of the mold, how many samples <b>20</b> are desired, the delivery time <b>22</b> in which the samples are needed, and the material <b>24</b> which will be used in injection molding the part <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this example, the software analysis of the customer's CAD file has identified several issues associated with manufacture of the cam part <b>10</b>. For instance, the cam part <b>10</b> may have failed one or more criteria established in a geometry analyzer module. In this example, the analysis of the customer's CAD file has identified two “Required Changes” issues <b>26</b> which require significant changes to the part shape, three “Moldability Advisory” issues <b>28</b> which do not require changes to the part shape but are alerts, and three items of other information <b>30</b> of which the customer should be advised. After the issues are identified, the next step is to communicate those issues to the customer. Because the CAD file was submitted to obtain a quote but the part <b>10</b> failed the computer analysis, the issues are communicated to the customer on a quote response form <b>32</b> which advises the customer that changes are required. The quote response form <b>32</b> accordingly does not provide the customer with pricing for manufacture of the mold and/or manufacture of the parts <b>10</b>, and includes blanks <b>34</b> for the pricing information.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">One preferred way of communicating the issues to the customer is through a real time responsive website. However, delays in analysis, or performing portions of the analysis with moldmaker/operator input may require a slower form of communication. For example, the quote form information <b>32</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-10</figref> could be provided via an e-mail, on a mailed or hand-delivered storage medium such as a disk, or through a delayed transmission of a link to a website server. The preferred embodiment has been tested and implemented to operate using a WINDOWS operating system utilizing an INTERNET EXPLORER internet browser, with .NET FRAMEWORK 2.0 and MANAGED DIRECTX FOR MICROSOFT .NET 2.0 components as well as viewer software installed on the customer's computer, with such components being deliverable for self-extracting installation via an internet connection. Regardless of the way in which the information is delivered to the customer, the information of the present invention is always delivered via computer and viewed on a computer.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention will be described with regard to two “Required Changes” issues requiring correction of the customer's CAD file before the quotation procedure can continue. In this example, one of the rotation pins <b>36</b> in the circular opening <b>38</b> had insufficient draft, and one of the edges <b>38</b> of the 60° corner hole <b>42</b> had an inadequate radius. It would be nearly impossible to communicate these failures to the customer, in a way that the customer would quickly understand and appreciate how to make changes to the part <b>10</b> to correct the failures, using strictly verbal communication. In Applicant's prior art system, the information was communicated using static images which showed the locations of failure highlighted with color or otherwise identified so the customer would see where the changes were needed. However, even with such images, customers may have difficulty appreciating where the changes need be made, particularly if the changes are relatively small. The present invention adds motion to the images so the customer can better identify the areas requiring change.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown at the bottom of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and better in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> after the customer has clicked on the scroll bar <b>44</b> with a mouse pointer <b>46</b>, the various issues may be provided on a viewing screen area <b>48</b>. In the preferred embodiment, separate tabs are provided for the “Required Changes” <b>26</b>, “Moldability Advisory” <b>28</b> and “Other Info” <b>30</b>. When the customer clicks on any of these tabs <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, the customer is provided with an active view area <b>48</b> above and text <b>50</b> below for each of the issues identified. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the default first screen for the active view area <b>48</b> is the first identified issue requiring change to the customer's CAD file, that of the rotation pin <b>36</b> requiring additional draft. The active view area screen <b>48</b> shows this issue on the portion of the part <b>10</b> affected in large size.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The second identified issue has to do with a minimum radius at a corner <b>40</b> of the part <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-9</figref> show a sequence disclosing what happens in the preferred embodiment when the customer clicks on a view button <b>52</b> indicating that the customer wants to view the second identified issue.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Upon clicking the view button <b>52</b>, the active view area <b>48</b> begins motion which changes the view of the part <b>10</b>, much like a flight path of a miniature flying camera. In general terms, a first set of motions provides the customer with visual cues on the part <b>10</b> so the customer can easily discern the orientation of the part <b>10</b> as shown. After sufficient orientation information is provided, a second set of motions highlights and enlarges the selected issue in the active view area <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a first time step in the flight path, which is generally changing the size (zoom), and possibly position (pan) of active view area <b>48</b> from the initial screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In the preferred embodiment, this involves zooming to a position that shows at least a majority, if not the entirety, of the part <b>10</b>. In the analysis of moldability, x-, y- and z-axes for the part <b>10</b> were determined. The axes of the part <b>10</b> may be determined by hand or as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,836,699 and 6,701,200 or otherwise through software analysis to best match the way the part <b>10</b> will be formed in the injection mold. The preferred “orientation position” is one with the z-axis directed upward, with 0° slant but tilted 30° toward the viewer. Additionally, the preferred orientation position places a center of the part <b>10</b> in the center of the active view area <b>48</b>. This can be easily done in the software by selecting/positioning the intersection of the x-, y- and z-axes in the center of the part <b>10</b> and using the intersection of the x-, y- and z-axes as a center of rotation <b>54</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the intersection of the x-, y- and z-axes and the center of rotation <b>54</b> are shown on the part <b>10</b> with a center of rotation symbol <b>56</b>. The preferred center of rotation symbol <b>56</b> is a set of arrows that show the x-, y- and z-axes of the part <b>10</b>. Each of the arrows may be displayed in different colors or otherwise labeled so the viewer can identify which axis is which. The preferred placement of the center of rotation <b>54</b> is at or near the center of the part <b>10</b>, but on a face (and more preferably on an edge of the part <b>10</b> where two faces intersect) rather than internal to the part <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the center of rotation symbol <b>56</b> in this position. Placing the center of rotation <b>54</b> on a surface of the part <b>10</b> rather than in the interior of the part or at some imaginary location which is off the part helps the flight path achieve an intuitive look and feel to so users can more easily understand the viewpoint being shown. Once the z-axis is so directed and positioned, the preferred initial “orientation position” does not require any further rotation of the x- and y-axes: any position of the x-axis and y-axis is considered sufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Because the first identified issue showed an image which had the z-axis generally directed upward (0° slant) at a tilt angle close to 30° the flight path from the initial view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to the initial orientation position is simple, merely involving zooming out while recentering. The recentering (panning) during the zoom out was only slightly to the right and about 20% of the part <b>10</b> downward. This recentering places the center of rotation symbol <b>56</b> directly at the centerline of the active view area <b>48</b>, both up and down and left and right. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes dashed lines <b>58</b> to depict this flight path from the initial screen size.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The purpose of the initial orientation position is so the user can readily identify the orientation of the part <b>10</b>. If the first identified issue had been at a different orientation other than with the z-axis directed upward (0° slant) and a 30° tilt, the “zooming back” movement of the active view area <b>48</b> would have rotated the z-axis to the preferred orientation position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the initial orientation position need not show the full extent of the part <b>10</b>, but should show enough of the part <b>10</b> that the user can readily identify the orientation of the part <b>10</b> as shown in the active view area <b>48</b>. As will be seen through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the center of rotation <b>54</b> equates to a point on the part <b>10</b> that does not move during the “fly around”, with the rest of the part <b>10</b> pivoting or rotating around the center of rotation <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The 0° slant, 30° tilt position of the z-axis provides a natural viewpoint for injection molded parts. Alternatively, the orientation position could have the z-axis directed at a different tilt or slant, or could be based upon either the x- or the y-axis of the part <b>10</b>. Because injection molded parts are most commonly viewed with the z-axis directed straight up, the preferred orientation position performs very well in communicating most issues on most parts.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> has zoomed back to a vantage point wherein the circular wall <b>60</b> conceals part of the view of the rotation pin <b>36</b> of interest in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. That is, the viewpoint (camera position) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is closer to the rotation pin <b>36</b> than the inside diameter of the circular wall <b>60</b>. During the zooming out action, the lower portion of the screen <b>48</b> appears to pass through the circular wall <b>60</b> to the viewpoint shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus, the preferred embodiment has the capability of showing viewpoints (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) which cannot be replicated on an actual part with a camera or the human eye, because no camera or eye is small enough to fit within the circular hole <b>38</b> and no camera or eye can pass through the circular wall <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Once the part <b>10</b> is shown in the active view area <b>48</b> in the orientation position, the flight path continues to a viewpoint which highlights the next (i.e., the corner radius) issue. In this example, the movement to the second issue is more complex than the movement from the first issue to the orientation position. In the preferred embodiment, the movement to the second issue starts with a fly-around shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows in dotted lines the outline <b>62</b> (shown only for descriptive purposes, not present in the actual software) of the part <b>10</b> from its location in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows in dotted lines the outline <b>64</b> (shown only for descriptive purposes, not present in the actual software) of the part <b>10</b> from its location in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The fly-around rotates the part <b>10</b> about the z-axis for an amount between 180 and 360°. Throughout this fly-around, the z-axis is held at a 0° slant, 30° tilt position, the center of rotation <b>54</b> (and the center of rotation symbol <b>56</b>) is kept in the center of the active area <b>48</b>, and the part size (zoom) is not modified. Accordingly, the fly-around takes the part <b>10</b> through a progression of view angles such that each point on the part <b>10</b> travels in a horizontal ellipse about the z-axis. The elliptical travel paths <b>66</b> of three points is mapped in dashed lines (shown only for descriptive purposes, not present in the actual software) from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> though <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>: a point <b>68</b> at the bottom of the cam <b>10</b> where the straight, 30° wall <b>70</b> meets the outer diameter of the circular wall <b>60</b>, a point <b>72</b> at the top of the cam <b>10</b> where the straight, 60° wall <b>74</b> meets the outer diameter of the circular wall <b>60</b>, and a point <b>76</b> at the bottom of the cam <b>10</b> at the corner of the 30° hole <b>77</b>. With this fly-around, the part <b>10</b> is rotated so the next issue is shown in the center of the screen <b>48</b>, in this example, directly under the z-axis. The fly-around is important so the customer can appreciate the vantage point for showing the next issue.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> depict the repositioning from the end of the fly-around to the final position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> which shows the second issue in magnified scale. In this example, the corner <b>40</b> of the second issue is quite low in the active area <b>48</b> after the fly-around. This is addressed by a zoom-out, keeping the top of the screen constant and raising the part <b>10</b> during the zoom-out. To the viewer, this appears to be a movement of the camera position backing up on a horizontal line away from the z-axis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows this zoom out in dashed lines <b>78</b>, and shows in dotted lines the outline <b>79</b> of the cam <b>10</b> as positioned in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (lines <b>78</b> and <b>79</b> both shown only for descriptive purposes, not present in the actual software).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts the zooming in on the second issue. In this example, the desired viewpoint for the second issue takes the z-axis out of the vertical orientation to a horizontal orientation. Once the camera viewpoint has backed up enough that the second issue is about halfway to the center of the screen <b>48</b> from its position after the fly-around, the zoom in also involves a pan the rest of the way downward and a rotation of the image on the screen <b>48</b> (about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the screen <b>48</b>). The extent of the active area <b>48</b> at three intermediate time steps are shown in dashed lines <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b</i>, <b>80</b><i>c </i>before the final reaching the final position <b>80</b><i>d </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When the final position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is reached, the customer readily understands the orientation of what is being shown on the part <b>10</b>, because the motion involved with the fly-around and zoom in has oriented the customer to understand what is being highlighted. Even if the customer would not readily recognize the static image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> absent motion, the viewing motion of the present invention assists the customer in understanding the issue being communicated.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once the final position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> highlighting the second issue is reached, the motion of the active view area <b>48</b> stops. In the preferred embodiment, the entire time sequence from clicking the view button <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to the stoppage of motion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) occurs quickly, such as in a time period of about 2 to 3 seconds. If the customer now clicks on “view” for the first issue, the series of motions reverses itself to play back to the first issue: first the view area zooms out and reorients the z-axis to the orientation position, does a minimum 180° fly-around to center on the selected issue, and then zooms in on the selected issue.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">If the customer clicks on the “view” button <b>52</b> for an issue already being shown, the same general process is followed: first the view area zooms out and reorients the z-axis to the orientation position, a 360° fly-around is performed, and then the view area zooms back in on the selected issue.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">If three or more issues are provided under the currently selected tab <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, then the order of showing issues is up to the viewer. For instance, clicking on the “Moldability Advisory” tab <b>28</b> in our example would present explanatory text and “view” buttons for three other issues, and clicking on the “Other Info” tab <b>30</b> in our example would present explanatory text and “view” buttons for three more issues. In each case when a “view” button <b>52</b> is selected, the view area zooms out and reorients the z-axis to the orientation position, does a minimum 180° fly-around to center on the selected issue, and then zooms in on the selected issue.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> highlights a second preferred way of using motion to communicate part issues to the customer. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, after the static image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is reached, the customer can manipulate the part rendering through a “click-drag-drop” command of the computer mouse. When the customer clicks anywhere on the active view area <b>48</b>, the customer is provided with a three-dimensional manipulation capability to reorient the part <b>10</b> as shown on the screen <b>48</b> and thereby examine the highlighting of the selected issue. The preferred three-dimensional manipulation algorithm is a portion of the graphical user interface and manipulation software disclosed in App. No. P439.12-14, incorporated by reference herein. Using this preferred three-dimensional manipulation algorithm, left clicking causes an orientation globe <b>82</b> to appear, defining a first active area <b>84</b> and a second active area <b>86</b> on the screen <b>48</b> for mouse-based manipulation of the part <b>10</b>. The preferred manipulation algorithm includes pan features based upon a right click-drag-drop command of the mouse, and includes zoom features based upon operation of a scroll wheel of the mouse. The preferred manipulation algorithm does not include any ability to highlight or color portions of the part rendering. The customer is provided with a viewer housing the preferred manipulation algorithm, which is a shorter download than the complete three-dimensional manipulation software. Alternatively, a different set of features or a complete set of features may be included with the customer download version.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When it is desired to give the customer feedback with regard to the part <b>10</b> and how well it will work for injection molding, the customer is provided with a simplified CAD file data set enabled in the simplified three-dimensional viewer. Each issue is then stored merely by recording the location (x-, y- and z-coordinates), zoom, and orientation (x-, y- and z-directions) which best show the issue. Storage of the location, zoom and orientation information can be performed either automatically by the software conducting the manufacturability criteria assessment, or by an operator selecting a position, zoom and orientation to best show each issue as identified by the manufacturability criteria assessment.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
