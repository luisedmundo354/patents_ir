<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An electric washing machine according to the present invention performs a washing process for washing laundry without the use of a detergent by generating water streams in an outer tub (<b>2</b>) containing an electrolyzed liquid produced through electrolysis by an electrolyzing device (<b>31</b>) when a zero detergent course is selected by a user. The electrolyzing device (<b>31</b>) is provided as a water treatment unit (<b>60</b>) attached to a lower portion of an outer side surface (<b>66</b>) of the outer tub (<b>2</b>), and includes a thin-box-shaped electrolyzing chamber (<b>32</b>), a pair of electrodes (<b>33</b>) supported at opposite edges thereof, and a pair of water communication paths (<b>34, 35</b>). The pair of water communication paths (<b>34, 35</b>) are disposed in a vertically juxtaposed relation to connect the outer tub (<b>2</b>) to the electrolyzing chamber (<b>32</b>) with the intervention of packings (<b>81</b>). Thus, an assembling operation and the like can conveniently be performed, and water can efficiently be electrolyzed for use in the washing process.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Electric washing machines usually perform a washing process with the use of a detergent.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is a main object of the present invention to provide an electric washing machine which is capable of washing laundry without the use of a detergent.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an electric washing machine comprising: a washing tub for containing laundry; water stream generating means for generating water streams in the washing tub; water treatment means for performing a specific treatment on tap water to be supplied into the washing tub or tap water supplied into the washing tub to impart the water with a cleaning capability without addition of a detergent; storage means which stores therein a sequence for a first washing course in which the laundry is washed by generating water streams in the washing tub which contains a detergent solution prepared by adding the detergent into the tap water, and a sequence for a second washing course in which the laundry is washed without the use of the detergent by generating water streams in the washing tub which contains a cleaning liquid imparted with the cleaning capability by treating the tap water by the water treatment means; selecting means for allowing a user to select the first washing course or the second washing course; and control means for controlling operations of the water stream generating means and the water treatment means on the basis of the sequence for the washing course selected by the selecting means to perform a washing process in the selected washing course.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More specifically, the water treatment means includes a pair of electrodes for electrolysis of the tap water, and is adapted to produce the cleaning liquid by electrolyzing the tap water through energization of the pair of electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the aforesaid arrangement, the machine preferably further comprises load detecting means for detecting a load of the laundry and information means for notifying a detergent amount according to the load detected by the load detecting means, wherein the control means actuates the load detecting means for the detection of the load and causes the information means to notify the detergent amount according to the detected load in the washing process of the first washing course, and prohibits the information means from notifying the detergent amount in the washing process of the second washing course.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The machine preferably further comprises second information means for notifying that no detergent is added, wherein the control means actuates the second information means in the washing process of the second washing course.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Alternatively, the machine preferably further comprises load detecting means for detecting a load of the laundry, and adding means for adding the detergent in an amount according to the load detected by the load detecting means, wherein the control means actuates the load detecting means for the detection of the load and causes the adding means to add the detergent in the amount according to the detected load in the washing process of the first washing course, and prohibits the adding means from adding the detergent in the washing process of the second washing course.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the aforesaid arrangements, where the first washing course is selected by the user, the water streams are generated in the washing tub containing the detergent solution (prepared by adding the detergent into the tap water) for washing the laundry in the washing process. More specifically, the load of the laundry contained in the washing tub is detected. Then, the detergent amount according to the detected load is notified (by display or voice), and the user adds a proper amount of the detergent on the basis of the notification. Alternatively, the detergent is automatically added according to the detected load.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A place where the detergent is added is, for example, the washing tub or a detergent box. That is, the place may be where the detergent is mixed with the water contained in the washing tub.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the water containing the detergent (detergent solution) is contained in the washing tub, the water streams are generated for washing the laundry. Dirt adhering to the laundry is removed by the effect of the detergent and the effect of the water streams.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Where the second washing course is selected by the user, the water streams are generated in the washing tub containing the cleaning liquid (e.g., electrolyzed liquid) produced through the treatment by the water treatment means for washing the laundry without the use of the detergent in the washing process.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">More specifically, the pair of electrodes are disposed in a space where the tap water in the washing tub can be electrolyzed, for example, in the washing tub or a chamber communicating with the washing tub. First, the water is retained in the washing tub. Then, the water in the washing tub is electrolyzed through energization of the pair of electrodes for production of the electrolyzed water as the cleaning liquid. In the electrolyzed water contained in the washing tub, the water streams are generated for washing the laundry. In this washing process, the information on the detergent amount according to the load is not given, but addition of no detergent is notified. Alternatively, the automatic addition of the detergent is not effected.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The tap water contains very small amounts of impurities such as iron, calcium, magnesium and chlorine, and the electrolysis thereof provides the following effects. That is, the electrolyzed water is neutral to alkaline. In addition, active oxygen is generated. Further, hypochlorous acid and hypochlorous ions are generated. Dirt adhering to the laundry is removed by the effect of the alkaline water, the effect of the active oxygen and the effect of the water streams. In addition, the laundry is sterilized by the effect of hypochlorous acid and hypochlorous ions.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The washing operation by the water streams may be performed during the water treatment (electrolysis), or after the water treatment. Rather than the treatment (electrolysis) of the tap water contained in the washing tub, the water treatment means (the pair of electrodes) may be provided upstream of the washing tub, so that the tap water is treated for the production of the cleaning liquid which is in turn supplied into the washing tub.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With the aforesaid arrangements, the washing course for washing the laundry without the use of the detergent can be realized, so that the amount of the detergent to be used can drastically be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, the information on the detergent amount according to the load is provided in the first washing course employing the detergent, and is not provided in the second washing course employing no detergent. Therefore, the proper amount of the detergent can be added without any excess or shortage in the first washing course, and the use of no detergent can expressly be notified to prevent the user from mistakenly adding the detergent in the second washing course employing no detergent.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the second washing course, the use of no detergent is notified, thereby assuredly preventing the user from adding the detergent.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The detergent is automatically added in an amount according to the load in the first washing course employing the detergent, and the automatic addition of the detergent is not effected in the second washing course employing no detergent. Therefore, the proper amount of the detergent can be added without any excess or shortage in the first washing course, and wasteful use of the detergent can be prevented in the second washing course employing no detergent.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an electric washing machine which is adapted to selectively effect a first washing course in which laundry is washed with the use of a detergent and a second washing course in which the laundry is washed in a manner different from the first washing course without the use of the detergent.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With the aforesaid arrangement, the washing course for washing the laundry without the use of the detergent is realized, so that the amount of the detergent to be used can drastically be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with further another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an electric washing machine comprising a water treatment unit for electrolyzing water in use for a washing process to impart the water with a cleaning capability without addition of a detergent, the water treatment unit being attached to the outside of a washing tub.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Thus, the amount of the detergent to be used can be reduced, and the water treatment unit can easily be handled from the outside of the washing tub. Therefore, a mounting operation for mounting the water treatment unit on the washing tub, a maintenance operation for the water treatment unit and a disassembling operation for recycling, for example, can be facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the aforesaid arrangement, the water treatment unit preferably includes an electrolyzing chamber, at least one pair of electrodes disposed in the electrolyzing chamber, and a pair of water communication paths extending from the electrolyzing chamber, the pair of water communication paths being connected to the washing tub, wherein the water flows into the electrolyzing chamber from the washing tub through one of the water communication paths, and the water treated in the electrolyzing chamber flows out into the washing tub through the other water communication path.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, the water treatment unit can unitarily be handled in the assembling and maintenance operations, so that these operations are further facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Since the pair of water communication paths ensure efficient water communication between the electrolyzing chamber and the washing tub, the treated water can be supplied into the washing tub for efficient use in the washing process without waste, and the water from the washing tub is caused to flow within the electrolyzing chamber for efficient electrolysis.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the aforesaid arrangement, the electrolyzing chamber preferably has a thin box shape having a smaller depth with respect to an outer surface of the washing tub, and the electrodes preferably each have a plate shape corresponding to the thin box shape of the electrolyzing chamber. The plate-shaped electrodes are preferably disposed at a predetermined inter-electrode pitch with opposite edges thereof being supported.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus, the projection of the water treatment unit from the outer surface of the washing tub can be reduced for space saving.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Since the electrodes are held at the opposite edges thereof in the box-shaped electrolyzing chamber, the water treatment unit can be handled without careful attention. Therefore, the assembling, maintenance and disassembling operations can be facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the aforesaid arrangement, the electrolyzing chamber is preferably mounted on an outer side surface of the washing tub. The one water communication path (inlet path) preferably extends from a lower portion of the electrolyzing chamber, and the other water communication path (outlet path) preferably extends from an upper portion of the electrolyzing chamber. The water communication paths are preferably connected to the washing tub with the intervention of packings.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With the use of the packings, dimensional errors can be accommodated when the water treatment unit is mounted on the washing tub, so that the mounting can easily be achieved. In addition, sealing of gaps between the water communication paths and the washing tub can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Since the pair of water communication paths are provided at different vertical positions of the thin-box-shaped electrolyzing chamber attached to the outer side surface of the washing tub, vertical water flow is facilitated for efficient electrolysis.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the aforesaid arrangement, the upper portion of the electrolyzing chamber is preferably inclined with one side thereof located at a higher position, and the outlet path preferably extends from the higher position. The inlet path preferably extends from a lower end of the electrolyzing chamber. Thus, the water flow in the electrolyzing chamber can be facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the aforesaid arrangement, an air supply port for supplying air is preferably provided at a lower portion of the electrolyzing chamber, whereby the air supplied into the electrolyzing chamber from the air supply port flows into the washing tub through the upper water communication path, and the water contained in the electrolyzing chamber is caused to flow by the air flow. Thus, the water flow in the electrolyzing chamber can be facilitated for efficient electrolysis. In addition, the air is introduced into the washing tub, thereby contributing to improvement of the cleaning capability.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the aforesaid arrangement, the air is preferably supplied without contact with the electrodes. Thus, reduction in electrolysis efficiency due to the air can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the aforesaid arrangement, the electrodes preferably each have a round corner, and a spacing between the electrodes and a spacing between each of the electrodes and the electrolyzing chamber are preferably such that lint is prevented from being caught therebetween. Thus, the lint is less liable to adhere onto the electrodes, so that reduction in electrolysis efficiency due to the lint can be prevented.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A fully automatic washing machine according to one embodiment of the present invention will hereinafter be described with reference to the attached drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side sectional view illustrating the construction of the fully automatic washing machine according to this embodiment. A bottomed cylindrical outer tub <b>2</b> is suspended in a forwardly inclined manner within a housing <b>1</b> of the washing machine by front suspension rods <b>3</b> and rear suspension rods <b>4</b> (though one front suspension rod and one rear suspension rod are shown in the figure, there are two front suspension rods and two rear suspension rods). A front upper portion of the housing <b>1</b> projects forward correspondingly to the forward projection of an upper portion of the inclined outer tub <b>2</b>. The housing <b>1</b> has a widely open front portion <b>16</b>, which is covered with a detachable front panel <b>17</b>. Therefore, an upper portion of the front panel <b>17</b> projects correspondingly to the projection of the upper portion of the outer tub <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A washing/dehydration tub (inner tub) <b>5</b> having a multiplicity of dehydration perforations formed in a circumferential wall thereof is supported within the outer tub <b>2</b> rotatably about a dehydration shaft <b>6</b> thereof. The outer tub <b>2</b> and the inner tub <b>5</b> constitute a washing tub according to the present invention. A pulsator <b>7</b> (water stream generating means) for generating water streams for agitation of laundry is disposed on an inner bottom portion of the inner tub <b>5</b>. A driving mechanism <b>10</b> for driving the pulsator <b>7</b> and the inner tub <b>5</b> is provided at the bottom of the outer tub <b>2</b>. The driving mechanism <b>10</b> includes the dehydration shaft <b>6</b>, a pulsator shaft <b>9</b> provided in the dehydration shaft <b>6</b> for rotating the pulsator <b>7</b>, a motor <b>8</b> provided coaxially with the dehydration shaft <b>6</b> and the pulsator shaft <b>9</b>, and a clutch for switchably transmitting power of the motor <b>8</b> only to the pulsator shaft <b>9</b> or to both the pulsator shaft <b>9</b> and the dehydration shaft <b>6</b>. The driving mechanism <b>10</b> principally rotates only the pulsator <b>7</b> in one direction or in opposite directions in a washing operation and a rinsing operation, and unitarily rotates the inner tub <b>5</b> and the pulsator <b>7</b> in one direction (or in a normal direction) in a dehydrating operation. The inner tub <b>5</b> is rotated once by each turn of the motor <b>8</b>. On the other hand, a reduction gear mechanism (not shown) is provided in a middle portion of the pulsator shaft <b>9</b>, so that the pulsator <b>7</b> is rotated according to a reduction radio of the reduction gear mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A water supply port <b>11</b> having a detergent container <b>11</b><i>a </i>for supplying a detergent contained therein is provided on an upper rear side of the outer tub <b>2</b>. A water supply tube <b>12</b> having a water supply valve <b>13</b> provided in a middle portion thereof is connected to the water supply port <b>11</b>. When the water supply valve <b>13</b> is opened, tap water is supplied to the water supply port <b>11</b> from an external tap through the water supply tube <b>12</b>. Thus, the tap water flows downward into the outer tub <b>2</b> from the water supply port <b>11</b>. One end of a water drainage tube <b>14</b> is connected to a front bottom portion or lowermost portion of the outer tub <b>2</b>. The water drainage tube <b>14</b> is opened and closed by a water drainage valve <b>15</b>. The other end of the water drainage tube <b>14</b> is connected to an external sewage drain through a self-standing hose not shown. The opening and closing of the water drainage valve <b>15</b> are associated with the switching of the aforesaid clutch. When a torque motor (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is not operated, the pulsator <b>7</b> is decoupled from the inner tub <b>5</b> so as to be solely rotated with the water drainage valve <b>15</b> being closed. When the torque motor is operated to pull a wire to the midst, the pulsator <b>7</b> is coupled to the inner tub <b>5</b> with the water drainage valve <b>15</b> being closed. When the wire is further pulled, the water drainage valve <b>15</b> is opened with the pulsator <b>7</b> kept coupled to the inner tub <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the washing machine according to this embodiment, the outer tub <b>2</b> and the inner tub <b>5</b> are inclined forward as described above, so that open tops of the outer tub <b>2</b> and the inner tub <b>5</b> are directed forward with respect to a vertically upward direction. That is, a center line CL of the outer tub <b>2</b> is tilted at a predetermined tilt angle α with respect to a vertical line VL. Thus, a user standing in front of the washing machine can easily view the bottom of the inner tub <b>5</b> and easily take out the laundry. A tilt angle α of about 5 degrees to about 20 degrees ensures easy take-out of the laundry, and yet suppresses the forward projection of the housing <b>1</b>. In this embodiment, the tilt angle α is set at about 10 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An electrolyzing device <b>31</b> as water treatment means is disposed on a lower portion of a circumferential wall of the outer tub <b>2</b>. The electrolyzing device <b>31</b> is provided as a unit separate from the outer tub <b>2</b>, and fixed to the outer tub <b>2</b> by screws or the like. The electrolyzing device <b>31</b> is located on a front side of the outer tub <b>2</b>, and appears when the front panel <b>17</b> is removed. This arrangement facilitates the repair and replacement of the electrolyzing device <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The electrolyzing device <b>31</b> includes an electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> provided separately from the outer tub <b>2</b>, a pair of electrodes <b>33</b> disposed in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>, an upper water communication path <b>34</b> connecting an upper portion <b>69</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> to the outer tub <b>2</b>, and a lower water communication path <b>35</b> connecting a lower portion of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> to the outer tub <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The pair of electrodes <b>33</b> include a first electrode <b>33</b><i>a </i>and a second electrode <b>33</b><i>b</i>. The first electrode <b>33</b><i>a </i>and the second electrode <b>33</b><i>b </i>each have a thin square plate shape. The electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is configured in a thin box shape having a smaller depth (indicated by D<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) with respect to the circumferential wall of the outer tub <b>2</b>. The first electrode <b>33</b><i>a </i>and the second electrode <b>33</b><i>b </i>are disposed in predetermined spaced relation in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> with surfaces thereof facing toward the circumferential wall of the outer tub. This arrangement suppresses the projection of the electrolyzing device <b>31</b> provided on the circumferential surface of the outer tub <b>2</b>. Thus, the electrolyzing device <b>31</b> is prevented from bumping against the housing <b>1</b> when the outer tub <b>2</b> vibrates during the dehydrating operation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is also conceivable that the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> of the electrolyzing device <b>31</b> is provided integrally with the outer tub <b>2</b> and the electrodes <b>33</b> are provided inside the outer tub <b>2</b>. In this case, however, it is difficult to mount the electrodes <b>33</b> in a narrow space inside the outer tub <b>2</b> and to take out the electrodes <b>33</b> for maintenance and recycling. This is why the electrolyzing device <b>31</b> is provided as a unit, i.e., as a water treatment unit <b>60</b>, which can be mounted outside the outer tub <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The water treatment unit <b>60</b> is constructed so as to be handled unitarily in the assembling. For example, the water treatment unit has the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>, the pair of electrodes <b>33</b> disposed in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>, and the pair of water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> extending from the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>, so as to solely constitute the aforesaid electrolyzing device <b>31</b>. The electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> and the pair of water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> are integrally formed of a synthetic resin.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The water treatment unit <b>60</b> is mounted on a front lower right portion of the outer tub <b>2</b> as seen from the front side thereof in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in an open space defined between a corner of the housing <b>1</b> and the outer tub <b>2</b>. An energization circuit <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is electrically connected to the water treatment unit <b>60</b>. The energization circuit <b>30</b> has a transformer <b>61</b> and the like. The transformer <b>61</b> which typically has a greater weight is stably fixed to a highly strong front portion <b>62</b> of a right corner of the housing <b>1</b> as seen from the front side thereof. The transformer <b>61</b> may be fixed to the bottom <b>64</b> of the outer tub <b>2</b>. In this case, the vibrations of the outer tub <b>2</b> can advantageously be suppressed by utilizing the great weight of the transformer <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The water treatment unit <b>60</b> and the transformer <b>61</b> are located in the vicinity of the open portion <b>16</b> of the housing <b>1</b> and, therefore, easily accessed through the open portion <b>16</b> for an assembling operation, a maintenance operation for repair, replacement or the like, and a disassembling operation for recycling. Further, the water treatment unit <b>60</b> and the transformer <b>61</b> are closely located, so that electrical connection therebetween is easily established. Since the water treatment unit <b>60</b> and the transformer <b>61</b> are detachably fixed by screws, the aforesaid operations can advantageously be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The water treatment unit <b>60</b> and the transformer <b>61</b> are fixed at a position remote from electrical components for controlling motor rotation such as a rotation sensor <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) provided in the motor <b>8</b> and a control circuit board <b>65</b> fixed to a front left portion <b>63</b> of the housing <b>1</b> and including an invertor driving section <b>23</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), and interconnection components (not shown) connecting these components. Thus, noises caused by the transformer <b>61</b> during electrolysis can be prevented from exerting an adverse effect on the control of the rotation of the motor <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the electrodes <b>33</b> are disposed parallel to the largest face, e.g., a front face portion <b>71</b>, of the thin-box-shaped electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>, and each have a plate shape having a size corresponding to the size of the front face portion <b>71</b>. Since the electrodes <b>33</b> thus have greater areas, a requirement for the surface areas is satisfied by a minimum number of electrodes <b>33</b>. The electrodes <b>33</b> are formed of a metal, and disposed in opposed relation. The plate-shaped electrodes <b>33</b> are supported at a predetermined inter-electrode pitch with opposite sides of plate faces thereof or opposite edges thereof being held. Opposite polarities are respectively applied to the pair of electrodes <b>33</b> for the electrolysis of the water.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The arrangement of the electrodes <b>33</b> is not limited to the pair of electrodes having the opposite polarities. For example, three electrodes <b>33</b> may be disposed in juxtaposition with plate surfaces thereof opposed to each other. Alternatively, five electrodes <b>33</b> maybe disposed in juxtaposition with plate surfaces thereof opposed to each other. In these cases, the polarities of the electrodes <b>33</b> are alternated so that each adjacent pair of electrodes <b>33</b> have opposite polarities. What is important is that at least one pair of electrodes <b>33</b> are provided. Therefore, the following description is directed to a case where one pair of electrodes <b>33</b> are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The vertically opposite edges of the electrodes <b>33</b> are held by the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>. Upper edges of the electrodes <b>33</b> are held in recesses <b>77</b> formed in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>. These recesses <b>77</b> are defined between a pair of ribs projecting inward from a top face portion <b>75</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>. Lower edges of the electrodes <b>33</b> are held by a bottom face portion <b>76</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> via terminal covers <b>85</b>. The terminal covers <b>85</b> cover the lower edges of the electrodes <b>33</b>, and seal gaps between the bottom face portion <b>76</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> and the lower edges of the electrodes <b>33</b> for prevention of accumulation of lint. The electrodes <b>33</b> may be supported at laterally opposite sides thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The inter-electrode pitch (indicated by D<b>2</b>), more specifically, a spacing (indicated by D<b>3</b>) between the electrodes <b>33</b>, is preferably not smaller than 2 mm and not greater than 5 mm, for example. If the spacing is smaller than 2 mm, the lint is liable to come into a space between the electrodes <b>33</b> and adhere on the electrodes, thereby reducing the electrolysis efficiency and the durability. If the spacing is greater than 5 mm, application of a higher voltage is required for maintaining the electrolysis efficiency at a high level, making practical construction difficult. With a spacing of not smaller than 2 mm and not greater than 5 mm, a practically high durability and a high electrolysis efficiency can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It is conceivable that the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is formed of a material different from the material for the outer tub <b>2</b> or, alternatively, of the same material as the outer tub <b>2</b>. In the latter case, the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> can easily be handled for recycling thereof. For example, the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is formed of an olefin resin such as polypropylene (PP). This resin is also employed as the material for the outer tub <b>2</b> to impart the outer tub with a chemical resistance to water containing agents such as a detergent and a bleaching agent. Further, addition of a reinforcing material such as glass fibers to the material for the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> advantageously suppresses reduction in the strength of the tub due to increase in water temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> has the bottom face portion <b>76</b>, the front face portion <b>71</b>, a rear face portion <b>72</b>, a right side face portion <b>73</b> and a left side face portion <b>74</b> which extend upright from the periphery of the bottom face portion <b>76</b>, and the top face portion <b>75</b>. The electrodes <b>33</b> are disposed in a space defined by the face portions <b>71</b> to <b>76</b>, and water is retained in the space. The electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is configured so as to have a smaller dimension as measured from the front face portion <b>71</b> to the rear face portion <b>72</b>. The electrodes <b>33</b> are disposed generally parallel to the front face portion <b>71</b>. The electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is constituted by a pair of vertically separable bodies <b>78</b>, <b>79</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">An upper portion <b>69</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is inclined with one side thereof located at a higher position. That is, the top face portion <b>75</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is inclined upward toward the right side thereof as seen from the front side thereof. The upper water communication path <b>34</b> extends from a part of the rear face portion <b>72</b> at the higher position. The lower water communication path <b>35</b> extends from a part of the rear face portion <b>72</b> at a lower position of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The pair of water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> are arranged generally parallel to each other in vertically juxtaposed relation. The water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> are tubes having a round section and formed integrally with the rear face portion <b>72</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>. The shape of the pair of water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> is not limited to the tubular shape, as long as spaces are defined therein for communication between the inside of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> and the inside of the outer tub <b>2</b> for water passage. It is also conceivable to provide the water communication paths separately from the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> or integrally with the outer tub <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The water flows into the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> from the outer tub <b>2</b> through the lower water communication path <b>35</b>. Water treated in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> flows out into the outer tub <b>2</b> through the upper water communication path <b>34</b>. The water is caused to flow in this manner, for example, by the water streams generated in the outer tub <b>2</b> by the rotation of the pulsator <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The way of the water flow in the pair of water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> is not particularly limited, but it is also conceivable that the water flows in a direction opposite to that described above. It is merely necessary that the pair of water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> are provided for the water inlet and the water outlet, and it is also conceivable that at least one of the water communication paths includes a plurality of water communication paths, e.g., three or more water communication paths. It is also conceivable that the pair of water communication paths are provided unitarily or as a single water communication path. For example, the single water communication path is not divided into two water communication paths for the water inlet and the water outlet, but may double as a water inlet path and a water outlet path. The following description is directed to a case where the lower water communication path <b>35</b> and the upper water communication path <b>34</b> serve as the water inlet path and the water outlet path, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the pair of water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> are connected to the outer tub <b>2</b> via packings <b>81</b>. The packings for the water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> have the same construction and, therefore, an explanation will be given only to the packing for the water communication path <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The packing <b>81</b> is a cylindrical elastic component such as composed of a rubber. The packing <b>81</b> is fitted around the water communication path <b>34</b>. The packing <b>81</b> is press-fitted in a connection port <b>67</b> formed on an outer surface <b>66</b> (circumferential wall) of the outer tub <b>2</b> externally of the outer tub <b>2</b>. The packing <b>81</b> has a long sealing distance between the tubular water communication path <b>34</b> and the connection port <b>67</b>. The packing <b>81</b> is fitted in a predetermined radially compressed manner to seal a gap between the inner circumference of the connection port <b>67</b> and the outer circumference of the water communication path <b>34</b>. The packing <b>81</b> is elastically deformable in its radial and axial directions. Thus, the packing <b>81</b> accommodates dimensional errors in the connection port <b>67</b> and the water communication path <b>34</b>. Further, the packing <b>81</b> can accommodate a dimensional difference between a pitch of the pair of water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> and a pitch of the pair of connection ports <b>67</b>. The packing <b>81</b> accommodates thermal deformation of the outer tub <b>2</b> occurring when hot water is retained in the outer tub <b>2</b>. Thus, breakage and water leakage can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Besides the cylindrical packing, an O-ring and a sheet packing may be employed as the packing <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> has a plurality of fixing portions, e.g., four fixing portions <b>80</b>, provided in the vicinity of the pair of water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> for fixing the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> to the outer tub <b>2</b> by screws. The screws <b>86</b> extending through through-holes of the fixing portions <b>80</b> are externally screwed into bosses <b>68</b> projecting from the outer surface <b>66</b> of the outer tub <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Terminals <b>84</b> of the electrodes <b>33</b> extend outward through the bottom face portion <b>76</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Even if water drops adhere on the outer surface of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> due to water condensation and overflow of the water from the washing tub, a short-circuit between the terminals <b>84</b> of the pair of electrodes <b>33</b> is less liable to occur due to the water drops. Thus, the terminals <b>84</b> can electrically be isolated from each other. Further, a separation plate <b>87</b> is provided for separating the terminals <b>84</b> of the pair of electrodes <b>33</b> from each other. The separation plate <b>87</b> prevents movement of the water drops to ensure the electrical isolation. The separation plate <b>87</b> may double as the fixing portion <b>80</b> formed integrally with the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> for reduction of the number of the components.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The water treatment unit <b>60</b> is assembled in the following manner. With the separable bodies <b>78</b>, <b>79</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> being separated from each other, the electrodes <b>33</b> are set in one <b>78</b> of the separable bodies. Then, the pair of separable bodies <b>78</b>, <b>79</b> are combined with each other, and seams thereof are sealed. Thus, the assembling of the water treatment unit <b>60</b> is completed. The water treatment unit <b>60</b> having the box-shaped electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> per se can be tested, for example, for the sealing property and the electrolysis performance thereof, before it is mounted on the outer tub <b>2</b>. Then, the pair of water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> are externally press-fitted in the connection ports <b>67</b> of the outer tub <b>2</b> with the intervention of the packings <b>81</b>. The fixing portions <b>80</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> are respectively fixed to the bosses <b>68</b> of the outer tub <b>2</b> by screws. The terminals <b>84</b> of the electrodes <b>33</b> are electrically connected to the energization circuit <b>30</b>. Further, the water treatment unit <b>60</b> can be removed from the outer tub <b>2</b> by performing the aforesaid operations in a reverse order. Thus, the maintenance operation and the disassembling operation for the recycling can be facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Since the water treatment unit <b>60</b> is thus provided on the outside of the outer tub <b>2</b>, the mounting operation for mounting the water treatment unit <b>60</b> on the outer tub <b>2</b>, the maintenance operation for the water treatment unit <b>60</b> and the disassembling operation for the recycling can easily be performed from the outside of the outer tub <b>2</b>. If the electrodes <b>33</b> were disposed between the outer tub <b>2</b> and the inner tub <b>5</b>, there would be a need for an additional space in the outer tub <b>2</b> and additional water to be retained in the space. Where the water treatment unit <b>60</b> is mounted on the outer surface of the outer tub <b>2</b>, on the other hand, the need for the additional space and the additional water is obviated.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It is herein merely necessary that the water treatment unit <b>60</b> which ensures easy implementation of the aforesaid operations is provided as a unit separate from the outer tub <b>2</b> and unitarily handled. For example, the water treatment unit <b>60</b> may include the pair of electrodes <b>33</b> and the fixing portions <b>80</b> for fixing the unit to the outer tub <b>2</b>, and be adapted to electrolyze the water in use for the washing process by its own or in cooperation with the outer tub <b>2</b> to impart the water with a cleaning capability without addition of the detergent.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The water treatment unit <b>60</b> is detachable from the outer tub <b>2</b>, so that the detaching operation can highly conveniently be performed. Where the electrodes <b>33</b> contain a precious metal, easy recycling is advantageously ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Since the water treatment unit <b>60</b> incorporates the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> and the pair of electrodes <b>33</b>, the water treatment unit <b>60</b> can unitarily be handled for the mounting and maintenance operations. Thus, these operations can further be facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Since the electrodes <b>33</b> are supported at the opposite sides thereof within the box-shaped electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>, the water treatment unit <b>60</b> can be handled without careful attention. Therefore, the assembling, maintenance and disassembling operations can further be facilitated. In addition, there is no possibility that the electrodes <b>33</b> are displaced or dislodged in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> due to the vibrations of the outer tub <b>2</b> during the dehydrating operation.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">With the packings <b>81</b> provided between the water treatment unit <b>60</b> and the outer tub <b>2</b>, dimensional errors in the outer tub <b>2</b> and the corresponding portion of the water treatment unit <b>60</b> can be accommodated by elastic deformation of the packings <b>81</b> when the water treatment unit <b>60</b> is mounted on the outer tub <b>2</b>, so that the mounting can easily be achieved. In addition, the sealing of the gap between the water treatment unit <b>60</b> and the outer tub <b>2</b> can be achieved. Therefore, bonding for the sealing can be obviated, so that labor for the assembling operation can be alleviated and the detaching and disassembling operations can be facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">By the provision of the pair of water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, the water inlet path and the water outlet path between the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> and the outer tub <b>2</b> can be separated, whereby the water is caused to efficiently flow between the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> and the outer tub <b>2</b>. Thus, the treated water can be supplied into the outer tub <b>2</b> for effective use in the washing process without wastage, so that the cleaning capability and the sterilizing capability can be enhanced. Further, the water from the outer tub <b>2</b> is caused to flow within the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> for efficient electrolysis.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The pair of water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> are spaced apart from each other, so that the treated water is prevented from flowing back into the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> immediately after flowing out of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The pair of water communication paths <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> are provided at different vertical positions of the thin-box-shaped electrolyzing chamber. <b>32</b> provided on the outer surface <b>66</b> of the outer tub <b>2</b>, so that the stagnation of the water and the trapping of air can be suppressed. Thus, the water is caused to flow vertically (in a direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for efficient electrolysis.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Where the water flows upward in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>, the provision of the upper water communication path <b>34</b> at the inclined upper portion <b>69</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> permits the water flowing upward in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> to be guided along the inclination into the upper water communication path <b>34</b> to speedily flow out, thereby facilitating the water flow. The lower water communication path <b>35</b> provided at the lower end of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> prevents the stagnation of the water in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>. This advantageously facilitates the water flow in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">It is preferred that the electrodes <b>33</b> are thus provided in a space where the water flows to ensure efficient electrolysis. It is particularly preferred that the electrodes <b>33</b> are provided in a space where the water is circulated with respect to the outer tub <b>2</b>. Thus, the use efficiency of the electrolyzed water can be enhanced. For example, it is conceivable that a circulation mechanism is provided for forcibly circulating the water by sucking the water from the outer tub <b>2</b> through an inlet thereof and discharging the water through an outlet thereof, and the electrodes <b>33</b> are provided in the circulation mechanism. The circulation mechanism may comprise a tubular water passage for water communication between an upper portion and a lower portion of the outer tub <b>2</b>, and an electric pump for causing the water to pass through the water passage. The construction of such a circulation mechanism is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-196894 and the like filed by the applicant of the present invention. Besides, a known construction for the water circulation may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Since the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> has a thin box shape having a smaller depth with respect to the outer surface of the outer tub <b>2</b>, the projection of the water treatment unit <b>60</b> from the outer surface of the outer tub <b>2</b> can be reduced. Where the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is of a thin type fitted on the outer side surface <b>66</b> as the outer surface of the outer tub <b>2</b>, for example, an increase in the size of the housing <b>1</b> is suppressed which may be required for prevention of the bump of the water treatment unit <b>60</b> against the housing <b>1</b> during the dehydrating operation as described above. Thus, space saving can be achieved. Where the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is of a thin type fitted on the bottom <b>64</b> as the outer surface of the outer tub <b>2</b>, the piping arrangement for the drainage of used water from the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> can be simplified, thereby achieving space saving.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Where the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is provided below the outer tub <b>2</b>, e.g., below the bottom <b>64</b> and the outer side surface <b>66</b>, water retained at a lower water level within the outer tub <b>2</b> can also be utilized. For example, the electrolyzing process can be started in the midst of the water supply to the outer tub <b>2</b>, so that the time required for the electrolysis can be reduced. Further, a course in which the electrolyzed water is utilized at a lower water level can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Where the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is provided on the outer side surface <b>66</b> of the outer tub <b>2</b> and the water communication path <b>35</b> is provided at the lower end of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>, the water in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is allowed to flow out into the outer tub <b>2</b> through the water communication path <b>35</b> during the water drainage from the outer tub <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">It is also conceivable that at least a part of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is formed integrally with the outer tub <b>2</b>. In this case, the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is preferably provided so as to project outward from the outer surface of the outer tub <b>2</b> or to be recessed along the inner surface of the outer tub <b>2</b>. Thus, the interior configuration of the outer tub <b>2</b> can generally properly be maintained, thereby preventing reduction in space efficiency within the outer tub <b>2</b> and increase in water consumption more than necessary. Where the inner surface of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> and the inner surface of the outer tub <b>2</b> are continuous, these inner surfaces are preferably inclined with respect to each other to facilitate the water flow between the inside of the outer tub <b>2</b> and the inside of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the meantime, the water from the outer tub <b>2</b> is often contaminated with lint. If the lint adheres on the electrodes <b>33</b>, there is a fear that the durability of the electrodes <b>33</b> and the electrolysis efficiency are reduced. Therefore, a problem associated with the lint entering into the water treatment unit <b>60</b> is solved in the following manner.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Corner portions <b>82</b> of the electrodes <b>33</b> each have an R-shape <b>83</b> (partly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Thus, the electrodes <b>33</b> have no corner edge, so that the lint is less liable to be caught on the corner portions of the electrodes <b>33</b> and easily released. Even if the lint is caught on the corner portions <b>82</b>, the lint is naturally released from the corner portion <b>82</b> by the water streams.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The R-shape <b>83</b> includes an R-shape as seen perpendicularly to the plate surface of the electrode <b>33</b>, and an R-shape as seen along the plate surface of the electrode <b>33</b>. At least some of the corner portions maybe rounded, but it is preferred that more of the corner portions, particularly, all the corner portions, are rounded.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The spacing (D<b>3</b>) between the electrodes <b>33</b> is determined so as to prevent the lint from being caught therebetween. The spacing is preferably not smaller than 2 mm, for example. If the spacing is smaller than 2 mm, the lint is liable to be caught. Further, a spacing (D<b>4</b>) between the electrode <b>33</b> and the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> may be the same as the aforesaid spacing, or zero. That is, there may be no gap between the electrodes and the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">This prevents reduction in water fluidity due to adhesion of the lint. This also prevents the lint from hindering the contact of the water with the electrodes <b>33</b>. As a result, the reduction in electrolysis efficiency due to the lint can be prevented, so that the electrolysis efficiency can be maintained at a higher level. Since the lint is permitted to enter the water treatment unit <b>60</b>, there is no need for provision of a lint filter and maintenance against the lint.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the washing machine may have an air bubble generator <b>88</b> for generating air bubbles from the bottom <b>64</b> of the outer tub <b>2</b> for enhancement of the cleaning capability. Where the air bubble generator <b>88</b> and the water treatment unit <b>60</b> are used in combination, the electrolysis can be achieved more efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The air bubble generator <b>88</b> includes an air pump <b>89</b>, an air hose <b>90</b> connected to an air outlet of the air pump <b>89</b> for air supply, and a nozzle (not shown) connected to an end of the air hose <b>90</b> for ejecting air into the outer tub <b>2</b>. When the air bubble generator <b>88</b> is actuated in the washing process, the air is ejected from the nozzle, and flows into the inner tub <b>5</b> through the perforations of the inner tub <b>5</b> to generate air bubbles below the pulsator <b>7</b>. The air bubbles are agitated by the rotating pulsator <b>7</b>, and broken into a multiplicity of minute air bubbles. When the minute air bubbles are brought into contact with the laundry, the minute air bubbles are broken to generate ultrasonic waves. At this time, shock waves within an ultrasonic range are generated, thereby promoting removal of dirt components adhering onto the laundry. Thus, the cleaning capability can be enhanced as compared with a case where air bubbles are not applied.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The air bubble generator <b>88</b> has a function as air supplying means for supplying air into the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> from a lower portion <b>70</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> in addition to the originally intended function for enhancing the cleaning capability. The air supplying means generates water streams by promoting upward water flow within the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> of the water treatment unit <b>60</b>. The air hose <b>90</b> is branched in a middle portion thereof. One branch extends to the nozzle, and the other branch is connected to the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A single air supply port <b>91</b> is provided in the lower portion <b>70</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> so as to be supplied with the air from the air hose <b>90</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A plurality of air supply ports <b>91</b> maybe provided. The air pump <b>89</b> is actuated in the electrolyzing process. The air supplied into the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> from the air supply port <b>91</b> is broken into air bubbles E, which float in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> to flow into the outer tub <b>2</b> through the upper water communication path <b>34</b> (in a direction indicated by a one-dot-and-dash line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Correspondingly, the water retained in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is caused to flow by the flow of the air (in a direction indicated by a broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Particularly, where the upper portion <b>69</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> is inclined and the water communication path <b>34</b> is located at the higher position, the air bubbles can quickly flow out of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>, so that the water flow can further be facilitated. There is no possibility that the air bubbles are trapped between the electrodes <b>33</b>. As a result, the electrolysis efficiency can be enhanced. Therefore, a voltage required to provide a predetermined electrolyzing capability can be reduced, thereby realizing reduction in size, cost and power consumption of the electrical components such as the transformer <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The air supply port <b>91</b> is disposed so as not to overlap with the electrodes <b>33</b> as seen in plan and so as not to face toward the electrodes <b>33</b>. Thus, the air can be supplied without contact with the electrodes <b>33</b>. Therefore, reduction in electrolysis efficiency due to the air can be suppressed. It is preferred that the air supply port <b>91</b> is horizontally spaced a predetermined distance from edges of the electrodes <b>33</b> in a corner of the bottom face portion <b>76</b> of the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>. The predetermined distance is a distance such as not to permit the contact of the air with the electrodes <b>33</b>, for example, 10 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The air supply port <b>91</b> and the upper water communication path <b>34</b> are disposed at diagonally opposite positions as seen from the front side. Thus, the air can flow a longer distance in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>, so that the water flow can be facilitated. The air supply port <b>91</b> and the lower water communication path <b>35</b> are disposed at laterally separate positions as seen from the front side. Thus, water present in a position remote from the lower water communication path <b>35</b> is caused to easily flow, which may otherwise have a difficulty in flowing.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Thus, the water flow in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> can be facilitated for efficient electrolysis. In addition, the air is introduced into the outer tub <b>2</b> for improvement of the cleaning capability. The aforesaid air pump <b>89</b> may be adapted to supply the air only to the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the following explanation is directed to a case where the air bubble generator <b>88</b> is not provided.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A top plate <b>18</b> is provided on a top face of the housing <b>1</b>. The top plate <b>18</b> has a laundry loading port <b>18</b><i>a </i>provided in a center portion thereof. The loading port <b>18</b><i>a </i>is covered with an openable upper lid <b>19</b>.

The course key set <b>37</b> includes a standard course key <b>38</b> for selecting a standard course, a self-arranged course key <b>39</b> for selecting a self-arranged course, a fast course key <b>40</b> for selecting a fast course, a thorough rinsing course key <b>41</b> for selecting a thorough rinsing course, and a zero detergent course key <b>42</b> for selecting a zero detergent course.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The standard course is a washing course in which a standard washing process is performed. The self-arranged course is a washing course in which a washing process is performed according to a procedure set by a user (manually set procedure). The fast course is a washing course in which a washing process time is short. The thorough rinsing course is a washing course in which a rinsing operation is thoroughly performed by increasing a rinsing operation period and the number of times of the rinsing operation. These courses employ a detergent. In these courses, water containing the detergent (detergent solution) is retained in the outer tub <b>2</b> and the laundry is washed by generating water streams by the rotation of the pulsator <b>7</b>. These courses are collectively referred to as a first washing course.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The zero detergent course employs no detergent. In this course, water retained in the outer tub <b>2</b> is electrolyzed by the electrolyzing device <b>31</b> for production of electrolyzed water, and the laundry is washed by generating water streams by the rotation of the pulsator <b>7</b>. The zero detergent course is referred to as a second washing course.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The display section <b>28</b> includes a course display section <b>43</b> for displaying a selected washing course, a detergent amount display section <b>44</b> (information means) for displaying the amount of the detergent corresponding to the load of the laundry, and a zero detergent display section <b>45</b> (second information means) for indicating addition of no detergent by lighting an LED. In the course display section <b>43</b>, LEDs <b>46</b> are provided in the vicinity of the respective course keys, and one of the LEDs corresponding to the selected washing course is lighted. In the detergent amount display section <b>44</b>, a plurality of LEDs <b>47</b> are provided in an illustration of a detergent measure cup, and a number of LEDs <b>47</b> corresponding to the amount of the detergent are lighted for indication of the detergent amount.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram illustrating the electrical construction of the fully automatic washing machine according to this embodiment. A control center is a control section <b>20</b> including a CPU, a RAM, a ROM, a timer and the like. The control section <b>20</b> is comprised of a microprocessor. An operation signal is inputted to the control section <b>20</b> from the operation section <b>21</b>. A water level detection signal is inputted to the control section from a water level sensor <b>22</b> for detecting the level of the water contained in the outer tub <b>2</b>. The control section <b>20</b> controls the rotation of the motor <b>8</b> via the invertor driving section <b>23</b>, and controls the operation of the torque motor <b>26</b> and the operation of the water supply valve <b>13</b> via a load driving section <b>25</b>. The torque motor <b>26</b> controls the operation of the clutch <b>27</b> and the operation of the water drainage valve <b>15</b> as described above. Further, the control section <b>20</b> controls the operation of the display section <b>28</b> and the operation of a buzzer <b>29</b> for notifying the end of the process and an abnormality in the process. The motor <b>8</b> is provided with a rotation sensor <b>24</b> for outputting pulse signals according to the rotation thereof, and the pulse signals are inputted to the control section <b>20</b>. The rotation sensor <b>24</b> is provided for detecting the rotation speed of the motor <b>8</b>, i.e., the rotation speed of the inner tub <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The pair of electrodes <b>33</b> are connected to an output side of the control section <b>20</b> via the energization circuit <b>30</b> including the transformer <b>61</b> and the like. When an energization signal is outputted from the control section <b>20</b>, the energization circuit <b>30</b> is actuated for energization of the pair of electrodes <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Sequences for the respective washing courses are stored in the ROM <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the control section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">When a washing course is selected by the operation of the course key set <b>37</b>, a sequence for the selected washing course is read out of the ROM <b>20</b><i>a</i>. Then, the control section <b>20</b> controls loads to be applied to the motor <b>8</b> and the like according to the sequence, and performs the washing process according to the selected washing course.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">An explanation will be given to the operation of the fully automatic washing machine having the aforesaid construction according to this embodiment. With reference to a flow chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there will first be described a case where a user selects the standard course which is a typical washing course employing a detergent.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">When the start key <b>36</b> is pressed to provide a command for the start of the washing process, the load or the amount of laundry loaded in the inner tub <b>5</b> is detected prior to the supply of water (Step S<b>1</b>). More specifically, the pulsator <b>7</b> is rotated for a short period of time, and the load is determined on the basis of a period during which the consequent inertial rotation continues. In this case, load detection means is constituted by the pulsator <b>7</b> and the control section <b>20</b>. Of course, the detection of the load is not limited to this method, but any other method may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Next, a washing water level is determined according to the detected load (Step S<b>2</b>), and a detergent amount corresponding to the load is displayed on the detergent amount display section <b>44</b> (Step S<b>3</b>). In view of the display in the detergent amount display section <b>44</b>, a user adds a proper amount of a detergent into the inner tub <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In turn, the supply of tap water is started, and the water is supplied to the determined washing water level (Steps S<b>4</b> to S<b>6</b>). Thus, a detergent solution obtained by dissolving the detergent in the tap water is contained in the outer tub <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Subsequently, the pulsator <b>7</b> is rotated at a predetermined speed in one direction or in opposite directions, whereby water streams are generated in the outer tub <b>2</b> for washing the laundry (Step S<b>7</b>). Dirt adhering to the laundry is removed by the effects of the detergent and the water streams. After a lapse of a predetermined washing period, the pulsator <b>7</b> is stopped to end the washing operation (Steps S<b>8</b>, S<b>9</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">After the washing operation is completed, a first intermediate dehydrating operation, a first rinsing operation, a second intermediate dehydrating operation, a second rinsing operation and a final dehydrating operation are sequentially performed. Thus, the washing process is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">With reference to a flow chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an explanation will be given to a case where the user selects the zero detergent course which employs no detergent.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">When the start key <b>36</b> is pressed to provide a command for the start of the washing process, the LED of the zero detergent display section <b>45</b> is lighted instead of the display in the detergent amount display section <b>44</b> (Step S<b>11</b>). Thus, the user is notified that no detergent is added.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Then, the supply of tap water is started (Step S<b>12</b>) The water is supplied to a predetermined washing water level (more specifically a lower water level) for the zero detergent course. When the water level in the outer tub <b>2</b> reaches a predetermined level which is lower than the washing water level and permits the pair of electrodes <b>33</b> of the electrolyzing device <b>31</b> to be submerged in the water, the electrolyzing device <b>31</b> is actuated, i.e., the pair of electrodes are energized (Steps S<b>13</b>, S<b>14</b>). Further, the pulsator <b>7</b> is rotated at a predetermined speed in one direction or in opposite directions to generate water streams in the outer tub <b>2</b> (Step S<b>15</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The tap water contains very small amounts of impurities such as iron, calcium, magnesium and chlorine. Therefore, electrolyzed water is produced through the electrolyzing process performed in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>, and the tap water goes back and forth between the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b> and the outer tub <b>2</b>, whereby the outer tub <b>2</b> is gradually filled with the electrolyzed water. The electrolyzed water has a weak alkalinity. Further, active oxygen as well as hypochlorous acid (HClO) and hypochlorous ions (ClO—) are generated in the electrolyzed water in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>. Together with the electrolyzed water, hypochlorous acid and hypochlorous ions flow into the outer tub <b>2</b>. In the outer tub <b>2</b>, dirt adhering to the laundry is removed by the effect of the alkaline water and the effect of the water streams. Further, the laundry is sterilized by the effect of hypochlorous acid and hypochlorous ions. The dirt removed from the laundry is decomposed by the effect of the active oxygen in the electrolyzing chamber <b>32</b>, and prevented from adhering again to the laundry.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">When the water reaches the washing water level, the water supply is stopped (Steps S<b>16</b>, S<b>17</b>). On the other hand, the operation of the electrolyzing device <b>31</b> and the operation of the pulsator <b>7</b> are continued. After a lapse of a predetermined washing period, the operation of the electrolyzing device <b>31</b> (the energization of the pair of electrodes <b>33</b>) is stopped, and the pulsator <b>7</b> is stopped for completion of the first washing operation (Steps S<b>18</b> to S<b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">After an intermediate dehydrating operation is performed, a second washing operation is performed in the same manner as the first washing operation. Upon completion of the second washing operation, a final dehydrating operation is performed. Thus, the washing process in the zero detergent course is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the washing course employing the detergent, e.g., in the standard course, the electrolyzing device <b>31</b> may be operated in the rinsing operations (first and second rinsing operations), so that the electrolyzed water is employed for rinsing the laundry. Thus, the laundry can be sterilized while being rinsed.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">An automatic detergent adding device (adding means) may be provided for automatically adding a proper amount of the detergent according to the detected load. Thus, the detergent is automatically added in the washing course employing the detergent, e.g., in the standard course, and no detergent is added in the zero detergent course. A conventionally known device may be used as the automatic detergent adding device and, therefore, no explanation will be given to the construction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">While the embodiment of the present invention has thus been described, it should be understood that the invention be not limited to the above-described embodiment as will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The washing machine according to the present invention is not limited to the fully automatic washing machine. The invention is applicable to a so-called drum type washing machine in which the washing tub is constituted by an outer tub and a drum of horizontal axis type provided in the outer tub. Further, the invention is applicable to a so-called double tub washing machine in which a single washing tub is provided separately from a dehydration tub.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The water treatment means according to the present invention is not limited to the electrolyzing device, but any treatment means may be employed which performs a specific treatment on tap water to impart the tap water with the cleaning capability. Further, the present invention is not limited to the electrolysis of the tap water alone. For promotion of the electrolysis of the tap water, the electrolyzing process may be performed on an electrolytic solution prepared by adding salt or sodium hydrogencarbonate to the tap water.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The water stream generating means according to the present invention is not limited to the pulsator. For example, the water streams may be generated by rotating the inner tub. In this case, the inner tub serves as the water stream generating means. What is important is that the water stream generating means is capable of generating water streams within the washing tub.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The information means and the second information means according to the present invention are not limited to the display means such as the detergent amount display section and the zero detergent display section. For example, means for notifying the amount of the detergent and the non-addition of the detergent by voice may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">It should be understood that the present invention be not limited to the embodiment described above, but various modifications may be made within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">This application claims priority benefits under the Convention on the basis of Japanese Patent Applications No. 2001-106923 and No. 2001-133254 filed with the Japanese Patent Office on Apr. 5, 2001 and on Apr. 27, 2001, respectively, the disclosure thereof being incorporated herein by reference.</p>
