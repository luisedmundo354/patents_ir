<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates generally to a system and method for operating a turbo-charged compression-ignition engine and, more specifically, to a system and method for reducing specific fuel consumption and engine exhaust emission in a turbo-charged diesel engine in a locomotive.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a compression-ignition engine, such as a diesel engine, a fuel injection system injects fuel (e.g. diesel fuel) into compressed air within each of the engine cylinders to create an air-fuel mixture that ignites due to the heat and pressure of compression. Unfortunately, engine efficiency, power output, fuel consumption, exhaust emissions, and other operational characteristics are less than ideal. In addition, conventional techniques to improve one operational characteristic often worsen one or more other operational characteristic. For example, attempts to decrease specific fuel consumption often cause increases in various exhaust emissions. Vehicle exhaust emissions include pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and smoke generated due to incomplete combustion of fuel within the combustion chamber.

For example, the engine exhaust emissions are controlled and the specific fuel consumption is reduced by splitting fuel injection of a predetermined quantity into a pilot fuel injection and an advanced main fuel injection during a second half of a compression stroke and before top dead center position of the compression stroke of the engine <b>14</b> based on operating conditions of the engine <b>14</b> such as engine speed, crank angle, common rail pressure, or the like. In accordance with the embodiments of the present technique, second half of the compression stroke relates to a crank angle of 90 degrees before top dead center of the compression stroke. The injection operation includes splitting the fuel injection into the pilot fuel injection and the main fuel injection, providing larger fuel quantity in the main injection event, advancing the main injection event by a predetermined value, and adjusting timing between the pilot injection and the main injection.</p>

The turbine <b>22</b> is coupled to the exhaust manifold <b>18</b>. The exhaust gases ejected from the exhaust manifold <b>18</b> are expanded through the turbine <b>22</b>, thereby forcing rotation of a turbocharger shaft <b>26</b> connected to the compressor <b>20</b>. The compressor <b>20</b> draws in ambient air through an air filter <b>28</b> and provides compressed air to a heat exchanger <b>30</b>. The temperature of air is increased due to compression through the compressor <b>20</b>. The compressed air flows through the heat exchanger <b>30</b> such that the temperature of air is reduced prior to delivery into the intake manifold <b>16</b> of the engine <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, the heat exchanger <b>30</b> is an air-to-water heat exchanger, which utilizes a coolant to facilitate removal of heat from the compressed air.

In the illustrated embodiment, the fuel injector <b>42</b> is an electrically actuated fuel injector. The fuel injector <b>42</b> typically injects fuel into the engine cylinder <b>24</b> as a function of a fuel injection signal <b>39</b> received from the controller <b>32</b>.

The power sensor <b>50</b> may be configured to detect engine power (in horse power). The intake air temperature sensor <b>52</b> may be configured to detect temperature of air (in degrees or kelvin) fed to the intake manifold. The exhaust gas temperature sensor <b>54</b> may be configured to detect the temperature of exhaust gas (in degrees or kelvin) ejected from the exhaust manifold. The oxygen sensor <b>56</b>, the CO sensor <b>58</b>, and the NOx sensor <b>60</b> may be configured to detect quantity of oxygen, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen respectively in the exhaust gas. The controller <b>32</b> includes a split fuel injection quantity and proportion control logic <b>62</b> that enables the controller <b>32</b> to inject a first quantity of fuel (e.g., pilot fuel injection) <b>64</b> into the engine cylinder <b>24</b> before the piston reaches top dead center position of the compression stroke.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the locomotive power unit <b>10</b> having a multi-cylinder arrangement of the engine <b>14</b> is illustrated in accordance with certain embodiments of the present technique. The fuel injectors each include a fuel injection valve <b>80</b> disposed in fluid communication with a respective cylinder <b>24</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the engine <b>14</b> includes four cylinders <b>24</b> and four fuel injection valves <b>80</b>, respectively. However, other numbers (e.g., 6, 8, 10, 12, etc.) and configurations of cylinders <b>24</b> and fuel injection valves <b>80</b> are within the scope of the present technique. The fuel injection valves <b>80</b> are provided to inject fuel into a combustion chamber of each cylinder <b>24</b>. The fuel injection valves <b>80</b> are coupled to a high pressure common rail <b>82</b> configured to pressurize the fuel to a preselected pressure. The high pressure common rail <b>82</b> is coupled to the fuel injection pump <b>40</b> via a fuel supply pipe <b>84</b>. The common rail <b>82</b> may be provided with a pressure sensor (not shown) for detecting a fuel pressure in the common rail <b>82</b> and transmitting a pressure signal <b>81</b> corresponding to the detected fuel pressure to the controller <b>32</b>. The fuel pressure in the common rail is maintained at a predetermined value depending on the operating condition of the engine <b>14</b> by actuating the fuel injection pump <b>40</b>. In certain embodiments, the controller <b>32</b> is configured to produce the fuel injection signal <b>39</b> to control the operation of plurality of fuel injectors based on the crank angle signal <b>34</b>, engine speed signal <b>46</b>.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The intake manifold <b>16</b> is coupled to the combustion chambers of the respective cylinders <b>24</b>. The intake manifold <b>16</b> is coupled to an intake pipe <b>86</b>. The intake air temperature sensor (not shown) may be provided to the intake pipe <b>86</b>. A heat exchanger <b>88</b> may be provided in the intake pipe <b>86</b> to cool the intake air through the intake pipe <b>86</b>.

The plurality of sensors (not shown) such as the exhaust gas temperature sensor, the oxygen sensor, the CO sensor, and the NOx sensor may be coupled to the exhaust pipe <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As discussed above, the controller <b>32</b> receives the crank angle signal <b>34</b> from the crank angle sensor <b>36</b> provided to detect crank angle of the engine <b>14</b>. The controller <b>32</b> may be operable to produce the fuel injection signal <b>39</b> to control operation of the fuel injectors.

As discussed above, in the illustrated embodiment, the controller <b>32</b> is configured to control the fuel injection quantity, timing, pressure and pulse duration based on the output from the plurality of sensors. The usage of high pressure common rail <b>82</b> along with electrically actuated fuel injector enables the controller <b>32</b> to provide flexibility in fuel injection rate, number of fuel injections, the fuel injection quantity, timing, pressure, and pulse duration. In accordance with the embodiments of the present technique, the fuel injection operation is applicable from medium load to full load conditions of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">For a single shot fuel injection, if the fuel injection timing is advanced, the specific fuel consumption is reduced and the exhaust gas emission is increased. In accordance with the present technique, the fuel injection is split into the pilot fuel injection and the main fuel injection with advanced timing before top dead center position of the compression stroke of the engine <b>14</b>. Atomization of fuel is enhanced due to split injection and may be further promoted by increasing the injection pressure of the fuel. The fuel is uniformly distributed in the combustion chamber and the air utilization within the combustion chamber is enhanced. Smaller quantity of pilot injection facilitates prevention of adherence of fuel to cylinder walls. As a result, the exhaust gas emission is substantially controlled and the specific fuel consumption is reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the illustrated embodiment, the controller <b>34</b> may further include a database <b>94</b>, an algorithm <b>96</b>, and a data analysis block <b>98</b>. The database <b>94</b> may be configured to store predefined information about the power unit <b>10</b>. For example, the database <b>94</b> may store information relating to crank angle, engine speed, engine power, intake air temperature, exhaust gas temperature, exhaust gas composition, or the like. The database <b>94</b> may also include instruction sets, maps, lookup tables, variables, or the like. Such maps, lookup tables, instruction sets, are operative to correlate characteristics of the pilot injection and the main injection to specified engine operation parameters such as engine speed, crank angle, common rail pressure, desired fuel quantity, or the like. Furthermore, the database <b>94</b> may be configured to store actual sensed/detected information from the above-mentioned sensors.

Any of the above mentioned parameters may be selectively and/or dynamically adapted or altered relative to time. The controller <b>34</b> is configured to control the engine exhaust emission and the specific fuel consumption by performing the pilot injection at the first predetermined time before the piston reaches the top dead center of the compression stroke and by further performing the advanced main fuel injection at the second predetermined time after the first predetermined time before the piston reaches the top dead center of the compression stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, this figure is a flow chart illustrating one embodiment of the method of operating the turbocharged system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.

The crank angle sensor <b>36</b> is provided to detect the crank angle of the engine and the speed sensor <b>48</b> is provided to detect the engine speed (e.g., rotations per minute of the crank shaft). The controller <b>32</b> determines the first predetermined time for the pilot fuel injection before the piston reaches the top dead center of the compression stroke based on the crank angle and/or the engine speed as represented by step <b>102</b>. The controller <b>32</b> actuates the fuel injection pump <b>40</b> to inject the pilot fuel quantity into the engine cylinder <b>24</b> as represented by step <b>104</b>. In certain embodiments, pilot fuel quantity in the range of 1 to 5% is injected when the piston is 20 to 90 degrees before top dead center of the compression stroke. The pilot fuel atomizes and mixes with the entrained air in the cylinder <b>24</b>. As the piston moves towards the top dead center, the pressure and temperature of the mixture of pilot fuel and air is increased due to compression. When the mixture of pilot fuel and air reaches an ignition temperature (self ignition temperature), the mixture of pilot fuel and air ignites to form combustion products before and during the main injection event.</p>

In certain embodiments, main fuel quantity in the range of 95 to 99% is injected when the piston is less than 5 degrees before top dead center of the compression stroke. The main fuel atomizes and mixes with the entrained air in the cylinder <b>24</b>. The main fuel also mixes with the entrained burnt mixture of pilot fuel and air. The entrained burnt mixture of pilot fuel and air act as diluents with high specific heat to reduce the temperature of the main injection event, thereby reducing exhaust gas emission.

The specific fuel consumption is reduced by advancing the main fuel injection in the vicinity of the top dead center of the compression stroke as represented by step <b>130</b>. The main fuel atomizes and mixes with the entrained air in the cylinder <b>24</b>. The main fuel also mixes with the entrained burnt mixture of pilot fuel and air. The entrained burnt mixture of pilot fuel and air act as diluents with high specific heat to reduce the temperature of the main injection event, thereby reducing exhaust gas emission. The advancing of the main injection event enables better atomization of the fuel resulting in improved fuel consumption. Hence a combination of smaller quantity of pilot fuel injection and advanced main fuel injection provides reduced fuel consumption while maintaining the exhaust emissions within safe limits.</p>

The method includes providing the split fuel injection quantity and proportion control logic <b>62</b> that enables the controller <b>32</b> to inject the first quantity of fuel (e.g., pilot fuel injection) <b>64</b> into the engine cylinder before the piston reaches top dead center position of the compression stroke and to inject the second quantity of fuel (e.g., majority/main fuel injection) <b>66</b> into the engine cylinder when the piston is in the vicinity of the top dead center position of the compression stroke as represented by step <b>132</b>. The pilot fuel injection is performed when the piston position is in the range of 20 to 90 degrees before the top dead center of the compression stroke. The method further includes providing the split fuel injection timing/advance control logic <b>68</b> that enables the controller <b>32</b> to inject the main fuel injection quantity into the engine cylinder at the second predetermined time <b>72</b> before the piston reaches top dead center position of a compression stroke as represented by step <b>134</b>. The main fuel injection is advanced to less than or equal to 5 degrees before the top dead center of the compression stroke. The method further includes providing the split fuel injection pressure and pulse duration control logic <b>74</b> that enables the controller <b>32</b> to control the pressure and pulse duration of the pilot fuel injection <b>76</b> and the main fuel injection <b>78</b> as represented by step <b>136</b>. The split fuel injection pressure and pulse duration control logic <b>74</b> may also enable the controller <b>32</b> to control dwell between the pilot and the main injection events.</p>
