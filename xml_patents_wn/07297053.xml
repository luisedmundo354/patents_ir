<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to a rotary crop residue chopper for an agricultural combine and a method of making the same, and more particularly to apparatus mountable on a rotatable element of a chopper for chopping crop residue, primarily straw, stalks, and other plant material, received into the chopper from a threshing mechanism of the combine, and for propelling the chopped material outwardly from the combine, which apparatus has at least one integrally formed stiffening element having a capability for generating and/or increasing air flow into, through and from the chopper, the stiffening element being formable by stamping to provide special features, and at least one embodiment of which apparatus can be reversible so as to be mountable in either of two orientations on the rotatable element.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Threshing and chopping crop residue in an agricultural combine can create substantial amounts of small and lightweight crop residue particles, dust and fragments which are desirably discharged from the combine with the larger chopped crop residue. Apparatus having a straight blade portion for performing the chopping, that is, a substantially planar blade portion oriented in a direction of rotation of the rotatable element on which the apparatus is mounted, has been found to provide excellent chopping capability. Reference in this regard, Gronberg et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,874,604, and Bender U.S. Pat. No. 4,998,679. However, this orientation provides only minimal air flow generation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other apparatus are configured to provide greater air flow generation. Reference in this regard, Redekop et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,232,405; 5,482,508; and 6,478,674; and Hammarstrand U.S. Pat. No. 5,042,973. Of these, the blade member shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,232,405 includes a support plate supporting a symmetrical transverse blade surface for generating a high velocity of air rotating with the chopping assembly. However, the symmetrical nature of the transverse blade about the support plate can be disadvantageous as it prevents the cutting edge of the blade member from being positioned close to fixed knives of the chopper past which the blade members move to perform the chopping action. The transverse blade is also only disclosed as lying in a plane perpendicular to the support plate and parallel to the rotational axis. And, as a result of the orientation of the blade relative to the support plate, the blade member is not reversible.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The apparatus of U.S. Pat. No. 5,482,508 overcomes the disadvantage of not being able to be positioned close to the fixed knives by having a fan blade extending sidewardly in only one direction from a trailing edge of the blade member. However, as a result of the sideward extent of the fan blade, this blade member is also not reversible and thus different blade members must be provided for use on opposite sides of a fixed knife of a chopper to achieve closeness of the cutting edge of the blade to the knife.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 6,478,674 is different still as it utilizes a twisted blade design. A disadvantage of this is that the cutting edge is oriented at an angle to the direction of rotation of the blade, which has been found to decrease cutting efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 5,042,973 discloses a chopper blade which is bent into a V or arch shape transverse cross section over the entire width of the blade, including the cutting edge or edges thereof, for providing a blower action. An observed disadvantage of the extension of the V or arch shape across the entire extent of the blade member is that it orients the cutting edge at an angle to the direction of rotation, thereby reducing cutting efficiency. Also, this makes the cutting efficiency and blower action inversely related. That is, as the angle of the V or degree of curvature is increased to increase the blower action, the angle of attack of the cutting edge of the blade relative to the direction of rotation thereof will also be increased, thereby decreasing cutting efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, what is sought is apparatus for a crop residue chopper which overcomes many of the disadvantages and shortcomings set forth above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention, a chopper apparatus for a rotary crop residue chopper of an agricultural combine, which overcomes many of the disadvantages and shortcomings set forth above, is disclosed. The chopper apparatus of the invention includes a substantially planar body having side surfaces which are preferably oriented perpendicular to a direction of rotation of the apparatus, such that a leading cutting edge of the apparatus is optimally oriented substantially directly in the direction of rotation for chopping. It is contemplated that the cutting edge can be smooth, serrated, blunt, or any combination of these. The apparatus has at least one longitudinally extending, integral stiffener extending sidewardly from one of the side surfaces for increasing the strength and rigidity of the chopper apparatus and which, during rotation, can generate an air flow for inducting dust and smaller particles of crop residue into the chopper for discharge from the chopper with the larger elements of the chopped crop residue.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one preferred aspect of the invention, the body includes opposite longitudinally extending cutting edges and the at least one stiffener is/are symmetrical about a longitudinal center line, so as to allow usage of the apparatus on opposite sides of mounting apparatus of the chopper. Alternatively, the stiffener or stiffeners can be located closer to one of the longitudinal edges. If more than one stiffener is used, for instance, two stiffeners, the stiffeners can be arranged either symmetrically or asymmetrically, the former advantageously providing easy reversibility when desired.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to still another preferred aspect of the invention, the stiffener is integrally formed on the chopper apparatus by die stamping, casting, molding, forging, striking, hydroforming or another suitable metal forming method. Alternatively, the stiffener can be attached in place on the chopper apparatus by other suitable means, such as by welding. An advantage of the present stiffener portion is that it can be relatively large, and can be located close to a leading or cutting edge of the chopper apparatus, without affecting the angle of attack of the leading or cutting edge. This should be contrasted with and is an important advantage over the chopper blade construction of U.S. Pat. No. 5,042,973 which as noted above is bent into a V or arch shape for providing a blower action, but which resultantly orients the cutting edge at an angle to the direction of rotation, thereby reducing cutting efficiency, which angle is increased by increasing the angle of the V or arch shape.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A special feature of forming the stiffener portion by stamping is that the stamping process can draw material from the adjacent edge or edges of the chopper apparatus to form a concavity or concave region in the edge or edges. This is advantageous as it makes the radial outer end of the cutting edge effectively extend forwardly of the concave region in the direction of rotation which can serve to retain crop material on the edge in opposition centrifugal force from the rotation acting to sling the material radially outwardly. This effective outward extension or prominence of the radial outer portion of the edge also serves to increase the wearability of that portion of the edge, that is, the useful life thereof, as that portion of the edge has been observed to typically wear at a faster rate compared the more radially inward regions of the edge, and also round off.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another preferred aspect, the stiffener has a rounded or bulbous shape such that no portion of the surface thereof is oriented perpendicular (e.g. at a 90 degree angle) to the rotational direction. This has been found to provide beneficial stress optimization because the effects of particle erosion are minimized on the stiffener portion. The non-perpendicular stiffener additionally provides improved air flow generation and crop material flow, and less crop material build up in front of the stiffener compared to other known constructions.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The opposite surface of the chopper apparatus preferably has a depression or concavity corresponding in location, and at least generally in shape, to the stiffener portion.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to still another aspect, the preferred stiffener does not extend to the radial outer longitudinal end of the chopper apparatus, but instead terminates a distance therefrom sufficient such that if all or a substantial portion of the stiffener wears or abrades away as a result of contact with abrasive crop material and dust, the radial outer leading and trailing edges of the chopper apparatus will remain connected together to maintain the structural integrity and functionality of the chopper apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">If more than one stiffener is used, for instance, two stiffeners are used, the stiffeners can be located all or completely on opposite sides of the longitudinal centerline of the chopper apparatus. The stiffeners can also be offset longitudinally. That is, all or a portion of one stiffener can lie on one side of a longitudinal centerline of the chopper apparatus and all or a portion of the other stiffener can lie on the opposite side of the centerline, and the stiffeners can be located at different or the same longitudinal positions along the chopper apparatus, which longitudinal positions can, for instance, partially coincide or overlap. One or more of the stiffeners can also have a curve shape in the radial direction, and/or can be oriented at an angle to the radial direction, as desired or required for providing a particular or sought after capability or capabilities.</p>

One or more washers or bushings <b>56</b> can be disposed between the apparatus <b>42</b> and the head of bolt <b>50</b> and/or nut <b>54</b> to facilitate free pivotal movement of the apparatus <b>42</b> in the direction of rotation C in a well known flail action or movement.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, each apparatus <b>42</b> includes a free end portion <b>58</b> opposite mounting end portion <b>48</b>. Free end portion <b>58</b> includes at least one, and preferably two, opposite, longitudinally extending edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> which are oriented in direction of rotation C, and one or both of which can be sharpened, such that the leading one of edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> relative to rotational direction C can cut or chop crop residue contacted thereby during the rotation thereof, in the well known manner. Here, it should be noted that while cutting edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> are illustrated as being smooth, it is contemplated that edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> could also be serrated, blunt, or any combination of these, as desired or required for a particular application. In addition, and importantly, free end portions <b>58</b> of each chopper apparatus <b>42</b> includes an elongate stiffener portion <b>64</b> that extends longitudinally and protrudes sidewardly from a side surface <b>66</b> of the chopper apparatus oriented parallel to direction of rotation C, for structurally stiffening apparatus <b>48</b>. Stiffener portion <b>64</b> can also generate an air flow in the rotational direction C during the rotation, preferably sufficient for inducting dust and smaller particles of crop residue into chopper <b>22</b> for discharge with the larger elements of the crop residue.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Stiffener portion <b>64</b> is located on side surface <b>66</b> substantially equidistant from edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, such that each chopper apparatus <b>42</b> is reversible, that is, it can be mounted either side <b>38</b> or <b>40</b> of a mounting bracket <b>36</b>. Stiffener portion <b>64</b> can have any desired longitudinal and/or sideward extent, as required or desired for providing a desired or required stiffness, and/or generating particular air flow characteristics, such as, but not limited to, more or less induction in the inlet region of chopper <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Because stiffener portion <b>64</b> extends sidewardly from only one side surface <b>66</b> of free end portion <b>58</b>, an opposite side surface <b>68</b> of chopper apparatus <b>42</b> can be positioned so as to pass in closely spaced relation to a fixed knife such as representative fixed knife <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) shown mounted in housing <b>30</b> of chopper <b>22</b> along the path of movement of chopper apparatus <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Each chopper apparatus <b>42</b> including stiffener portion <b>64</b> is preferably, bot not necessarily of unitary construction, side surfaces <b>66</b> and <b>68</b> preferably being substantially planar. Stiffener portions <b>64</b> can be formed by a suitable metal forming method such as by die stamping, casting, molding, forging, striking, hydroforming, or the like, or can be attached in place on the chopper apparatus, for example, by welding. Particularly if die stamped, forged, or hydroformed, stiffener portion <b>64</b> can include a concavity <b>72</b> in side surface <b>68</b>, corresponding generally in shape but smaller in extent compared to the protuberance of stiffener <b>64</b> on surface <b>66</b>, as illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As an example dimensionally, for a chopper apparatus such as apparatus <b>42</b> having an overall length of from about 130 to 250 millimeters (mm) and a width of from about 30 to 80 mm, a suitable stiffener portion <b>64</b> can have a length of from about 130 to 235 mm, a width of from about 30 to 80 millimeters, (smaller values for smaller width chopper apparatus), and a sideward extent from side surface <b>66</b> of from about 0.0 to 20 mm as represented by distance X (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), so as to be sufficient such that stiffener portion <b>64</b> will desirably disturb air flow over surface <b>66</b> as chopper apparatus <b>42</b> is rotated, so as to generate induction in an inlet region <b>74</b> of chopper <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), for supplementing crop residue flow A by drawing dust and other lighter airborne particulate matter around inlet region <b>74</b> into and through housing <b>30</b>. This is particularly useful for reducing and evacuating dust in the rear end of combine <b>20</b>. It should be appreciated that the above ranges are only exemplary and that additional ranges, both of lesser and greater values, could be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Stiffener portion <b>64</b> preferably has rounded portions <b>76</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>) at its interface with surface <b>66</b>; rounded end portions <b>78</b> at its radial inner and outer ends; and an overall rounded sectional shape when viewed from a longitudinal end (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), such that all portions of the surface of stiffener portions <b>64</b> facing the direction of rotation are oriented at less than a 90 degree angle to side surface <b>66</b>. In turn, no imaginary line lying in a surface of any of rounded portions <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> would lie substantially parallel to the rotational axis <b>32</b>, which extends longitudinally through rotor <b>26</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>). Advantages of such rounded shape include good air flow generation and air flow characteristics over stiffener <b>64</b>. This rounded shape can also optimize stress upon stiffener portion <b>64</b> and reduce wear of stiffener portion <b>64</b> as a result of passage through and contact with crop material and dust at high rotational speeds, and it reduces areas where snagging and collecting of crop material can occur. In short, the rounded shape of stiffener portion <b>64</b> minimizes the effects of particle erosion on stiffener portion <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It has also been found that as a result of the protrusion of stiffener portion <b>64</b> into the flow of crop material, dust and air, stiffener portion <b>64</b> can be subject to greater or accelerated wear compared to other regions of chopper apparatus <b>42</b>. As a result, to facilitate adequate service life, stiffener portion <b>64</b> preferably terminates a spaced distance Y (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) preferably with a range of from about 5 to 7 mm from a longitudinal endmost edge portion <b>80</b> of free end portion <b>58</b> of the example chopper apparatus <b>42</b> having dimensions set forth above, such that in the event stiffener portion <b>64</b> wears through to produce a hole through chopper apparatus <b>42</b>, endmost edge portion <b>80</b> will remain continuous between edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, thereby maintaining the flatness and integrity and functionality of free end portion <b>58</b>, even as the leading edge <b>60</b> or <b>62</b> itself wears. It should be appreciated that the above ranges are only exemplary and that additional ranges, both of lesser and greater values, could be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B and <b>9</b>, three alternative chopper apparatus <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>A and <b>82</b>B, constructed and operable according to the teachings of the present invention, are illustrated, like parts of chopper apparatus <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>A and <b>82</b>B, and chopper apparatus <b>42</b> being identified by like numbers. Each of chopper apparatus <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>A and <b>82</b>B differs from chopper apparatus <b>42</b> primarily in two respects. First, only one longitudinally extending edge, here edge <b>60</b>, which would be the leading or cutting edge, is shown sharpened, which would provide a manufacturing cost advantage, but would limit or eliminate reversibility if it is desired or required to use the sharpened edge as the cutting or leading edge. As a result, a chopper apparatus that is a mirror image of the chopper apparatus <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>A or <b>82</b>B, that is, one with a sharpened edge <b>62</b> instead of edge <b>60</b>, or another chopper apparatus, such as a chopper apparatus <b>42</b>, would be usually be required for mounting on an opposite side of a mounting member, such as bracket <b>36</b>. Second, elongate stiffener portion <b>64</b>, <b>64</b>A and <b>64</b>B is offset toward either edge <b>60</b> or edge <b>62</b>, relative to a longitudinal center line <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the elimination of the sharpened trailing edge <b>62</b> provides the advantage of chopper apparatus <b>82</b> having more thickness in the vicinity of that edge so as to be itself stiffer. The elimination of the second sharpened edge provides a larger area for stiffener portion, such that it can be correspondingly larger, as denoted by the arrows, and/or have a curved or angled shape and/or orientation, and/or allows it to be placed at a greater variety of side to side locations, for achieving desired or required stiffness and/or air flow generating capability. For stamped versions of the chopper apparatus, this can also provide an additional area from which to draw material for forming the stiffener portion, without resultant thinning or deforming of the chopper apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Here, its should be observed that stiffener portion <b>64</b> of chopper apparatus <b>82</b> is relatively large so as to extend over a larger area of side surface <b>66</b>, including over longitudinal center line <b>92</b>, whereas the stiffener portions <b>64</b>A and <b>64</b>B of apparatus <b>82</b>A and <b>82</b>B, respectively, are shown lying completely on one side or the other of the longitudinal center line <b>92</b> of each of those chopper apparatus. An advantage of this latter location is that mirror image stampings, for example for use on opposite sides of a mounting bracket <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) can be made using the same die, for a manufacturing cost advantage. As another advantage for some applications wherein the chopper apparatus <b>82</b>A or <b>82</b>B is stamped, stiffener portions <b>64</b>A and <b>64</b>B can be located sufficiently close to edge <b>60</b> or <b>62</b>, and/or can have a sufficiently large size in at least one direction, such that material will be drawn from the adjacent edge <b>62</b> or <b>64</b> so as to form a concavity or concave region <b>60</b>A or <b>62</b>A in the respective edge <b>60</b> or <b>62</b> when the stiffener portion <b>64</b>A or <b>64</b>B is formed. This is an inherent qualitative feature of the stamping process. A stiffener portion <b>64</b>A or <b>64</b>B formed in this manner and as illustrated will stiffen and support the adjacent edge during the cutting and chopping action, and provide a desired degree of air flow generating capability. A concave region <b>60</b>A or <b>62</b>A in the leading one of edges <b>60</b> or <b>62</b> will also be advantageous for some applications, as the greater sideward extent of a radial outermost region <b>60</b>B or <b>62</b>B of respective edge <b>60</b> or <b>62</b> radially outwardly of the concave region <b>60</b>A or <b>62</b>A can act to retain crop material on the edge longer in opposition to centrifugal forces acting on the crop material during rotational movement of the chopper apparatus about rotational axis <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), at least until the radial outer portion <b>60</b>B or <b>62</b>B wears down from use. In this latter regard, it has been observed that the radial outermost portion of the leading or cutting edge will be subject to faster wear and, as a result, the corner thereof will typically round off. Another advantage of the greater sideward extent of radial outer portion <b>60</b>B or <b>62</b>B relative to the adjacent concave region <b>60</b>A or <b>62</b>A, is that the radial outermost portion of edge <b>60</b> has a greater transverse extent or is more prominent (perpendicular to center line <b>92</b> and forwardly in the direction of rotation) compared to the concave portion, such that the radial outer portion will provide improved wearability during use.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Stiffener portion <b>64</b>B of chopper apparatus <b>82</b>B located on the side of center line <b>92</b> closer to edge <b>62</b>, which is the trailing or non-cutting edge, will provide stiffening and air flow generating capabilities, but from a location farther away from the leading cutting edge <b>60</b>, which may be more desirable for some applications.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Here, it should be observed that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an end view of chopper apparatus <b>82</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and that end views of chopper apparatus <b>82</b>A and <b>82</b>B would be similar, differing only in the location of stiffener portion <b>64</b>A or <b>64</b>B relative to edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It should also be observed from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B and <b>9</b> that a wide variety of sizes of stiffener portions can be used in accordance with the present invention. As an example dimensionally, for a chopper apparatus such as apparatus <b>82</b> having an overall length of from about 130 to 250 millimeters (mm) and a width of from about 30 to 80 mm, a suitable stiffener portion <b>64</b> can have a length of from about 130 to 235 mm, a width of from about 30 to 80 millimeters, (smaller values for smaller width chopper apparatus), and a sideward extent from side surface <b>66</b> of from about 0.0 to 20 mm as represented by distance X (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), so as to be sufficient such that stiffener portion <b>64</b> will desirably disturb air flow over surface <b>66</b> as chopper apparatus <b>42</b> is rotated, so as to generate induction in an inlet region <b>74</b> of chopper <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), for supplementing crop residue flow A by drawing dust and other lighter airborne particulate matter around inlet region <b>74</b> into and through housing <b>30</b>. This is particularly useful for reducing and evacuating dust in the rear end of combine <b>20</b>. Stiffener apparatus <b>64</b>A and <b>64</b>B can have similar length dimensions, but should be smaller in width than stiffener portion <b>64</b> if it is desired to be limited to one side of center line <b>92</b>. The distance of the radial outer end of the stiffener portions <b>64</b>A and <b>64</b>B from free end <b>58</b> is preferably within the range set forth above (distance Y in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). It should also be noted that the greater the width and/or sideward extent of stiffener portions <b>64</b>A and <b>64</b>B, and/or the closer to adjacent edge <b>60</b> or <b>62</b>, the more material that will be drawn from the vicinity of that adjacent edge during the stamping process, such that the concavity or depth of the concave region <b>60</b>A or <b>62</b>A from the forwardmost portion of the edge in the direction of rotation (e.g. radial outer portion <b>60</b>B) can be resultantly increased, and the radial outer portion <b>60</b>B or <b>62</b>B made correspondingly more prominent. Conversely, the lesser the width and/or sideward extent of stiffener portions <b>64</b>A and <b>64</b>B, and/or the farther from adjacent edge <b>60</b> or <b>62</b>, the less material that will be drawn from the vicinity of that adjacent edge, such that the concavity or depth of the concave region <b>60</b>A or <b>62</b>A can be resultantly decreased, and the radial outer portion <b>60</b>B or <b>62</b>B made correspondingly less prominent. Here, it should be noted such different shapes and sizes can be formed without affecting the angular orientation of the edge <b>60</b> or <b>62</b> relative to the direction of rotation, such as is a problem with prior constructions involving bending.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It should be appreciated that the above ranges are only exemplary and that additional ranges, both of lesser and greater values, could be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With regard to the shape of the stiffener portions <b>64</b>, <b>64</b>A and <b>64</b>B, it should be noted that they can have a wide variety of alternative shapes, such as, but not limited to, an angular shape <b>64</b>C as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> which extends forwardly in the direction of rotation, for providing desired stiffening and/or air flow generating capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows crop residue chopper <b>22</b> including a plurality of fixed knives <b>70</b> arranged in an array which is offset relative to rotational axis <b>32</b> of cylinder <b>28</b>, such that adjacent ones of chopper apparatus <b>42</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>A, <b>82</b>B, or any of the other chopper apparatus disclosed hereinafter will interact with knives <b>70</b> at different angular locations about axis <b>32</b>. As a result, crop material inducted into chopper <b>22</b> and chopped by the interaction of chopper apparatus <b>42</b>, <b>82</b> <b>82</b>A, <b>82</b>B and knives <b>70</b>, may be discharged from chopper <b>22</b>, as denoted by arrow B, in different directions along axis <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, chopper <b>22</b> is shown including a rotor <b>84</b> having mounting brackets <b>36</b> disposed at angularly offset positions about a rotational axis <b>32</b> of the rotor. A representative fixed knife <b>70</b> is shown, it being contemplated that a single axially extending rank of knives <b>70</b> can be used, or axially offset knives, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, another alternative chopper apparatus <b>86</b> constructed and operable according to the teachings of the present invention is shown, like parts of chopper apparatus <b>86</b> and chopper apparatus <b>42</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>A and <b>82</b>B being identified by like numbers. Chopper apparatus <b>86</b> is most similar to chopper apparatus <b>42</b> in that it includes a single centered stiffener portion <b>64</b> in essentially the same location protruding sidewardly from side surface <b>66</b> as stiffener portion <b>64</b> of chopper apparatus <b>42</b>. Here though, stiffener portion <b>64</b> is formed in chopper apparatus <b>86</b> by stamping in such a manner that concave regions <b>60</b>A and <b>62</b>A are formed in edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, respectively, similar as in chopper apparatus <b>82</b>A and <b>82</b>B. Again, this is an inherent qualitative feature of the stamping process. Also again, such concavity in the leading one of edges <b>60</b> or <b>62</b> has been found to be advantageous, for retaining the crop material on the edge in opposition to centrifugal forces acting on the crop material during rotational movement of the chopper apparatus about rotational axis <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), at least until the edge wears down from use. In this latter regard, it has been observed that the radial outermost portion of the leading cutting edge will be subject to faster wear and, as a result, will typically round off. As result of the concavity, the radial outermost portions <b>60</b>B and <b>62</b>B of edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> have a greater transverse extent (perpendicular to center line <b>92</b>) than the concave regions, such that the radial outer portion <b>60</b>B will have improved wearability during use.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, still another alternative chopper apparatus <b>88</b> constructed and operable according to the teachings of the present invention is shown, like parts of chopper apparatus <b>88</b> and chopper apparatus <b>42</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>A, <b>82</b>B and <b>86</b> being identified by like numbers. Chopper apparatus <b>88</b> has a planar side surface <b>66</b> having opposite longitudinal edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> oriented to face directly in the direction of rotation, one or both of which can be sharpened, in the latter instance to provide reversibility, if desired. Chopper apparatus <b>88</b> differs from the previous chopper apparatus in the provision of two smaller stiffener portions <b>90</b> extending sidewardly from side surface <b>66</b>, on opposite sides of longitudinal center line <b>92</b> of chopper apparatus <b>88</b>. Stiffener portions <b>90</b> are located at the same longitudinal position along center line <b>92</b> between mounting end portion <b>48</b> and free end portion <b>58</b>, although it is contemplated that they could be longitudinally offset. Stiffener portions <b>90</b> are preferably spaced adequately from free end portion <b>58</b>, for instance, within the range set forth above, such that in the event of wear through of the stiffener portion, the integrity of free end portion <b>58</b> will be maintained. It is also preferable that stiffener portions <b>90</b> each be at least largely longitudinally continuous, such that little or no longitudinal gap is present therebetween. This is to provide adequate stiffness along the length of chopper apparatus <b>88</b>, and also to provide desired air flow generation and induction properties. Other aspects of stiffener portions <b>90</b>, such as longitudinal and/or sideward extent, can be as required or desired for the desired or required stiffness and/or air flow characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Again, similarly to stiffener portions <b>64</b> of chopper apparatus <b>86</b> and stiffener portions <b>64</b>A and <b>64</b>B of chopper apparatus <b>82</b>A and <b>82</b>B discussed above, stiffener portions <b>90</b> are preferably formed in chopper apparatus <b>86</b> by stamping in such a manner that concave regions <b>60</b>A and <b>62</b>A are formed in edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, respectively. This is an inherent qualitative feature of the stamping process. Also again, such concavity in the leading one of edges <b>60</b> or <b>62</b> has been found to be advantageous, for retaining the crop material on the edge in opposition to centrifugal forces acting on the crop material during rotational movement of the chopper apparatus about rotational axis <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), at least until the edge wears down from use. In this latter regard, it has been observed that the radial outermost portion of the leading cutting edge will be subject to faster wear and, as a result, will typically round off. As result of the concavity, the radial outermost portions <b>60</b>B and <b>62</b>B of edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> have a greater transverse extent (perpendicular to center line <b>92</b>) than the concave regions, such that the radial outer portion <b>60</b>B will have improved wearability during use.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Dimensionally, for an exemplary chopper apparatus <b>88</b> having an overall length of from about 130 to 250 millimeters (mm) and a width of from about 30 to 80 mm, a suitable stiffener portion <b>90</b> can have a length of from about 130 to 235 mm, a width of from about 15 to 40 millimeters, (smaller values for smaller width chopper apparatus), and a sideward extent from side surface <b>66</b> of from about 0.0 to 20 mm as represented by distance X (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), so as to be sufficient such that stiffener portion <b>90</b> will desirably disturb air flow over surface <b>66</b> as chopper apparatus <b>88</b> is rotated, so as to generate induction in an inlet region <b>74</b> of chopper <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), for supplementing crop residue flow A by drawing dust and other lighter airborne particulate matter around inlet region <b>74</b> into and through housing <b>30</b>. Again, it should be appreciated that the above ranges are exemplary only and that additional ranges, both of lesser and greater values, could be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Also, it is desirable for stiffener portions <b>90</b> to have rounded portions <b>76</b> at their interface with surface <b>66</b>; rounded end portions <b>78</b> at their radial inner and outer ends; and an overall rounded sectional shape when viewed from a longitudinal end (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) such that all portions of the surface of stiffener portions <b>90</b> facing the direction of rotation are oriented at less than a 90¬∞ angle to side surface <b>66</b>. Again, advantages of such rounded shape include good air flow generation and air flow characteristics over stiffeners <b>90</b>. This rounded shape can also reduce wear of the stiffener portions as a result of passage through and contact with crop material and dust at high rotational speeds, and it reduces areas where snagging and collecting of crop material can occur.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Here, although chopper apparatus <b>88</b> is shown including two stiffener portions, other arrangements of multiple stiffener portions are contemplated, such as arrangements including three or more stiffeners of the same or different shapes and/or sizes, and ones which can be longitudinally coextensive, or offset to a desired extent. It should also be observed that edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> are each shown as being sharpened, and include concave regions <b>60</b>A and <b>62</b>A, respectively, adjacent to the respective stiffener portions <b>90</b>, as a result of the stamping process as explained above. Again, such concave regions can facilitate retention of crop material on the leading one of edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> in opposition to centrifugal forces acting thereon during rotation. The greater sideward extent of the radial outermost portion <b>60</b>B of the leading cutting edge <b>60</b> also provides improved wearability as also explained above.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Here, it should additionally be noted that it is contemplated that although stiffener portions <b>64</b>, <b>64</b>A, <b>64</b>B and <b>90</b> shown in the drawings and disclosed hereinabove are each oriented so as to extend in the longitudinal direction, any of the stiffener portions can be oriented at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the chopper apparatus, as desired or required for achieving a particular air flow generation or stiffening characteristic or characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Addressing methods of manufacture of any of the above discussed chopper apparatus so as to have concave regions <b>60</b>A and/or <b>60</b>B on respective edges <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, such features are preferably formed as discussed above as a result of stamping stiffener portions <b>54</b>, <b>64</b>A, <b>64</b>B, <b>64</b>C or <b>90</b> into the chopper apparatus <b>42</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>82</b>A, <b>82</b>B, <b>86</b> or <b>88</b>. Alternatively, such features can be formed all or in part by grinding.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It will be understood that changes in the details, materials, steps, and arrangements of parts which have been described and illustrated to explain the nature of the invention will occur to and may be made by those skilled in the art upon a reading of this disclosure within the principles and scope of the invention.
