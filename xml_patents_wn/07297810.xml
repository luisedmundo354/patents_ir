<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The development of films or coatings as protective films for display devices such as a CRT screen is well documented in the art. These include antireflective coatings, hardcoats, optical coatings, and the like. Nevertheless, there continues to be a need for further improvement in the development of polymerizable high index materials for optical applications. Exemplary applications include antireflective coatings, hardcoats, and brightness enhancement film materials. Many polymerizable films have a refractive index of 1.5 or less. Because of the optical advantages, however, an increase of the refractive index to 1.58 or more would be a desirable improvement. Furthermore, there is a need for durable, inexpensive, and yet high quality antireflective coatings that exhibit a relatively low reflectance, that is less than 1%.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The above-referenced concerns are resolved by the development of new ultraviolet curable monomers employing a substituted fluorene structure. Bromine is readily substituted at the 2 position in the mono brominated derivative, the 2 and 7 positions in the dibrominated derivative and the 2, 3, and 7 positions in the tribrominated derivative. The fluorene backbone of the monomers of the present invention may also be functionalized with one or more polymerizable or reactive functionalities, and most readily at the 9 position. In particular, preferred embodiments incorporate reactive, pendant acrylate groups.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Compositions of the present invention include the reactive bromosubstituted fluorenes combined with inorganic nanoparticles, particularly nanoparticles with reactive surface modifiers exhibiting polymerizable functionality. Reactive high index nanoparticles such as zirconia are preferred, although other high index nanoparticles such as titania are acceptable. Photoinitiators may also be employed in the present compositions thereby enhancing free radical curing by ultraviolet light for example.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One advantage of the monomers of the present invention is the copolymerizability and high refractive index of the monomers. A second advantage is the compatibility of the monomers with the solvents employed in dispersing functionalized nanoparticles thereby forming stable coating formulations. Another advantage of the high refractive index monomers is that antireflective coatings including the high refractive index monomers within high index optical layer(s) may be provided, thereby enhancing the optical properties of the antireflective coating.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention includes the development of bromosubstituted fluorenes as a coating matrix. The incorporation of bromine is believed to raise the refractive index and is readily substituted at the 2 position in the mono brominated derivative, the 2 and 7 positions in the dibrominated derivative and the 2, 3, and 7 positions in the tribrominated derivative. The substituted polymers are also functionalized with one or more polymerizable functionalities along the fluorene backbone, and preferably at the 9 position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a fluorene structure that may be substituted about the positions shown. The functional groups particularly emphasized include reactive, pendant acrylate groups. Co-polymers may be made from other acrylates and methacrylates, and from monofunctional derivatives represented by the generic structure shown below. Pendant acrylate groups include those selected from the group of acrylate, methacrylate, polyacrylate, polymethacrylate, and polymethylmethacrylate compounds formed from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, trimethoxysilylpropylmethacrylate, and trimethoxysilylpropylacrylate, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The use of the new monomers of the invention are envisioned in combination with other monomers, multifunctional acrylates, crosslinking monomers, fillers, nanoparticles, adhesion promoters, slip agents, initiators, photoinitiators, dyes, and solvents, and are given in weight percent ranges relative to the total weight of the optical coating composition. The weight percents of each constituent are given relative to the total weight of the compositions, absent the solvent used in the processing thereof. For UV curable formulations, the photoinitiators may be employed between 0.05% and 10%, although preferably between 1-4%. For the films of the invention, the nanoparticles were provided at 20-60 wt % and even more preferably in a range of 30-38.5 wt %, whereby the weight percents given reflect the weight of nanoparticles not yet surface modified. In accordance with the present invention, the nanoparticle surface modifier weight percent ratio preferably ranges from about 2.70:1 to 6:1. Stated another way, the weight percent range for nanoparticles with surface modifiers is the sum of the two. To illustrate, example 12 has 30% ZrO2+11.1% surface modifier, so that the weight percent of the surface modified particles is 41.1%. Similarly, example 16 exhibits a 35.32% wt % of surface modified nanoparticles, wherein the wt % is also relative to the total compositional weight. Table 1 below gives exemplary nanoparticle/surface modifier combinations of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Two classes of bromo-substituted fluorene monomers are characterized by the structures illustrated above. Examples 1-4, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, exemplify molecules that may be formed as given above. As such, a preferred group of bromo substituted fluorene monomers may be selected from the group including acrylic acid 3-[9-(3-acryloyloxy-propyl)-2,3,7-tribromo-9H-fluoren-9-yl]-propyl ester, acrylic acid 3-{9-[3-acyloyloxy-propoxy)-propyl]-2,3,7-tribromo-9H-fluoren-9-yl}-propyl ester, 3-[9-(3-acryloyloxy-propyl)-2,7-dibromo-9H-fluoren-9-yl]-propyl ester, and 2-[9-(2-acryloyloxy-ethyl)-2,7-dibromo-9H-fluoren-9-yl]-ethyl ester. It has been found that the bromosubstituted monomers of the present invention as exemplified by this preferred group, possess a high refractive index (greater than or about 1.58 to 1.6), good solubility, good miscibility with the nanoparticles, and reasonable durability after curing, especially when formulated with zirconia nanoparticles.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Polymerizable compositions of the present invention incorporating the bromosubstituted fluorene described above may be characterized as nanocomposites. Nanocomposites are defined as a polymer matrix that contains well-dispersed nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are defined as particles that are smaller than 100 nanometers. U.S. Pat. No. 5,385,776 exemplifies the current understanding of nanocomposites incorporated within polyamides and is herein incorporated by reference. A nanoparticle is generally an inorganic particle such as a metal, metal oxide, metal nitride, metal carbide or metal chloride. In accordance with the present invention, the use of high index nanoparticles increases the refractive index of compositions incorporating the same. Preferred nanoparticles include crystalline zirconia, although other high index nanoparticles such as titania, antimony, mixtures of metal oxides, and mixed metal oxides are acceptable. Crystalline zirconia is preferred over amorphous zirconia due to the greater refractive index of compositions containing crystalline zirconia. Functionalized silica nanoparticles may be used for added reinforcement, although it lowers the refractive index of the cured coating. Examples of useful zirconia are those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,376,590, and examples of titania are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,432,526, both incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Surface modification of the nanoparticles relates to the reaction of specific molecules on the surface of particles, and is useful in achieving good dispersion within the polymer matrix. Accordingly, the nanoparticles are preferably treated with surface modifying agents such as carboxylic acids, silanes and/or dispersants to help compatibilize them with the polymer matrix. U.S. Pat. No. 6,329,058 exemplifies typical surface modifiers and is herein incorporated by reference. In essence, it is believed that surface modification prevents particle agglomeration thereby facilitating particle dispersion within the monomers and resins, and therefore enhancing the transparency of the coating. Preferred surface modifiers are carboxylic acids and silanes including methoxyethoxyethoxyacetic acid (MEEAA) and A1230 (a polyethersilane or PEG-silane). The use of surface modifiers with high refractive index is also preferred and includes naphthyl acetic acid and trimethoxy phenyl silane.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The nanoparticles of the present invention may also be surface modified by reactive surface modifiers. Reactive surface modification means that surface modifiers are employed that include functional groups that facilitate polymerization in addition to functionality that can either adsorb or covalently bond with the particle surface. When a coating of the present invention is polymerized (or cured), it forms a nanocomposite having particles covalently linked to the polymer matrix. When employing mixtures of nanoparticles, a combination of benefits may be realized. For example, surface modified zirconia may be added to raise the refractive index, while surface modified silica may be added to further enhance durability.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Compositions of the present invention may further contain any of the well known Type I and Type II UV photoinitiators, such as the substituted acetophenones, benzoins, phosphine oxides, benzophenone/amine combinations, and other photoinitiator classes well known to those in the art. Exemplary photoinitiators include Irgacure™ 819, Darocure™ 1173, or TPO supplied for example by Ciba Geigy of Tarrytown, N.Y. It is believed that radical photoinitiators cleave in the presence of ultraviolet light to form radicals that initiate the polymerization of the acrylate and methacrylate functional groups in the formulation to form the crosslinked nanocomposite. Known types and classes of radical photoinitiators may be employed as described in, “Chemistry and Technology of UV &amp; EB Formulation For Coatings, Inks, &amp; Paints” of Volume 3 of Photoinitiators for Free Radical Cationic Polymerization, published by SITA Technology Ltd., Gardiner House, Broomhill Road, LONDON SW18184JQ ENGLAND, herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Specific photoinitiators which are useful in the compositions of the invention include onium salts as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,676, herein incorporated by reference. Onium salts have been found to be useful as coinitiators in high speed visible light curing of free radically polymerizable systems. Photoinitiators are typically employed from about 0.05 wt % to about 10 wt %, and more preferably at about 1 to 4 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The invention is further illustrated, but not thereby limited, by the Examples given below. In particular, the examples given provide a template for production of a class of compounds characterized as bromo-substituted fluorene monomers, and also polymerizable compositions containing the same.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The following exemplifies surface modification of any suitable nanoparticle and in particular relates to the preparation of a silane-modified zirconia nanoparticle dispersion. 400.0 grams of Nalco™ zirconia sol and 26.57 grams of MEEAA (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wis.) were charged to a 1 L round bottom flask. The water and acetic acid were removed via rotary evaporation at 80° C. The powder thus obtained was redispersed in 398 grams of D.I. water. 416.56 grams of the particles dispersed in water was charged to a 2 L beaker. While stirring the particle dispersion, 800 grams of 1-methoxy-2-propanol, 45.0 grams of Silane A-174™, and 29.21 grams of Silquest A-1230™, supplied for example by OSI Specialties, a Crompton Corporation, of Greenwich, Conn. This mixture was slowly added to the beaker. This mixture was then poured into two quart-sized jars, sealed and heated to 90° C. for three hours. The contents of the jars were removed and concentrated via rotary evaporation to 40.43 wt % zirconia. 1268.0 grams of deionized water and 42.0 grams concentrated aqueous ammonia (29% ammonia) were charged to a 4 L beaker. The concentrated dispersion was added slowly to the beaker while stirring. The white precipitate thus obtained was isolated via vacuum filtration and washed with additional deionized water. The damp solids were dispersed in methylethylketone (MEK). The resultant silane modified zirconia dispersion contained 14.89% zirconia. U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,378, herein incorporated by reference, further describes other inorganic oxide particles useful as nanoparticles, and, aqueous, organic, and mixed sols that may be employed when surface modifying the nanoparticles of the present invention. Mixed oxides containing more than one type of inorganic atom may also be employed as described in U.S. patent application No. US2003 0165680, herein incorporated by reference. Accordingly, in some embodiments, Ti/Sb mixed oxide nanoparticles may be combined with additional nanoparticles having a different elemental composition (e.g., silica, zirconia, alumina, titania, antimony pentoxide). Desirably, such additional nanoparticles, if present, have an average particle size comparable to that of the Ti/Sb mixed oxide nanoparticles. Such nanoparticles may be commercially obtained, for example, from Nalco Chemical Co. (Naperville, Ill.) or Nyacol Nano Technologies, Inc. (Ashland, Mass.). Exemplary additional nanoparticles are also described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,037,579; and 6,261,700; which disclosures are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Examples 11 and 12 (as 5% solids, 95% MEK), were coated, dried, and UV cured with a Fusion Systems UV source (employing a “D” bulb) to a nominally 80 nm thickness on a 5 um film of 906 hardcoat on top of a polyester substrate. Example 3 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,299,799, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, describes an exemplary hardcoat employed in the present invention. First surface reflection measurements were obtained using an MPC 3100 spectrophotometer in accordance with standardized testing method, First Surface Total and CP Reflection Measurement Using the Shimadzu Spectrophotometer. The thickness of the single high index optical layer on 906 hardcoated PET can be calculated from the following relationship:

<p id="p-0037" num="0039">Ideally, the samples will reflect maximally at 550 nm. The higher reflection at the peak of Example 11 v. Example 12 occurs due to the addition of the low refractive index multifunctional acrylate PETA in Example 12. Tables 3 and 4 given below illustrate coated and cured samples, UV-VIS measurement correlating to thickness, and the abrasion resistance results to date. The cured samples were evaluated for durability through:

<p id="p-0038" num="0043">Refractive indices were calculated on the basis of a volume average of the RI of the individual components. The refractive index of neat liquid materials was measured on a Zeiss refractometer. Solids were melted and then measured promptly. Refractive index of a coating is often found to increase 0.01-0.02 after UV curing, as a consequence of increasing coating density.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0047">Examples 13-17 were prepared in the same way as examples 11 and 12 with the same surface modified zirconia and resins, and at the wt % ranges and with the solvent listed in the table. It should be emphasized that although the refractive index of Examples 12-16 are below 1.6, when cured, the refractive index of compositions formed in accordance with the present invention generally rises to an index at or above 1.6.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">The cured samples were evaluated for durability by mechanically rubbing the sample with a 6 mm “stylus” wrapped with 24 layers of cheesecloth with a 2.2 kg weight onto the stylus (plus the weight of the stylus) and noting how many passes or “rubs” were performed without damage being observed and at how many passes or “rubs” damage was observed. The results are given in an X/Y format, where the number X indicates the number of passes where the sample remained unchanged visually from the abrasion. The number Y represents the point at which damage was observed. Unacceptable abrasion resistance is defined as failure below 25 rubs. The samples are examined at 25, 50, 150, and 200 rubs, but not in between.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0051">The ZrO2 sol (279.85 g, 40.05% solids, 36.02% ZrO2) was charged to a 1 qt jar. De-ionized water (150 g) was charged with stirring. Methoxypropanol (455 g), Methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy silane (26.33 g) and A1230 (17.8) were charged to a 1 liter beaker with stirring. The methoxypropanol mixture was then charged to the ZrO2 sol with stirring. The jar was sealed and heated to 90 C for 4 hr. After heating the mixture was stripped to 350 g via rotary evaporation. Copending U.S. application Ser. No. 11/027426, filed Dec. 30, 2004, describes exemplary 3M zirconia particles and is hereby incorporated by reference. Nalco and Buhler also provide zirconia particles in accordance with the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0053">Other additives may be included in the present compositions. For example, UV sensitizers, oxygen scavengers, and other components useful in free radical curing may be employed as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">Films made in accordance with the present invention may be coupled, layered, laminated, and/or otherwise coupled to other films or display devices in accordance with the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,378, herein incorporated by reference, describes a process of bonding layers of film together and also of bonding the an antireflective film, for example, upon a display device. The same process may be employed in accordance with the present invention. Known techniques of preparing multilayer films may be employed to include spin coating, knife coating, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">In yet another aspect of the invention, the optical films described above are included within an antireflective film construction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, a coating <b>10</b>, and preferably an antireflective coating, contains a substrate <b>12</b> formed from PET or polycarbonate, or any other material recognized for its utility as a substrate in antireflective films. An optional adhesive <b>14</b> may be provided on one side of the substrate <b>12</b> whereby the substrate <b>12</b> is coupled to a display device <b>16</b> and also to a juxtaposed layer outwardly oriented from the substrate <b>12</b>. In accordance with the present invention, a hardcoat layer <b>18</b> is coupled to and layered over or otherwise fixed to substrate <b>12</b> in a known manner thereby forming an outwardly oriented layer in physical contact with substrate <b>12</b>. An optical layer <b>20</b> having a relatively high refractive index of at least 1.6, formed as described above, is next coupled to and/or layered over hardcoat layer <b>18</b>. If desired, the construct <b>10</b> may include other layers typically used in antireflective film such as a relatively lower refractive index layer <b>22</b>, or an anti-smudge layer (not shown) as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">The low index layer <b>20</b> may be formed as known in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 6,723,423 exemplifies the known understanding of forming a low refractive index layer and is herein incorporated by reference, although not by way of limitation. An exemplary low index layer may be formed from low refractive index fluoropolymer compositions and derived from an interpenetrating polymer network or semi-interpenetrating polymer network which includes a reactive fluoroplastic and/or a fluoroelastomer (i.e. the functional fluoropolymer phase) blended with multi-functional acrylates (i.e. the acrylate phase) such as trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and optionally additional fluorinated mono-functional acrylates or multi-functional fluorinated acrylates which can be coated and cured by ultraviolet light or by thermal means. The presence of an acrylate crosslinker provides a composition with both low refractive index and improved adhesion to high index polymer substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) or hard coated PET films. The low index coating mixture preferably describes a reactive high molecular weight fluoropolymer(s) that can participate in the crosslinking reactions between the monomeric multi-functional acrylates. This enhances the crosslinkability of the fluoropolymer phase to the forming polyacrylate phase and produces a co-crosslinked, interpenetrating or semi-interpenetrating polymer network with enhanced interfacial contact between the high index layer and the low index layer and thereby improves durability and low refractive index.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0057">Various optional permanent and removable grade adhesive compositions <b>14</b> may be coated on the opposite side of the substrate <b>12</b> (i.e. to that of the hardcoat <b>18</b>) so the article <b>10</b> can be easily mounted to a display surface. Typically, the adhesive <b>14</b>, substrate <b>12</b>, and hard coating layer <b>18</b> are prepackaged as a film <b>19</b> having a release layer (not shown) attached to the adhesive <b>14</b>. The release layer is then removed and the adhesive layer <b>14</b> coupled to a housing or other area of the display <b>16</b> to form the optical display <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0058">Suitable optional adhesive compositions <b>14</b> include (e.g. hydrogenated) block copolymers such as those commercially available from Kraton Polymers, Westhollow, Tex. under the trade designation “Kraton G-1657”, as well as other (e.g. similar) thermoplastic rubbers. Other exemplary adhesives include acrylic-based, urethane-based, silicone-based and epoxy-based adhesives. Preferred adhesives are of sufficient optical quality and light stability such that the adhesive does not yellow with time or upon weather exposure so as to degrade the viewing quality of the optical display. The adhesive can be applied using a variety of known coating techniques such as transfer coating, knife coating, spin coating, die coating and the like. Exemplary adhesives are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0012936, herein incorporated by reference. Several of such adhesives are commercially available from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn. under the trade designations 8141, 8142, and 8161. The substrate layer <b>12</b> may consist of any of a wide variety of non-polymeric materials, such as glass, or polymeric materials, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), bisphenol A polycarbonate, cellulose triacetate, poly(methyl methacrylate), and biaxially oriented polypropylene which are commonly used in various optical devices.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0059">It is contemplated that the present invention will find primary application in optical coatings and films including antireflective film, for example. However, it is not limited thereto. It will also be understood that the foregoing description of an embodiment of the present invention is for illustrative purposes only. As such, the various structural and operational features herein disclosed are susceptible to a number of modifications commensurate with the abilities of one of ordinary skill in the art, none of which departs from the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
