<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) apparatus, and more particularly to an LCD apparatus having metal chassis to reduce the size and weight of the LCD apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An LCD apparatus, in general, is a display apparatus for displaying images using liquid crystal. The LCD apparatus has advantages such as lighter weight and smaller size in comparison with a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The LCD apparatus is generally divided into a liquid crystal controlling part for controlling the liquid crystal and a light supplying part for supplying light to the liquid crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The liquid crystal controlling part includes an LCD panel for displaying images and a driving module for driving the LCD panel. The LCD panel includes a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) substrate, liquid crystal and a color filter substrate. The TFT substrate is a transparent glass substrate on which TFTs are disposed in association with a voltage providing line and a first electrode. Each of the TFTs includes a gate electrode, a channel layer, a source electrode and a drain electrode. The first electrode is made of ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) or IZO (Indium Zinc Oxide) and disposed corresponding to each of drain electrodes of the TFTs. The voltage providing line includes gate lines and data lines to provide a driving signal to the TFTs. The gate lines are disposed corresponding to columns of the TFTs, and each of the gate lines provides a gate turn-on signal to the TFTs arranged in a column direction. The data lines are disposed corresponding to rows of the TFTs, and each of the data lines provides a data signal to the TFTs arranged in a row direction. The driving module receives an image signal generated from an external information-processing device and generates the driving signal to timely apply the driving signal to the gate and data lines. The color filter substrate combined to the TFT substrate includes a transparent substrate, a color filter and a second electrode. The color filter includes a red color filter, a green color filter and a blue color filter disposed on the transparent substrate in a matrix configuration. The second electrode made of the ITO or IZO is disposed over the transparent substrate to cover the color filter. The second electrode receives a predetermined reference voltage, so that an electric field is applied between the first and second electrodes. The liquid crystal is interposed between the color filter substrate and TFT substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The light supplying part includes a middle receiving container, a bottom receiving container, a light guide plate, a lamp assembly and an optical sheet. The lamp assembly employs a CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp) for generation the light. The light guide plate receives the light from the lamp and changes optical properties and light path of the light. The bottom receiving container provides a receiving space in which the lamp assembly and light guide plate are received. The optical sheet is disposed on the light guide plate and controls brightness distribution of the light emitted from the light guide plate. The middle receiving container is combined to the bottom receiving container to fix the LCD panel to the bottom receiving container. The LCD panel is fixed to the middle receiving container by a top chassis combined to the middle and bottom receiving containers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Generally, the bottom and middle receiving containers are made of synthetic resin using an injection-molding manner. In order to form the bottom and middle receiving containers using the injection-molding manner, the bottom and middle receiving containers need a thickness of at least 0.4 mm. The bottom and middle receiving containers, generally, have a thickness of 0.4 mm at a first portion, where little strength is needed and a thickness of 1.2 mm to 1.5 mm at a second portion where certain strength is necessary. Also, the bottom and middle receiving containers are contracted at the time of cooling melted synthetic resin, and the first and second portions of the bottom and middle receiving containers each have a different contractile rate. As a result, the bottom and middle receiving containers are easily distorted in a manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, the bottom and middle receiving containers made of the synthetic resin have low heat conductivity, so that it is difficult to control a light transmittance of the liquid crystal because the liquid crystal is liquidized by heat emitted from the lamp assembly.</p>

The LCD panel assembly <b>400</b> includes an LCD panel <b>450</b> and a driving module <b>490</b>. The LCD panel <b>450</b> includes a TFT substrate <b>410</b>, a liquid crystal <b>440</b> and a color filter substrate <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a partially enlarged view of the TFT substrate of the LCD panel according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the TFT substrate <b>410</b> is a transparent glass substrate on which TFTs <b>401</b> each associated with a voltage providing line <b>404</b> and a first electrode <b>405</b> are disposed in a matrix configuration. A TFT <b>401</b> includes a gate electrode “G”, a channel layer “C”, a source electrode “S” and a drain electrode “D”. The first electrode <b>405</b> is made of, for example, ITO (indium tin oxide) or IZO (indium zinc oxide) and disposed to be connected with the drain electrode “D” of the TFT <b>401</b>. The voltage providing line <b>404</b> includes a gate line <b>403</b> and a data line <b>402</b> to provide a driving signal to the TFT <b>401</b>. The gate lines <b>403</b> are disposed in a column direction corresponding to the columns of the matrix configuration of the TFTs <b>401</b>. A gate line <b>403</b> provides a gate turn-on signal to the TFTs <b>401</b> arranged in a column corresponding to the gate line <b>403</b>. The data lines <b>402</b> are disposed in a row direction corresponding to the rows of the matrix configuration of the TFTs <b>401</b>. A data line <b>402</b> provides a data signal to the TFTs <b>401</b> arranged in a row corresponding to the data line <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> again, the driving module <b>490</b> includes a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) <b>492</b> and a TCP (Tape Carrier Package) <b>494</b>. The TCP <b>494</b> is connected to the gate and data lines <b>403</b> and <b>402</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and the PCB <b>492</b> is connected to the TCP <b>494</b>. The driving module <b>490</b> receives an image signal generated from an external information-processing device and generates the driving signal to timely apply the driving signal to the gate and data lines <b>403</b> and <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The color filter substrate <b>420</b> combined to the TFT substrate <b>410</b> includes color-filters (not shown) and a second electrode (not shown) disposed on a transparent substrate. The color filters each include a red color filter, a green color filter and a blue color filter and are disposed on the transparent substrate in a matrix configuration. The second electrode is disposed over the transparent substrate to cover the color filters. The second electrode receives a predetermined reference voltage, so that an electric field is applied between the first electrode <b>405</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and the second electrode (not shown). The liquid crystal <b>440</b> is interposed between the color filter substrate <b>420</b> and the TFT substrate <b>410</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</figref>, the second chassis <b>500</b> is disposed to press edge portions of the LCD panel <b>400</b> and is outwardly combined to the first to fourth sidewalls <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>140</b> and <b>150</b> of the receiving container <b>100</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the receiving container <b>100</b>, first chassis <b>300</b> and second chassis <b>500</b> are manufactured by pressing plates having a first thickness, a second thickness and a third thickness, respectively. The first thickness, second thickness and third thickness each are, for example, from about 0.1 mm to about 0.5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The receiving container <b>100</b>, first chassis <b>300</b> and second chassis <b>500</b> are, for example, made of metal material. Thus, although the receiving container <b>100</b>, first chassis <b>300</b> and second chassis <b>500</b> have the thickness of about 0.1 mm to about 0.5 mm, they may have strength enough to endure an externally applied impact. Also, the receiving container <b>100</b>, first chassis <b>300</b> and second chassis <b>500</b> may be made of metal material such as aluminum or aluminum alloy, so that the LCD apparatus <b>1100</b> may have the strength while the entire thickness thereof is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In case that a receiving container and a first chassis are made of synthetic resin, the receiving container and first chassis each have a thickness in the range of 0.4 mm to 1.2˜1.5 mm. In contrast, since the receiving container <b>100</b> and first chassis <b>300</b> are made of the metal material in the present invention, the receiving container <b>100</b> and first chassis <b>300</b> may have the thickness of about 0.1 mm to about 0.5 mm. That is, in the LCD apparatus <b>1100</b> the thickness of each of the receiving container <b>100</b> and first chassis <b>300</b> may be reduced by about 0.3 mm to about 0.7-1.0 mm, so that the entire thickness of the LCD apparatus <b>1100</b> is reduced by about 0.6 mm to about 2 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In order to further reduce the thickness of the LCD apparatus <b>1100</b>, the second thickness of the first chassis <b>300</b> may be thinner than the first thickness of the receiving container <b>100</b> and the third thickness of the second chassis <b>500</b>. For example, the first thickness of the receiving container <b>100</b> is in the range of about 0.2 mm to about 0.5 mm, the third thickness of the second chassis <b>500</b> is in the range of about 0.2 mm to about 0.5 mm, and the second thickness of the first chassis <b>300</b> is in the range of about 0.1 mm to about 0.2 mm. This is because the first chassis <b>300</b> is little subject to an external force or an external impact in comparison with the receiving container <b>100</b> and the second chassis <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As another exemplary embodiment, the first chassis <b>300</b> may be formed to have a second thickness in the range of about 0.4 mm to about 1.5 mm using the synthetic resin, and the receiving container <b>100</b> and second chassis <b>500</b> is formed to have a first and a second thickness in the range of about 0.1 mm to about 0.5 mm using the metal material, respectively. In this case, the entire thickness of the LCD apparatus <b>1100</b> is reduced in comparison with the case that the receiving container <b>100</b>, first chassis <b>300</b> and second chassis <b>500</b> are made of the synthetic resin.</p>
