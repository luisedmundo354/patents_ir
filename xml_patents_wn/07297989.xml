<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a substrate as needed for a nitride compound semiconductor and also to a semiconductor laser diode and more generally a semiconductor device, using such a substrate, and further to a method of making such devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Devices such as a semiconductor laser diode (hereinafter referred to as “LD”) and a light emitting diode (hereinafter referred to as “LED”) are applied to a variety of apparatus such as optical disk devices. In recent years, in order to obtain such an optical disk device that is larger in storage capacity, LEDs and LDs are being developed using a nitride compound semiconducting material capable of emitting light in a blue to ultraviolet region that is short in wavelength. A nitride compound semiconductor has a high breakdown voltage owing to it's a large energy band gap. Also, being large in mobility and hence excelling in high frequency properties, a nitride compound semiconductor is being used to develop various types of transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Nitride semiconductor devices such as LDs and high frequency transistors have thus been developed to form such a semiconductor device on a sapphire single crystal substrate, since a substrate of the nitride compound semiconductor such as gallium nitride (GaN) for example is not satisfactory in quality.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional methods of making a LD using a nitride compound semiconductor was disclosed in JP H07-297495 A, which is referred to herein as a first prior art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a cross sectional view illustrating the structure of a LD according to the first prior art. As shown the LD, denoted by reference character <b>40</b>, has a multilayer structure forming its active layers successively built on (11-20) planes of a single crystal sapphire substrate <b>41</b>, the structure comprising an AlN buffer layer <b>42</b>, an n<sup>+</sup>GaN layer <b>43</b>, a nAl<sub>0.1</sub>Ga<sub>0.9</sub>N layer <b>44</b>, a GaN layer <b>45</b> and a pAl<sub>0.1</sub>Ga<sub>0.9</sub>N layer <b>46</b> wherein the uppermost layer: p Al<sub>0.1</sub>Ga<sub>0.9</sub>N layer <b>46</b> has a SiO<sub>2 </sub>film <b>47</b> deposited thereon and opened for an electrode window where an electrode <b>48</b>A is formed for the p layer <b>46</b>. While an electrode <b>48</b>B for the n layer <b>44</b> is formed on the n<sup>+</sup>GaN layer <b>43</b>. The LD <b>40</b> has a Fabry-Perot resonator whose resonant faces are made by a pair of opposite end faces which are opposed to each other in a direction perpendicular to the optical path of laser light emitted (in a direction perpendicular to the sheet of paper).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The first prior art teaches that the opposed end faces defining the resonator are obtained by cleaving the sapphire single crystal substrate <b>41</b> along its &lt;0001&gt; axis (c-axis), followed by its splitting, and further teaches that this allows the efficiency of oscillations by the LD <b>40</b> using a nitride compound semiconductor to be improved by mirror-finishing the opposed end faces with precision.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand there is a report that a zirconium diboride (ZrB<sub>2</sub>) substrate is a promising substrate for a nitride compound semiconductor (J. Suda, H. Matsunami, Journal of Crystal Growth, Vol. 237-239, pp. 210-213, 2002), which is referred to herein as a second prior art. As taught there, a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>substrate can be obtained in the form of a single crystal in a floating zone method (FZ) by high frequency induction heating, is well lattice matched with a nitride compound semiconductor, and has a good electrical conductivity. It is further shown that a nitride compound semiconductor can be epitaxially grown on a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While the first prior art in making a LD seeks to provide a (10-12) cleavage face by cleaving the sapphire substrate <b>41</b> along its c-axis, the incongruity of such a crystallographic plane with a (10-10) plane in which the nitride compound semiconductor is to be cleaved gives rise to the problem that a stable cleavage face can seldom be obtained stably therefor. As a result, the problem in turn arises that because of the inability to ensure facial precision and parallelism of the opposed end faces providing the Fabry-Perot resonator for a nitride compound semiconductor, LDs high in oscillation efficiency cannot be obtained at an acceptable yield.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A LD using III-V group semiconductor is a so-called a vertical structure device in which the front surface of active layers and the rear surface of a substrate are provided with ohmic electrodes to flow the electric current from the front side to the rear side of the substrate. Such a vertical structure device cannot here be realized, however, since the sapphire single crystal substrate <b>41</b> being an insulator cannot provide an ohmic electrode at its rear surface. Thus, for the LD <b>40</b>, it is necessary to form the electrode <b>48</b>B on the n<sup>+</sup> layer <b>43</b> as a lower part of the multi-layer structure and as on an upper surface of the device. Then, exposing the n<sup>+</sup> layer <b>43</b> on an upper surface of the device in the course of crystal growth of LD multiple layers requires suspending crystal growth when the n+ layer <b>43</b> has grown and covering such an electrode area with an insulator such as SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>47</b> while preventing crystal growth, followed by crystal growth of further layers, and thus performing the so-called selective growth. And, after the multiple layers have been formed, it is required to perform a further step of exposing the n<sup>+</sup> or electrode region to a device surface by etching. These added process steps give rise to problems of reduced yield and additional cost.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, the low thermal conductivity of a sapphire single crystal substrate <b>41</b> causes a nitride compound semiconductor such as a LD <b>40</b> using it to tend to rise in temperature while in operation with the result that the LD <b>40</b> has a very limited life and the high frequency transistor fails to achieve desired output and efficiency. Hence, there is the problem that a sapphire single crystal substrate <b>41</b> prevents a nitride compound semiconductor device from fully exhibiting its essential performance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As for the second prior art, using a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>substrate as a substrate, for example, a LD requires the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>substrate to be cleaved simultaneously in forming the resonant faces of the LD. There is, however, the problem that the clear cleavage plane of a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>substrate has not yet been identified.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In view of the problems mentioned above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a substrate that has a cleavage face as same as that of a nitride compound semiconductor and is electrically conductive. Further objects of the present invention are to provide a semiconductor device e.g., a semiconductor laser diode, using such a substrate and to provide a method of making such devices.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to certain suitable forms of implementation thereof illustrated in the drawing figures.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">At the outset, an explanation is given in respect of a substrate that represents a first form of implementation of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has views diagrammatically illustrating the structure of a substrate that represents a first form of implementation of the present invention wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) is a plan view of a diboride XB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>) is a cross sectional view taken along the line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the single crystal substrate, denoted by reference character <b>1</b>, consists of diboride XB<sub>2 </sub>(where X is either Zr (zirconium) or Ti (titanium) and B is boron.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Here, mention is made of the single crystal substrate <b>1</b> as being made of ZrB<sub>2 </sub>when X is Zr as an example. The ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> has its main surface or front face <b>2</b> constituted by a (0001) crystallographic plane and having a short side L<b>1</b> and a long side L<b>2</b>, the short side <b>4</b> having its side face constituted by either (10-10) or (11-20) crystallographic plane and being orientation flat.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>) is a cross sectional view taken along the line A-A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>). The substrate has its rear face denoted by reference character <b>3</b>. The substrate <b>1</b> has a thickness t that is preferably 0.1 mm or less for ease of cleaving the substrate <b>1</b> as mentioned below.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Mention is next made of cleaving ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate of the present invention. A ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> having a thickness of 0.06 mm as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is scribed using a diamond pen on its front or rear face <b>2</b> or <b>3</b> under a pressure applied to the (0001) face <b>2</b> parallel to the (10-10) plane <b>4</b> with a scribe line <b>5</b> as a base line for cleaving.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Mention is next made of operations and effects of a substrate of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A large number of ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrates were prepared and cleaved by applying a mechanical or thermal shock to each of them. Thorough observation of the cut surfaces they then had indicates that a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate with its principal surface constituted by (0001) crystallographic plane <b>2</b> and its thickness reduced to 0.1 mm or less can be cleaved or broken linearly with its cut surface made parallel to (10-10) plane <b>4</b> and along a nodal line where (10-10) plane <b>4</b> and (10-11) plane intersect in the (0001) plane <b>2</b>. Thus, while a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> with a (0001) face <b>2</b> has hitherto been deemed difficult to cleave, it has been found that this can be done to provide a favorable cut surface when the substrate is reduced in thickness to 0.1 mm or less and further it has turned out to be in a (10-10) plane that provides such a favorable cut surface in a so thinned ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> with a (0001) face <b>2</b>, rather than in a (10-11) plane as an intrinsic cleavage plane thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The fact that it is in (10-10) plane <b>4</b> that provides a favorable cut surface in such a thinned ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b>, rather than in a (10-11) plane as an intrinsic cleavage plane thereof can be reasoned as below.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">First, the relationship in position between a (10-11) plane and a (10-10) plane <b>4</b> in a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> is to be noted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating relative positions of principal planes in a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>crystal. ZrB<sub>2 </sub>has a crystallographic structure of hexagonal system in which a1-axis, a2-axis and a3-axis lie to extend in the base of a hexagonal pole and c-axis extends in a direction perpendicular to the base. As shown, the base of the hexagonal pole lies in a (0001) plane <b>2</b> and is hexagonal having a side whose length is equal to a lattice constant a. It is also shown that the (0001) plane <b>2</b> makes an angle of 90° with a (10-10) plane <b>4</b> and an angle of 52.15° with a (10-11) plane <b>7</b>. And the (10-11) and (10-10) planes <b>7</b> and <b>4</b> intersect at a nodal line <b>8</b> in the (0001) plane <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a relative position of (10-11) plane in a substrate having a (0001) face in a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate. As shown, the angle that the (10-11) plane <b>7</b> which is an intrinsic cleavage plane makes with the (0001) plane <b>2</b> is 52.15° and not 90°. As a result, there develops a deviation between the nodal lines at which the (10-11) plane <b>7</b> intersects the front and rear surfaces <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, respectively, of a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Why can the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> be favorably cleaved in a (10-10) plane <b>4</b>, rather than in a (10-11) plane <b>7</b> as an instinct cleavage plane? First of all, that will be because a stress exerted subsequent to scribing is hard to be impressed on the intrinsic (10-11) plane <b>7</b> that is not perpendicular to the (0001) plane <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, it is thought that since the (10-11) plane <b>7</b> is higher than the (10-10) plane <b>4</b> in yield point to a stress applied subsequent to scribing, the substrate is easier to be cut in the (10-10) plane <b>4</b>. To wit, if the substrate is thinned, it is presumed that even if a difference in yield point to a given stress between the (10-10) plane <b>4</b> easier to be cut and the (10-11) plane <b>7</b> harder to be cut, the (10-10) plane <b>4</b> easier to be cut will take the lead in being cut.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">On the other hand, as the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> is made thicker, it is presumed that the (10-10) plane <b>4</b> which was easier to be cut if the substrate is thinner will have its yield point to a stress increased, thus becoming hard to be cut easily, too. As a result, the substrate will be broken with its cut surface bending from the (10-10) plane <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As for a TiB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate, the (10-11) plane <b>7</b> makes an angle of 50.9° with the (0001) plane <b>2</b> and it is shown that such a substrate, too, can be cleaved in the (10-10) plane <b>4</b>, as is the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> to provide a favorable cut surface stably when the substrate has its thickness reduced to 0.1 mm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate has a lattice constant of a=3.169 Å which is close to lattice constants: a=3.189 Å and 3.112 Å of GaN and AlN as nitride compound semiconductors and can thus be lattice matched with them.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Ga<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>1-x</sub>N as a mixed crystal nitride compound semiconductor has its lattice constant varying according to its composition ratio, which according to the Vegard's law can take a value between those of GaN and AlN, and can then be lattice matched favorably with a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate here.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate is chemically stable and has a specific resistance of several μΩ·cm. This substrate is optimum for use as a substrate and an electrode for a diode or bipolar device using a nitride compound semiconductor, namely, as a substrate and an electrode in a vertical structure device in which an electric current is flown from a front side of the device vertically to the substrate. Further, a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> has a thermal conductivity that is substantially equal to that of Si and about three times as large as those of GaAs or sapphire substrates. Therefore, a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> is suitable to dissipate heat from a nitride compound semiconductor device formed on the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate. On the other hand, a TiB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate has a lattice constant: a=3.030 Å which is somewhat smaller than that of a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> but is well lattice matched with GaN and AlN. It should be noted further that Zr<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>x-1</sub>B<sub>2 </sub>as a solid solution of ZrB<sub>2 </sub>and TiB<sub>2 </sub>can also be used to form a substrate for a nitride compound semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Thus, in accordance with the present invention a (0001) faced XB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> having a thickness of 0.1 mm or less is provided that permits stably obtaining a cleavage surface lying in (10-10) plane <b>4</b> that is congruent with (10-10) plane in which a cleavage surface of a nitride compound semiconductor lie. Moreover, such a XB2 single crystal substrate <b>1</b> has a low electrical resistivity and a high thermal conductivity and is therefore well suited as a substrate for a nitride compound semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Mention is next made of a specific example of the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> has views illustrating a specific example of the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) is a plan view of a round single crystal substrate of ZrB<sub>2 </sub>that represents a substrate of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) is a cross sectional view taken along the line B-B. The round single crystal substrate of ZrB<sub>2 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) has its main surface lying in a (0001) plane <b>2</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A (10-10) plane <b>4</b> or (11-20) plane to constitute the cleavage plane is indicated by an orientation flat <b>6</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) shows a cross section that is identical to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>), and its repeated explanation is therefore omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">An explanation is given below in respect of a method of making a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A ZrB<sub>2 </sub>powder on the market is molded and a resultant molding is baked at a temperature of 1,400° C. in vacuum to prepare a raw material bar of ZrB<sub>2 </sub>crystal. Using a high-frequency floating zone (FZ) method, this raw material bar is single-crystallized. The high frequency FZ method is performed in an argon gas atmosphere in which a seed crystal is disposed at a lower end of the raw material bar to breed a single crystal along the bar from its lower end upwards. The ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal thus obtained is measured by an X-ray to check its crystal orientation and a (0001) faced plate is cut out. The ZrB<sub>2 </sub>plate cut out has a thickness ranging from 0.4 mm to 0.55 mm and is then ground to have a thickness of 0.1 mm to 0.3 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Subsequently, peripheral areas of the plate to constitute substrate side faces are measured of their crystal orientation and the plate is ground to shape those peripheral areas until the side faces each in line with a (10-10) <b>4</b> or (11-20) crystallographic plane are reached. The shaped plate is then further machined by polishing with colloidal silica to reduce its thickness to 0.06 to 0.1 mm. A ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> according to the present invention since if exceeding 0.1 mm in thickness it is hard to cleave stably should preferably be machined to a thickness of about 0.1 mm or less with a machining inconsistency taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Mention is next made of the cleavage of a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> having a thickness of 0.06 mm is scribed on its front or rear face <b>2</b> or <b>3</b> with a scribe line <b>5</b> along a crystallographic (10-10) plane <b>4</b> using a diamond pen and then placed under a stress and cut with the scribe line <b>5</b> as a base line of cleavage.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an enlarged photographic image taken when a cut area of a (0001) faced ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate having a thickness of 0.06 mm cut parallel to a (10-10) plane is observed from obliquely above the substrate. In the Figure, a line, shown with the arrows, extending from mid the lower side of the photographic image towards the upper left corresponds to a nodal line <b>8</b> of a (0001) plane <b>2</b> and a (10-0) plane with a (10-11) plane <b>7</b>. The scribing mark <b>5</b> made on ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate is found at a lower part of the nodal line <b>8</b> indicated by an arrow. A cut section shown at the right hand side of the nodal line <b>8</b> is the (10-10) plane <b>4</b> that is shown retaining a favorable linearity to its nodal line <b>8</b> with the (0001) plane <b>2</b> in which the substrate surface lies.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Although to initiate cleaving or breaking in this method a scribe line is made on the substrate rear face over a full width defining a side of a cleavage or break area to be produced, such a scribe line may be only a part of the width, made with 2 to 3 mm long, on the substrate rear or front surface <b>3</b> or <b>2</b> so that under a stress subsequently applied to this scribe line, breakage propagates spontaneously to an area not scribed in a (10-10) plane. Thus, scribing with a diamond pen followed by stressing allows cutting while retaining a favorable linearity to the nodal line <b>8</b> with respect to the (0001) plane <b>2</b> of the substrate surface.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">This is an example that a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate of the present invention is cut and thereby cleaved using a dicer having a diamond blade generally used in splitting a device.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Using such a dicer the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> of 0.06 mm thick in a shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> was cut from its (0001) crystallographic face <b>2</b> along a (10-10) crystallographic plane <b>4</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an enlarged photographic image of a cut area resulting from cutting a (0001) faced ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> of 0.06 mm thick along a (10-10) crystallographic plane using a dicer.

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Mention is next made of a comparative example in which a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate large in thickness is likewise broken.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the structure of a LD that represents the second form of the present invention and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a cross sectional view of the LD structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> taken in the direction of an optical path. A LD <b>10</b> according to the present invention has a LD structure <b>11</b> formed on a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> that is facially oriented in a (0001) plane. The LD structure <b>11</b> is provided in its uppermost part with a stripe electrode <b>17</b> and on a rear surface of the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>substrate <b>1</b> with a counter electrode <b>18</b>. The ZrB<sub>2 </sub>substrate <b>1</b> has a thickness preferably of 0.1 mm or less. The structure has opposed end faces <b>19</b> (<b>19</b>A, <b>19</b>B) and <b>20</b> (<b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B) formed by cleaving perpendicular to the optical path indicated by reference character <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Here, a first pair of opposed end faces <b>19</b>A and <b>20</b>A constitute a Fabry-Perot resonator of the LD structure <b>11</b> made of a nitride compound semiconductor and lie each in a (10-10) plane <b>4</b>, and a second pair of opposed end faces <b>19</b>B and <b>20</b>B are as of the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> and lie in the same (10-10) planes <b>4</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The LD structure <b>11</b> comprises multiple active layers of the nitride compound semiconductor, which are successively formed as an n-type (n<sup>+</sup>) low resistance GaN layer <b>12</b>, an n-type Al<sub>0.1</sub>Ga<sub>0.9</sub>N layer <b>13</b>, a Ga<sub>0.9</sub>In<sub>0.1</sub>N active later <b>14</b>, a p-type Al<sub>0.1</sub>Ga<sub>0.9</sub>N layer <b>15</b> and a p-type (p<sup>+</sup>) low resistance GaN layer <b>16</b>, on the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b>. So that any depletion layer is not formed in the interface between the n<sup>+</sup> GaN layer <b>12</b> and the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b>, it is desirable that a high concentration Si as impurity should be doped as high as possible into the n<sup>+</sup> GaN layer <b>12</b>. Further, the electrodes <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> are provided as an ohmic electrode to a p layer on the p-type (p<sup>+</sup>) GaN layer <b>16</b> as the uppermost active layer <b>11</b> and as an ohmic electrode to an n layer on the rear surface of the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>substrate <b>1</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Here, use may be made of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N (where x+y+z=1) as the multiple layers of the nitride compound semiconductor that constitutes the LD structure <b>11</b>. Further, while the LD structure <b>11</b> here illustrated is a so-called double hetero structure, use may also be made of a quantum well or multiple quantum well structure.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Mention is made of features of the LD constructed as mentioned above as the second form of implementation of the present invention. Being identical to that as a cleavage plane of the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> having a thickness of 0.1 mm or less, a (10-10) plane as a cleavage plane of a nitride compound semiconductor constituting an end face of the Fabry-Perot resonator can not only be cleaved easily but also be obtained as a mirror surface high in planarity. Thus, compared with those of the LD <b>40</b> with a nitride compound semiconductor using a sapphire substrate according to the first prior art, there can be obtained here well reproducibly cleavage faces <b>19</b>A and <b>20</b>A being mirror surfaces extremely high in planarity, highly suitable to form end faces of the Fabry-Perot resonator. This permits reducing the loss, while improving the Q value, of the Fabry-Perot resonator for the LD <b>10</b> and lowering the threshold current for lasing the LD <b>10</b>. Further, in contrast to the LD <b>40</b> with a nitride compound semiconductor using the sapphire substrate <b>41</b> according to the first prior art, the LD <b>10</b> of the present invention permits forming an ohmic electrode <b>18</b> to an n layer on the rear surface of a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> being electrically conductive. This in turn permits the LD <b>10</b> of the present invention to be realized in a vertical structure as same as that with III-V group compound semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The LD <b>10</b> which according to the present invention can be realized by a vertical structure using nitride compound semiconductor eliminates the need to form an n-layer electrode <b>48</b>B on a device as in the LD in the first prior art. This in turn makes unnecessary any step as required to expose the n<sup>+</sup>GaN layer <b>43</b> on the device and significantly reduces the total processing time period, thereby reducing the cost of manufacture while improving the yield of products. Also, with a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> being larger in thermal conductivity than a sapphire substrate <b>41</b>, a LD <b>10</b> according to the present invention much excels in heat dissipation. This allows the LD <b>10</b> of the present invention to produce the same output power of LD <b>40</b> at a junction temperature lower than that at which the LD <b>40</b> in the first prior art. Thus, the LD <b>10</b> can be continuously operated longer and have an extended lifetime over the LD <b>40</b> with a marked increase in operating reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, mention is made of the manufacture of a LD using a substrate of the present invention as a third form of implementation thereof. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref><i>a</i>), a LD active layer <b>11</b> of a nitride compound semiconductor is first formed using a CVD (MOCVD) or molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) method using organometallic compounds on a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> that is facially oriented in a (0001) plane <b>2</b> by crystallographically growing an n<sup>+</sup> GaN layer <b>12</b>, an n-type Al<sub>0.1</sub>Ga<sub>0.9</sub>N layer <b>13</b>, a Ga<sub>0.9</sub>In<sub>0.1</sub>N active later <b>14</b>, a p-type Al<sub>0.1</sub>Ga<sub>0.9</sub>N layer <b>15</b> and a p-type p<sup>+</sup> GaN layer <b>16</b> successively on the substrate <b>1</b>.

ZrB<sub>2 </sub>and a nitride compound semiconductor being equally hexagonal crystallographically, the nitride compound semiconductor here is grown epitaxially with a crystal orientation congruous with that of ZrB<sub>2 </sub>in each of (0001), (10-10) and (11-20) directions.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref><i>b</i>), the uppermost p<sup>+</sup> GaN layer <b>16</b> in the LD active layer <b>11</b> is formed thereon by sputtering or electron beam vapor depo2sition with metallic layers which are heat treated to form ohmic electrodes <b>17</b>. Alternatively, the LD active layer <b>11</b> epitaxially grown may upon masking be formed with an insulator such as SiO<sub>2 </sub>by CVD while windowed regions in the form of stripes such that they form ohmic electrodes <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref><i>c</i>), the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> when generally 0.1 mm or less in thickness is formed on its rear surface by sputtering or electron beam vapor deposition with a metallic layer which is heat treated to from an ohmic electrode <b>18</b> to the n layer. On the other hand, when the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> has a thickness of, say, 0.3 mm, then the substrate can be polished to reduce its thickness to 0.1 mm or less and thereafter the ohmic electrode <b>18</b> may be formed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">After the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> and the LD active layer <b>11</b> are processed as mentioned above, the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> is scribed or scribed by point on its rear surface in a direction perpendicular to the direction in which the optical path extends and cut by cleaving along broken lines A so that each of cut faces lies in a (10-10) crystallographic plane <b>4</b> of the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref><i>d</i>), each resultant ZrB<sub>2 </sub>substrate <b>1</b> is separated by a cutter with a diamond blade along (11-20) crystallographic planes of ZrB<sub>2 </sub>indicated by broken lines B into a plurality of such substrates.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Dividing a ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> whose principal surface lies in a (0001) plane <b>2</b> so that it is split parallel to a (10-10) crystallographic plane <b>4</b> allows the opposed end faces <b>19</b>A and <b>20</b>A of the multiple layers of a nitrogen compound semiconductor forming a LD active layer <b>11</b> to be each a surface that is smooth and high in planarity. This permits a LD <b>10</b> formed on the ZrB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate <b>1</b> to form between such opposed end faces <b>19</b>A and <b>20</b>A a Fabry-Perot resonator that is small in loss and thus to have an improved oscillation efficiency.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As will be appreciated from the foregoing description, the present invention provides a (0001) faced XB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate having a thickness of 0.1 mm or less which can easily be cleaved along a (10-10) plane to provide a flat face and high in electrical and thermal conductivities and is thus optimum for a nitride compound semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The present invention also realizes a LD of a vertical structure having a multilayered LD structure of a nitride compound semiconductor built on the principal surface of a XB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate having a pair of cleavage faces formed along (10-10) planes. Formed continuously with these cleavage faces along (10-10) planes, a pair of opposed end faces designed to provide a Fabry-Perot resonator is high in surface precision and planarity, thereby providing the Fabry-Perot resonator that is reduced in loss, increased in laser oscillation efficiency and longer in service life.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The present invention also provides a method that can make a high performance LD of a nitride compound semiconductor in simpler process steps wherein a multilayered LD structure of the nitride compound semiconductor formed on a XB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate is split by cleaving it parallel to a (10-10) plane of the XB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal into a plurality of its divisions.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The present invention also provides a technique that can form a semiconductor device such as a LED, a photodetector, an HBT or an FET with a nitride compound semiconductor on a XB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate and can be realized a semiconductor device, especially a LED or an HBT, having a vertical structure.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The present invention further makes it possible to fabricate a high performance nitride compound semiconductor device in simpler process steps whereby a semiconductor structure of nitride compound semiconductor formed on a XB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal substrate is split, together with the substrate, along (10-10) planes of XB<sub>2 </sub>single crystal into a large number of divisions each individually constituting a semiconductor device such as a LED, a photodetector, an HBT or an FET.</p>
