<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is generally directed to subsea completion systems for oil and gas wells, and, more particularly, to, in one embodiment, a subsea system comprising a top flow Christmas tree.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A typical subsea well comprises a high pressure wellhead housing which supports one or more casing hangers located at the upper ends of strings of casing that extend into the well. The system further comprises a tubing hanger that supports a string of production tubing through which the oil and/or gas products will eventually be produced. Such a system further comprises a production tree or Christmas tree, e.g., a horizontal or vertical Christmas tree, that contains one or more production bores and a plurality of actuatable valves to control the flow of fluids through the production tree.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventionally, wells in oil and gas fields are built up by establishing a wellhead housing, and with a drilling blow out preventer stack (BOP) installed, drilling down to produce the well hole while successively installing concentric casing strings, which are cemented at the lower ends and sealed with mechanical seal assemblies at their upper ends. In order to convert the cased well for production, a tubing string is run in through the BOP and a hanger at its upper end landed in the wellhead. Thereafter the drilling BOP stack is removed and replaced by a Christmas tree having one or more production bores containing actuatable valves and extending vertically to respective lateral production fluid outlet ports in the wall of the Christmas tree.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such an arrangement introduces many problems which have, previously, been accepted as inevitable. For example, any operations down hole have been limited to tooling which can pass through the production bore, which is usually no more than five inch diameter, unless the Christmas tree is first removed and replaced by a BOP stack. However this involves setting plugs or valves, which may be unreliable by not having been used for a long time, down hole. The well is in a vulnerable condition while the Christmas tree and BOP stack are being exchanged and neither one is in position, which is a lengthy operation. Also, if it is necessary to pull the completion, consisting essentially of the tubing string on its hanger, the Christmas tree must first be removed and replaced by a BOP stack. This usually involves plugging and/or killing the well.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Achieving proper alignment among the various components of a completion system for a subsea well can be a very difficult and time-consuming task. The various components of a subsea completion system, e.g., wellhead, Christmas tree, tubing hanger, etc., are arranged in a stacked configuration wherein each of the various components must be oriented relative to one another or to a fixed reference point, e.g., the wellhead or a guide base. Such orientation is required to insure that the various components properly interface with one another, and to insure that the production outflow line is properly directed toward another subsea component, e.g., a manifold, located on the sea floor. More specifically, proper angular alignment is required to insure that various fluid flow bores and electrical and/or hydraulic lines properly interface with one another when the various components and emergency disconnect devices are stacked up. A very high degree of accuracy, e.g., ±2 degrees, is required in orienting the various components to one another and relative to other subsea components. Such precise alignment is necessary if proper connections are to be made without damage as the devices are lowered into engagement with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This orientation problem is exacerbated in the case of subsea wells as the various devices which are to be stacked up are run down onto guide posts or a guide funnel projecting upwardly from a guide base. The post receptacles which ride down on to the guide posts or the entry guide into the funnel do so with appreciable clearance. This clearance inevitably introduces some uncertainty in alignment and the aggregate misalignment when multiple devices are stacked, can be unacceptably large. Also the exact orientation will depend upon the precise positions of the posts or keys on a particular guide base and the guides on a particular running tool or BOP stack and these will vary significantly from one to another. Consequently it is preferable to ensure that the same running tools or BOP stack are used for the same wellhead, or a new tool or stack may have to be specially modified for a particular wellhead. Further misalignments can arise from the manner in which the guide base is bolted to the conductor casing of the wellhead. As is clear from the foregoing, achieving proper orientation of the various components that comprise a subsea production system can be a very difficult, expensive and time-consuming task.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is directed to an apparatus and methods for solving, or at least reducing the effects of, some or all of the aforementioned problems.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an illustrative subsea completion system <b>10</b> in accordance with one illustrative embodiment of the present invention. As shown therein, in one illustrative embodiment, the present invention comprises a conventional or vertical subsea production tree (Christmas tree) <b>16</b> landed above a subsea wellhead <b>12</b>. The tree <b>16</b> may be connected to the wellhead <b>12</b> via a hydraulic subsea connector <b>20</b> or any other suitable connection means. The tree <b>16</b> comprises a flow bore <b>18</b> that is adapted to allow for the production of oil and/or gas products from the well or provide a flow path for injection of fluids or gases into the well. The flow bore <b>18</b> defines a top outlet <b>31</b>. In one particularly illustrative embodiment, the flow bore <b>18</b> is a vertical flow bore <b>18</b>, having a centerline <b>19</b>, that defines the top outlet <b>31</b>. The tree <b>16</b> further comprises one or more valves, such as a production master valve (PMV) <b>26</b> and/or production wing valve (PWV) <b>28</b>, for controlling flow through the flow bore <b>18</b>. The tree <b>16</b> may also include an annulus passageway <b>30</b>, an annulus swab valve (ASV) <b>32</b> for controlling flow through the annulus passageway <b>30</b>, and a crossover valve (XOV) <b>34</b> for controlling flow through a crossover passageway <b>35</b> connecting the annulus passageway <b>30</b> and the well annulus. One or more chemical injection lines <b>24</b> may also be provided, as is well known in the art. The tree <b>16</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrative of one type of production tree <b>16</b> that may be employed with the present invention. As will be recognized by those skilled in the art after a complete reading of the present application, the tree <b>16</b> may take other forms or have other features. For example, the tree <b>16</b> may have a non-vertical, e.g., horizontal, flow bore and outlet instead of the vertical flow bore <b>18</b> and top outlet <b>31</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Thus, the present invention should not be considered as limited to the illustrative configuration of the tree <b>16</b> depicted in the attached drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A tubing hanger <b>14</b> is employed to suspend production tubing <b>15</b> within the well. The tubing hanger <b>14</b> is positioned within the wellhead <b>12</b> below the tree <b>16</b>. The tubing hanger <b>14</b> may be landed or positioned within the wellhead <b>12</b> using a variety of known techniques. For example, the tubing hanger <b>14</b> may directly contact the wellhead <b>12</b> or may be landed in a previously installed lockdown bushing <b>43</b> (shown on the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is an enlarged partial view of the system <b>10</b> wherein the tubing hanger <b>14</b> is positioned within the wellhead <b>12</b> without use of the bushing <b>43</b>. In one embodiment, the tubing hanger <b>14</b> has a centerline <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a cross-sectional, plan view of a portion of an illustrative tubing hanger <b>14</b> that may be employed with various embodiments of the present invention. As shown therein, in one illustrative embodiment, the tubing hanger <b>14</b> comprises a flow opening <b>27</b> and a plurality of eccentrically located openings <b>21</b>, one or more of which extend through the tubing hanger <b>14</b>. In one particular embodiment, the flow opening <b>27</b> is centrally located within the tubing hanger <b>14</b>. The size, number and location of the openings <b>21</b> may vary depending on the particular application. For example, one of the openings <b>21</b> may provide access to the well annulus, while other openings or penetrations <b>21</b> may be employed for various chemical, hydraulic, electrical and/or optical lines. Metal-to-metal seals (not shown) may be provided to seal various penetrations that extend into or through the tubing hanger <b>14</b>. Thus, the number, size, location and purpose of each of the openings <b>21</b> should not be considered a limitation of the present invention. In one particularly illustrative embodiment, the tubing hanger <b>14</b> may comprise eight of such eccentrically located openings <b>21</b>. In another very illustrative example of the present invention, the top outlet <b>31</b>, the flow bore <b>18</b> in the tree <b>16</b>, and the flow opening <b>27</b> in the tubing hanger <b>14</b> may all be axially aligned with one another. In other embodiments, only the top outlet <b>31</b> may be coaxially aligned with the centerline of the wellhead <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For reasons described in more detail below, in one illustrative embodiment, the tubing hanger <b>14</b> is adapted to be positioned or landed within the wellhead <b>12</b> such that it is coarsely or non-precisely oriented relative to a fixed reference point, e.g., the wellhead <b>12</b>, a guide base (not shown), a drilling template (not shown), etc. In stating that the tubing hanger <b>14</b> may be positioned within the wellhead <b>12</b> in a non-precisely oriented fashion, it is meant that the tubing hanger <b>14</b> is not oriented in the sense of providing precise orientation between the tubing hanger <b>14</b> and the wellhead <b>12</b>, as is the case with prior art systems wherein the tubing hanger <b>14</b> was oriented to the wellhead <b>12</b> (or other fixed point of reference) with great precision, e.g., ±2 degrees using various mechanical means, such as pin/slot configurations. That is, in this embodiment, the maximum orientational accuracy that may be achieved for the non-precisely oriented tubing hanger <b>14</b> relative to a fixed reference point, e.g., the wellhead <b>12</b>, is ±5 degrees. In other embodiments, such a non-precise orientation means may have a maximum accuracy of ±10 degrees or more, depending on the application. Such non-precise orientation may be accomplished by, in one embodiment, various mechanical mechanisms known to those skilled in the art, e.g., pin/slot arrangements, pin/helix arrangements, etc. However, such mechanical means would not provide any higher degree of orientation tolerance than ±5 degrees. Such a non-precise orientation system would be ineffective in providing the precise mechanical orientation required of prior art systems, wherein the tubing hanger <b>14</b> is precisely oriented, e.g., within ±2 degrees, relative to the wellhead <b>12</b>, or other fixed reference point.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another illustrative embodiment, the tubing hanger <b>14</b> is adapted to be positioned in the wellhead <b>12</b> such that it is not oriented with respect to any fixed reference point, e.g., the wellhead <b>12</b>, guide base, etc., by any mechanical means. That is, in this illustrative embodiment, the tubing hanger <b>14</b> may be positioned in the wellhead without reference to any fixed reference point, i.e., the orientation of the tubing hanger <b>14</b> is independent with respect to the wellhead <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, by “non-oriented” it is meant that there is no mechanical orientation means, e.g., pin/slot, pin/helix, etc., employed to orient the tubing hanger <b>14</b> relative to a fixed subsea reference point, such as the wellhead <b>12</b> or a guide base.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The production tree <b>16</b> is adapted to be operatively coupled to and precisely oriented relative to the tubing hanger <b>14</b>. Once coupled together, the flow bore <b>18</b> of the tree <b>16</b> is in fluid communication with the flow opening <b>27</b> in the tubing hanger <b>14</b>. In one particular embodiment, the flow bore in the tree <b>16</b> and the flow opening in the tubing hanger <b>14</b> are coaxially aligned. The top outlet <b>31</b> may also be coaxially aligned with respect to the center-line of the wellhead <b>12</b>. The orientation between the tubing hanger <b>14</b> and the tree <b>16</b> is very precise, e.g., ±2 degrees, due to the interfacing lines, stabs, projections and openings on the tree <b>16</b> and tubing hanger <b>14</b> that operatively engage one another. The precise orientation between the tree <b>16</b> and the tubing hanger <b>14</b> may be accomplished by a variety of known mechanical techniques. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> depicts one illustrative embodiment wherein an orientation key <b>51</b> may be provided on the tubing hanger <b>14</b>, and a downwardly extending bushing <b>53</b> having an orientation slot <b>55</b> is provided on the bottom of the tree <b>16</b>. When the tree <b>16</b> engages the tubing hanger <b>14</b>, e.g., when the tree <b>16</b> is landed on the wellhead <b>12</b>, the orientation slot <b>55</b> on the bushing <b>53</b> engages the orientation key <b>51</b> on the tubing hanger <b>14</b>, and orients the tree <b>16</b> relative to the tubing hanger <b>14</b>. In other embodiments, the tree <b>16</b> may be oriented to the tubing hanger <b>14</b> using any other suitable orientation means.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In still other embodiments of the present invention, the tubing hanger <b>14</b> may be coarsely oriented, or non-precisely oriented, relative to the wellhead <b>12</b> using any suitable orientation means, and the tree <b>16</b> may be precisely oriented relative to the tubing hanger <b>14</b> using any suitable orientation means. For example, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, precise orientation between the tubing hanger <b>14</b> and a fixed reference point, e.g., the wellhead <b>12</b> or guide base, is not required. That is, the precision orientation between the tubing hanger <b>14</b> and the tree <b>16</b> may be established without regard to the orientation between the tubing hanger <b>14</b> and a fixed reference point, e.g., the wellhead <b>12</b>. Nevertheless, in some applications, it may be desirable to provide coarse, non-precise orientation capability between the tubing hanger <b>14</b> and a fixed reference point, e.g., the wellhead <b>12</b> or a guide base. For example, it may be desirable to orient the body of the tree <b>16</b> (which is relatively large) in a desired general direction such that the body of the tree <b>16</b> does not interfere with other structures that have previously been installed or will be installed at a later time. Such coarse, non-precise orientation is not provided for purposes of aligning various production outlets, stabs and openings where very high precision, e.g., ±2 degrees, is required in the orientation process. Such a coarse, non-precise orientation system would not be capable of providing such a high degree of orientation accuracy. For example, such a coarse, non-precise orientation system would not provide an orientation accuracy greater than ±5 degrees. The coarse, non-precise orientation between the tubing hanger <b>14</b> and the fixed reference point, e.g., wellhead <b>12</b>, may be provided by any of a variety of known mechanical techniques, e.g., a key/slot arrangement, a pin/helix arrangement, a key/helix arrangement, etc. Such coarse, non-precise orientation may also be provided by non-mechanical means, such as a GPS-based system or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A flowline jumper <b>22</b>, having a centerline <b>23</b>, is connected to the top outlet <b>31</b> of the flow bore <b>18</b> of the tree <b>16</b> via a flowline jumper connector <b>27</b>, which, in one embodiment, engages the flow bore <b>18</b> along the centerline <b>19</b> of the tree <b>16</b>. The flowline jumper connector <b>27</b> may comprise a swivel joint. The flowline jumper <b>22</b> may be of any desired structure and may be any desired configuration. For example, the flowline jumper <b>22</b> may be fabricated from rigid pipe or flexible conduit, it may be constructed with articulated joints, it may be buoyant or partially buoyant, and it may terminate in a horizontal or vertical connection. As described more fully below, the flowline jumper <b>22</b> may extend laterally to another subsea component <b>40</b>, e.g., a sled, a manifold, a flowline connector, or other component disposed at some distance from the subsea completion system <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the flowline jumper <b>22</b> may extend to a separate production facility (not shown) located on a surface vessel or platform or a land-based production facility.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref> depict various illustrative embodiments of a subsea system <b>10</b> in accordance with various aspects of the present invention. In general, in various embodiments, the flowline jumper <b>22</b> may be operatively coupled to any of a variety of different subsea components <b>40</b>. The illustratively depicted component <b>40</b> may be any of a variety of known subsea components employed in producing oil or gas from subsea wells, or injecting fluids or gases into such wells. For example, the subsea component <b>40</b> may be a sled, a manifold, a flowline connector, a subsea processing facility, a subsea separator, a pump unit, etc. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the subsea component <b>40</b> is a sled. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> depicts an alternative embodiment wherein the flowline jumper <b>22</b> is comprised of a flexible conduit that is adapted to be coupled to a production facility (not shown) that may be either land-based or located on a surface vessel or platform. If desired, such a flexible subsea jumper <b>22</b> may also be employed when a subsea component <b>40</b>, e.g., a manifold, is employed as part of the system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In other cases, the tubing hanger <b>14</b> may be run to the sea floor and positioned in the wellhead <b>12</b>. Thereafter, the tree <b>16</b> may be operatively coupled to the previously installed tubing hanger <b>14</b> wherein precise orientation alignment is achieved between the tubing hanger <b>14</b> and the tree <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the illustrative embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the tree <b>16</b> comprises a vertical flow bore <b>18</b> and a top outlet <b>31</b>. Because production flow occurs through the top outlet <b>31</b> of the tree <b>16</b> along the centerline <b>19</b>, there is no wing outlet on the tree <b>16</b>. This allows the system <b>10</b> to be simplified in several ways. First, elimination of the wing outlet reduces the number of valves required, thus reducing the size, weight, and complexity of the tree <b>16</b>. Second, because the flowline jumper connection <b>27</b> is along the tree centerline <b>19</b>, there is no longer a need to orient the tree <b>16</b> relative to the wellhead <b>12</b>, or other fixed reference point, because it is not necessary to “point” the production outlet in any particular direction. In previous systems employing a horizontal production outlet, a Christmas tree had to be oriented relative to a known reference (i.e. the wellhead). Because the tubing hanger was run prior to the tree, the tubing hanger also had to be oriented relative to a known reference (i.e. the wellhead), in order to ensure that the tubing hanger was aligned with the tree. With some embodiments of the present invention, it is only necessary to orient the tree <b>16</b> to the tubing hanger <b>14</b>, regardless of the orientation of either component relative to the wellhead <b>12</b>. Not only does this reduce the complexity of the tree <b>16</b> and the tubing hanger <b>14</b>, it also greatly simplifies the installation procedure, because only the tree <b>16</b> must be precisely oriented during running, instead of precisely orienting both the tree <b>16</b> and the tubing hanger <b>14</b>. This creates significant savings for the operator. Third, the centerline location of the flowline jumper connection <b>27</b> allows jumper measurements to be made much earlier in the installation process. For example, the measurements could be taken from the wellhead <b>12</b>, with the future height of the tree <b>16</b> calculated in. This allows more time for jumper <b>22</b> fabrication, and thereby reduces the cost and the risk of delay associated with the jumpers <b>22</b>. Another advantage of the concentric connection is that the tree <b>16</b> and tubing hanger <b>14</b> may be removed and re-installed in a different orientation without affecting the design of the jumper <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> are control schematics of various embodiments of the present invention that involve increasing degrees of complexity and functionality for the system disclosed herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a relatively low-function, low-cost embodiment of the invention is shown schematically.

The choke module may include an additional production valve (PSDV), a production choke (PCV) and one or more chemical lines. A second control pod (POD <b>2</b>) may be used to control the components of the choke module.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the present invention comprises a conventional or vertical subsea Christmas tree <b>16</b> landed above a subsea wellhead <b>12</b>. A tubing hanger <b>14</b> is landed within the wellhead <b>12</b> below the Christmas tree <b>16</b>. The Christmas tree <b>16</b> includes a concentric vertical flow bore <b>18</b> and one or more production bore valves for controlling flow therethrough. A flowline jumper <b>22</b> is connected to the top of the flow bore <b>18</b> via a flowline jumper connector, which engages the flow bore <b>18</b> along the centerline of the tree <b>16</b>. The flowline jumper <b>22</b> may extend laterally to a sled, manifold, flowline connector, or other component disposed at some distance from the subsea completion system. Alternatively, the flowline jumper <b>22</b> may extend to a separate production hub mounted on the subsea completion system.</p>
