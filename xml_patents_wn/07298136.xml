<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Present Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to electrical test leads, and in particular, to test leads that allow physical and electrical contact of test instruments to a device under test using a magnetic probe to connect to the device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electricians, automotive technicians and other personnel are frequently required to use various test instruments to test electrical equipment and systems such as circuit panels, power supplies (including car batteries), automotive electronics, and the like. The test instruments may include digital multimeters, phase meters, oscilloscopes, and the like. Conventionally, testing the equipment requires connecting test leads to the test instrument and then establishing electrical contact between the opposite ends of the test leads and appropriate test points on the equipment under test. For this purpose, each test lead typically includes a first suitable electrical connector for connecting the lead to the test instrument and a second suitable electrical connector for making electrical contact with the test points on the equipment under test. Both electrical connectors are generally of conventional construction, with the first electrical connector often being a plug-type connector, such as a banana-type connector, and the second electrical connector being a test probe, a clip (such as an alligator clip or any of various other types of clips suitable for temporary attachment to the test point), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Often, the electrician, technician or other tester must hold the test instrument in one hand while he manipulates one of the test probes with his other hand, thus preventing him from carrying out any other activities (since both hands are occupied). Clip-type connectors may free one hand, but require a suitable attachment point in order to work.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another issue faced by electricians and other testers is the frequent presence of potentially lethal voltages and currents that are present in and around the equipment under test. When using the test probes, or when trying to attach a clip to the equipment under test, the user thus faces the prospect of an electrical shock or even electrocution.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, a need exists for a more convenient and potentially safer type of test lead that allows the operator to couple his test lead from his test instrument to a common (possibly ground) point on the equipment under test during the entire troubleshooting or other test exercise, with no other intervention from the operator except the initial placement of the electrical connector.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It has been recognized that it would be advantageous to develop electrical cables/test leads using magnetic force at one end thereof to allow physical and electrical contact between electrical test equipment and an electrical test point. This type test leads would help eliminate the often needed physical manipulation of test leads by test personnel in the vicinity of possibly lethal voltages, allowing the test personnel to maintain a safe distance from the test equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, an electrical test lead includes: an insulated electrical cable having a proximal end and a distal end, an electrical connector disposed at the proximal end of the cable, and an electrically conductive magnetic probe disposed at the distal end.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a feature of this aspect, the electrical connector is adapted to connect to a test instrument, and the electrical connector may be a banana plug.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another feature of this aspect, the electrically conductive magnetic probe is adapted to electrically connect to a test point of a piece of equipment to be tested. The magnetic probe may include a magnetic core and an outer insulating coating retaining and partially exposing the magnetic core therein. The magnetic core may include a piece of magnetic material, which may be neodymium iron boron, to which an electrically conductive metallic coating, which may be nickel, is applied. The partially exposed magnetic core may include a surface whose shape is selected from the group consisting of: flat surface, pointed surface, concave surface, convex surface, chisel surface, and round ball spherical surface.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In yet another feature of this aspect, the magnetic probe is adapted to be oriented at a 90 degree angle relative to a longitudinal axis of the cable.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In still another feature of this aspect, the electrical test lead further includes an additional electrical test lead component electrically connected to the electrically conductive magnetic probe and extending therefrom. The additional electrical test lead component has a proximal end and a distal end, wherein the proximal end of the additional electrical test lead component is magnetically attached and electrically connected to the electrically conductive magnetic probe, and wherein the distal end of the additional electrical test lead component is adapted to electrically connect to a test point of a piece of equipment to be tested. The additional electrical test lead component may be an electrical test lead extender adapted to extend the effective length of the electrical test lead, or it may be an electrical test lead adapter having a non-magnetic electrical connector disposed at the distal end thereof. The electrical test lead may further include an additional second electrically conductive magnetic probe is disposed at the distal end of the additional electrical test lead component. A test probe, an alligator clip or the like may be disposed at the distal end of the additional electrical test lead component.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another feature of the additional electrical test lead component feature of this aspect, the additional electrical test lead component may comprise an electrically conductive connector disposed at the proximal end thereof and adapted to magnetically attach to the magnetic probe of the electrical test lead, thereby establishing an electrical connection. The electrically conductive connector may be a magnetic core, comprising a piece of magnetic material to which an electrically conductive metallic coating is applied, or the electrically conductive connector may be a ferrous metal slug that is adapted to magnetically attach to the electrically conductive magnetic probe of the electrical test lead.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method of conducting an electrical test on an electrical system includes: providing a test instrument; providing at least one electrical test lead having a proximal end and a distal end, an electrically conductive magnetic probe being disposed at the distal end; connecting the proximal end of the at least one electrical test lead to the test instrument; magnetically attaching the electrically conductive magnetic probe of the at least one electrical test lead to a test point in an electrical system, thereby retaining the magnetic probe at the test point, while maintaining an electrical connection from the test point in the electrical system, through the electrically conductive magnetic probe, to the test instrument; and using the test instrument to test an electrical parameter of the electrical system via the magnetically attached magnetic probe and the electrical connection maintained thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, an electrical test kit includes: a test instrument; and an electrical test lead, including an insulated electrical cable having a proximal end and a distal end, an electrical connector disposed at the proximal end of the cable and connected to the test instrument, and an electrically conductive magnetic probe disposed at the distal end, the probe adapted to magnetically attach to a test point in an electrical system and to provide an electrical connection from the test point through the probe, the cable and the connector to the test instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As a preliminary matter, it will readily be understood by one having ordinary skill in the relevant art (“Ordinary Artisan”) that the present invention has broad utility and application. Moreover, many embodiments, such as adaptations, variations, modifications, and equivalent arrangements, will be implicitly disclosed by the embodiments described herein and fall within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Accordingly, while the present invention is described herein in detail in relation to one or more embodiments, it is to be understood that this disclosure is illustrative and exemplary of the present invention, and is made merely for the purposes of providing a full and enabling disclosure of the present invention. The detailed disclosure herein of one or more embodiments is not intended, nor is to be construed, to limit the scope of patent protection afforded the present invention, which scope is to be defined by the claims and the equivalents thereof. It is not intended that the scope of patent protection afforded the present invention be defined by reading into any claim a limitation found herein that does not explicitly appear in the claim itself.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thus, for example, any sequence(s) and/or temporal order of steps of various processes or methods that are described herein are illustrative and not restrictive. Accordingly, it should be understood that, although steps of various processes or methods may be shown and described as being in a sequence or temporal order, the steps of any such processes or methods are not limited to being carried out in any particular sequence or order, absent an indication otherwise. Indeed, the steps in such processes or methods generally may be carried out in various different sequences and orders while still falling within the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the scope of patent protection afforded the present invention is to be defined by the appended claims rather than the description set forth herein.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Additionally, it is important to note that each term used herein refers to that which the Ordinary Artisan would understand such term to mean based on the contextual use of such term herein. To the extent that the meaning of a term used herein—as understood by the Ordinary Artisan based on the contextual use of such term-differs in any way from any particular dictionary definition of such term, it is intended that the meaning of the term as understood by the Ordinary Artisan should prevail.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Furthermore, it is important to note that, as used herein, “a” and “an” each generally denotes “at least one,” but does not exclude a plurality unless the contextual use dictates otherwise. Thus, reference to “a picnic basket having an apple” describes “a picnic basket having at least one apple” as well as “a picnic basket having apples.” In contrast, reference to “a picnic basket having a single apple” describes “a picnic basket having only one apple.”</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When used herein to join a list of items, “or” denotes “at lease one of the items,” but does not exclude a plurality of items of the list. Thus, reference to “a picnic basket having cheese or crackers” describes “a picnic basket having cheese without crackers”, “a picnic basket having crackers without cheese”, and “a picnic basket having both cheese and crackers.”Finally, when used herein to join a list of items, “and” denotes “all of the items of the list.”Thus, reference to “a picnic basket having cheese and crackers” describes “a picnic basket having cheese, wherein the picnic basket further has crackers,” as well as describes “a picnic basket having crackers, wherein the picnic basket further has cheese.”</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like components throughout the several views, the preferred embodiments of the present invention are next described. The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of an electrical test lead <b>10</b> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown therein, the electrical test lead <b>10</b> comprises an insulated electrical cable <b>14</b> having a proximal end and a distal end, with an electrical connector <b>12</b> disposed at the proximal end of the cable <b>14</b> and an electrically conductive magnetic probe <b>16</b> disposed at the distal end.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref> are a perspective, side and end view, respectively, of the magnetic probe <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a side cross-sectional view of the magnetic probe <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, taken along line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b>. As perhaps best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the magnetic probe <b>16</b> includes a partially exposed magnetic core <b>28</b> retained within an outer insulating coating <b>24</b>. The magnetic core <b>28</b> is fabricated of an electrically conductive magnetized metal and has any suitable shape and configuration, but more preferably a generally cylindrical configuration. More particularly, the magnetic core <b>28</b> is fabricated from a piece of magnetic material to which an electrically conductive metallic coating or plating is applied. A magnetic material suitable for use in the preferred embodiments of the present invention is neodymium iron boron, but other magnetic or magnetizable materials may likewise be utilized. An electrically conductive metallic coating or plating suitable for use in the preferred embodiments of the present invention is nickel, but copper, gold and other types of electrically conductive materials that may be coated or plated onto the magnetic material may likewise be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The insulating coating <b>24</b> is formed from any suitable insulating material and provides a shield that prevents the magnetic probe <b>16</b> from being short-circuited when disengaged from a live test point. Suitable insulating materials may include, but are not limited to, heat shrinkable plastic or molded thermoplastic, e.g., a resin, a nylon, and/or blends thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the insulated electrical cable <b>14</b> comprises a conductive wire <b>22</b> that is likewise covered with an outer insulating coating <b>24</b>. The distal end of the electrical cable <b>14</b> is electrically and mechanically attached to the magnetic core <b>28</b> by a solder connection <b>18</b>. Care should be exercised during the soldering process in order to not exceed the critical temperature at which magnets lose their magnetic properties. Further, conventional strain relief means (not shown) may be provided for mechanically reinforcing the solder connection <b>18</b> between the conductive wire <b>22</b> and the magnetic core <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The magnetic probe <b>16</b> may be of any suitable size and shape to accommodate the space requirements of a device under test <b>32</b> (a representation of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Moreover, during fabrication, the magnetic probe <b>16</b> may be adapted to be oriented at various angles relative to a longitudinal axis of the conductive wire <b>22</b>. For example, although as shown the magnetic probe <b>16</b> is generally coaxial with the conductive wire <b>22</b>, it will be understood that the magnetic probe <b>16</b> may instead be mounted at a 90 degree angle, i.e., perpendicularly, relative to the longitudinal axis of the conductive wire <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The electrical connector <b>12</b> attached to the proximal end of the electrical cable <b>14</b> may generally be any electrical connector, and is preferably non-magnetic electrical connector <b>12</b> of conventional design and construction. Suitable non-magnetic electrical connectors include, but are not limited to, a banana clip, an alligator clip and any other type of clip, probe or the like. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view of an electrical test lead <b>110</b> in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. The test lead <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes a conventional alligator clip <b>112</b> as the electrical connector at the end of the cable <b>14</b> opposite the magnetic probe <b>16</b>. The electrical connectors <b>12</b>, <b>112</b> are typically used to attach to a piece of test equipment <b>30</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Test equipment <b>30</b> may be any type of conventional test equipment, including, but not limited to, test instruments such as digital multimeters, oscilloscopes, phase rotation indicators, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the insulating coating <b>24</b> covers the extent of the conductive wire <b>22</b>, the solder connection <b>18</b> and the magnetic probe <b>16</b>, with only an unsoldered end of the magnetic core <b>28</b> being exposed. In a preferred embodiment, the insulating coating <b>24</b> includes two portions <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b</i>, with a first portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>covering the conductive wire <b>22</b> and the solder connection <b>18</b> and a second portion <b>24</b><i>b </i>covering the magnetic core <b>28</b>. Alternatively, however, the insulating coating <b>24</b> may comprise a single piece of insulating material extending along the conductive wire <b>22</b>, the solder connection <b>18</b> and the length of the magnetic probe <b>16</b>, leaving exposed the one unsoldered end of magnetic core <b>28</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are a side view and a side cross-sectional view, respectively, of such an alternative application of the insulating coating <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic illustration of the test lead <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> being used with a test instrument <b>30</b> and a piece of equipment <b>32</b> to be tested. As used herein, an “electrical test kit” refers to one or more test leads, of any of the types described and/or illustrated herein, in combination with a test instrument. In use, a technician may attach two of the test leads <b>10</b> between a test instrument <b>30</b> and a piece of equipment under test <b>32</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the test instrument <b>30</b> is a digital multimeter and the equipment to be tested <b>32</b> is an electrical breaker panel with a plurality of individual circuit breakers. Additional examples of equipment under test <b>32</b> may include power sources, car batteries, and the like. The respective magnetic probes <b>16</b> are magnetically attached by the technician to test points <b>34</b>, and the necessary tests are conducted. After testing is complete, the electrical connection between the test points <b>34</b> and the magnetic probes <b>16</b> may be broken by moving a magnetic probe <b>16</b> in a lateral direction relative to a test point <b>34</b> with which it is in contact.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Although not specifically illustrated, one particularly useful application for the various preferred embodiments of the present invention is in the field of automotive repair. Conventionally, when testing most automotive electrical systems, the technician uses the vehicle chassis to establish a reference ground when making readings. Because the chassis is typically made from a ferrous metal, magnetic attachment of the probes <b>16</b> to the chassis is easy and convenient to accomplish. The probes <b>16</b> may also be conveniently attached to the metal bolts of the vehicle's battery terminals and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7G</figref> are side cross-sectional views of alternative embodiments of the magnetic probe <b>16</b>. The magnetic probe <b>16</b> may have a different configuration depending on its intended use. Alternative embodiments include, but are not limited to, magnetic probes that have the surface of the exposed unsoldered end thereof shaped as follows: concave (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>), pointed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>), pointed with spring (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>), convex (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>), chisel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>), ball (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7F</figref>) and spherical (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7G</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Advantageously, the magnetic probe <b>16</b> of the electrical test lead <b>10</b> allows a user to connect a test instrument <b>30</b> to the equipment under test <b>32</b> without any need to reconnect the magnetic probe <b>16</b> once securely attached to the equipment under test <b>32</b> while conducting the necessary tests. The magnetic force applied by the magnetic core <b>28</b> temporarily retains the probe <b>16</b> against the test point <b>34</b> and thus may be left alone once placed by the user. Therefore, the physical manipulation of test leads by test personnel may be greatly reduced and in some cases eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective view of the electrical test lead <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> incorporated into a convertible test lead <b>100</b> in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. In the convertible test lead <b>100</b>, the test lead <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is connected to an electrical test lead adapter <b>60</b> that includes a second insulated electrical cable <b>64</b> having a second magnetic probe <b>66</b> at its proximal end and a test probe or other electrical connector <b>62</b> at its distal end. The connection between the electrical test lead <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the electrical test lead adapter <b>60</b> forms a magnetically-coupled convertible test lead <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is a side perspective view of the magnetic coupling of the convertible test lead <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is an end perspective view of the second magnetic probe <b>66</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> are side cross-sectional views of the magnetic coupling of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, shown in an engaged and a disengaged state, respectively. In at least one embodiment, it is preferred that one magnetic probe <b>16</b>,<b>66</b> be larger in size than the other magnetic probe <b>16</b>,<b>66</b>. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated herein, the second magnetic probe <b>66</b> is larger than the first magnetic probe <b>16</b>, but it will be understood that the relative sizes of the corresponding magnetic probes <b>16</b>,<b>66</b> may alternatively be reversed. Like the magnetic probe <b>16</b> of the test lead <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the second magnetic probe <b>66</b> comprises a cylindrical magnetic core <b>78</b> substantially covered by an insulating coating <b>74</b> that may be formed from the same material as the insulating coating <b>24</b> of the test lead <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Like the cable <b>14</b> of the test lead <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the second electrical cable <b>64</b> comprises a conductive wire <b>72</b> that is likewise covered with an outer insulating coating <b>74</b>. The proximal end of the second electrical cable <b>64</b> is electrically and mechanically attached to the magnetic core <b>78</b> by a solder connection <b>68</b>, and once again, care should be exercised during the soldering process in order to not exceed the critical temperature at which magnets lose their magnetic properties. Further, conventional strain relief means (not shown) may be provided for mechanically reinforcing the solder connection <b>68</b> between the conductive wire <b>72</b> and the magnetic core <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As described previously, the unsoldered ends of the magnetic cores <b>28</b>,<b>78</b> are left uncovered by the insulating coating <b>74</b>. In at least one embodiment, it is preferred that the magnetic core <b>78</b> of the larger magnetic probe <b>66</b> not extend to an inner surface of the insulating coating <b>74</b> surrounding it. This arrangement allows the smaller magnetic probe <b>16</b> to fit in concentric sliding relation within the insulating coating <b>74</b> of the larger magnetic probe <b>66</b> without interference from the insulating coating <b>24</b> of the smaller magnetic probe <b>16</b>. In an alternative embodiment (not shown), the magnetic core <b>28</b>,<b>78</b> of each magnetic probe <b>16</b>,<b>66</b> extends to the respective inner surface of the insulating coating <b>24</b>,<b>74</b>. In either arrangement, the exposed ends of the magnetic cores <b>28</b>,<b>78</b> may be brought into physical contact with one another, thereby establishing a magnetic connection therebetween. It will be understood that in order to facilitate this magnetic connection, the polarities of the respective magnetic cores <b>28</b>,<b>78</b> must be arranged to create attractive forces therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the magnetic probes <b>16</b>,<b>66</b> are brought into physical contact, the two probes <b>16</b>,<b>66</b> engage in a magnetic bond, and a low resistance electrical path is created therebetween. Therefore, when electrical test leads having the magnetic coupling are utilized, a low resistance electrical path is created between a test instrument <b>30</b> and a device under test <b>32</b>, passing through the first electrical cable <b>14</b>, through the first magnetic probe <b>16</b>, through the second magnetic probe <b>66</b> and on through the second electrical cable <b>64</b>, wherein the cables <b>14</b>,<b>64</b> are connected to the test instrument <b>30</b> and the device under test <b>32</b> by means of appropriate electrical connectors <b>12</b>,<b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In use, the magnetically coupled electrical connector is helpful for connecting, for example, a typical test probe <b>62</b> that is used on a device under test <b>32</b> to a test lead <b>10</b> that attaches to a test instrument, as a temporary means for releasing the test lead adapter <b>60</b> (and thus the test probe <b>62</b>) quickly from the device under test <b>32</b> and replacing it with a lead having a different electrical connector, such as an alligator clip <b>112</b>. To disengage the test lead adapter <b>60</b> from the test lead <b>10</b> that is joined by a magnetically-coupled electrical connector, a user simply pulls at either side of the magnetic connection to overcome the magnetic attraction of the two magnetic probes <b>16</b>,<b>56</b>. With such a magnetic coupling, the user can replace an adapter <b>60</b> with a test probe <b>62</b> such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> with any other adapter, having a different electrical connector, for conducting the necessary tests.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In at least some embodiments that may be preferred for their reduced manufacturing cost, the magnetic core <b>78</b> may be replaced by an electrically conductive ferrous metal slug. Although when coupled with the magnetic core <b>28</b> of the first probe <b>16</b>, a magnetic bond may still be achieved by bringing the metal slug into contact with the magnetic core <b>28</b> of the first probe <b>16</b>. Such an alternative design could not be used as a magnetic probe because the slug itself would have little or no magnetic properties, but would be generally sufficient to maintain the coupled connection with the magnetic core <b>28</b> of the first probe <b>16</b>. Such a slug could further be substituted in many of the other leads described and/or illustrated herein, with a similar potential reduction in manufacturing cost but a similar reduction in reliability and functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a perspective view of the electrical test lead <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> incorporated into another convertible test lead <b>200</b> in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. Like the convertible test lead <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, this convertible test lead <b>200</b> includes the test lead <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> connected to an electrical test lead adapter <b>160</b> that includes a second insulated electrical cable <b>64</b> having a second magnetic probe <b>116</b> at its proximal end and an electrical connector <b>112</b> at its distal end. Once again, the connection between the electrical test lead <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the electrical test lead adapter <b>160</b> forms a magnetically-coupled convertible test lead <b>200</b>. Other than the inclusion of an alternative type of electrical connector <b>112</b> (in this case, an alligator clip), the test lead adapter <b>160</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> except that the second magnetic probe <b>116</b> is somewhat different in construction. More particularly, the second magnetic probe <b>116</b> is similar to the magnetic probe <b>16</b> of the first test lead <b>10</b>, except that its magnetic core <b>28</b> is reversed in polarity in order to produce the necessary attractive forces between the respective magnetic cores <b>28</b>,<b>28</b>. The connection between the two magnetic probes <b>16</b>,<b>16</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-13C</figref>, which are a side perspective view of two disengaged magnetic probes <b>16</b>,<b>16</b>, a side cross-sectional view of two disengaged magnetic probes <b>16</b>,<b>16</b>, and a side cross-sectional view of two engaged magnetic probes <b>16</b>,<b>16</b>, respectively. This test lead adapter <b>160</b> is thus an example of the type of test lead adapter with which the test lead adapter <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may be replaced as desired by the user. Notably, the first test lead <b>10</b> is adapted to mate with either the magnetic probe <b>66</b> of the first exemplary test lead adapter <b>60</b> or the second exemplary test lead adapter <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">It will be understood that various configurations of test leads <b>10</b>,<b>100</b>,<b>200</b> may be used during testing of a device <b>32</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a first schematic illustration of some of these variations. As shown therein, a technician may attach the test instrument <b>30</b> to, for example, an electrical breaker panel <b>32</b> using one convertible test lead <b>100</b> of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and a second convertible test lead <b>200</b> of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The two illustrated test lead adapters <b>60</b>,<b>160</b> are interchangeable, and the particular test lead adapter <b>60</b>,<b>160</b> chosen may be based on the nature of the test point <b>34</b>. In this configuration, each convertible test lead <b>100</b>,<b>200</b> is being used conventionally in that their respective magnetic couplings are engaged and the test probe <b>62</b> and alligator clip <b>112</b> are being used conventionally (i.e., non-magnetically).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Significantly, the first test lead <b>10</b> of each convertible test lead <b>100</b>,<b>200</b> may also be used separately by directly attaching its magnetic probe <b>16</b> to a device under test <b>32</b> if the test points on such device <b>32</b> have a ferrous metal surface. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, which is a second schematic illustration of some additional configuration variations. As shown therein, a technician may alternatively attach the test instrument <b>30</b> to the electrical breaker panel <b>32</b> using the components of one convertible test lead <b>200</b> of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, and a second test lead <b>80</b> of conventional construction, wherein the conventional test lead <b>80</b> includes a conventional, non-magnetic electrical connector at each end with no magnetic coupling interposed therebetween. The convertible test lead <b>200</b> has been separated into a first test lead <b>10</b>, of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the test lead adapter <b>160</b>, of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. When separated, each lead <b>10</b>,<b>160</b> has a magnetic probe <b>16</b> at one end and a non-magnetic electrical connector <b>12</b>,<b>112</b> at the other end. One of the electrical connectors of the conventional test lead <b>80</b> is connected to the test instrument <b>30</b>, while the other electrical connector of the conventional test lead <b>80</b> is connected to the electrical connector <b>112</b> of the test lead adapter <b>160</b>. The magnetic probe <b>16</b> of the other end of the test lead adapter <b>160</b> is connected to a test point <b>34</b> on the device under test <b>32</b>. Finally, the first test lead <b>10</b> is used in the same way illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a perspective view of an electrical test lead extender <b>40</b> in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown therein, the electrical test lead extender <b>40</b> comprises an insulated electrical cable <b>44</b> having a proximal end and a distal end, with one type of electrically conductive magnetic probe <b>66</b> disposed at the proximal end of the cable <b>44</b> and another type of electrically conductive magnetic probe <b>16</b> disposed at the distal end. It will be apparent that other types of probes may be substituted for either probe, and that in fact the two probes may be of the same type, but the two probes <b>16</b>, <b>66</b> preferably are arranged to have opposite polarities for a purpose made evident below. The construction of the cable <b>44</b> and the two probes <b>16</b>, <b>66</b> may be identical to those described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a perspective view of the extender <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> in use as part of an electrical test lead <b>140</b>. In the illustrated arrangement, the expanded test lead <b>140</b> includes a test lead <b>10</b> and test lead adapter <b>60</b> like those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, but with the test lead extender <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> inserted therebetween. In other words, to create the test lead <b>140</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the test lead <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> has been separated into its primary components (i.e., a basic test lead <b>10</b> and a test lead adapter <b>60</b>), the probe of the basic test lead <b>10</b> has been connected to the probe <b>66</b> at the proximal end of the test lead extender <b>40</b>, and the probe <b>66</b> at the proximal end of the test lead adapter <b>60</b> has been connected to the probe <b>16</b> at the distal end of the test lead extender <b>40</b>. The result is similar in function and purpose to the test lead <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, but is longer than that test lead <b>100</b>. In other words, the length of the test lead <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> has been extended, by inserting the test lead extender <b>40</b>, to produce the test lead <b>140</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Notably, the extender <b>40</b> may be used to extend any of the various two-part test leads described and illustrated herein, provided that the magnetic polarities of the respective probes <b>16</b>,<b>66</b> of the extender <b>40</b> are arranged to permit corresponding magnetic attraction to the probes or other connectors with which they are intended to be coupled. Further, more than one extender <b>40</b> may be used in at least some preferred embodiments to provide still greater test lead length. Still further, the extender may be used with only a basic test lead <b>10</b>,<b>110</b> (i.e., use of a test lead adapter <b>60</b>,<b>160</b> is not required). Still further, each extender can itself function as a test lead (provided the test instrument <b>30</b> is of a type that permits magnetic connection thereto).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">It will be apparent that the various configurations and arrangements shown herein are merely exemplary of the possible configurations and arrangements possible by combining different electrical connectors, magnetic probes, test lead adapters and test lead extenders, together with conventional test leads, to produce convertible and non-convertible test leads, all without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a side perspective view of a magnetic coupling, using two magnetic probes <b>216</b>, <b>266</b>, shown in a disengaged state, in accordance with yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown therein, one or more of the probes <b>266</b> may be provided with ridges <b>290</b> or other textures to make it easier to grip the probe <b>266</b>. Further, the connection of either probe <b>266</b> to an electrical cable <b>264</b> may be further reinforced using multiple insulation layers <b>274</b>. The arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> also illustrates the use of probes <b>216</b>, <b>266</b> of two different sizes but whose magnetic cores flush-fit against each other. Other features known to the Ordinary Artisan for use with conventional connectors and other fittings on electrical cables will likewise be apparent and may be likewise applied to the magnetic probes of the present invention.</p>
