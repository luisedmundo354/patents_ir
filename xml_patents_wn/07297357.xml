<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for manufacturing a puffed snack by using an extruder More specifically, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for manufacturing a puffed snack having a different texture and color tone in the surface layer and the inside.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A puffed snack produced by using an extruder and using milled grains and flours as ingredients normally has the same nature and color tone in the surface layer and the inside without having any difference therebetween. This is mainly due to the ingredients, and hence the puffed snack is likely to be simple without having any individuality.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the conventional apparatus for manufacturing a puffed snack, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, there is known one in which a cutting blade D is installed so as to lightly touch the point face of a nozzle hole B provided at the point portion of an extruder A and driven by a motor M, to thereby cut the extruded dough (U.S. Pat. No. 5,435,714).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, there is known a manufacturing apparatus in which the dough extruded from a nozzle hole is drawn out by a drawing roll, a blade plate protruding radially or at a right angle with respect to the circumference of the drawing roll is fitted thereto, and the extrudate is made to pass through the drawing roll having the blade plate to thereby cut the extrudate at a right angle with respect to the extruding direction. However, neither of these apparatuses can manufacture a puffed snack having a different texture and color tone in the surface layer and the inside.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for manufacturing a puffed snack having an improved texture by making the surface layer hard and the inside soft, while giving a difference in color tone between the surface layer and the inside.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present inventors have made diligent study regarding the method for manufacturing a puffed snack and as a result have devised the present invention, in which after a coating solution or water is sprayed to a dough extruded from an extruder in the form of a rope, the extrudate is dried until the moisture content of the sprayed extrudate becomes 5 to 12% by weight and is then cut, thereby improving the texture of a puffed snack whose inside is made soft so that a puffed snack having a difference in color tone between the surface layer and the inside can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As the extruder used in the manufacturing method according to the present invention, a single-screw extruder or a twin-screw extruder is used, and either of a self-heating type using friction of ingredients and one having a heating apparatus may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The spraying, drying and cutting processing can be carried out in the following manner. That is, the dough extruded from the extruder in the form of a rope is clamped between belts, which are spanned, respectively, in a tensioned state over two pairs of drawing rolls arranged on the opposite sides of the extruding route of the extrudate so as to face each other, and while the extrudate is drawn out therefrom by the drawing rolls, the above processing is carried out. As described above, by providing the drawing process, the flow of the dough extruded from the extruder in the form of a rope after having been extruded can be made smooth. This drawing process may be provided either before the spraying process or after the drying process.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">After the cutting process, further drying may be carried out. Thereby, the dough which maintains softness suitable for cutting can be cut into a predetermined shape without getting out of shape, and dried sufficiently depending on the material, to thereby obtain a product having a complete shape.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As the ingredients of the puffed snack used in the present invention, milled grains, starch, root vegetable flours or pulse flours can also be used, and one kind or two or more kinds of these may be mixed. The milled grains include, for example, wheat grains, rye grains, corn grits, and rice grains. Starch includes, for example, wheat flour and corn flour. Root vegetable flours include, for example, potato flour, sweet potato flour, and potato flakes. Pulse flours include, for example, soybean flour, red bean flour, and green peas flour.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As the coating solution sprayed onto the surface of the extrudate, an aqueous solution containing sugar solution, egg liquid, pigment solution or an alkaline solution can be used, and one kind or two or more kinds may be mixed. The concentration of the solid thereof is preferably from 0.1 to 50% by weight. The sugar solution includes, for example, sucrose, glucose, dextrin and starch syrup. As the egg liquid, the whole egg is used, but one obtained by returning a dried egg to the original state with water, or one obtained by returning a frozen egg to the original state may be used. The pigment solution includes, for example, a solution containing one kind or two or more kinds of natural pigments such as anthocyanin, cochineal and turmeric, or fruit juice and vegetable juice. The alkaline solution includes sodium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, potassium of phosphates and sodium.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The above cutting may be performed at right angles with respect to the central axis of the extrudate, or may be performed at angles of inclination from 15 to 60 degrees inclusive, with respect to the central axis of the extrudate. Thereby, products having different sizes and shapes of the cutting plane can be obtained from the extrudate having substantially the same diameter, without changing the nozzle diameter of the extruder.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For execution of the manufacturing method of the present invention, an apparatus is used that is constituted of an extruder attached with a die having a nozzle hole provided therein, at the tip portion thereof, a spray device arranged with at least one spray nozzle for uniformly spraying the surface of the rope-shaped dough extruded from the nozzle hole, a drying device arranged adjacent to the spray device on the downstream side of the spraying device, a drawing mechanism comprising belts respectively spanned in a tensioned state so as to clamp the extrudate, over two pairs of drawing rolls arranged on the opposite sides of the extruding route of the extrudate so as to face each other, a holding cylinder for holding the extrudate, arranged at the end on the downstream side of the extruding route of the extrudate, and a cutting blade arranged in close proximity to the outlet side opening of the holding cylinder so as to be able to cut the extrudate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The cutting blade can be arranged so as to be able to cut at right angles with respect to the central axis of the extrudate, or may be arranged so as to be able to cut at angles of inclination from 15 to 60 degrees inclusive, with respect to the central axis of the extrudate. When the cutting blade is arranged so as to be able to cut at angles of inclination from 15 to 60 degrees inclusive, with respect to the central axis of the extrudate, the cutting plane of the puffed snack becomes larger than that of when the cutting blade is arranged so as to be able to cut at right angles, and the shape thereof becomes different. Hence, the variety of the shape and size of the products can be increased, only by changing the set angle of the cutting blade, without replacing the apparatus with another apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The drawing mechanism may be arranged either between the drying device and the holding cylinder, or between the extruder and the spray device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">When the cutting blade is arranged so as to be able to cut at angles of inclination from 15 to 60 degrees inclusive, with respect to the central axis of the extrudate, the outlet side opening can be formed in an angle of inclination corresponding to the cutting blade, and can include a cut receiving board integrally formed with the opening. By having this cut receiving board, blurring of the extrudate at the time of cutting the extrudate by the cutting blade can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The apparatus may not include the spray device and the drying device, depending on the materials of the puffed snack and conditions such as temperature and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A coating liquid or water is sprayed onto the surface of the extrudate T, by using the spray nozzle <b>2</b><i>a </i>in the spray device <b>2</b>, and the surface of the extrudate T is quickly dried in the drying device <b>3</b> immediately. The sprayed coating liquid is put into a spray liquid tank <b>2</b><i>b</i>, and is sprayed onto the surface of the extrudate T which is passing through the spray device <b>2</b> by the use of a feed pump <b>2</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The amount of the coating liquid or water to be sprayed is from 1 to 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the snack. If the amount of the coating liquid or water to be sprayed is less than 1 part by weight, the texture is not improved. If the amount of the coating liquid or water to be sprayed exceeds 30 parts by weight, the water content becomes excessive, and hence the puffed snack is deformed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is important to spray uniformly onto the surface of the extrudate T, and hence, it is necessary to spray in the vertical and horizontal directions, at certain positions from a plurality of spray nozzles <b>2</b><i>a</i>. If uniform spraying is not performed onto the surface of the extrudate T in the drying step, drying marks are generated on the extrudate T. As a result, the cut and molded products are likely to be bent and broken.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In order to quickly dry the moisture on the surface of the extrudate T in the drying device <b>3</b> immediately after the coating liquid or water has been sprayed, a gas burner or a heating element using direct fire or hot blast may be used. At this time, the moisture content in the dried extrudate T should be from 5 to 12% by weight. If the moisture content is less than 5% by weight, the extrudate T becomes brittle, and extruding by the drawing roll mechanism <b>4</b> becomes difficult. On the other hand, if the moisture content exceeds 12% by weight, the surface of the dough becomes sticky, which is not desirable. By the above-described spraying of the coating liquid and quick drying, there can be obtained a puffed snack having different texture and color tone in the surface layer and the inside, such that the surface layer is hard and the inside is soft.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a second embodiment relating to a puffed snack manufacturing apparatus, which uses a single-screw extruder, used for the manufacturing method of the present invention, wherein parts other than a holding cylinder <b>50</b> and the cutting blade <b>6</b> are the same as in the first embodiment. Hence, the same parts are denoted by the same reference symbols, and the description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The cutting blade <b>6</b> in this embodiment is arranged at an angle of inclination from 15 to 60 degrees inclusive, with respect to the central axis CL of the extrudate T, and the outlet side opening of the holding cylinder <b>50</b> is formed at the same angle of inclination. The cutting blade <b>6</b> and the outlet side opening of the holding cylinder <b>50</b> are arranged so as to come in light contact with each other. A cut receiving board <b>51</b> is integrally fitted to the outlet side opening of the holding cylinder <b>50</b>. This cut receiving board <b>51</b> is fitted to the outlet side opening of the holding cylinder <b>50</b>, in the form of a doughnut with the same angle of inclination, so that the cutting blade <b>6</b> slides on the surface of the cut receiving board <b>51</b> at the time of a cutting and rotating operation of the cutting blade <b>6</b>. By this cut receiving board <b>51</b>, blurring of the extrudate T at the time of cutting the extrudate T by the cutting blade <b>6</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The angle α between the central axis CL of the extrudate T and the cutting axis XL of the cutting blade <b>6</b> having a drive motor M is from 15 to 60 degrees inclusive. If this angle α is smaller than 15 degrees, the spatial volume in which the cutting blade <b>6</b> is driven increases, and hence the workspace becomes too large, which is not desirable. The failure rate of the products in cutting also increases, and hence production efficiency decreases. If the angle α exceeds <b>60</b> degrees, the cutting plane is not wide as compared to the case where the dough is cut at right angles.</p>
