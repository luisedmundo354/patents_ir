<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 to Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-412431 filed Dec. 10, 2003, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a technique for informing a user of a communication terminal of reception of an e-mail.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A mobile communication network using IMT-2000 (International Mobile Telecommunication 2000) can provide a communication service known as a multi-call service, which enables a user of a mobile phone to simultaneously use a voice communication service and a data communication service. Accordingly, by using a mobile phone which complies with IMT-2000 and which is capable of using the multi-call service, a user can receive e-mails or browse a variety of contents by use of a WWW (World Wide Web) browser during voice communication.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When it becomes possible to perform data communication during voice communication, a user of a mobile phone can receive a mail alert indicating reception of an e-mail during voice communication, to inform the user that an e-mail has been stored in a mailbox for storing e-mails addressed to the user. On receipt of the mail alert, a mobile phone informs a user thereof that it has received an e-mail; for example, by a ring alert or a vibration.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, if a mobile phone is set to provide a user with a mail alert, voice communication can be undesirably interrupted by the alert.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a means of solving the foregoing described problem, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-211478 proposes a technique for alerting a user of a received e-mail message, during voice communication, via an LED. Accordingly, interruption of voice communication by a sound can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, since a mobile phone is necessarily positioned proximate to an ear of a user during voice communication, it is unlikely that an LED indication provided in the mobile phone is will be noticeable to the user. Consequently, there is a high probability that the user will not be aware of an e-mail alert.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing described circumstances, and its object is provide a technique for, in a communication terminal capable of receiving a mail alert during data communication, and promptly informing a user of reception of an important e-mail without interrupting an important voice communication.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To solve the problems discussed above, the present invention provides a communication terminal capable of receiving data addressed to a user thereof while the terminal is being used for voice communication, comprising: storing means for storing an importance level of a communication partner in association with an identifier of the communication partner; first obtaining means for obtaining an identifier of a voice communication partner; second obtaining means for obtaining an identifier of an e-mail sender; determining means for identifying importance levels of a voice communication partner and an e-mail sender on the basis of an identifier of the voice communication partner obtained by the first obtaining means, an identifier of the e-mail sender obtained by the second obtaining means, and contents of the storing means, and for determining which importance level is higher; and alerting means for informing, if the determining means determines that an importance level of a sender is higher than that of a voice communication partner, the user of the communication terminal of receipt of data.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also, the present invention provides a program for causing a computer capable of receiving data addressed to a user thereof, while the computer is being used for voice communication, to function as: storing means for storing an importance level of a communication partner in association with an identifier of the communication partner; first obtaining means for obtaining an identifier of a voice communication partner; second obtaining means for obtaining an identifier of an e-mail sender; determining means for identifying importance levels of a voice communication partner and an e-mail sender on the basis of an identifier of the voice communication partner obtained by the first obtaining means, an identifier of the e-mail sender obtained by the second obtaining means, and contents of the storing means, and for determining which importance level is higher; and alerting means for informing, if the determining means determines that an importance level of a sender is higher than that of a voice communication partner, the user of the communication terminal of receipt of data.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the present invention, if a communication terminal receives a mail alert while being used for voice communication, the communication terminal obtains an identifier for uniquely identifying the voice communication partner and an identifier for uniquely identifying the sender of the e-mail. The communication terminal determines which one is more important, and, if the sender of the e-mail is determined to be more important, the communication terminal informs the user that it has received the mail alert.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the present invention, if an e-mail is sent to a user of a communication terminal while the terminal is being used for voice communication, informing the user of an alert of the e-mail is controlled.</p>

The mail alert sent from in-network mail server <b>430</b> is received by communication unit <b>502</b> of mobile phone <b>500</b>-<b>1</b> and output to CPU <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">CPU <b>510</b> of mobile phone <b>500</b>-<b>1</b>, after receiving the mail alert, extracts the sender e-mail address “shiro@xyz.co.jp” and searches the address book table of nonvolatile memory <b>507</b> using the extracted e-mail address as a search key.

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As described above, according to the present embodiment, if an e-mail is sent during voice communication from a person having a higher importance level than the voice communication partner, the reception of the e-mail is informed to the user by a ring alert during the voice communication. Consequently, the user of mobile phone <b>500</b> can know that an e-mail has been sent from a person important to the user even during voice communication. On the other hand, if the voice communication partner has a higher importance level than the sender of the e-mail, the reception of the e-mail is not informed to the user by a ring alert during the voice communication. Consequently, an important voice communication is not disturbed by a ring alert indicating receipt of a less important e-mail message.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">3. Modifications</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Mobile phone <b>500</b> of the above embodiment may be provided with time information obtaining means for obtaining time information or location information obtaining means for obtaining current location information of mobile phone <b>500</b>. In this modification example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> or <b>12</b>, an importance level field of an address book table is sectionalized by a time period or a location. According to this modification example, an importance level of a person with whom the user talks over the phone or a sender of an e-mail can be set for each time period or for each location of mobile phone <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the above embodiment, an importance level may be stored in an address book table during a telephone conversation, instead of being stored in advance. In this modification example, when a user operates keys such as numeric keys during a telephone conversation, an importance level designated by the key operation is stored in an address book table in association with the telephone number.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the above embodiment, an importance level of a voice communication partner, which has been set at low, may be raised temporarily using keys such as numeric keys during voice communication. According to this modification example, an importance level of a voice communication partner can be changed depending on the importance the user places on voice communication at the time it takes place.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the above embodiment, if a reception of an e-mail is not informed to a user during voice communication, the reception of the e-mail may be informed to the user after the voice communication ends.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the above embodiment, an address book table may be stored in-network mail server <b>430</b> instead of mobile phone <b>500</b>. In this modification example, in-network mail server <b>430</b> determines whether mobile phone <b>500</b> to which a mail alert is to be sent is being used for voice communication, and if it is determined that mobile phone <b>500</b> is being used for voice communication, in-network mail server <b>430</b> obtains a telephone number of the voice communication partner. According to this modification example, in-network mail server <b>430</b> determines whether to send a mail alert by referring to the obtained telephone number, a received e-mail, and the address book table. Consequently, effects similar to those of the above embodiment can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the above embodiment, mobile phone <b>500</b> receives a mail alert. However, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment. In recent years, between personal computers connected to the Internet, it has become possible to exchange voice data using VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) and thereby perform voice communication. The present invention may be applied to a personal computer performing voice communication using VoIP as well as a mobile phone.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the above embodiment, mobile communication network <b>400</b> and mobile phone <b>500</b> may employ a communication technology other than IMT-2000. In essence, any communication technology which enables a multi-call service can be adapted.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the above embodiment, programs executed by mobile phone <b>500</b> may be stored in a readable/writable memory such as a flash ROM instead of ROM <b>508</b>. Alternatively, the programs executed by mobile phone <b>500</b> may be provided in mobile phone <b>500</b> via a storage medium such as a CD-ROM (Compact Disk Read Only Memory). In this modification example, the programs stored in a CD-ROM are once read by a personal computer having a CD-ROM drive, and by connecting the personal computer with mobile phone <b>500</b>, the read programs are installed on mobile phone <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the above embodiment, the terminal identifier and the e-mail address assigned to a user of mobile phone <b>500</b> may be stored in a UIM (User Identity Module) instead of ROM <b>508</b> and nonvolatile memory <b>507</b>. This UIM is an IC card which is detachable from a mobile phone and stores subscriber data of a user of the mobile phone, and is used by a mobile phone using IMT-2000.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the above embodiment, in-network mail server <b>430</b>, after storing an e-mail in a mailbox, may send the e-mail itself to mobile phone <b>500</b> instead of a mail alert informing that the e-mail has been stored in the mailbox.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the above embodiment, a human is assumed to be a voice communication partner and an e-mail source. However, the voice communication partner and the e-mail source are not limited to a human. A voice communication partner designated by a telephone number may be a telephone or computer having a telephone answering function, and a sender designated by an e-mail address may be a computer conducting a mailing list service.</p>
