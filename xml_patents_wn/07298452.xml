<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims, under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119, the priority benefit of Korean Patent Application No. P03-091997 filed Dec. 16, 2003 in Republic of Korea, the entire contents of which are herein fully incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a patterning apparatus and a patterning method using the same, and more particularly to an apparatus for fabricating a pattern of a continuous structure, which is used in a large-area display, and a method for fabricating a pattern of a continuous structure using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As used herein, the pattern of a continuous structure refers to a pattern of, e.g., barrier ribs of a Plasma display panel (PDP), which are arranged in line in one direction with a uniform cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional patterning methods include an electron beam lithography method, an optical lithography method, and an X-ray lithography method.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the electron beam lithography method, a photosensitive agent, which reacts to electrons, is applied on the upper surface of a substrate and a predetermined pattern is directly etched using electron beams, without any mask. This method can form a high-resolution pattern of 0.2 ฮผm or less, since the electrons have a short wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, it takes a long time to etch a predetermined pattern using the electron beam lithography method. This decreases productivity. In addition, since the depth of a formed pattern is small, the accuracy of overlay and etching is poor. Furthermore, the method uses expensive electron-emission equipment. Consequently, the electron beam lithography method is not suitable for fabricating a pattern for use in a large-area display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the optical lithography method, a photosensitive agent is applied on the upper surface of a substrate, a mask is placed thereon, and UV rays are irradiated to fabricate a predetermined pattern. This method can form a vertical or slanted pattern according to the irradiation angle of the UV rays.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, if the optical lithography method is used, it is difficult to fabricate a vertical pattern with a thickness of a few tens of ฮผm or more, as well as to form a uniformly slanted pattern, due to the diffraction characteristics peculiar to the UV rays. In addition, since the UV rays have dispersion, they cannot be irradiated only on selected portions or form a micro-pattern with a line width of 0.2 ฮผm or less. Accordingly, this method cannot form a highly-integrated pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an X-ray lithography method, a photosensitive agent is applied on the upper surface of a substrate and X-rays are irradiated via a mask to fabricate a predetermined pattern. Since the X-rays have a short wavelength, this method can form a micro-structure with a line width of 0.1 ฮผm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, when a substrate <b>1</b> and a mask <b>2</b> are kept parallel to each other and X-rays are irradiated with a slant to form a pattern <b>1</b><i>a </i>of a slanted structure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a problem occurs as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">If the mask <b>2</b> is positioned with a slant relative to the X-rays, there is a difference in the traveling distance L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2 </sub>of the X-rays to the absorbent body <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the mask <b>2</b>. This decreases the degree of precision in shape. In order to solve this problem, the mask <b>2</b> should have a trapezoid absorbent body, which is difficult to fabricate. Since the width d of the X-rays is not zero, it is also impossible to form a continuous pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, when the substrate <b>1</b> and the mask <b>2</b> are retained parallel to each other and X-rays are irradiated vertically to form a pattern <b>1</b><i>a </i>of a slanted structure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a problem occurs as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">If the X-rays are irradiated on the upper surface of the substrate <b>1</b>, a thickness T of a photosensitive agent, which has been applied on the upper surface of the substrate, is subject to exposure as far as they penetrate into the substrate. Accordingly, this method can form only a pattern <b>1</b><i>a </i>of a thickness T of tens or hundreds of ฮผm, which corresponds to the thickness of the substrate. In other words, such a conventional vertical irradiation method cannot continuously form a pattern of a three-dimensional slanted structure having a predetermined thickness or more.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve one or more of the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a patterning apparatus capable of forming a pattern in a relatively large area of substrate and a patterning method using the same.</p>

The opening <b>42</b> is formed in such a manner that its shape corresponds to the sectional shape of a pattern to be formed and the absorption unit <b>44</b> forms a vertical wall around the opening <b>42</b>. The mask <b>40</b> may also be provided with a cover (not shown) to selectively shield the opening <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A light source <b>50</b> is positioned in a location spaced a predetermined distance from the mask <b>40</b>. The light source <b>50</b> provides beams <b>52</b>, which are irradiated on the photosensitive agent to form a pattern. In other words, the beams <b>52</b> from the light source <b>52</b> pass through the opening <b>42</b> of the mask <b>40</b> and are irradiated on the photosensitive agent of the substrate, which is wound around the guide unit <b>20</b>. In the present embodiment, the light source <b>50</b> emits X-rays, which travel in an exactly straight line, have very little dispersion, and have energy tens of thousands of times larger than other rays.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It will now be explained how the photosensitive agent on the substrate <b>10</b> is subject to exposure, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>. If the substrate is cut parallel to the Z axis through the center of the guide unit <b>20</b>, a yz section is obtained in a location corresponding to the top point of the guide unit <b>20</b>. Hereinafter, this section will be referred to as a โvertical section Hโ.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to the present invention, the beams <b>52</b> are irradiated vertically on the vertical section H to subject the photosensitive agent to exposure. In particular, by irradiating the beams <b>52</b> on the vertical section H without interruption, while the substrate <b>20</b> is continuously moved, a region is subject to exposure at points to which the beams <b>52</b> are transmitted, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">More theoretically, as a vertical section H, which has been subject to exposure, is moved along the circumstance of the guide unit <b>20</b>, the next vertical section H is positioned on the top point t of the guide unit <b>20</b> for exposure. As such, the photosensitive agent is divided into innumerable vertical sections H, which are subject to exposure successively.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In practice, part โaโ of the photosensitive agent is initially subject to exposure. If the substrate <b>10</b> is moved and passes through the top point t of the guide unit, the entire vertical section H is subject to exposure. Of course, if the beams <b>52</b> can pass through the photosensitive agent even at the location where the substrate has passed the top point t, point โbโ will be the last portion to be subject to exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The period of time during which the photosensitive agent of the substrate <b>10</b> is subject to exposure can be calculated by multiplying the radius r of the guide unit <b>20</b> by the rotation angle โ of the guide unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The mask <b>40</b> is preferably positioned parallel to the vertical section H. When passing through the opening <b>42</b> of the mask <b>40</b>, the beams <b>52</b> should be vertically incident on the vertical section H.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a second embodiment of the present invention. For clarity, the same components as in the first embodiment are given the same reference numerals and repeated explanation thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in the drawing, a guide unit <b>20</b> is positioned on a frame <b>20</b>โฒ together with a mask <b>40</b> to guide a substrate <b>10</b>, in the present embodiment. The guide unit <b>20</b> is a cylindrical roller and contacts a predetermined region of the substrate <b>10</b> to guide it. An auxiliary guide unit <b>22</b>, which corresponds to the guide unit <b>20</b>, is provided. The auxiliary guide unit <b>22</b> cooperates with the guide unit <b>20</b> to guide the movement of the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The auxiliary guide unit <b>22</b> is rotated together with the guide unit <b>20</b> and securely forces the moving substrate <b>10</b> against the upper surface of the guide unit <b>20</b>. In other words, the auxiliary guide unit <b>22</b> prevents the substrate <b>10</b> from being spaced from the upper surface of the guide unit <b>20</b> so that the beams <b>52</b> are accurately irradiated on the vertical section H.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The auxiliary guide unit <b>22</b> is not necessarily positioned adjacently to the guide unit <b>20</b>, as shown in the drawing. For example, one auxiliary guide unit <b>22</b> is positioned on a side of the guide unit <b>20</b> where the substrate <b>10</b> is supplied and another is positioned on a side where the substrate <b>10</b> is collected. The region of the substrate <b>10</b>, which contacts the guide unit <b>20</b> and is guided thereby, depends on the difference in location between the auxiliary guide unit <b>22</b> and the guide unit <b>20</b>, as well as the height of the auxiliary guide unit <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The guide unit <b>20</b> may be driven by a driving motor, as in the previous embodiment. To this end, the driving motor may be positioned on a side of a frame <b>20</b>โฒ. If a driving motor is used, driving control may be necessary to control the rotation speed of the driving motor, so that the traveling speed of the substrate <b>10</b> can be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Meanwhile, it is not mandatory to provide the frame <b>20</b>โฒ with a driving motor, which supplies driving power to move the substrate <b>10</b>. In other words, a separate driving source may provide the driving power to move the substrate <b>10</b>, while the guide unit <b>20</b> is simply rotated together with the substrate <b>10</b> and guides it. Such a configuration will be described later in relation to a supplying unit <b>60</b> and a winding unit <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The guide unit <b>20</b> may be positioned along the longitudinal direction of the frame <b>20</b>โฒ, that is, along a direction perpendicular to the moving direction of the substrate <b>10</b>. To this end, a guide unit controller unit <b>25</b> is positioned on the frame <b>20</b>โฒ and the guide unit <b>20</b> is supported thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The mask <b>40</b> is supported on the frame <b>20</b>โฒ by an alignment controller unit <b>40</b>โฒ. The alignment controller unit <b>40</b>โฒ is adapted to adjust the mask <b>40</b> precisely. The alignment controller unit <b>40</b>โฒ plays the role of aligning the mask <b>40</b> parallel to the vertical section H of the photosensitive agent, which has been applied on the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A feature is preferably provided to align the light source <b>50</b> relative to the mask <b>40</b>. In particular, the light source <b>50</b> is preferably positioned so that the light, which is irradiated from the light source <b>50</b>, is accurately incident on the vertical section H via the mask <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Meanwhile, a feature is provided to continuously supply the substrate <b>10</b> to the guide unit <b>20</b> and continuously collect the substrate <b>10</b>, which has been subject to exposure. In particular, the substrate <b>10</b> is wound into a roll form and placed in a supply unit <b>60</b>. The substrate <b>10</b> is then continuously unwound and supplied to the guide unit. A winding unit <b>70</b> is also provided to wind the substrate, which has been subject to exposure, into a roll form and collect it from the guide unit <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the substrate, which has been subject to exposure, may be continuously supplied to the next process and wound on the winding portion <b>70</b>, after the pattern formation is over.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">To this end, the winding unit <b>70</b> should exert a drawing force to wind the substrate <b>10</b>. In that case, the winding unit <b>70</b> acts as a driving source. Of course, another driving source may be positioned on the moving path of the substrate <b>10</b> to move the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a third embodiment of the present invention. For clarity, the same components as in the previous embodiment are given the same reference numerals and repeated explanation thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the present embodiment, a guide unit <b>120</b>, which guides a substrate <b>10</b>, is not rotated but fixed. The guide unit <b>120</b> does not need to have a curved surface anywhere but in a region adjacent to the top point t thereof, which contacts the substrate <b>10</b> and guides it. Except for this detail, the guide unit <b>120</b> may be arbitrarily configured.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">For reference, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, the region from point โaโ to the top point t is preferably composed of a curved surface, while the region from the top point โtโ to point โbโ may be composed of a flat surface. In that case, it is possible to modify the period of time during which the photosensitive agent is subject to exposure, by adjusting the length of the flat surface region.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Although not shown in the drawing, the guide unit <b>120</b> may be provided with an auxiliary guide unit, which forces the moving substrate <b>10</b> against the guide unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As such, in the present embodiment, the guide unit <b>120</b> is fixed and just guides the movement of the substrate <b>10</b>. Accordingly, a supply unit <b>60</b> and a winding unit <b>70</b> provide the power necessary for the movement of the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The supply unit <b>60</b> continuously supplies the substrate <b>10</b>, while the winding unit <b>70</b> pulls and winds the substrate <b>10</b>. Therefore, the winding unit <b>70</b> acts as a driving source. Of course, a separate driving source may be positioned in the movement path of the substrate <b>10</b> to provide the driving power to move the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A mask <b>40</b> is positioned parallel to the vertical section H of the substrate <b>10</b> so that beams <b>52</b> are selectively irradiated on the vertical section H. The configuration of the mask <b>40</b> is the same as in the previous embodiment. The beams <b>52</b>, which are irradiated on the substrate <b>10</b>, are provided from a light source <b>50</b>. A feature may also be provided to align the mask <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A patterning method using a patterning apparatus, configured as above, according to the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the flow chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A substrate <b>10</b>, which has a photosensitive agent applied on its surface, is continuously supplied between a guide unit <b>20</b> and an auxiliary guide unit <b>22</b> (step <b>1</b>). The substrate <b>10</b> is moved while contacting a surface of the guide unit <b>20</b>. The auxiliary guide unit <b>22</b> plays the role of forcing the substrate <b>10</b> against the surface of the guide unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">An alignment controller unit <b>40</b>โฒ is used to accurately position a mask <b>40</b> so that beams <b>52</b>, which are irradiated from a light source <b>50</b>, are correctly transmitted to a vertical section H (step <b>2</b>). Of course, the light source <b>50</b> should be correctly positioned relative to the mask <b>40</b> or the guide unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The light source <b>50</b> irradiates beams <b>52</b>, while the substrate <b>10</b> is moved and guided by the guide unit <b>20</b>. The beams <b>52</b> pass through an opening <b>42</b> of the mask <b>40</b> and subject the photosensitive agent of the substrate <b>10</b> to exposure with a shape corresponding to that of the opening <b>42</b> (step <b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As such, while the substrate <b>10</b> is continuously supplied to the guide unit <b>20</b>, the beams <b>52</b>, which are provided from the light source <b>50</b>, continuously pass through the mask <b>40</b> and are irradiated on the vertical section H of the substrate <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the photosensitive agent is continuously subject to exposure and a continuous pattern is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The period of time during which the photosensitive agent is subject to exposure or a necessary amount of exposure may be obtained by calculation. Of course, the exposure period or the exposure amount should be modified according to the type of the photosensitive agent or the beams <b>52</b>. The exposure period or the exposure amount may be controlled based on the speed of the substrate <b>10</b>, which is moved and guided by the guide unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">After the photosensitive agent is subject to exposure in the guide unit <b>20</b>, the substrate <b>10</b> is again wound into a roll form (step S<b>4</b>). Of course, the steps for supply, collection, and exposure of the substrate <b>10</b>, among other steps, are performed simultaneously and continuously, once they are begun.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Several steps should be performed additionally, including removing the photosensitive agent from parts, which have been subject to exposure, or from parts, which have not, to complete a pattern on the photosensitive agent, which has been subject to exposure through the above processes.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a </i>to <b>8</b><i>c </i>present examples of patterns <b>15</b>, which have been formed on a substrate <b>10</b> according to a method of the present invention. Needless to say, the inventive method can form patterns having various sectional shapes, besides the patterns <b>15</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a </i>to <b>8</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In summary, the basic technological idea of the present invention is as follows: beams <b>52</b> are vertically irradiated on a vertical section H of a substrate <b>10</b>, which is continuously supplied along the outer peripheral surface of a guide unit <b>20</b> and through the top point t thereof, so that patterns of various sectional shapes can be fabricated in a continuous manner.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As mentioned above, the patterning apparatus and the patterning method according to the present invention are advantageous in that a pattern of a predetermined sectional shape can be formed in a relatively large area and thus a pattern for a large-area display can be fabricated easily.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Based on a completed pattern, beams are irradiated from a lateral surface, not from a top surface, of the pattern. This minimizes the spacing between patterns and enables the fabrication of a micro-pattern. Accordingly, it is possible to fabricate a highly-integrated pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The lateral irradiation also makes it possible to continuously fabricate patterns having the same sectional shape. This reduces the process time for forming patterns and improves production efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Furthermore, the lateral irradiation makes it relatively easy to adjust the height of the patterns. Accordingly, patterns of various heights can be fabricated. Since the beams are irradiated on the upper and lower portions of a pattern at the same time, the upper and lower portions are subject to the same amount of exposure. This makes the width of the pattern uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.</p>
