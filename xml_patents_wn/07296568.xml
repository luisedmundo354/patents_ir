<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention relates to a respirator with a module that includes a speech transmission and exhalation valve functions. In one of its aspects, the invention relates to a respirator module incorporating an exhalation valve, a speech transmitter and a drinking tube. In another of its aspects, the invention relates to a respirator speech transmission module with integral electrical connections for communications devices. In another of its aspects, the invention relates to a respirator with a speech transmission and an exhalation valve module. In yet another of its aspects, the invention relates to a respirator and speech transmitter module therefore with low airflow resistance through the module.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When a respirator such as a gas mask is used in a contaminated environment, it is critical that the wearer only inhale air from a purified source or air that has been passed through a filtration canister. In the typical gas mask having removable filtration canisters, the filtration canisters are attached to a filter mount including an inhalation valve that provides for one-way flow, opening during inhalation and closing during exhalation to prevent exhalation of hot, moisture-laden air through the filter.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is important that the inhalation valve introduce no restrictions in the airflow path that will put additional strains on the wearer. In like fashion, it is important that an exhalation valve has minimal restrictions in the exhalation airflow but has secure sealing during inhalation. As the inhalation valve must have a low-opening pressure, the exhalation valve must also have a low-opening pressure to reduce the burden on the wearer and the likelihood of breaking the seal of the respirator.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, it is important that the wearer has the ability to communicate clearly with others in the vicinity or by radio while the respirator is in place and functioning in the contaminated environment. It is therefore advantageous for an exhalation module to have low-resistance opening during wearer exhalation, complete sealing during wearer inhalation and with high intelligibility of wearer speech.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 4,958,633, issued Sep. 25, 1990, to Angell, discloses a respirator with a speech and exhalation module incorporating an elastomeric exhalation valve. The exhalation valve is constructed of resilient material in a generally dished form anchored at a central portion and adapted to seal on a peripheral edge onto a valve seat on the module housing. The exhalation valve has an annular channel, formed by an annular arcuate section and that faces the outside of the mask. The module forms an air path in the form of an exponential horn between the inside and outside of the mask. The air path reverses axial direction between the inlet and the outlet, creating some turbulence. The speech module and exhalation valve have a fairly low resistance to exhalation, in the range of about 15 mm at 85 l/min air flow. The respirator also has interchangeable mountings on the face piece for a secondary speech outlet, such as a microphone, and for an air-purifying canister. The speech transmitter module is disclosed more fully in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,539,983, issued Sep. 10, 1985, to Angell. These two Angell patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention relates to a respirator and a front module therefor as set forth in the preamble to claim <b>1</b> and wherein the inner side wall of the module body forms with the airflow guide an airflow channel in the form of a horn expansion contour during exhalation when the outlet valve is in an open position. The airflow channel from the interior to the exterior of the module extends radially and axially outwardly, then bends radially inwardly and axially outwardly through a smooth curve and then bends through a smooth curve axially outwardly. The airflow pattern does not reverse direction and thus has a very low resistance. In one embodiment, the outlet valve forms a part of the airflow channel with the inner side wall of the module body.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the form of the horn expansion is conical, exponential, hyperbolic, tractrix or a combination thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the airflow guide has a generally conical surface facing the outer face of the module. In addition, the airflow guide conical surface is concave and the airflow guide has a relatively flat bottom surface facing the inner face of the module. An outer edge of the exhalation valve abuts the bottom surface of the airflow guide when the exhalation valve is in the open position. In one embodiment of the invention, the bottom surface of the airflow guide has relief channels to prevent sticking of the exhalation valve in the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention also relates to a respirator and a front module therefor as set forth in the preamble to claim <b>1</b> and wherein the outlet valve has a dome shape with a central body and a generally conical skirt. In one embodiment, the outlet valve conical skirt is slightly convex outwardly toward the outer face of the module body.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to the drawings and to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in particular, a gas mask or respirator assembly <b>310</b> comprises a mask <b>312</b> having a facepiece <b>330</b> that fits onto a user's face and defines an interior chamber, a visor <b>332</b> comprising a transparent polyurethane panel <b>336</b>, or panels, that may or may not have a central elastomeric hinge <b>338</b>, a pair of circular or elliptical filter canisters <b>314</b> each mounted to the mask <b>312</b> at a canister mount <b>313</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Facepiece <b>330</b> is held to a user's face by a plurality of low-profile harness straps <b>344</b> defining a seal at facepiece periphery <b>334</b> that eliminates hot spots and fits comfortably with a helmet. Harness straps <b>344</b> can be folded over the exterior of facepiece <b>330</b> to aid user in rapidly donning mask <b>312</b>. The interior chamber of mask <b>312</b> further comprises a nose cup (not shown) that is formed of a suitable material such as silicone or polyisoprene and is provided in multiple sizes for comfort and fit on different users.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The canister mounts <b>313</b> each include an inlet port and self-sealing mechanism assembly <b>316</b> and a connector <b>318</b> for affixing the circular or elliptical filter canisters <b>314</b> to mask <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The assembly <b>310</b> further comprises a front module <b>10</b> that includes speech transmission and exhalation valve functions affixed to mask <b>312</b>. Module <b>10</b> combines and integrates the functions of speech, drinking system, outlet valve assembly and electrical communication.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref> in particular, front module <b>10</b> includes a module body <b>12</b> having an inner face <b>14</b>, an outer face <b>16</b> and a central cavity <b>18</b> defined by a smooth and continuous side wall. A conical airflow guide <b>30</b> is supported within the cavity <b>18</b> by a number of airflow guide struts <b>32</b> that are connected to the airflow guide <b>30</b> and to the side wall of the central cavity <b>18</b> to hold the conical airflow guide substantially centered within the central cavity <b>18</b>. The conical airflow guide has a concave upper surface <b>33</b> and a relatively flat lower surface. The module body <b>12</b> further includes a peripheral shoulder <b>80</b> having a facepiece engaging surface <b>82</b> for mounting the module <b>10</b> to the facepiece <b>312</b> of a respirator (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). A skirt <b>84</b> extending from the peripheral shoulder <b>80</b> is mounted in a conforming opening in a facepiece adapted to receive the speech transmitter module <b>10</b>. The skirt <b>84</b> includes a circumferential bead <b>86</b> for assisting in retaining the module <b>10</b> in the facepiece opening and further provides a retention means for a nosecup within the respirator facepiece.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The central cavity <b>18</b> provides a flow path, illustrated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, between an inlet opening <b>50</b> at the inner face <b>14</b> of the mask to an outlet opening at the outer face <b>16</b> of the mask through slots <b>44</b>. The outer face <b>16</b> of the module body <b>12</b> includes a plurality of slats <b>40</b> defining an outer face grille <b>42</b>. The slats <b>40</b> are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> so that the conical airflow guide <b>30</b> can be seen in the cavity <b>18</b>. The air flows between the inside and outside of the module body <b>12</b> through slots <b>44</b> defined between the slats <b>40</b> of the grille <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At the inner face <b>14</b> of the module body <b>12</b>, the cavity <b>18</b> includes the substantially circular opening <b>50</b> defined by an annular valve seat <b>60</b> for fluidly connecting the cavity <b>18</b> to the inner face <b>14</b> of the module body <b>12</b>. The circular opening <b>50</b> is surrounded at the base of central cavity <b>18</b> of the module body <b>12</b> by the annular valve seat <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">An outlet valve attachment stud <b>52</b> is mounted to the annular valve seat <b>60</b> in a central portion of the circular opening <b>50</b> through a plurality of spokes <b>54</b>. The valve attachment stud <b>52</b> and spokes <b>54</b> define a number of airflow apertures <b>56</b> for fluidly connecting the cavity <b>18</b> to the outside of the module body <b>12</b> at the inner face <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The side wall of the cavity <b>18</b> and the upper surface <b>33</b> of the conical airflow guide <b>30</b> define the airflow channel <b>70</b> through the module body <b>12</b> from the airflow apertures <b>56</b> at the inner face <b>14</b> of the module body <b>12</b> to the slots <b>44</b> at the outer face <b>16</b> of the module body <b>12</b>. The airflow channel <b>70</b> defines a horn expansion contour that enhances the sound transmitted by a user through the speech module. The form of the horn expansion can be conical, exponential, hyperbolic, tractrix or a combination of theses forms. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the airflow pattern between the airflow apertures <b>56</b> and the slots <b>44</b> follows a smooth, continuous route without any reversal of direction. The airflow pattern begins in a radial outward and axial direction and then bends smoothly in a radially inward and axial outward direction and then smoothly turns axially outwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The outlet valve attachment stud <b>52</b> mounts a domed outlet valve <b>90</b>. The domed outlet valve <b>90</b> includes a central cylindrical body <b>92</b> surrounded by an outwardly convex shoulder hinge <b>94</b> and an umbrella-like skirt <b>96</b> having a ribbed, weighted perimeter <b>98</b>. The skirt <b>96</b> is convex outwardly slightly toward the outer face <b>16</b> of the module body <b>12</b>. The shoulder hinge <b>94</b> forms an open channel of generally semi-circular cross-section and the channel opening faces the inside of the module and the respirator. The central cylindrical body <b>92</b> includes a stud-receiving cavity <b>100</b> adapted to closely receive the outlet valve attachment stud <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The outlet valve attachment stud <b>52</b> is positioned centrally within the circular opening <b>50</b> and directed into the cavity <b>18</b>. The domed outlet valve <b>90</b> is configured such that with the outlet valve attachment stud <b>52</b> received in the cavity <b>100</b> of the central body <b>92</b> of the domed outlet valve <b>90</b>, the ribbed perimeter <b>98</b> of the domed outlet valve <b>90</b> is sealingly received in the annular valve seat <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The domed outlet valve <b>90</b> is resilient and biased toward a closed position with the perimeter <b>98</b> of the outlet valve <b>90</b> pressed against the annular valve seat <b>60</b> within the central cavity <b>18</b> of the module body <b>12</b> to form an airtight seal. This configuration eliminates the possibility that the outlet valve <b>90</b> will be drawn inside out during an inhalation process. As the wearer exhales, the domed outlet valve <b>90</b> rolls up the hinge <b>94</b> and then inverts so that it abuts the base <b>34</b> of the conical airflow guide <b>30</b>. The convex shoulder hinge <b>94</b> functions as a rolling toggle mechanism to flip the valve very wide open at the lowest possible positive (exhalation) pressure and closing quickly when the exhalation pressure drops near zero. The domed or umbrella shape of the valve is designed such that more energy is stored in the valve when inverted and this helps to revert the valve back rapidly to the closed position. This rolling hinge action represents a major change over cone-shaped valves that have a tendency to be lazy and not to revert as rapidly. The opening and closing of the outlet valve <b>90</b> takes place very quickly when the pressure changes from positive to negative. The harder the work rate, the more rapid and deep is the pressure change as the airflow volume increases per breath. The valve <b>90</b> accommodates a wide variety of changes very quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The base <b>34</b> of the airflow guide <b>30</b> is formed with a central depression <b>36</b> and a series of radial relief channels <b>38</b>. The relief channels or grooves <b>38</b> prevent the skirt <b>96</b> of the outlet valve <b>90</b> from sticking to the base <b>34</b> by surface tension from breath moisture and forming an airtight seal when the valve is forced up against the base during exhalation.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The inverted outlet valve <b>90</b> cooperates with the conical airflow guide <b>30</b> to create an unobstructed airflow channel <b>70</b> through the cavity <b>18</b> of the module body <b>12</b>. Exhalation air (shown by arrows) flows from the interior of the respirator through the airflow apertures <b>56</b> at the inner face <b>14</b> of the module body <b>12</b>. The exhalation air then passes by the inverted outlet valve <b>90</b> and around the conical airflow guide <b>30</b>, through the airflow channel <b>70</b>, and through the slots <b>44</b> in the outer face <b>16</b> of the module body <b>12</b>. Exhalation air in the form of speech by the wearer passes through the airflow channel <b>70</b> in a like manner; the expansion contour of the horn form of the airflow channel enhances the intelligibility of the wearer's speech.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The surfaces of the side wall of the cavity <b>18</b> and the skirt <b>96</b> of the domed valve <b>90</b> at the inner portion of the module and the side wall of the cavity <b>18</b> and the upper surface <b>33</b> of the conical airflow guide <b>30</b> define an expanding airflow channel in a smooth continuous horn pattern between the airflow apertures <b>56</b> and the slots <b>44</b> to amplify the speech from the user and to minimize the flow resistance through the airflow channel. The airflow through the airflow channel has very little, if any, turbulence and yet has a very low dynamic leakage due to the sensitivity of the exhalation valve. The combination of the low resistance domed valve <b>90</b> and the smooth, axially non-reversing and continuously expanding horn airflow passage walls minimize the airflow resistance through the airflow passage to a very low value. For example, it has been found that the flow resistance to airflow through the airflow channel <b>70</b> is a little as 6 mm water gauge at 85 l/min with the configuration illustrated in the drawings and described above.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As the wearer of the respirator completes his exhalation, the outlet airflow rate decreases until it can no longer overcome the bias in the outlet valve <b>90</b>. The outlet valve <b>90</b> then returns to its naturally biased position and forms a seal against the annular valve seat <b>60</b>. As the wearer of the respirator inhales, the outlet valve <b>90</b> is firmly seated in the annular valve seat <b>60</b> and prevents the infiltration of inhalation air through the outlet airflow apertures <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The central cavity <b>18</b> is protected from the impingement of solid matter by the outer face grille <b>42</b>. The domed outlet valve <b>90</b> is further shielded from the outer face <b>16</b> of the module body <b>12</b> by the conical airflow guide <b>30</b>. The domed outlet valve <b>90</b> is not visible from the outer face <b>16</b> of the module body <b>12</b> through the outer face slots <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The respirator speech transmitter and exhalation valve module <b>10</b> further includes a drinking tube storage channel <b>110</b> for storing a drinking tube <b>120</b> on the exterior of the module <b>10</b>. The drinking tube <b>120</b> has a distal end <b>122</b> for connecting to a fluid source such as a water bottle and a proximal end <b>124</b> for fluidly connecting to a drinking tube hole <b>130</b> passing through the module body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The drinking tube hole <b>130</b> is selectively sealed by a drinking tube valve <b>140</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref>. The drinking tube valve <b>140</b> includes a blind end hollow tube <b>142</b> having an activation tap lever <b>144</b> for placement on the outside of the module body <b>12</b>. The inner end <b>146</b> of the drinking tube valve <b>140</b> is adapted for fitting a mouthpiece <b>148</b> enabling a wearer of a respirator to drink from the water bottle. The drinking tube valve <b>140</b> includes an opening <b>150</b> in a side of the hollow tube <b>142</b> for selectively fluidly connecting the mouthpiece <b>148</b> to the proximal end <b>124</b> of the drinking tube <b>120</b>. The drinking tube <b>120</b> is secured on a fitting <b>152</b> fluidly connected to the drinking tube hole <b>130</b>. With the drinking tube valve <b>140</b> in the closed position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the fitting <b>152</b> and drinking tube <b>120</b> are fluidly isolated from the mouthpiece <b>148</b>. When the drinking tube valve <b>140</b> is moved to the open position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the hole <b>150</b> in the side of the tube <b>142</b> is aligned with the fitting <b>152</b> to fluidly connect the drinking tube <b>130</b> with the mouthpiece <b>148</b>. As the drinking tube valve <b>140</b> is rotated from the closed to the open position, the mouthpiece <b>148</b> simultaneously moves from a stored position away from the wearer's mouth to a position accessible to the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The module body <b>12</b> further incorporates an integrally molded communication connector block <b>160</b> for providing an electrical and communication connection between the inner and outer faces <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the module body <b>12</b>. The connector block <b>160</b> is preferably integrally molded with the module body <b>12</b> and can be used for attaching a microphone (not shown) to internal terminal connectors <b>162</b> on the inner face <b>14</b> of the module body <b>12</b>. The microphone can be electrically powered with the use of all three terminal connectors <b>162</b> or unpowered with the use of only two of the terminal connectors <b>162</b>. A communications device, such as a radio or an amplifier (not shown) carried by the respirator user, can be connected to the external terminal connectors <b>164</b> on the outer face of the module body <b>12</b>. All three terminal connectors <b>164</b> can be used to connect electrical power to the interior microphone. Alternatively, only two of the terminal connectors <b>164</b> can be used to connect the radio or amplifier to an unpowered microphone. The connector block <b>160</b> is also provided with an integrally molded connector block cover <b>166</b> for protecting the external connectors <b>164</b> when not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In use, the respirator speech transmitter and exhalation valve module <b>10</b> provides an exhalation valve and airflow management for a respirator and provides a conduit through which the wearer of the respirator can intelligibly speak. For face-to-face conversation the wearer's voice is carried through the outlet airflow charmer <b>70</b>. For electronic communication, the wearer's voice can be carried through the outlet airflow channel <b>70</b> to an external microphone, or the wearer can use an internal microphone electrically connected to the internal connectors <b>162</b> with the electronic communication device electrically connected to the external connectors <b>164</b>. The module <b>10</b> provides pass-through connectors for a microphone and electronic communication. The module <b>10</b> further provides an attachment location for the nose cup as part of the airflow management process. Still further, the module <b>10</b> incorporates a drink tube connection to the mask and provides a convenient parking place for the drink tube. The module <b>10</b> has a low dynamic leakage while a very low flow resistance due to the smooth flow of the airflow through the air passage in the module.</p>
