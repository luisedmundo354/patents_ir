<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The object of the present invention is directed to providing a web-fed rotary printing press.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with the present invention, this object is attained by the provision of a web-fed rotary printing press having at least one, and typically several printing units. The printing units include one or more cylinder pairs, each consisting of a forme cylinder and a transfer cylinder. Those cylinders are sized to print six newspaper pages arranged axially along the length of each cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The advantages to be gained by the present invention rest, in particular, in that a simple, cost-effective and space-saving construction, together with the provision of a high variability of the product or intermediate product, is made possible.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Advantages also lie, in particular, in that, in comparison to double-width printing presses, the production dependability is considerably increased with the same target size of a product. Also, when retaining the number of printing units, the yield of the printing press, or of each printing group, can be increased by 50%.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The number of roll changers, and their associated investment costs, the frequency of roll changes and the resultant loss of production dependability, as well as the set-up time when drawing in webs and the increase in cycle times, can all be reduced for the same production size in comparison with a double-width printing press.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an advantageous embodiment, the printing units are structured as nine-cylinder satellite printing units, which results in high precision of the ink register, and otherwise in a low-oscillation construction. Oscillations are also reduced by the advantageous arrangement, structure and fastening of dressings on the cylinders. For one, openings on the shell surface in the circumferential direction are minimized. It is furthermore also possible to arrange the openings, at least on the transfer cylinder, alternatingly offset in the circumferential direction, in such a way, that a closed shell surface always works together with the forme or satellite cylinder, at least over the length of a section of the forme or satellite cylinder. Thirdly, out-of-roundness and production costs are minimized because, although channels which are axially dispersed on the barrel over its entire effective length are provided, openings in the direction toward the shell surface only exist in the mentioned sections. Devices for fastening of dressing ends and/or fillers are selectively inserted into the channels.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">At least six devices for the axial positioning of printing formes are arranged in the channel or channels of the forme cylinders. These devices are embodied, for example, as register pins that are positively acting together with the printing forme ends, which are arranged inside the channel and which can be axially movable manually or by remote control.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For equipping the forme cylinders with printing formes which can be reproduced with exact registration and color congruence, the configuration of the printing groups with associated pressing devices is advantageous. Because of these, it is possible to fix dressings, resting on the shell surface of the cylinders, in place by use of respectively at least one pressing element, as needed, while one end of a dressing or of several dressings is or are released for being removed or attached.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The drive mechanism of the satellite cylinder, or cylinders, which is mechanically independent of the pairs of cylinders, offers particular advantages, with respect to a possibility of a variable operation. Thus it is possible, for example, to perform a set-up operation during production, for example a flying printing forme change, or a forme washing. On the other hand, a web can be drawn in while other cylinders, or other pairs of cylinders, are stopped or are being cycled through a set-up program. If rubber blankets, with positively or negatively conveying properties, are present, it is also advantageous to operate the satellite cylinder with a surface speed which differs from that of the remaining cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, a superstructure of the printing press has at least one longitudinal cutting device with at least five cutters, which cutters are spaced apart from each other transversely to the paper conveying direction. In an advantageous embodiment, two register elements, which can be moved transversely, with respect to the paper conveying direction, are provided for each printing tower, or respectively for each eight print positions, for compensating for the paths of the partial webs. In a further development, these register elements can be structurally connected with respective turning devices, each of the width of a partial web. Also, subsequent guide elements, which are only assigned to partial webs, are, for example, substantially embodied to have only a partial web width. These configurations make possible a low-oscillation, and therefore also an exactly matching conveyance of the web. Fluctuations in the web tension, occurring, for example during load changes, or during a change of the printing speed, and caused by the inertia of long, thick guide elements only driven by the partial web or webs, can be effectively reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With a view to dependable operation and to a cost-saving construction, it is also advantageous to provide the possibility of turning a partial web by an odd-numbered multiple of half a partial web in the superstructure. With this, the draw-in and imprinting of partial webs of half a former width, for example a newspaper page can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In connection with the reduction of costs and for providing a space-saving construction, it is advantageous, in one embodiment, to place a so-called harp, i.e. a plurality of lead rollers which, as a rule, are not driven, ahead of only one of two formers, which are themselves arranged above one another. Webs can be transported from the harp to the other former. Strands of variable sizes or numbers of partial webs of the same alignment can be supplied to the two formers which are arranged vertically above one another.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one preferred embodiment, partial webs from one harp assigned to the one group of formers can be supplied to the other group of formers, and vice versa. In an advantageous embodiment, a so-called harp, i.e. a plurality of lead rollers, which are also called collecting or receiving rollers, is to be placed ahead of only one of two formers that are arranged above each other. Webs from the common harp can then be transferred to the other former. Strands of variable size, or numbers of partial webs of the same alignment, can be supplied to the two formers which are arranged vertically above one another.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an advantageous embodiment of a turning device, the partial web can be displaced, or is displaced, only by an odd-numbered multiple of half a partial web. In this way, it is possible, with little outlay, to avoid, for example, to have to imprint very narrow webs, or to provide additional printing units. The construction of at least one of the turning bars, which at least one bar can be moved transversely in respect to the web, allows a large amount of variability.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The drive mechanism of rollers of the structure of the former and/or of the folding apparatus, which drive mechanism is mechanically independent from the printing units, is advantageous. This is the case particularly in respect to good registration and variable operation.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A web-fed rotary printing press in accordance with the present invention, and represented, by way of example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, has a left press section and a right press section, each section having at least two printing towers <b>01</b>. The printing towers <b>01</b> each have printing units <b>02</b> which are embodied to be, for example, at least of triple width, i.e. are configured for the imprinting, of respectively, six newspaper pages, which are arranged axially side-by-side. The printing units <b>02</b> are each embodied as satellite printing units <b>02</b>. The advantageous embodiment of each of the printing units <b>02</b> as a nine-cylinder satellite printing unit <b>02</b> assures a very good maintenance of color congruence, or a very small fan-out. The printing units <b>02</b> can also be embodied as ten-cylinder satellite printing units <b>02</b>, or possibly can also be embodied as printing units which can be operated in rubber-against-rubber printing, such as, for example, as several bridge printing units or as an H-printing unit <b>02</b>. Webs <b>03</b> from rolls, which are not specifically represented, are supplied to the printing units <b>02</b>, in particular by the use of roll changers which are also not specifically shown.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">One superstructure <b>04</b> for each section is provided downstream, in the direction of travel of a web <b>03</b> which is passing through the printing towers <b>01</b>, or printing units <b>02</b>, in this case, superstructure <b>04</b> is situated above the printing towers <b>01</b>, and in which superstructure <b>04</b> the web <b>03</b>, or the webs <b>03</b>, are cut by longitudinal cutting arrangements <b>06</b>. The resultant partial webs can possibly be offset and/or cambered, the linear register of the partial webs can be aligned by the use of register arrangements <b>08</b>, only depicted schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and these partial webs can be guided above each other. Downstream, as viewed in the web running direction, the superstructure <b>04</b> has at least one so-called harp <b>09</b> including a plurality of harp or lead rollers, which are arranged above each other and which guide the webs <b>03</b>, or the partial webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>. The harp <b>09</b> determines the entry into the former of the webs <b>03</b> or of the partial webs that are conducted above each other. The webs <b>03</b> or partial webs undergo a change in direction as they pass through this harp <b>09</b>, and are thereafter combined into either one strand, or several strands, and are conducted to at least one folding structure <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the printing press shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, two folding structures <b>11</b> are arranged between the two press sections, which two folding structures <b>11</b> each have formers respectively arranged, on two different levels located above one another, for example. However, the printing press can also have only one common folding structure <b>11</b>, arranged between the sections, or can have only one section and one associated folding structure. Also, the respective folding structure <b>11</b> can be embodied with only one level of formers. One or a plurality of folding apparatus <b>12</b> can be assigned to each folding structure <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Each printing unit <b>02</b> has a plurality, in the preferred embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> four, printing groups <b>13</b>, by operation of which, ink from an inking unit <b>14</b> can be applied to the web <b>03</b> by operation of at least one cylinder <b>16</b> embodied as a forme cylinder <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the first embodiment of the printing unit <b>02</b> as a satellite printing unit <b>02</b>, the printing group <b>13</b> is configured as an offset printing group <b>13</b> for wet offset printing and has, in addition to the inking unit <b>14</b>, a dampening unit <b>20</b> and a further cylinder <b>17</b>, embodied as transfer cylinder <b>17</b>. Together with a cylinder <b>18</b> constituting a counter-pressure cylinder or thrust element, the transfer cylinder <b>17</b> forms a print position. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the counter-pressure cylinder <b>18</b> is embodied as a satellite cylinder <b>18</b> which, together with further transfer cylinders <b>17</b> of further printing groups <b>13</b>, constitutes further print positions when in the print-on position. In an embodiment of the printing groups as a double printing group for rubber-against-rubber printing, the counter-pressure cylinder <b>18</b> could also be embodied as a transfer cylinder <b>18</b>. If not required for their differentiation, identical parts are provided with the same reference symbols. However, a difference in their spatial position can exist and is disregarded as a rule when identical reference symbols are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an advantageous embodiment, the inking unit <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has an ink duct <b>15</b> which is extending laterally over six printed pages. In a different embodiment, three ink ducts <b>15</b>, each of which may be approximately two printed pages wide, are arranged side-by-side in the cylinder axial direction. In an advantageous embodiment, the dampening unit <b>20</b> is embodied as a spray dampening unit <b>20</b> with four rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a first embodiment, the forme cylinder <b>16</b> has a circumference between 850 and 1,000 mm, and in particular between 900 and 940 mm. For example, for receiving two vertical printed pages, for example two newspaper pages in broadsheet format, the circumference is designed with two dressings or covers <b>19</b>, for example two flexible printing formes <b>19</b>, which can be fixed in place, one behind the other, in the circumferential direction on the forme cylinder <b>16</b>. The printing formes <b>19</b> can be fixed in place in the circumferential direction on the forme cylinder <b>16</b> and, in the configuration represented schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, can be individually exchanged in the form of individual printing plates <b>19</b>, each of which is equipped with one printed page in the axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the first embodiment, the length L<b>16</b> of the usable barrel of the forme cylinder <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is 1,850 to 2,400 mm, and in particular is 1,900 to 2,300 mm, and is configured in the axial direction, for receiving, for example, at least six vertical printed pages which are arranged side-by-side, and in particular for receiving newspaper pages in broadsheet format, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at sections A to F. In this case, it depends, inter alia, on the type of the product to be made whether only one printed page, or a plurality of printed pages are arranged side-by-side in the axial direction on a printing plate <b>19</b>. In an advantageous wider variation of the first embodiment, the length L<b>16</b> of the usable barrel of the forme cylinder <b>16</b> lies between 2,000 and 2,400 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In a second embodiment, the forme cylinder <b>16</b> has a circumference, for example, of between 980 and 1,300 mm, and in particular of between 1,000 and 1,200 mm. In this case, the length of the usable barrel is, for example, 1,950 to 2,400 mm, and in particular is between 2,000 and 2,400 mm. The covering corresponds to the above mentioned embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the first embodiment, the transfer cylinder <b>17</b> also has a circumference of, for example, between 850 and 1,000 mm, and in particular of between 900 and 940 mm. The length L<b>17</b> of the usable barrel of the transfer cylinder <b>17</b> in the first embodiment is, for example, 1,850 to 2,400 mm, and in particular is between 1,900 to 2,300 mm, and it is equipped, in the linear direction, with, for example, three dressings <b>21</b>, for example rubber blankets <b>21</b>, shown as sections AB to EF. They substantially extend in the circumferential direction over the entire circumference. Advantageously affecting the oscillating behavior of the printing group during operation, the rubber blankets <b>21</b> are arranged alternatingly offset in respect to each other, for example by 180°, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In the wider variation of the first embodiment, the length L<b>17</b> of the usable barrel also lies between 2,000 and 2,400 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the second embodiment, the transfer cylinder <b>17</b> has a circumference, for example, between 980 and 1,300 mm, and in particular between 1,000 and 1,200 mm. The length L<b>17</b> of the usable barrel here is, for example, 1,950 to 2,400 mm, and in particular from 2,000 to 2,400 mm. The covering with dressings <b>21</b> corresponds to that of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the first above mentioned embodiment, the diameters of the barrels of the cylinders <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> lie, for example, between 270 to 320 mm, and in particular are approximately 285 to 300 mm in diameter. In the second above mentioned embodiment, the diameters of the barrels of the cylinders <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> lie, for example, between approximately 310 to 410 mm, and in particular between 320 and approximately 380 mm. The ratio of the lengths of the usable barrels of the cylinders <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> to their diameters should be 5.8 to 8.8, for example between 6.3 to 8.0, and in a wide embodiment, in particular between 6.5 to 8.0.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The width or length of the barrel is here understood to be that length L<b>16</b>, L<b>17</b> of the usable barrel which is suited for receiving dressings, covers or blankets <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>. This barrel width also approximately corresponds to a maximally possible web width of a web <b>03</b> to be imprinted. In relation to the total length of the barrels of the cylinders <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> it would be necessary here to add to this length L<b>16</b>, L<b>17</b> of the usable barrel the width of possibly existing cylinder bearing rings, of possibly existing channels and of possibly existing shell surface areas which must be accessible, for example, for operating bracing and/or clamping devices.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an advantageous embodiment, the satellite or counter-pressure cylinder <b>18</b> also substantially has the above-mentioned dimensions and ratios of at least the associated transfer cylinder <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As schematically represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the dressings, covers or blankets <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> are embodied as flexible plates, for example, wherein the dressing <b>21</b> embodied as a rubber blanket <b>21</b> is structured as a so-called metallic printing blanket <b>21</b>, having an elastic and/or compressible layer <b>22</b>, which is shown in dashed lines, and which is arranged on a support plate <b>23</b>. Only the reference symbols in regard to the metallic printing blanket <b>21</b> are connected by dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As a rule, a plate-shaped printing forme <b>19</b>, or a support plate <b>23</b> for a rubber printing blanket, consists of a flexible, but otherwise dimensionally stable material, for example an aluminum alloy, and has two oppositely located ends <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> to be fastened in or on the cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, and of a material thickness MS of 0.2 mm to 0.4 mm, for example, and of preferably 0.3 mm, wherein, for being embodied as suspension legs <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, these ends <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are beveled or angled along a bending line, in relation to the elongated length I of the dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>, by an angle α, or β of between 40° and 140°, and preferably of between 45°, 90° or 135°, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A leading end <b>24</b> of dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> is beveled, for example, at an acute angle α or of 40° to 50°, and in particular of 45°, and a trailing end <b>26</b> is beveled at an angle β of 80° to 100°, and in particular of 90°. If only a single dressing <b>21</b> has been applied in the circumferential direction of the cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, and in particular of the circumferential direction of the transfer cylinder <b>17</b>, the length I of the dressing <b>21</b> nearly corresponds to the circumference of this transfer cylinder <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In principle, the beveled edges <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> of the dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> can now be inserted into a slit-shaped opening, which extends axis-parallel, and in the longitudinal direction, on the circumference of the respective cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>. The ends <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> of the dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> are maintained in place by their shape, by friction or by deformation, for example. However, the dressing ends <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> can also be basically fixed in place by application of a spring force, by pressure devices, or by a centrifugal force which is effective during the press operation. In an advantageous embodiment, the slit-shaped openings for printing plates <b>19</b>, arranged side-by-side in the axial direction on the forme cylinder <b>16</b>, are each arranged in alignment, for example are each arranged in the form of a continuous slit-shaped opening, as will be described subsequently, while the openings for the rubber blankets <b>21</b>, which are arranged side-by-side on the transfer cylinder <b>17</b>, are not continuously offset, but instead are arranged in alternation with each other by 180° in the circumferential direction. In a perspective view, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <i>b </i>there is depicted an example of a preferred embodiment of the forme cylinder <b>16</b>. Two channels <b>27</b> are provided in the forme cylinder <b>16</b>. Both of these channels <b>27</b> extend continuously, in the axial direction of the forme cylinder <b>16</b>, over at least the entire length of the six sections A to F on the barrel, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>. These two channels <b>27</b> are arranged offset, in respect to each other, for example by 180°, in the circumferential direction of the forme cylinder <b>16</b>. The two channels <b>27</b> are arranged underneath a shell surface <b>30</b> of forme cylinder <b>16</b>, in the interior of the cylinder <b>16</b> and are embodied as circular bores, for example, and each have a narrow, slit-shaped opening <b>28</b> facing toward the shell surface <b>30</b> of the cylinder <b>16</b> and extending over the length of the six sections A to Fig., as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>. A slit width s<b>16</b>, in the circumferential direction of the opening <b>28</b> on the forme cylinder <b>16</b>, is less than 5 mm, and preferably lies in the range of 1 mm to 3 mm, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The beveled edges <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> of the printing forme <b>19</b> can now each be inserted into one of the openings <b>28</b>, which are axis-parallel in the longitudinal direction on the circumference, and can be fixed in place, or at least the trailing end <b>26</b> can be fixed in place, by the use of a holding device <b>29</b>, <b>31</b> which is arranged in the channel <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Here, the holding device <b>29</b>, <b>31</b> has at least one clamping element <b>29</b> and a spring element <b>31</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c</i>.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In an embodiment which is particularly advantageous in connection with the printing units <b>02</b>, or in connection with cylinders <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> of a width of six pages, a device <b>52</b> for pushing a dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> against a cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, and in particular for pushing a printing forme <b>19</b> against the forme cylinder <b>16</b> of at least one of the printing towers <b>01</b>, is assigned to at least two cylinders <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, in particular two forme cylinders <b>16</b>. This device <b>52</b> is referred to as a pressing device <b>52</b> in what follows. For example, use of this pressing device <b>52</b> is advantageous if it is intended to perform a rapid, for example a flying plate change, in two corresponding printing groups <b>13</b>. It is advantageous, in particular, for a rapid, dependable and exact product change if such a pressing device <b>52</b> is assigned to all of the forme cylinders <b>16</b> of a printing tower <b>01</b>. An appropriate pressing device <b>52</b> in accordance with the present invention has one or several pressing elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, for example strips, plungers or roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, which can be selectively placed against one or against several dressings <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>. This makes possible a controlled and guided draw-on, or tensioning or a controlled releasing or removing of the dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>. It is also possible, by use of this pressing device <b>52</b>, to move one end <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> of the dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> into the corresponding channel <b>27</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, or into the opening <b>28</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>, <b>41</b>, or to keep down a released end <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, or the partially released dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> in a desired position. The pressing device <b>52</b> extends along the cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> at least in the entire area of the sections A to F, i.e. in the area of the barrel of the cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> which is effective for printing.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The embodiment of the pressing device <b>52</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is particularly advantageous in connection with the embodiment of the common actuating device <b>32</b> extending over all of the sections A to Fig., as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In this configuration, the draw-on, change and/or removal, individually or in groups, is also possible for six printing formes <b>19</b> that are arranged side-by-side on the forme cylinder <b>16</b>, without an increased outlay of actuating devices or of operating supply needing to provided within the forme cylinder <b>16</b>. Production, assembly and maintenance is also considerably simplified by this.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">For each section A to F, in the case of six dressings <b>19</b> arranged side-by-side, or for each section AB, CD, EF, in case of three dressings <b>21</b> arranged side-by-side, the pressing device <b>52</b> has at least one first pressing element <b>53</b>, for example one first pressing roller element <b>53</b>. In an advantageous embodiment, in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, pressing device <b>52</b> also has a second pressing element <b>54</b>, for example a second pressing roller element <b>54</b> that is spaced apart from this first roller element <b>53</b> in the circumferential direction of the cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, for each section A to F, or for each section AB, CD, EF. In connection with the forme cylinder <b>16</b>, only the center sections B, C and D, as well as the roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> assigned to these sections B, C and D, are represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. A pressing device <b>52</b> including a first pressing roller element <b>53</b>, or a group of first pressing roller elements <b>53</b> arranged side-by-side in the axial direction, as well as, for example, a second pressing roller element <b>54</b>, or a group of second pressing roller elements <b>54</b> arranged side-by-side in the axial direction, is arranged for each section A to F, or AB to EF. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a first roller element <b>53</b> and a group of three second roller elements <b>54</b> for each section A to F, or AB to EF is represented. In view of the danger of possible tilting, and of possibly wrong axial orientation, the arrangement of groups of at least two roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, which can be moved independently of each other, is advantageous. A single roller element <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> for a section A to F, or for sections AB to EF is embodied, for example, not as a roller <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> extending in the longitudinal direction over almost the length of the sections A to F, or AB to EF, but as a roller element <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> of a group only as a roller <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> of, for example, at most a fraction of the length of the section A to F, or AB to EF.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, which are arranged axially side-by-side, as well as the roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> which are arranged one behind the other in the circumferential direction, if both roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> are provided, are, in principle, arranged, to be movable independently of each other, for example, on a cross arm <b>56</b>, or on several cross arms <b>56</b>. The sole first roller element <b>53</b>, or the group of first roller elements <b>53</b> of each section A to F, or AB to EF, as well as the sole second roller element <b>54</b>, or the group of second roller elements <b>54</b>, if provided, of each section A to F, or AB to EF, can be actuated independently of each other by their respective own actuating devices <b>57</b>, <b>58</b>. These actuating devices <b>57</b>, <b>88</b> are embodied as reversibly deformable hollow bodies <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> which can be actuated by a pressure medium, and in particular are embodied as hoses <b>57</b>, <b>58</b>. However, it is also possible to provide differently configured, such as electrically or magnetically actuable actuating devices. For stretching a dressing <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> on one of the sections A to F, or AB to EF, the leading end <b>24</b> of the dressing, which leading end of the dressing <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> is beveled at an acute angle, is inserted into the appropriate opening <b>28</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>, <b>41</b>. The first roller element, or elements assigned to this section A to F, or AB to EF, as well as, if provided, the second roller element, or elements assigned to this section A to F, or AB to EF, are placed against the cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, or the against already suspended dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> to be drawn on. If one or if several dressings <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> have already been arranged on the cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> and are to remain there, the first and/or the second roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> assigned to this section A to F, or AB to EF, are also placed against the respective dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>. If first and second roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> are provided, in the course of the cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> with the roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> rolling off against each other, the second roller element <b>54</b> pushes the trailing beveled end <b>26</b> of the dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> into the opening <b>28</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>, <b>41</b> when rolling across it. If only first roller elements <b>53</b> are provided, these perform the inserting pressure. In the course of this procedure, the roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> remain stationary, while the cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> is rotated in a production direction P, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The holding elements for the sections A to F, or AB to EF, for example the one or the several clamping elements, change into their or its holding or clamping position; i.e. are closed. After the holding elements has changed from its, or their release position into its, or their holding position, all of the roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> of the affected section A to F, or AB to EF, or their dressings, are pulled back.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">When releasing a dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>, it is necessary to ascertain whether one or several dressings <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> should remain on the cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>. In this case, initially at least one of the roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, which is assigned to the remaining dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>, should be placed or is placed against this remaining dressing in the area of its trailing end <b>26</b>, or close to the opening <b>28</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>, <b>41</b>. The roller element <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> assigned to the dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> to be released can remain in place or is pulled back. The holding element for the sections A to F, or AB to EF is opened. The trailing end <b>26</b> of the dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> to be released will be released or removed from the channel <b>27</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> by its inherent tension, while the dressings <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> which are to remain are held down by the roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>. The holding element is then closed again. If the pressing device <b>52</b> has first and second roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> respectively, the dressings <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> which are to remain in place are advantageously held down by at least the second roller elements <b>54</b>. In connection with the dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> to be removed, at least the second roller element <b>54</b> is initially pulled back, so that the trailing end <b>26</b> can leave the channel <b>27</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, and the first roller element <b>53</b> is placed against it, so that the already partially released dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> is still guided and maintained on the cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Thereafter, the cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> can be rotated, preferably opposite to the production direction P, until the leading end <b>24</b> can be removed from the channel <b>27</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> and the dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> can be removed. If, in the course of unclamping the dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>, no remaining dressings <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> need to be considered, the roller elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> relating to the dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b> pertaining to the sections A to F, or AB to EF can, in principle, assume any arbitrary operating position during the procedure, and are preferably pulled away.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It is thus possible to fix dressings <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>, placed on the shell surface <b>30</b>, <b>40</b> of the cylinder <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, in place, as needed, by respectively at least one pressing element <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, while an end <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> of a dressing <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>, or several dressings <b>19</b>, <b>21</b>, is, or are released, i.e. is or are not pressed on.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In an advantageous embodiment, cylinders <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> of the printing unit <b>02</b> are driven in such a way that the printing groups <b>13</b> of the printing unit <b>02</b> can each be rotatably driven by a drive motor <b>61</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which is independent of the remaining printing units <b>13</b>.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The above-described embodiments of the printing unit <b>02</b>, or of the printing groups <b>13</b>, or of their cylinders <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, or of the drive mechanism, allow low-oscillation, exactly color congruent printing of high quality with a small technical and spatial outlay, in regard to the attainable product size.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">After the web <b>03</b> of, for example, a width of six printed pages has been imprinted, it runs into the area of the superstructure <b>04</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, possibly via guide elements and/or traction rollers, which are not further identified, and is guided through the longitudinal cutting arrangement <b>06</b>, for example. The cutting arrangement <b>06</b> has, for example, a traction roller <b>81</b> driven by its own drive motor <b>80</b>, for example, and with which traction roller <b>81</b>, suitable pressing rollers can work together for preventing slippage, all as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The longitudinal cutting arrangement <b>06</b> and the traction roller <b>81</b> can also be embodied separately wherein, however, another roller preferably works, together with the longitudinal cutting arrangement <b>06</b>, as a counter-roller. The web <b>03</b> is longitudinally cut in this longitudinal cutting arrangement <b>06</b>, into several, for example into three webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>of partial width, and which are called partial webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>for short. These partial webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, and <b>03</b><i>c </i>are symbolized by center lines, with the lines <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b </i>only being suggested. These partial webs <b>03</b>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>are conducted to subsequent guide elements, for example to rollers of register arrangements <b>08</b>, to turning bars of turning devices <b>07</b>, to lead rollers for the entry into the former, or to traction rollers. In order to achieve a low oscillation web conveyance in regard to the web tension, individual, several, or all of the guide elements which are non-driven or which are driven only by friction with the web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>, and which are intended for guiding the web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>, can be embodied with a reduced length. In this way, it is possible to considerably reduce, beside the length, the great size of the guide elements otherwise required for presses of a width of six printed pages, and along with this, to reduce their inertia. The otherwise existing danger of oscillations in the web tension, which oscillations are existing, in particular, in connection with speed changes, is effectively reduced, which, in turn, affects the ability to maintain color congruence, and therefore the quality of the printing. The following remarks regarding guide elements of reduced length, ability for lateral changes, as well as the assignment of a register roller to another guide element, can be applied to the most various printing presses, but are of particular advantage in connection with wide, for example six plate-wide presses.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A first preferred embodiment of at least a portion of the superstructure <b>04</b> is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> in a perspective, oblique view. By way of example, the partial web <b>03</b><i>b </i>is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> as a partial web <b>03</b><i>b </i>turned from the center in an outward direction. A second one of the partial webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>could be turned, for example by the use of a second such turning device <b>07</b>, also into another alignment. A second turning device, which is not specifically depicted, can be located, for example, above or below the first turning device <b>07</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As is customary, the turning device <b>07</b> has two parallel or crossed turning bars <b>82</b> as the guide element <b>82</b>, which two turning bars <b>82</b> form an angle of approximately 45°, or of approximately 135° with the conveying direction of the incoming partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>, and by the use of which turning bars <b>82</b> an incoming web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>can be laterally offset or cambered. Advantageously, the turning bars <b>82</b> have a length L<b>82</b>, whose projection on the transverse extension of the incoming partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>is slightly greater, for example is 0% to 20% greater, than the width of the incoming partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>, i.e. the turning bar length L<b>82</b> is approximately 1.4 to 1.7 times that of the partial web width. The length L<b>82</b> has been selected to be at least such, that its projection is less than or equal to twice the width of a partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>of a width of two pages, i.e. the length L<b>82</b> is at most 2.8 times the partial web width. In an advantageous further development, the turning bars <b>82</b> are each separately seated on individual supports <b>83</b>, the location of which supports <b>83</b> can be changed transversely to the direction of the incoming partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>on at least one guide element <b>84</b>. The now “short” turning bars <b>82</b> can now be brought from the desired web guidance into the required position in accordance with the respective requirements. Possibly both turning bars <b>82</b> can be seated on such a support <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Offset, turned, transferred and/or cambered partial webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>as a rule undergo an offset in the running direction in comparison with other partial webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>, and their linear register is therefore corrected by the use of a register arrangement <b>08</b>. The register arrangement <b>08</b> has as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, at least one roller <b>86</b> as a guide element <b>86</b>, which at least one roller <b>86</b> can be moved parallel with the running direction. In an advantageous manner, the guide element roller <b>86</b>, or several rollers <b>86</b>, of the register arrangement <b>08</b> have a length L<b>86</b>, which is slightly greater, for example between 0% to 20% greater, than the width of the incoming partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>. The length L<b>86</b> is at least less than or equal to twice the width of a partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>of a width of two pages. In an advantageous further development, the register arrangement <b>08</b> is seated, in a displaceable manner, transversely to the direction of the incoming partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>on at least one guide element <b>87</b>. The now narrow register arrangement <b>08</b>, or its short rollers <b>86</b>, can now be brought from the desired web guidance into the required position in accordance with the respective requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Besides being cut, turned and possibly registered, the partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>is now conducted in the superstructure <b>04</b>, possibly by the use of further, non-driven guide elements, such as guide rollers, which are not specifically represented, until it finally is conducted to a lead or a harp roller <b>88</b> of the so-called harp <b>09</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and which is arranged upstream of the folding structure <b>11</b>. For straight-running webs <b>03</b>, or for partial webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>, a registration roller <b>91</b>, extending over the full web width b<b>03</b> and displaceable in the conveying direction, as well as a rerouting roller <b>92</b>, are, for example, arranged in the superstructure <b>04</b> upstream of the harp roller <b>89</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In an advantageous embodiment, again as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a length L<b>88</b> of a guide roller and/or of a harp roller <b>88</b>, <b>93</b> is slightly greater, for example is 0% to 20% greater, than the width of the incoming partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>. The length L<b>88</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, or L<b>93</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is at least less than or equal to twice the width of a partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>of a width of two pages. In the preferred embodiment, in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the “short” harp roller <b>88</b> is realized as a section <b>88</b> of a harp roller <b>89</b> which, in this embodiment, is divided, but which extends as a whole over a web <b>03</b> of a width of six printed pages. In this case, the several sections <b>88</b> of the harp roller <b>89</b> are rotatably seated independently of each other.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">However, instead, of or in addition to a section <b>88</b>, the “short” harp roller <b>88</b>, <b>93</b> can also be embodied as a separate harp roller <b>93</b> arranged, on a frame, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The latter can then be arranged either fixed on the frame, or can be displaceable transversely to the direction of the incoming partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>on a support <b>94</b>, which support <b>94</b> is, in turn, mounted on a guide element <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Since the offset, in the course of turning, offsetting, cambering, or the like, only effects this partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>and is tied to its specific web guidance, it is possible, in an advantageous embodiment, to assign the required register arrangement <b>08</b> to at least one of the guide elements determining the course of the partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>, such as, for example, the turning device <b>07</b>, or a turning bar <b>82</b>, or the harp <b>09</b>, or a “short” harp roller <b>93</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the “short” register arrangement <b>08</b> is assigned, for example, to the “short” harp roller <b>93</b> and can be displaced, together with the latter, on the guide element <b>96</b> transversely to the direction of the incoming partial web <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the “short” register arrangement <b>08</b> is assigned, for example, to one of the “short” turning bars <b>82</b> and can be displaced, together with the latter, on the guide element <b>84</b> transversely to the direction of the incoming partial web <b>03</b><i>b</i>. Although this arrangement is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> for crossed turning bars <b>82</b>, it is to be applied to the parallel turning bars <b>82</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. For the case of the turning bars <b>82</b> extending crossed, or orthogonally in respect to each other, at least one rerouting roller <b>97</b> or as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, two rerouting rollers <b>97</b>, each with an axis of rotation extending perpendicularly to the axis of rotation of the roller <b>81</b>, is or are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In an advantageous further development, two such “short” devices, which can be displaced together with the register and turning arrangement <b>08</b>, <b>07</b>, or with the register or harp roller <b>93</b>, are arranged above or below each other per full web <b>03</b> in the superstructure <b>04</b> of a triple-wide printing press.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The guide elements <b>84</b>, <b>96</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, of the previously discussed preferred embodiments, can be realized in various ways. For example, the guide elements <b>84</b>, <b>96</b> can be embodied as spindles, each having a screw thread at least over parts of each spindle, and which spindles are rotatably seated on both sides and which can be rotatorily driven, for example, by a drive mechanism, which is not specifically represented. The supports <b>83</b>, <b>94</b> can also be guided in rigid guide elements <b>84</b>, <b>96</b>, for example on profiled strips in the manner of sliding blocks. In this case, the support <b>83</b>, <b>94</b> can also be provided by means of a driveable spindle, or in another way.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Various transitions or offsets of partial webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>over one or two partial web widths, or also over multiples of half a partial web width, are possible by the use of the transversely displaceable turning bar <b>82</b>. In the course of this, the imprinted partial webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>are aligned with one of several, here three, formers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> of the folding structure <b>11</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, which three formers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> are arranged side-by-side transversely to the web running direction. The transition takes place, for example, for meeting the requirements for different sizes of individual strands, or for finally intermediate or end products, wherein it is simultaneously intended to perform effective printing with as full as possible web widths.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In an advantageous embodiment, the superstructure <b>04</b> has at least (n*(m/2−1) turning arrangements <b>07</b> for n full webs <b>03</b>, <b>03</b>′, for example n printing towers <b>01</b>, to be imprinted, each with a maximum width b<b>03</b> of m printed pages. In the case of a printing press of a width of six pages and, for example, three webs <b>03</b>, <b>03</b>′, or three printing towers <b>01</b>, per section, six turning arrangements <b>07</b> per sector are advantageous.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In an embodiment of a printing press with, for example, two sections of three printing towers <b>01</b> each and a total of six webs <b>03</b>, <b>03</b>′, <b>03</b>″ of a width of four printed pages and intended for four-color imprinting on both sides, at least three turning arrangements <b>07</b> per section are arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In an advantageous embodiment of a printing press with, for example, two sections of two printing towers <b>01</b> each, and a total of six webs <b>03</b>, <b>03</b>′, <b>03</b>″ of a width of four printed pages and intended for four-color imprinting on both sides, four turning arrangements <b>07</b> per section are arranged, for example. A product of a total size of 96 pages can then be produced in collection operation in this printing press with two sections, or a total of four printing towers <b>01</b> and with four webs <b>03</b>, <b>03</b>′. Besides the offset of a partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>by a whole number multiple of its partial web width b<b>03</b><i>a</i>, a type of operation is advantageous wherein a partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>is offset by an odd-numbered multiple of half a partial web width b<b>03</b><i>a </i>and/or former width i.e. the partial web is offset by a factor of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. This offset can take place by the use of long turning bars which are not specifically represented, and which are extending over the total width of the printing press, or the width b<b>03</b><i>a </i>of the entire web <b>03</b>, but can also advantageously take place by the use of the above described “short” turning bars <b>82</b>. For example, the turning bars <b>82</b> are then arranged, as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in such a way that the turning bar <b>82</b>, around which the partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>is first looped, is aligned over at least the entire width with a subsequent former <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, while the second turning bar <b>82</b> is aligned with at least two adjoining halves of two subsequent side-by-side arranged formers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>, which is offset by an odd-numbered multiple of half a former width b<b>101</b>, or by a partial web width b<b>03</b><i>a</i>, thus runs “between” the formers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>. This is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> by the example of the former arrangement of a width of six printed pages at a partial web <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c </i>of a width of two pages, but can also be applied to presses of different widths. It is therefore unnecessary to imprint partial webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>, each of a width of only one printed page, or partial webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>, each of a width of one-half a former width b<b>101</b> per se, and to conduct them through the printing press.

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, two groups, each of respectively three formers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, or <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>, <b>108</b>, which two groups being vertically offset in respect to each other, are arranged for the printing press of a width of six printed pages. For four printed pages wide printing presses, these can be respectively two, for eight printed pages wide printing presses there can be respectively four formers arranged side-by-side in each group. Respectively, one upper former and one lower former <b>101</b>, <b>106</b>, or <b>102</b>, <b>107</b>, or <b>103</b>, <b>108</b> are aligned with each other in pairs in the above described manner and respectively with a center plane M.

The harp rollers <b>89</b>, <b>93</b> of the two rows are here arranged again in a common frame, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">If, in fact and as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, two folding structures <b>11</b> are provided for the two sections, it can nevertheless be advantageous to provide for at least one of the two harps <b>09</b> a number of harp rollers <b>89</b>, <b>93</b>, possibly in the two above mentioned rows, which would be required for both sectors. Thus, an even greater amount of flexibility in production size and in production composition is provided. If required, webs <b>03</b>, <b>03</b>′ imprinted in one section can now be conducted for further processing to the harp <b>09</b> of the other section, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, at least one of the partial webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>, etc. passing through the common harp <b>09</b> arranged upstream of the upper former <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> can be or is conducted to the lower former <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>, <b>108</b>.

In this way, depending on where the “separation” into partial webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>, etc. from the common harp <b>09</b> is located, a flexible production of differently sized intermediate products, such as booklets, books, or end products, is possible with a reduced outlay. A second row of harp rollers <b>89</b>, <b>93</b> is shown in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, by the use of which partial webs <b>03</b><i>a</i>, <b>03</b><i>b</i>, <b>03</b><i>c</i>, for example from another section, can also be received, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the case of multi-colored products and when using the above-described folding structure <b>11</b> with a common harp <b>09</b>, it is advantageous, with regard to flexibility, to embody all printing units <b>02</b> or printing towers <b>01</b>, or the paths of the web <b>03</b>, <b>03</b>′ in the same color.
