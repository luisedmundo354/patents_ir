<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention pertains generally to snowboard bindings, and more particularly to snowboard bindings designed to absorb vibration and shock.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Snowboarding has rapidly become a popular winter sport, competing with skiing. Various types of equipment have been developed, to facilitate the enjoyment of the sport by all participants, from beginners to experts.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The binding, by which the boot is affixed to the board, is an important element. In addition to the terrain and snow conditions, as well as the ability of the rider, the combination of boot, binding, and board greatly influence the type of ride that the snowboarder will experience. The bindings connect the snowboarder to the board and allow the snowboarder to maneuver the board during a ride down a slope.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The snowboard is controlled by weight transfer and foot movement of the rider. Edge control is important to carve turns rather than just slide through the snow. It is desirable to improve the riders feel for the board and to increase the board's responsiveness to the riders foot movement. It is generally desirable to provide a secure attachment to the board, while at the same time providing some medial and lateral ankle mobility. The system should provide for vibration and shock absorption to provide a more comfortable ride, and allow the board to flex properly as it traverses the terrain. The system should of course be as lightweight as possible, safe, and adjustable, both for a single user for different conditions, and for multiple users.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The rider's feel for the board, and the board's responsiveness to the rider's foot movements, are increased by keeping the snowboarder's feet close to the board. Secure attachment of the boot to the board improves safety, in particular by allowing the efficient transfer of forces between the rider and the board, which aids the rider in controlling the board. Some medial and lateral ankle mobility is helpful for maneuvering the board. Riding over hard-packed or rough terrain, particularly at high speeds, is improved by vibration damping or absorption, and jumps and stunts are improved by shock absorption.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Of course, in addition to the bindings, a variety of different boots and boards are also available. These also affect the snowboarding experience.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, a wide variety of different bindings have been developed that incorporate features designed to address various of these problems and objectives. The goal is to provide a boot-binding-snowboard system so that riders of different levels, facing a variety of different conditions, can enjoy an optimum experience by selecting a system which matches the rider's ability to the rider's performance objectives.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In particular, the problem of vibration or shock damping or absorption is generally dealt with by providing some type of elastomeric pads between the boot and the board, usually as part of the binding, but sometimes also on the bottom of the boot. However, the materials used are exposed to harsh conditions and have a limited lifetime. Thus it is desirable to find a different and better way to provide vibration and shock damping and absorption.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring more specifically to the drawings, for illustrative purposes the present invention is embodied in the apparatus generally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. It will be appreciated that the apparatus may vary as to configuration and as to details of the parts, without departing from the basic concepts as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The invention applies to a snowboard-binding-boot system designed to damp or absorb vibration or shock. The invention is directed to a snowboard binding having a base plate structure formed of an upper plate and a lower plate separated by a plurality of springs. The springs are mounted in any manner that allows the top plate to be pushed down, thereby compressing the springs, when weight is redistributed on or additional force is applied to the top plate. The springs act as shock absorbers.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a base plate structure <b>10</b> of the invention. Base plate structure <b>10</b> is mounted on a snowboard <b>12</b>. Base plate structure <b>10</b> is formed of an upper or top plate <b>14</b>, on which a boot will sit, and a lower or bottom plate <b>16</b>, which is attached to the board <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each of upper and lower plates <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are substantially rectangular or elongated in shape and have a pair of flanges <b>18</b> extending from each lateral side thereof, typically near the front and rear of each lateral side. The flanges <b>18</b> generally extend outside the area over which the boot will sit. When the upper plate <b>14</b> is mounted over lower plate <b>16</b> in base plate structure <b>10</b>, each flange <b>18</b> of the upper plate <b>14</b> will be substantially aligned with a corresponding flange <b>18</b> of the lower plate <b>16</b>. A spring <b>20</b> is mounted between each of the four pairs of corresponding upper and lower flanges <b>18</b> so that upper plate <b>14</b> can move relative to lower plate <b>16</b> by compression and expansion of the springs <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the details of mounting the springs <b>20</b> between upper plate <b>14</b> and lower plate <b>16</b>. (Similar parts have the same identifying numbers.) Each flange <b>18</b> extending from the upper and lower plates <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> has an aperture <b>22</b> formed therein. The apertures <b>22</b> of upper plate <b>14</b> align with corresponding apertures <b>22</b> of lower plate <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A bolt <b>24</b> passes upwards through an aperture <b>24</b> in lower plate <b>16</b> and through the corresponding aligned aperture <b>22</b> of the upper plate <b>14</b>, where it is secured to a top cap <b>26</b>, e.g. top cap <b>26</b> screws onto the distal end of bolt <b>24</b>. A washer <b>28</b> is placed between the end cap <b>26</b> and flange <b>18</b> with the bolt <b>24</b> passing through the washer <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Surrounding the bolt <b>24</b> between the lower plate <b>16</b> and upper plate <b>14</b> are a lower spring seat <b>30</b>, a nut <b>32</b>, the spring <b>20</b>, and an upper spring seat <b>34</b>. Nut <b>32</b> is tightened down, with lower spring seat <b>30</b> underneath, so that one end of bolt <b>24</b> is secured to the bottom plate <b>16</b>, i.e. the lower plate <b>16</b> cannot move relative to bolt <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Lower spring seat <b>30</b> and upper spring seat <b>34</b> form seats at the lower and upper flanges <b>18</b> respectively for the ends of spring <b>20</b>, i.e. they are shaped to engage the ends of the springs <b>20</b>. As a result, the springs are kept in a substantially vertical orientation; otherwise they would tend to tilt in operation. An alternate way of seating springs <b>20</b> in the binding plate structure <b>10</b> is to have the ends of the springs <b>20</b> extend into recesses formed in the upper and lower plates <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When there is no weight on the upper plate <b>14</b>, the spring tension forces the upper plate <b>14</b> apart from lower plate <b>16</b>. Bolt <b>24</b> defines the maximum separation between plates <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. End caps <b>26</b> prevent the plate <b>14</b> from moving any farther, i.e. the plate <b>14</b> is pushed by spring <b>20</b> into contact with end cap <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">However, the upper plate <b>14</b> can move relative to bolt <b>24</b> (and end cap <b>26</b>). When weight is applied to top plate <b>14</b>, plate <b>14</b> is pushed down, compressing spring <b>20</b>. Plate <b>14</b> can move down away from end cap <b>26</b> and slide down along bolt <b>24</b> when weight is applied. The flanges <b>18</b> extend outside the footprint of the boot so that upper plate <b>14</b> can compress the springs <b>20</b> and move downwards along the bolts <b>24</b>, i.e. the bolt <b>24</b> will extend upwards alongside the boot.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The distance down that the plate <b>14</b> will move will be determined by the weight applied and by the spring force. If the weight is applied uniformly, then plate <b>14</b> will move uniformly down on all the springs. However, weight can be applied unevenly, e.g. along one side or at just one corner, during particular maneuvers. Then the compression will be uneven. The springs are generally chosen for a particular rider so that the upper plate will be at its topmost position. The springs will then allow for weight redistribution, and absorb vibrations of the board and shocks produced by impact on the board, e.g. during jumps or other stunts.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Of course the springs <b>20</b> will be relatively short and relatively stiff to limit the amount of motion available. A typical spacing between the upper and lower plates <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> is about 1 to about 1½ inches.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Bottom plate <b>16</b> contains a central aperture <b>36</b> and a central cap <b>38</b>. These are used in a conventional manner to mount or affix the bottom plate <b>16</b> to the board, and also to allow adjustment of the binding position, i.e. to rotate the plate <b>16</b> to be positioned at a different angle to the length of the board. Other apertures in the plates <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are merely to reduce weight.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (most of the elements are identical and are not numbered), but includes a pair of lateral brackets <b>42</b> mounted on top plate <b>14</b> of base plate structure <b>10</b>. Brackets <b>42</b> are L-shaped and are secured to top plate <b>14</b> by bolts <b>44</b> passing through apertures <b>46</b> in the horizontal portion of the bracket <b>42</b>, and through aligned apertures <b>40</b> in top plate <b>14</b>. The distal ends of bolts <b>44</b> are secured with nuts <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Lateral brackets <b>42</b> extend along the two lateral edges of top plate <b>14</b> and provide a support structure for laterally holding the boots. The vertical portion of the bracket <b>42</b> contains a plurality of horizontal slots <b>50</b>, which may be used to secure other components of the binding.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The base plate structure <b>10</b> with its spring-based suspension system connecting the upper and lower plates <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, forms the basis of the binding for a snowboard. The remainder of the binding comprises the boot attachment apparatus; any conventional components for attaching a boot to the binding can be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref> illustrate two examples.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a binding <b>60</b> of the invention that has the base plate structure <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>. Binding <b>60</b> has a front or toe strap <b>61</b> connected to a toe cap <b>62</b> with a tensioning and release buckle <b>63</b>, and a mid-boot strap <b>64</b> connected to mid-boot retainer <b>65</b> with a tensioning and release buckle <b>66</b>. Binding <b>60</b> also has a heel portion <b>67</b>. The heel portion <b>67</b> and the straps <b>61</b>, <b>64</b> are connected to a base portion <b>68</b> which is mounted on the top plate <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A boot fits into binding <b>60</b> with the heel against heel portion <b>67</b>. Toe cap <b>62</b> and mid-boot retainer <b>65</b> are tightened against the boot by buckles <b>63</b>, <b>66</b> on straps <b>61</b>, <b>64</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a binding <b>70</b> of the invention that has the base plate structure <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> and the lateral brackets <b>42</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Binding <b>70</b>, similar to binding <b>60</b>, has a front or toe strap <b>61</b> connected to a toe cap <b>62</b> with a tensioning and release buckle <b>63</b>, and a mid-boot strap <b>64</b> connected to a mid-boot retainer <b>65</b> with a tensioning and release buckle <b>66</b>. Binding <b>60</b> also has a heel portion <b>72</b>. The heel portion <b>72</b> and the straps <b>61</b> are connected to the lateral brackets <b>42</b>, which are mounted on the top plate <b>14</b>. Straps <b>64</b> are connected to the heel portion <b>72</b>. A boot fits into binding <b>70</b>, held between heel portion <b>72</b> and lateral brackets <b>42</b>, by toe cap <b>62</b> and strap <b>61</b> and mid-boot retainer <b>65</b> and strap <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The invention thus provides a snowboard binding which damps or absorbs vibration and shock. The compression and expansion of the springs between the upper and lower base plates provides the mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">While this invention has been described in terms of a snowboard binding, the binding is also suitable for use in conjunction with other types of boards, such as wakeboards, or similar boards where it is desirable to provide for dampening of vibration, and shock absorption. Thus, in its broadest context, the invention is a binding for any type of board where it is necessary or desirable to reduce vibration and absorb shock.</p>
