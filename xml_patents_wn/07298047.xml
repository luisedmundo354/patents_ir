<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an electronic circuit device and, more specifically, relates to an electronic circuit device capable of dissipating heat generated by an electronic component included in the electronic circuit device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the past, multilayer substrates for embedding electronic components so as to obtain highly dense and highly integrated electronic components, such as semiconductor chips (e.g., PCT Japanese Translation Patent Publication No. 7-107954).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method for producing a known multilayer substrate with embedded electronic components will be briefly described in sequence below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a substrate <b>1</b>. On one of the surfaces (upper surface in the drawings) of the substrate <b>1</b>, wiring is provided by copper foil <b>2</b> so as to form a circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a semiconductor chip <b>3</b> with its active surface (device surface) facing toward the substrate <b>1</b> is disposed on the substrate <b>1</b>. Bumps <b>4</b> are formed on electrodes (not shown in the drawings) of the semiconductor chip <b>3</b>. The semiconductor chip <b>3</b> is fixed to the substrate <b>1</b> by a bonding member, such as solder or conductive paste, and is electrically connected to the circuit via the copper foil <b>2</b>. A sealing resin <b>5</b> is interposed between the semiconductor chip <b>3</b> and the substrate <b>1</b> so as to increase the connection strength between the substrate <b>1</b> and the semiconductor chip <b>3</b> and to prevent intrusion of moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the upper surface of the substrate <b>1</b> with the semiconductor chip <b>3</b> is flattened by applying a resin <b>6</b>. On the surface of the substrate <b>1</b> flattened by the resin <b>6</b>, wiring is provided by the copper foil <b>7</b>, a circuit is formed, and a substrate <b>8</b> is stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, through-holes are formed in the substrate <b>1</b> and the substrate <b>8</b> from the upper surface of the substrate <b>8</b> to the lower surface of the substrate <b>1</b> in positions where the semiconductor chip is not disposed. By plating each of the through-holes entirely with a conductive material, such as copper, through-holes <b>9</b> are formed. Circuits composed of copper foil <b>10</b> are formed on the upper surface of the substrate <b>8</b> and are electrically connected to the through-holes <b>9</b>. Other circuits composed of copper foil <b>11</b> are formed on the lower surface of the substrate <b>1</b> and are electrically connected to the through-holes <b>9</b>. In this way, a multilayer substrate <b>21</b> is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, the known multilayer substrate <b>21</b> is produced by including the semiconductor chip <b>3</b> in the multilayer substrate <b>21</b> as part of the multilayer substrate <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Recently, in the technological field of mobile phones and home information appliances, there has been a demand for reduction in size and weight and improvement in advanced functions. For this reason, highly efficient electronic devices have been in demand for mobile phones and home information appliances. However, many of these highly efficient electronic devices generate high-temperature heat.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The above-described known multilayer substrate <b>21</b> includes the semiconductor chip <b>3</b> flatted by the resin <b>6</b> and/or surrounded by the substrates <b>1</b> and <b>8</b>. Therefore, it is difficult to dissipate the heat generated by the semiconductor chip <b>3</b> to outside the multilayer substrate <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The electronic circuit device according to an embodiment of the present invention has taken into consideration the above-described problem and is capable of dissipating heat generated from electronic components embedded in the electronic circuit device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The electronic circuit device according to an embodiment of the present invention includes at least a first substrate and a second substrate, a spacer substrate interposed between the first substrate and the second substrate, an electronic component interposed between the first substrate and the second substrate, and at least one through-hole formed on the second circuit substrate opposing the first circuit substrate. The spacer substrate mutually connects the first substrate and the second substrate. The electronic component is connected to the first circuit substrate with the active surface of the electronic component. The through-hole penetrates from a first surface of the second circuit substrate opposing the first substrate to a second surface of the second circuit substrate. The first circuit substrate is connected to the electronic component.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The electronic component may be a semiconductor chip or a chip-type electronic component.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional side view of an electronic circuit device <b>51</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The electronic circuit device <b>51</b> is constituted by stacking a circuit substrate <b>61</b> on a circuit substrate <b>62</b>, wherein spacer substrates <b>63</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>63</b>-<b>2</b> and an electronic component <b>64</b> are interposed between the circuit substrate <b>61</b> and the circuit substrate <b>62</b>. Hereinafter, when the spacer substrates <b>63</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>63</b>-<b>2</b> do not have to be distinguished from each other, the spacer substrates <b>63</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>63</b>-<b>2</b> will be referred to as ‘spacer substrates <b>63</b>.’</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The circuit substrates <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> are each formed by stacking three layers including a rigid substrate. The rigid substrate is constituted of an insulating plate that is made of an electric insulator, such as glass epoxy, and has a copper-foil electric circuit (not shown in the drawing). The circuit substrates <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> may be constituted of a single rigid substrate or more than three layers of rigid substrates, and an electric circuit does not have be formed on all rigid substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As illustrated from the left of the drawing, the spacer substrate <b>63</b>-<b>1</b>, the electronic component <b>64</b>, the spacer substrate <b>63</b>-<b>2</b> are disposed on the uppermost surface <b>62</b><i>a </i>(the surface opposing the circuit substrate <b>61</b>) of the circuit substrate <b>62</b>. More specifically, lands (not shown in the drawing) formed on the lower surfaces of the spacer substrate <b>63</b>-<b>1</b>, the electronic component <b>64</b>, and the spacer substrate <b>63</b>-<b>2</b> correspond to lands (not shown in the drawing) formed on the uppermost surface <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the circuit substrate <b>62</b>. A bonding member <b>71</b>-<b>1</b>, a bonding member <b>73</b>, and a bonding member <b>71</b>-<b>2</b> electrically and mechanically (physically) connected the lands formed on the lower surfaces of the spacer substrate <b>63</b>-<b>1</b>, the electronic component <b>64</b>, and the spacer substrate <b>63</b>-<b>2</b>, respectively, and the lands formed on the uppermost surface <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the circuit substrate <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Lands (not shown in the drawing) formed on the upper surfaces (surfaces opposing the circuit substrate <b>61</b>) of the spacer substrate <b>63</b>-<b>1</b> and the spacer substrate <b>63</b>-<b>2</b> correspond to lands (not shown in the drawing) formed on the lowermost surface <b>61</b><i>b </i>of the circuit substrate <b>61</b>. A bonding member <b>72</b>-<b>1</b> and a bonding member <b>72</b>-<b>2</b> electrically and mechanically connected the lands formed on the upper surfaces (surfaces opposing the circuit substrate <b>61</b>) of the spacer substrate <b>63</b>-<b>1</b> and the spacer substrate <b>63</b>-<b>2</b>, respectively, and the lands formed on the lowermost surface <b>61</b><i>b </i>of the circuit substrate <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">On the circuit substrate <b>61</b>, substantially right above of the electronic component <b>64</b> disposed on and connected to the circuit substrate <b>62</b>, a through-hole <b>65</b> passing through from the uppermost surface <b>61</b><i>a </i>to the lowermost surface <b>61</b><i>b </i>of the circuit substrate <b>61</b> is formed. A heat-dissipation resin <b>66</b> is filled inside the through-holes <b>65</b> and between the lower edges of the through-holes <b>65</b> and the upper surface <b>64</b><i>a </i>(i.e., surface opposing the circuit substrate <b>61</b>) of the electronic components <b>64</b> so that the upper surface <b>64</b><i>a </i>is covered with the heat-dissipation resin <b>66</b>. The through-holes <b>65</b> only have to be large enough such that the heat-dissipation resin <b>66</b> can be filled inside and the diameter, for example, is 1 to 2 mm. As the heat-dissipation resin <b>66</b>, a resin that can be removed from the electronic circuit device <b>51</b> when heated is used.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The spacer substrates <b>63</b>, similar to the circuit substrates <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>, are constituted of a rigid substrate and are capable of electrically connecting the circuit substrates <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> and are capable of maintaining a predetermined gap between the circuit substrates <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>. More specifically, the distance between the circuit substrates <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> can be 0.4 to 1.6 mm depending on the thickness of the spacer substrates <b>63</b>. In this way, the electronic component <b>64</b> having a thickness smaller than the gap can be interposed between the circuit substrates <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>. On the upper and lower surfaces of the spacer substrates <b>63</b>, lands (not shown in the drawing) made of a metal thin film are provided so as to electrically and mechanically connect the circuit substrates <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The electronic component <b>64</b> may be a chip-type electronic component in which a semiconductor chip that generates high heat, such as a central processing unit (CPU), a memory, or a digital signal processor, is packaged on a substrate with its active surface facing downwards on the substrate. On the lower surface of the electronic component <b>64</b> (i.e., surface opposing the circuit substrate <b>62</b>), lands (not shown in the drawing) made of a metal thin film are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described above, in the electronic circuit device <b>51</b>, the electronic component <b>64</b> that generates high heat is embedded in the electronic circuit device <b>51</b> by interposing the spacer substrates <b>63</b> between the stacked circuit substrates <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>. The through-hole <b>65</b> is formed in the circuit substrate <b>61</b>, which is the substrate opposing the active surface of the embedded electronic component <b>64</b>. The resin <b>6</b> is filled inside the through-hole <b>65</b> and between the through-hole <b>65</b> and the electronic component <b>64</b> so as to cover the upper surface <b>64</b><i>a </i>of the electronic components <b>64</b> (i.e., surface opposing the active surface). In this way, heat generated by the electronic components <b>64</b> is dissipated to the electric circuit formed on the circuit substrate <b>61</b> by copper foil through the heat-dissipation resin <b>66</b> and the through-hole <b>65</b>. The electric circuit formed on the circuit substrate <b>61</b> also functions as a ground.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Accordingly, even when the electronic component <b>64</b> that generates high heat is interposed between the stacked circuit substrates <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>, heat can be efficiently dissipated and, thus, malfunction of the electronic component <b>64</b> due to heat can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, by filling the through-holes <b>65</b> with the heat-dissipation resin <b>66</b>, the through-holes <b>65</b> are sealed and intrusion of unwanted substances, such as dust and dirt, can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the electronic circuit device <b>51</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the through-hole <b>65</b> is formed in the circuit substrate <b>61</b> substantially directly above the electronic component <b>64</b>. However, the position of the through-hole <b>65</b> is not limited and may be formed anywhere so long as the heat-dissipation resin <b>66</b> can fill the space between the through-hole <b>65</b> and the electronic component <b>64</b>. The heat-dissipation resin <b>66</b> should at least be in contact with the inner wall of the through-hole <b>65</b> and the upper surface <b>64</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>64</b>. Therefore, for example, the heat-dissipation resin <b>66</b> may fill the entire space between the circuit substrates <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">However, by forming the through-holes <b>65</b> in the circuit substrate <b>61</b> substantially directly above the electronic components <b>64</b> and filling the through-hole <b>65</b> and the space between the through-hole <b>65</b> and the electronic component <b>64</b> with the heat-dissipation resin <b>66</b> so as to cover the upper surface <b>64</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>64</b>, the heat-dissipation efficiency is increased while only a minimum amount of the heat-dissipation resin <b>66</b> is required. Accordingly, production costs can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the electronic circuit device <b>51</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the through-holes <b>65</b> is filled flush with the heat-dissipation resin <b>66</b>. However, the through-holes <b>65</b> can be filled with the heat-dissipation resin <b>66</b> such that some of the heat-dissipation resin <b>66</b> overflows from the top of the through-holes <b>65</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the spacer substrates <b>63</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>63</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>63</b>-<b>3</b> and electronic components <b>64</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>64</b>-<b>2</b>, which are connected to the electronic component <b>64</b>, are disposed on the uppermost surface <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>64</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the spacer substrate <b>63</b>-<b>4</b> and the electronic component <b>64</b>-<b>2</b> that were not viewable in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> because of being disposed behind the spacer substrate <b>63</b>-<b>1</b> and the electronic component <b>64</b> (<b>64</b>-<b>1</b>), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Often, three or four the spacer substrates <b>63</b> are disposed on the circuit substrate <b>62</b>.
