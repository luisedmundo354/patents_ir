<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates broadly to endoscopic surgical instruments. More particularly, this invention relates to an endoscopic biopsy instrument with means for facilitating sample removal without withdrawal of the biopsy instrument from an endoscope.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. State of the Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Endoscopic biopsy procedures are typically performed with an endoscope and an endoscopic biopsy forceps device (bioptome). The endoscope is a long flexible tube carrying fiber optics and having a narrow lumen through which the bioptome is inserted. The bioptome typically includes a long flexible coil having a pair of opposed jaws at the distal end and manual actuation means at the proximal end. Manipulation of the actuation means opens and closes the jaws. During a biopsy tissue sampling operation, the surgeon guides the endoscope to the biopsy site while viewing the biopsy site through the fiber optics of the endoscope. The bioptome is inserted through the narrow lumen of the endoscope until the opposed jaws arrive at the biopsy site. While viewing the biopsy site through the fiber optics of the endoscope, the surgeon positions the jaws around a tissue to be sampled and manipulates the actuation means so that the jaws close around the tissue. A sample of the tissue is then cut and/or torn away from the biopsy site while it is trapped between the jaws of the bioptome. Keeping the jaws closed, the surgeon withdraws the bioptome from the endoscope and then opens the jaws to collect the biopsy tissue sample.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A biopsy tissue sampling procedure often requires the taking of several tissue samples either from the same or from different biopsy sites. Unfortunately, most bioptomes are limited to taking a single tissue sample, after which the device must be withdrawn from the endoscope and the tissue collected before the device can be used again to take a second tissue sample. Several attempts have been made to provide an instrument which will allow the taking of several tissue samples before the instrument must be withdrawn and the samples collected. Problems in providing such an instrument include the extremely small size required by the narrow lumen of the endoscope and the fact that the instrument must be flexible in order to be inserted through the lumen of the endoscope. Thus, several known multiple sample biopsy instruments are precluded from use with an endoscope because of their size and rigidity. These include the “punch and suction type” instruments disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,989,033 to Halpern et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,206 to Whipple et al. Both of these devices have a hollow tube with a punch at the distal end and a vacuum source coupled to the proximal end. A tissue sample is cut with the punch and suctioned away from the biopsy site through the hollow tube. It is generally recognized, however, that dry suctioning tissue samples (i.e., without the use of an irrigating fluid) through a long narrow flexible bioptome is virtually impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Efforts have been made to provide multiple sampling ability to an instrument which must traverse the narrow lumen of an endoscope. These efforts have concentrated on providing a cylindrical storage space at the distal end of the instrument wherein several tissue samples can be accumulated before the instrument is withdrawn from the endoscope. U.S. Pat. No. 4,651,753 to Lifton, for example, discloses a rigid cylindrical member attached to the distal end of a first flexible tube. The cylindrical member has a lateral opening and a concentric cylindrical knife blade is slidably mounted within the cylindrical member. A second flexible tube, concentric to the first tube is coupled to the knife blade for moving the knife blade relative to the lateral opening in the cylindrical member. A third flexible tube having a plunger tip is mounted within the second flexible tube and a vacuum source (a syringe) is coupled to the proximal end of the third tube. A tissue sample is taken by bringing the lateral opening of the cylindrical member upon the biopsy site, applying vacuum with the syringe to draw tissue into the lateral opening, and pushing the second flexible tube forward to move the knife blade across the lateral opening. A tissue sample is thereby cut and trapped inside the cylindrical knife within the cylindrical member. The third flexible tube is then pushed forward moving its plunger end against the tissue sample and pushing it forward into a cylindrical storage space at the distal end of the cylindrical member. Approximately six samples can be stored in the cylindrical member, after which the instrument is withdrawn from the endoscope. A distal plug on the cylindrical member is removed and the six samples are collected by pushing the third tube so that its plunger end ejects the samples.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The device of the Lifton patent suffers from several recognizable drawbacks. First, it is often difficult to obtain a tissue sample laterally of the device. Second, in order to expedite the obtaining of a lateral sample, a syringe is used to help draw the tissue into the lateral opening. However, this causes what was once a two-step procedure (position and cut), to become a three-step procedure (position, suction, cut). In addition, the use of a syringe requires an additional hand. Third, the Lifton patent adds a fourth step to the biopsy procedure by requiring that the tissue sample be pushed into the storage space. Thus, in all, the Lifton patent requires substantial effort on the part of the surgeon and an assistant and much of this effort is involved in pushing tubes, an action which is counter-intuitive to classical biopsy sampling. The preferred mode of operation of virtually all endoscopic tools is that a gripping action at the distal end of the instrument is effected by a similar action at the proximal end of the instrument. Classical biopsy forceps jaws are closed by squeezing a manual actuation member in a syringe-like manner.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A more convenient endoscopic multiple sample biopsy device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,255 to Rydell. Rydell provides a flexible endoscopic instrument with a knife-sharp cutting cylinder at its distal end. A coaxial anvil is coupled to a pull wire and is actuated in the same manner as conventional biopsy forceps. When the anvil is drawn into the cylinder, tissue located between the anvil and the cylinder is cut and pushed into a storage space within the cylinder. Several samples may be taken and held in the storage space before the device is withdrawn from the endoscope. While the device of Rydell is effective in providing a multiple sample tool where each sample is obtained with a traditional two-step procedure (position and cut), it is still limited to lateral cutting which is often problematic. Traditional biopsy forceps provide jaws which can grasp tissue frontally or laterally. Even as such, it is difficult to position the jaws about the tissue to be sampled. Lateral sampling is even more difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A multiple sample biopsy forceps of a more traditional form is disclosed-in co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,542,432 to Slater et al. Slater et al. discloses an endoscopic multiple sample biopsy forceps having a jaw assembly which includes a pair of opposed toothed jaw cups each of which is coupled by a resilient arm to a base member. The base member of the jaw assembly is mounted inside a cylinder and axial movement of one of the jaw assembly and cylinder relative to the other draws the arms of the jaws into the cylinder or moves the cylinder over the arms of the jaws to bring the jaw cups together in a biting action. The arms of the jaws effectively form a storage chamber which extends proximally from the lower jaw cup and prevents accumulated biopsy samples from being squeezed laterally out from between the jaws during repeated opening and closing of the jaws and the lower jaw cup enhances movement of the biopsy samples into the storage chamber. The device can hold up to four samples before it must be retrieved out of the endoscope. However, in some biopsy procedures it is sometimes desirous to retrieve more. In addition, it has been found that samples within the chamber can stick together and make determinations of which sample came from which biopsy site somewhat difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,008 to Crowe discloses a multiple sample bioptome which purports to take several samples and to transfer each sample by water pressure through a duct to the proximal end of the instrument, where each sample can be individually retrieved. The device includes a plastic jaw set biased in an open position and coupled to the distal end of an elongate tube, up to seven feet long. The tube defines a duct. A sleeve extends over the tube and a water flow passage is provided between the tube and the sleeve. An aperture is provided in the tube to permit the water flow passage to meet the duct at the distal end of the tube. Withdrawing the tube into the sleeve is disclosed to force the jaws closed and enable a sample to be cut from tissue and lodge in the duct. The water flow passage is disclosed to enable water to flow under pressure from the proximal end of passage to the distal end of the passage, through the aperture and into the distal end of the duct and to be aspirated to the proximal end of the duct, thereby transferring with it any sample contained in the duct to the proximal end where the sample can be retrieved.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">While on paper the Crowe device is appealing, in practice the design is impractical and flawed. For example, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to slide the elongate tube, up to seven feet in length, relative to a sleeve of substantially the same length. It would also be difficult to maintain an unobstructed water flow passage between the tube and sleeve as the tube and sleeve curve and bend through the body. Furthermore, in order for the jaws to cut a tissue sample, the tube and jaws must be drawn into the sleeve, thereby undesirably pulling the jaws away from the tissue to be sampled.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An endoscopic biopsy instrument is provided and generally includes a proximal actuation handle, a distal forceps assembly, a control member coupled to the proximal actuation handle and the distal forceps assembly, and a flexible multi-lumen tubular member having an aspiration conduit, and a control conduit which receives the control member.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a first aspect of the invention, the proximal actuation handle includes a shaft and a spool slidably mounted on the shaft. The actuation handle is also provided with a proximal irrigation passage, a sample chamber, a sample catch member, and a pinch valve which regulates irrigation and aspiration. The proximal irrigation passage is coupled to the irrigation conduit and to an irrigation coupling tube. The sample chamber is coupled to the aspiration conduit and to an aspiration coupling tube. The sample catch member includes a screen which is inserted into the sample chamber and filters out tissue samples from the aspirated fluid. The irrigation coupling tube and the aspiration coupling tube extend through the pinch valve which operates to control the flow of fluid through the tubes. The actuation handle is coupled to the proximal ends of both the flexible tubular member and the control member and moves the control member relative to the tubular member.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The distal assembly is coupled to the distal end of the tubular member and includes a hollow stationary jaw coupled over the distal end of the aspiration conduit and a hollow movable jaw pivotably coupled adjacent the irrigation conduit. The stationary jaw, preferably formed from a hard plastic or stainless steel, has a blunt edge, while the movable jaw is preferably a metal jaw with a sharp cutting edge. The movable jaw is further coupled to the control member, such that actuation of the actuation handle moves the movable jaw relative to the stationary jaw, and thereby moves the jaw from an open position to a closed position. Moving the hollow jaw to a closed position provides a substantially fluidtight coupling between the irrigation and aspiration conduits.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It will be appreciated that the distal end of the instrument is brought into contact with tissue of which a sample is required and the actuation handle is actuated to close the jaws and cut off a tissue sample. With the jaws in a closed position, water is irrigated through the irrigation conduit to the jaws at the distal end of the instrument and aspirated from the jaws to the proximal end of the instrument through the aspiration conduit, such that the sample cut by the jaws is aspirated with the water. As the water is aspirated it passes through the chamber and the sample is filtered onto the screen. The screen may easily be removed to retrieve the sample. It will be further appreciated that the entire procedure of cutting a sample and retrieving the sample may be performed without removing the endoscopic biopsy instrument from its location within the body.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a further aspect of the invention, a biopsy instrument is provided having a proximal end and a distal end. The biopsy instrument includes a distal assembly, an elongate flexible member connected to and extending in a proximal direction from the distal assembly, and a proximal actuation handle coupled to the proximal end of the flexible member. The flexible member includes an irrigation conduit and an aspiration conduit. The proximal actuation handle includes an irrigation port in fluid connection with the proximal end of the irrigation conduit and an aspiration port in fluid connection with the proximal end of the aspiration conduit. The irrigation port is for fluid connection with a fluid source; the aspiration port is for fluid connection with a suction device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another aspect, the invention may include a control member connected to and extending from the distal assembly to the proximal actuation handle. The proximal actuation handle may include means for actuating the control member and the distal assembly. Furthermore, the distal assembly may include a stationary jaw and a movable jaw. The movable jaw is pivotable relative to the stationary jaw. The movable jaw is in fluid connection with either the irrigation conduit or the aspiration conduit; the stationary jaw is in fluid connection with the other. The distal assembly forms a fluid passageway between the irrigation conduit and the aspiration conduit when the movable jaw and the stationary jaw are in a closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a still further aspect of the present invention, the biopsy instrument includes a proximal actuation handle, and an elongate flexible member connected to and extending from the proximal actuation handle and having an irrigation conduit for fluid connection with a fluid source and for supplying a fluid to the distal end of the biopsy instrument. The biopsy instrument further includes a distal assembly for use in a surgical operation, and a means for permitting an operator to selectively increase fluid pressure in the irrigation conduit thereby causing a surge in fluid flow through the biopsy instrument. The distal assembly is attached to the distal end of the flexible member. The means for permitting an operator to selectively increase fluid pressure in the irrigation conduit may include a fluid pressure device in fluid connection with the irrigation conduit. The fluid pressure device may include a contractible fluid accumulating chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The invention may include an aspiration conduit for fluid connection with a vacuum source and for permitting the flow of fluid from the distal end to the proximal end of the biopsy instrument. The biopsy instrument may also include an actuator on the proximal actuation handle, a control conduit on the elongate flexible member, and a control member extending through the control conduit. The control member is connected to and extends from the actuator to the distal assembly. Furthermore, the distal assembly may include a stationary jaw and a movable jaw. The movable jaw is pivotable relative to the stationary jaw. The movable jaw is in fluid connection with either the irrigation conduit or the aspiration conduit; the stationary jaw is in fluid connection with the other. The distal assembly may form a fluid passageway between the irrigation conduit and the aspiration conduit when the movable jaw and the stationary jaw are in a closed position. A sample collector assembly may be provided in-line with the aspiration conduit and the vacuum source and located therebetween. An irrigation valve in fluid connection with the irrigation conduit and the fluid source may be provided. The irrigation valve is configured to start and stop a fluid flow in the irrigation conduit. A suction valve in fluid connection with the aspiration conduit and the vacuum source may also be provided. The suction valve is configured to start and stop a vacuum effect in the aspiration conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a further aspect of the invention, a method is provided for retrieving a biopsy tissue sample using the biopsy instrument having irrigation and aspiration capabilities in conjunction with a fluid pressure device. The biopsy instrument includes a proximal actuation handle, an elongate flexible member extending from the proximal actuation handle and having an irrigation conduit, a distal assembly located at the distal end of the biopsy instrument, and a fluid pressure device in fluid connection with the irrigation conduit. The method comprises the steps of: inserting the distal end of the biopsy instrument into a patient; positioning the distal assembly proximate to a tissue to be sampled; detaching the tissue sample from a surrounding tissue using the distal assembly; introducing a flow of fluid through the fluid pressure device and the irrigation conduit; actuating the fluid pressure device to cause a surge in fluid flow through the distal end of the biopsy instrument to flush the tissue sample through an aspiration conduit configured for fluid connection with a vacuum source and for permitting fluid to flow from the distal end to the proximal end of the biopsy instrument; and recovering the tissue sample.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The method may include the steps of: manipulating an actuator connected to a control member which is connected to a movable jaw of the distal assembly, whereby manipulating the actuator opens the distal assembly; moving the open distal assembly so as to encompass the tissue to be sampled; and re-manipulating the actuator to close the distal assembly and detach the tissue sample. Additionally, method may include initiating a vacuum effect in the aspiration conduit after the detaching step. Furthermore, the method may include repeating the steps of positioning, detaching, introducing, actuating, and recovering for subsequent tissue samples.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to another aspect, the invention comprises a sample collector having a catcher handle and a catcher body. The sample collector is for use with a biopsy instrument having a suction passageway with a proximal end access opening. The catcher handle has a securing end for insertion into the access opening. The securing end of the catcher handle may complement the access opening to provide a seal therewith. The catcher body has a screen, may be removably attached to the securing end of the catcher handle, and is positionable within the suction passageway upon insertion of the securing end into the access opening. The catcher body may fit a pathology processing cartridge. The sample collector may be provided with a cover. The cover is positionable between an open position displaced from the catcher body and a closed position overlaying the catcher body.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an additional aspect of the invention, a biopsy instrument with aspiration capabilities is provided having a distal assembly for use in a surgical operation, an elongate flexible member connected to and extending from the distal assembly to the proximal end, a proximal actuation handle with a suction passageway having an access opening, and a sample collector. The flexible member includes an aspiration conduit for fluid connection with a vacuum source and for permitting the passage of matter from the distal end to the proximal end. The suction passageway of the proximal actuation handle is in fluid connection with the aspiration conduit and capable of fluid connection with the vacuum source. The sample collector includes a catcher handle having a securing end for insertion into the access opening and a catcher body with a screen. The catcher body is positionable within the suction passageway upon insertion of the securing end into the access opening. Furthermore, the catcher body may be removably attached to the securing end of the catcher handle; the securing end may complement the access opening to provide a seal therewith; and the sample collector may include a cover positionable between an open position displaced from the catcher body and a closed position overlaying the catcher body. The flexible member of the biopsy instrument may include an irrigation conduit in fluid connection with a fluid source and for supplying fluid to the distal end of the biopsy instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Additionally, the objects and purpose of the invention are obtained by a method of retrieving a biopsy sample using a biopsy instrument with aspiration capabilities in conjunction with an irrigation endoscope. The biopsy instrument includes a distal assembly, an elongate flexible member with an aspiration conduit, a proximal actuation handle, a vacuum source, and a sample collector. The proximal actuation handle includes a suction passageway in fluid connection with the aspiration conduit and having an access opening. The vacuum source is in fluid connection with the suction passageway. The sample collector has a catcher handle and a catcher body with a screen. The method comprises the steps of: introducing the remote end of the endoscope into a patient; engaging the sample collector into the access opening of the proximal actuation handle; inserting the distal end of the biopsy instrument through the working channel of the endoscope until the distal assembly is proximate the tissue to be sampled; obtaining the tissue sample using the distal assembly; initiating a vacuum effect in the suction passageway and the aspiration conduit to draw the tissue sample into the catcher body; and disengaging the sample collector from the proximal actuation handle.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a further aspect of the invention, the method may include the step of establishing a temporary vacuum effect in the aspiration conduit to pull the tissue to be severed into the distal assembly. The method may also include the step of positioning a cover over the catcher body to entrap the tissue sample and of disconnecting the catcher body from the catcher handle. The method may further include the step of squirting irrigation fluid from the remote end of the irrigation endoscope. The initiated vacuum effect draws the squirted irrigation fluid and tissue sample through the aspiration conduit and suction passageway to the screen of the catcher body. Finally, the introducing, engaging, inserting, obtaining, initiating, and disengaging steps of the method may be repeated for subsequent tissue samples.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a still further aspect of the invention, the biopsy instrument includes a proximal actuation handle, an elongate flexible member, and a distal end effector assembly for use with an irrigation endoscope in a surgical operation. The elongate flexible member, connected to and extending from the proximal actuation handle, has an aspiration conduit for fluid connection with a vacuum source and for permitting the flow of fluid from the distal end to the proximal end of the biopsy instrument. The biopsy instrument may include a sample chamber, a sample catch member, and a valve which regulates the vacuum in the aspiration conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The distal end effector assembly, comprised of first and second hollow movable jaws, is coupled to the distal end of the tubular member. The first and second hollow movable jaws are pivotably coupled adjacent the aspiration conduit to the tubular member. With the jaws in a closed position, the end effector assembly provides a substantially fluidtight passageway at the distal end of the aspiration conduit. The movable jaws may be made from metal or plastic and may have sharp cutting edges, teeth for grasping, or other matching profiles. The movable jaws are further coupled to the control member, such that actuation of the actuation handle moves the movable jaws relative to the tubular member, thereby opening and closing the distal end effector assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It will be appreciated that with both jaws of the distal end effector assembly being capable of opening and closing, the biopsy instrument may be better positioned around the tissue to be sampled.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Additional objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reference to the detailed description taken in conjunction with the provided Figures.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a multiple sample biopsy instrument <b>10</b> is shown. The biopsy instrument generally includes a proximal actuation handle <b>12</b>, a flexible multi-lumen tubular member <b>14</b>, a pull wire <b>20</b>, and a distal assembly <b>22</b>. Several coupling tubes are preferably provided to couple the proximal actuation handle <b>112</b> to the tubular member <b>14</b> and to irrigation and aspiration means. In particular, a control coupling tube <b>23</b>, first and second irrigation coupling tubes <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> and first and second aspiration coupling tubes <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The proximal actuation handle <b>12</b> includes a shaft <b>30</b> having a transverse slot <b>32</b> and a spool <b>34</b> slidably mounted on the shaft <b>30</b> and having a transverse bar (not shown) extending through the slot <b>32</b>, as is common in the art. The actuation handle <b>12</b> is provided with a sample chamber <b>42</b>, a sample catch member <b>44</b>, and a pinch valve <b>45</b> which regulates irrigation and aspiration. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sample chamber <b>42</b> includes irrigation connectors <b>46</b>, <b>47</b> which couple the first irrigation coupling tube <b>24</b> to the second irrigation coupling tube <b>25</b>. The sample chamber <b>42</b> also includes first and second aspiration connectors <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> which couple the first aspiration coupling tube <b>26</b> to the second aspiration coupling tube <b>27</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the sample catch member <b>44</b> includes a handle portion <b>52</b>, an engagement portion <b>54</b> which removably engages the sample catch member <b>44</b> to the sample chamber <b>42</b>, and a screen <b>56</b>. The screen <b>56</b> extends through the sample chamber <b>42</b> between the first and second aspiration connectors <b>48</b>, <b>49</b>. The screen <b>56</b> includes a front side <b>58</b> and a back side <b>60</b> and is provided with a plurality of perforations <b>62</b> which are preferably frustoconical in shape and expand from the front side <b>58</b> to the back side <b>60</b>. The first irrigation coupling tube <b>26</b> and the first aspiration coupling tube <b>27</b> extend through the pinch valve <b>45</b> which operates to control the flow of fluid through the tubes <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>. The pinch valve is biased to clamp closed the first irrigation coupling tube <b>26</b> and the first aspiration coupling tube <b>27</b>, i.e, to collapse the tubes on top of each other. Pressing downward on the pinch valve <b>45</b> with a practitioner's finger counters the bias of the pinch valve to permit fluid flow through the first irrigation coupling tube <b>26</b> and the first aspiration coupling tube <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, and in accord with the first embodiment of the invention, the tubular member <b>14</b> is preferably an ovoid multi-lumen extrusion. The tubular member includes a proximal end <b>66</b>, a distal end <b>68</b>, a control conduit <b>70</b> an irrigation conduit <b>72</b>, and an aspiration conduit <b>74</b>, each of which extends through the tubular member to the distal assembly <b>22</b>. At the proximal end <b>66</b> of the tubular member, the control conduit <b>70</b> is coupled to the control coupling tube <b>23</b>, the irrigation conduit <b>72</b> is coupled to the second irrigation coupling tube <b>25</b> and the aspiration conduit <b>74</b> is coupled to the second aspiration coupling tube <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 9</figref>, the distal assembly <b>22</b> includes a substantially rigid molded collar <b>80</b> and a hollow movable jaw <b>90</b>. The collar <b>80</b> is preferably made from a unitary piece of polycarbonate, a glass-filled polycarbonate, a hard grade styrene, or other plastic, while the movable jaw <b>90</b> is preferably made from cast metal. The collar includes a central opening <b>81</b>, a circumferential channel <b>83</b>, a distally extending control passage <b>82</b>, a distally extending hollow jaw mount <b>84</b>, a distally extending hollow stationary jaw <b>88</b>, and a proximal socket <b>86</b>. The central opening <b>81</b> of the collar <b>80</b> is of similar diameter to the outer diameter of the endoscope and is designed to couple the collar to the outside of the distal end of an endoscope. The circumferential channel <b>81</b> receives a portion of a silicone rubber sock (not shown), which is used to secure collar <b>80</b> to the endoscope.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Stationary jaw <b>88</b> preferably includes blunt edge or lip <b>92</b>. Movable jaw <b>90</b> is pivotably mounted at pivot pin <b>94</b> on jaw mount <b>84</b> and is pivotable relative to stationary jaw <b>88</b>. The movable jaw <b>90</b> is preferably provided with a sharp cutting edge <b>98</b>, a stop <b>100</b> for limiting the extent to which the movable jaw pivots away from the stationary jaw <b>88</b>, and two jaw holes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, for receiving a pull wire <b>20</b>, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 through 11</figref>, the proximal socket <b>86</b> is aligned with the control passage <b>82</b>, the jaw mount <b>84</b> and the stationary jaw <b>88</b>, and is designed to receive the distal end <b>68</b> of the flexible tubular member <b>14</b>. The distal end <b>68</b> of the tubular member is secured in the proximal socket <b>86</b>, preferably using an adhesion bonding agent, such that the control passage <b>82</b> is coupled to the control conduit <b>70</b>, the jaw mount <b>84</b> is coupled substantially fluidtight to the irrigation conduit <b>72</b>, and the stationary jaw <b>88</b> is coupled substantially fluidtight to the aspiration conduit <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>10</b>, a central portion of the pull wire <b>20</b> extends through the jaw holes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and the ends of the pull wire <b>20</b> extend through the control passage <b>82</b>, the control conduit <b>74</b>, and the control coupling tube <b>23</b> to the spool <b>34</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, alternatively the pull wire <b>20</b><i>a </i>forms a secure loop <b>106</b><i>a </i>through the jaw holes <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>a </i>by doubling back on itself and forming a twist <b>108</b><i>a</i>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in yet another alternative, two pull wires <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>b </i>may be used, the distal end of each pull wire being coupled to a jaw hole <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>104</b><i>b </i>by a Z-bend <b>110</b><i>b</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>and extending through the control passage <b>82</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b>, it will be appreciated that movement of the spool <b>34</b> relative to the shaft <b>30</b> results in movement of the pull wire <b>20</b> relative to the tubular member <b>14</b> and consequently moves the movable jaw <b>90</b> relative to the stationary jaw <b>88</b> such that the jaws open (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and close (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 11</figref>, when the stationary and movable jaws <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> are in a closed position a substantially fluidtight passage is formed therebetween. Because the stationary jaw <b>88</b> is coupled to the aspiration conduit <b>74</b> and the movable jaw <b>90</b> is coupled over the irrigation conduit <b>72</b>, a substantially fluidtight coupling of the irrigation and aspiration conduits is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In use, it will be appreciated that the distal end of the endoscope to which the collar <b>80</b> is coupled is maneuvered adjacent the desired tissue for sampling and the distal assembly is brought into contact with tissue <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>). The actuation handle <b>12</b> is actuated to close the jaws <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> and cut off a tissue sample <b>112</b>. When the jaws <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> are in a closed position the irrigation means and the aspiration means are activated and the first proximal irrigation coupling tube and the first proximal aspiration coupling tube <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are released from the clamping action of the pinch valve <b>45</b> by depressing the pinch valve. Irrigating fluid is thereby permitted to flow through the first and second proximal irrigation coupling tubes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, through the irrigation conduit <b>72</b> and the hollow jaw mount <b>84</b>, and to the jaws <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> at the distal end of the instrument. The fluid flows through the jaws and is aspirated back to the proximal end of the instrument such that the sample held within the jaws is aspirated with the water. Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref>, as the water is aspirated through the aspiration conduit <b>74</b> and into the sample chamber <b>42</b>, the sample is filtered onto the screen <b>58</b>. The frustoconical shape of the perforations <b>62</b> permits increased fluid flow through the perforate screen while preventing the tissue sample from passing through the screen. Irrigation and aspiration means are interrupted by releasing the pinch valve <b>45</b> such that the pinch valve clamps down on the first proximal irrigation and aspiration coupling tubes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and causes the tubes to collapse on top of each other. The screen <b>58</b> may easily be removed to retrieve the sample by gripping the handle portion <b>52</b> of the sample catch member <b>44</b> and pulling the sample catch member from the sample chamber <b>42</b>. The sample is recovered from the screen, and the sample catch member is reinserted into the sample chamber to continue the procedure. It will be further appreciated that the entire procedure of cutting a sample and retrieving the sample may be performed without removing the endoscopic multiple sample biopsy forceps instrument from its location within the body. Unlimited subseguent samples may be obtained in an identical manner.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, a second embodiment of a multiple sample biopsy forceps instrument <b>210</b> is shown. The instrument includes a proximal actuation hande <b>212</b>, a flexible multi-lumen tubular member <b>214</b>, a pull wire <b>220</b>, and a distal assembly <b>222</b>. Several coupling tubes are preferable provided to couple the proximal actuation handle <b>212</b> to the tubular member <b>214</b> and to irrigation and aspiration means. In particular, a Y-shaped control coupling tube <b>223</b>, first and second irrigation coupling tubes <b>224</b>, <b>225</b>, and first and second aspiration coupling tubes <b>226</b>, <b>227</b> are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The proximal actuation handle <b>212</b> is substantially similar to the first embodiment (with like parts having numbers incremented by 200). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, the tubular member <b>214</b> is preferably a multi-lumen multi-layer extrusion, and preferably includes a first metal braid <b>276</b> beneath the outermost layer to add desired stiffness to the tubular member. If desired, a second metal braid <b>277</b> may be additionally provided around the aspiration conduit <b>274</b> to stiffen and support the aspiration conduit <b>274</b>. The tubular member <b>214</b> has a proximal end <b>266</b>, distal end <b>268</b>, two control conduits <b>270</b>, <b>271</b>, an irrigation conduit <b>272</b>, and an aspiration conduit <b>274</b>, each of the conduits <b>270</b>, <b>271</b>, <b>272</b>, <b>274</b> extending through the tubular member to the distal assembly <b>222</b>. The aspiration conduit <b>274</b> has a substantially circular cross section. The irrigation conduit <b>272</b> has a generally kidney-shaped cross section and is separated from the aspiration conduit <b>274</b> by a membrane <b>275</b>. The control conduits <b>270</b>, <b>271</b> are preferably situated one on either end of the membrane <b>275</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-20</figref>, the distal assembly <b>222</b> according to a second embodiment of the invention includes a stationary jaw <b>281</b> coupled, preferably by adhesion bonding, to the distal end <b>268</b> of the tubular member. The stationary jaw <b>281</b>, preferably made of plastic includes a jaw cup <b>288</b>, an integral central clevis <b>293</b> and integral proximal ramps <b>295</b>, <b>296</b>. The jaw cup <b>288</b> is located over the aspiration conduit <b>274</b> and preferably has a blunt cutting surface or lip <b>292</b>. The central clevis <b>293</b> and proximal ramps <b>295</b>, <b>296</b> extend from the stationary jaw <b>281</b> and abut and partially cover the irrigation conduit. A movable jaw <b>290</b>, preferably made of metal, is provided with a sharp cutting edge <b>298</b>, defines two jaw holes <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> for receiving a pull wire <b>220</b>, and is provided with two bosses <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> for mounting the jaw. The bosses <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> loosely engage the central lug <b>293</b> and a pivot pin <b>294</b> extends through the bosses and the central lug. The ramps <b>295</b>, <b>296</b> of the stationary jaw <b>281</b> guide the movable jaw <b>290</b> when opening and closing and assist to form a substantially fluidtight passage between the movable jaw <b>290</b> and the stationary jaw cup <b>288</b> when the jaws are in a closed position. A central portion of the pull wire <b>220</b> which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the instrument extends through the jaw holes <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> and the ends of the pull wire extend into the control conduits <b>270</b>, <b>271</b>. Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the Y-shaped coupling tube <b>223</b> facilitates alignment of the ends of the pull wire <b>220</b> for coupling the pull wire to the proximal actuation handle. The pull wire <b>220</b> may be coated, e.g., in a plastic, to inhibit the pull wire from cutting into the tubular member.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 20</figref>, the distal end <b>268</b> of the tubular member is inserted through the lumen of an endoscope to a biopsy site. The jaws <b>281</b>, <b>290</b> are moved into a closed position cutting off a tissue sample and further providing a substantially fluidtight coupling between the irrigation and aspiration conduits <b>272</b>, <b>274</b>. While it appears from the illustrations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 20</figref> that the irrigation conduit <b>272</b> is obstructed at the distal end by clevis <b>293</b>, it will be appreciated that the irrigation conduit <b>272</b> is substantially wider than the clevis and that fluid may flow around the clevis to the aspiration conduit <b>274</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-23</figref>, a third embodiment of a multiple sample biopsy forceps, substantially similar to the second embodiment (with like parts having numbers incremented by another 200) is shown. The tubular member <b>414</b> has a proximal end <b>466</b>, a distal end <b>468</b>, an irrigation conduit <b>472</b>, and an aspiration conduit <b>474</b>. The aspiration conduit <b>474</b> has a substantially circular cross section, while the irrigation conduit <b>472</b> has a generally crescent-shaped cross section. A control coupling tube <b>423</b> is coupled to the second irrigation coupling tube <b>425</b>.

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">There have been described and illustrated herein several embodiments of a multiple sample endoscopic biopsy instrument. While particular embodiments of the invention have been described, it is not intended that the invention be limited thereto, as it is intended that the invention be as broad in scope as the art will allow and that the specification be read likewise. Therefore, while a particular manner of coupling the proximal actuation handle to the distal assembly has been disclosed for the several embodiments, it will be appreciated that other manners of coupling the proximal and distal assemblies may be used as well. Furthermore while the stationary jaw is disclosed as preferably being made of plastic and the movable jaw is disclosed as being made of metal it will be appreciated both the stationary jaw and the movable jaw may be made from plastic, metal, or another material. Moreover, while the movable jaw is disclosed as preferably being made from cast metal, it will be appreciated that the movable jaw, when made of metal, may alternatively be made by machining or M.I.M. Further, while both jaws are shown without teeth, one or both of the jaws may include teeth along their mating surface. In fact, the teeth may be arranged radially as disclosed in co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,296. Also, while one or two pull wires are disclosed with respect to certain embodiments, it will be appreciated that in each embodiment either one or two pull wires may be used, in manners described herein. Furthermore, while the stationary jaw is disclosed as being coupled to the aspiration conduit and the movable jaw is disclosed as being coupled to the irrigation conduit, it will be appreciated that the stationary jaw may be coupled to the irrigation conduit and the movable jaw may be coupled to the aspiration conduit. Moreover, it will be appreciated that both the jaws may be movable about the distal end of the tubular member. In addition, while particular configurations have been disclosed in reference to coupling the proximal actuation handle to the tubular member, it will be appreciated that other configurations can be used as well. It will therefore be appreciated by those skilled in the art that yet other modifications could be made to the provided invention without deviating from its spirit and scope as so claimed.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In accordance with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the biopsy instrument includes a proximal actuation handle <b>612</b> located at proximal end <b>11</b> of biopsy instrument <b>610</b> and coupled to proximal end <b>615</b> of flexible member <b>614</b>. Proximal actuation handle <b>612</b> has a front end <b>77</b> and a back end <b>79</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The proximal actuation handle <b>612</b> includes an elongate shaft, a thumb ring, an actuation spool, and a front end nose portion. As embodied herein and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref>, proximal actuation handle <b>612</b> includes shaft <b>30</b>, thumb ring <b>31</b>, actuation spool <b>34</b>, body portion <b>35</b>, and nose portion <b>37</b>. Shaft <b>30</b> has a transverse through slot <b>32</b> extending most of the longitudinal length of shaft <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Thumb ring <b>31</b> is affixed to back end <b>79</b> of shaft <b>30</b>. Ring <b>31</b> enables a surgeon to better grip and control biopsy instrument <b>610</b>.

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Actuation spool <b>34</b> slidably mounts on shaft <b>30</b>. Actuation spool <b>34</b> includes a central hole through which shaft <b>30</b> extends. This permits spool <b>34</b> to slide back and forth along the length of shaft <b>30</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, actuation spool <b>34</b> may be assembled from two hermaphroditic spool halves <b>130</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, each spool half <b>130</b> has guide posts <b>132</b> for mating with holes <b>133</b>, and tangs <b>134</b> for mating with slots <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Pull wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b </i>extend from movable jaw <b>590</b> of distal assembly <b>522</b> through control conduits <b>570</b><i>a</i>, <b>570</b><i>b </i>of flexible member <b>614</b>, through nose member <b>37</b> and body portion <b>35</b> of proximal actuation handle <b>612</b>, and longitudinally within slot <b>32</b> to actuation spool <b>34</b>. In a preferred configuration and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-31</figref><i>b</i>, pull wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b </i>are coupled to actuation spool <b>34</b> via swash plate <b>38</b> and swash plate axle <b>36</b>. Swash plate <b>38</b> freely pivots about axle <b>36</b> to accommodate uneven loading of pull wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b </i>caused by bending of flexible member <b>612</b> that occurs as the biopsy instrument is positioned at the surgical site. The proximal ends of pull wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b </i>are inserted through hypotubes <b>39</b><i>a</i>, <b>39</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Hypotubes <b>39</b><i>a</i>, <b>39</b><i>b </i>are provided to prevent pull wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b </i>from buckling or kinking along their unsupported length within slot <b>32</b> when actuation spool <b>34</b> is moved in a distal direction. Typically, hypotubes <b>39</b><i>a</i>, <b>39</b><i>b </i>are formed from tubing similar to that used to manufacture hypodermic needles, but any tubing with sufficient anti-buckling capabilities may be used. The proximal ends of hypotubes <b>39</b><i>a</i>, <b>39</b><i>b</i>, with pull wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b </i>inside, are inserted through holes <b>138</b><i>a</i>, <b>138</b><i>b </i>in swash plate <b>38</b> and bent substantially flat against swash plate <b>38</b>. Pull wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b </i>are thereby securely retained within hypotubes <b>39</b><i>a</i>, <b>39</b><i>b </i>and hypotubes <b>39</b><i>a</i>, <b>39</b><i>b </i>are securely retained to swash plate <b>38</b> without the necessity of additional parts. Holes <b>138</b><i>a</i>, <b>138</b><i>b </i>are diametrically opposed. Each spool half <b>130</b> has a seat <b>136</b> for swash plate axle <b>36</b>, whereby swash plate <b>38</b> is capable of rotating around axle <b>36</b> relative to actuation spool <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Alternatively, actuation spool <b>34</b> may be provided with a transverse bar (not shown) and pull wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b </i>may be connected to this bar. The bar extends transversely through slot <b>32</b> and is coupled to the wall of the central hole of actuation spool <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">It is to be understood that actuation devices, other than a spool on a shaft, that are known to one skilled in the art may be used in connection with biopsy instruments of the present invention and any of the embodiments described herein. For example, as alternatives, the actuator may be embodied as a three-ring shaft/cylinder combination, a pistol grip handle/lever, or any other structure which permits a surgeon to move pull wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">It will be appreciated that movement of actuation spool <b>34</b> relative to shaft <b>30</b> results in movement of pull wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b </i>relative to flexible member <b>614</b> and consequently moves movable jaw <b>590</b> relative to stationary jaw <b>588</b> such that the jaws open (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>) and close (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, when movable and stationary jaws <b>590</b>, <b>588</b> are in a closed position, a substantially fluidtight passageway is formed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Movable jaw <b>590</b> is coupled over irrigation conduits <b>572</b><i>a</i>, <b>572</b><i>b </i>via jaw mount <b>584</b> and irrigation conduit mounting stubs <b>605</b><i>a</i>, <b>605</b><i>b</i>. Stationary jaw <b>588</b> is coupled to aspiration conduit <b>574</b> via jaw mount <b>584</b> and aspiration conduit mounting stub <b>604</b>. Thus, when movable and stationary jaws <b>590</b>, <b>588</b> are in a closed position, wherein a substantially fluidtight passageway is formed therebetween, a substantially fluidtight coupling of irrigation conduits <b>572</b><i>a</i>, <b>572</b><i>b </i>to aspiration conduit <b>574</b> is achieved. Irrigation fluid flowing in a distal direction through irrigation conduits <b>572</b><i>a</i>, <b>572</b><i>b </i>may enter and flow through the passageway formed when movable and stationary jaws <b>590</b>, <b>588</b> are in a closed position. This irrigation fluid may then exit from this passageway and flow in a proximal direction through aspiration conduit <b>574</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In accordance with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the proximal actuation handle <b>612</b> includes a nose portion coupled to the proximal end of the elongate flexible member.

Proximal end <b>615</b> of flexible member <b>614</b> is secured to nose portion <b>37</b> of proximal actuation handle <b>612</b> by any suitable means of connection. For example, an adhesive bonding agent could be used to secure flexible member <b>614</b> to nose portion <b>37</b>. A molded strain relief <b>137</b> could be used to avoid overstraining flexible member <b>614</b> and pull wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b </i>at the attachment of flexible member <b>614</b> to nose portion <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">An irrigation passageway <b>620</b> and an aspiration passageway <b>622</b> extend through body portion <b>35</b> and nose portion <b>37</b>.

Irrigation port <b>624</b> is in fluid connection with irrigation passageway <b>620</b>. In a preferred embodiment, irrigation port <b>624</b> is provided with a Luer lock fitting. The disclosed configuration allows a surgeon to quickly and easily connect and disconnect various fluid sources (not shown) to provide fluid to distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Similarly, proximal actuation handle <b>612</b> includes an aspiration port to provide means for flow-connecting a vacuum source to the biopsy instrument.

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In an alternative configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, irrigation passageway <b>620</b> could extend from the front end of nose portion <b>37</b> to irrigation port <b>624</b> located on a first side of body portion <b>35</b>. Similarly, aspiration passageway <b>622</b> could extend from the front end of nose portion <b>37</b> to aspiration port <b>626</b> located on a second side of body portion <b>35</b>.

However, it should be understood that other standard and non-standard fluid connection fittings may also be used without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The fluid source typically contains an irrigation fluid, such as saline solution. A pump (not shown) may be in fluid connection with irrigation port <b>624</b> to provide a constant and/or intermittent flow of irrigation fluid from a fluid source to distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>610</b>. Alternatively, a fluid filled syringe (not shown) may be directly or indirectly in fluid connection with irrigation port <b>624</b>, wherein depressing the plunger of the syringe causes fluid to flow to distal end <b>13</b> via irrigation conduit <b>572</b>. In another alternative, a fluid source may be suspended at an elevation above the patient being operated upon and in fluid connection with irrigation port <b>624</b> via a fluid source conduit (not shown) so that gravity causes fluid to flow to distal end <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The vacuum source may include a sample collector in fluid connection with a vacuum pump or other suction retrieval devices. Alternatively, the vacuum source may include a waste collection device in fluid connection with a vacuum pump.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Operation of the embodiment of a biopsy instrument shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-29</figref> will now be described. When a surgeon desires to take a tissue sample from within a patient's body without invasive surgery, the surgeon inserts distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>610</b> into an orifice of a patient under treatment. While retaining control of proximal actuation handle <b>612</b> at proximal end <b>11</b>, the surgeon guides distal assembly <b>522</b> through the patient's body to a position adjacent a tissue to be sampled. In a preferred embodiment, the surgeon uses endoscopic technology to ensure proper positioning of distal assembly <b>522</b>. The surgeon inserts distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>610</b> into an endoscope already inserted and properly located within a patient's body. Distal assembly <b>522</b> is threaded through the endoscope until the surgical site is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The tissue to be sampled is then sited within opened movable jaw <b>590</b>. In order to facilitate siting the tissue within the open distal assembly, the surgeon may actuate the vacuum effect, thereby drawing the tissue into the area between the jaws. Once jaw <b>590</b> is properly positioned, the surgeon slides spool <b>34</b> along shaft <b>30</b> in the proximal direction. This, in turn, axially displaces pull wires <b>520</b><i>a</i>, <b>520</b><i>b </i>in the proximal direction causing movable jaw <b>590</b> to pivot about pivot pin <b>594</b>. Distal assembly <b>522</b> is thereby closed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, and the tissue sample is separated from the surrounding tissue when sharp cutting edge <b>598</b> of movable jaw <b>590</b> comes into contact with blunt edge <b>592</b> of stationary jaw <b>588</b>. The severed tissue sample is enclosed within the fluid passageway formed by cup-like body <b>595</b> of movable jaw <b>590</b> and concave cavity <b>601</b> of stationary jaw <b>588</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The surgeon then proceeds to initiate flow from a fluid source through irrigation port <b>624</b>, irrigation passageway <b>620</b>, and irrigation conduit <b>572</b>. Fluid flows to distal end <b>617</b> of irrigation conduit <b>572</b> to flush the surgical region. The surgeon also initiates a vacuum effect in aspiration port <b>626</b>, aspiration passageway <b>622</b>, and aspiration conduit <b>574</b>. This causes fluid flowing through distal end <b>617</b> of irrigation conduit <b>572</b> to return through aspiration conduit <b>574</b>. The severed tissue sample will be swept into the flow, and will travel through aspiration conduit <b>574</b> from distal end <b>617</b> to proximal end <b>615</b> under the combined action of the fluid flow and the vacuum effect. Upon exiting aspiration port <b>626</b>, the severed tissue sample may be collected by a sample collector (not shown) or simply disposed of in a waste collection device (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As a first alternative method of retrieving a severed tissue sample, the vacuum effect need not be initiated by the surgeon. Without the vacuum effect, the severed tissue sample may be flushed through aspiration conduit <b>574</b> under the action of the fluid flow alone. As a second alternative, no fluid need be supplied to distal end <b>617</b>. Without irrigation fluid, the severed tissue sample is aspirated through aspiration conduit <b>574</b> under the action of the vacuum effect alone. A third alternative method of retrieving a tissue sample includes using irrigation fluid supplied by the endoscope, or other fluid available at the surgical site, to aid in the retrieval of the tissue sample through aspiration conduit <b>574</b> under the action of the vacuum effect.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">After retrieval of a tissue sample, the surgeon may then reposition distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>610</b> proximate to the next tissue sample to be collected, and proceed to obtain and recover a this other tissue sample by repeating the above process. In this manner, the surgeon may recover multiple tissue samples without the necessity of removing distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>610</b> from the body of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">A further embodiment of a biopsy instrument according to the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. This embodiment generally relates to a biopsy instrument having irrigation and aspiration capabilities and including fluid pressure increasing capabilities. The fluid pressure increasing capabilities discussed below and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-37</figref> may be incorporated into any of the several embodiments of a biopsy instrument having irrigation capabilities described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">A biopsy instrument according to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> generally relates to a method and apparatus for increasing the pressure of fluid flowing through a biopsy instrument. The inventive method and apparatus are shown in connection with an endoscopic biopsy forceps device that retrieves multiple tissue samples from a patient without withdrawal of the device from the patient. The biopsy forceps device provides irrigation at the distal end and aspiration of the samples to the proximal end through fluid pressure and suction. The present embodiment provides a method and apparatus to increase fluid pressure to more effectively retrieve the tissue samples.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">A surgical biopsy instrument according to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> generally includes a proximal actuation handle, a distal assembly, and an elongate flexible member connecting the proximal actuation handle to the distal assembly. A fluid pressure device is in fluid connection with the flexible member to selectively increase the pressure of fluid being supplied to the distal end. These general portions of the biopsy instrument will now be more specifically described. The operation of the biopsy instrument will be described thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a biopsy instrument having a proximal end and a distal end. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, biopsy instrument <b>10</b> includes proximal end <b>11</b> and distal end <b>13</b>. As with previous embodiments, during a surgical procedure, proximal end <b>11</b> remains external to a patient's body and under the direct physical control of the surgeon. Distal end <b>13</b> is inserted into a passageway or cavity of the patient's body and is positioned proximate to the remote internal operation site. In the preferred embodiment, distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>10</b> is inserted into and threaded through an endoscope (not shown) which has previously been inserted in the patient's body and positioned proximate to the operation site.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In accordance with the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, the biopsy instrument includes proximal actuation handle <b>12</b> located at proximal end <b>11</b> of biopsy instrument <b>10</b>. Proximal actuation handle <b>12</b> includes an elongate shaft <b>30</b> having a manipulation thumb ring <b>31</b> fixed to the end thereof. Manipulation thumb ring <b>31</b> enables a surgeon to better grip and control biopsy instrument <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Proximal actuation handle <b>12</b> also includes a manipulable actuator spool <b>34</b> connected to a distal assembly <b>22</b> via a pull wire <b>20</b>. Distal assembly <b>22</b> and its operation will be described further herein. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, actuator spool <b>34</b> includes a hole through which shaft <b>30</b> extends. This permits spool <b>34</b> to slide back and forth along the length of shaft <b>30</b> to manipulate distal assembly <b>22</b>. Shaft <b>30</b> includes an axial control slot <b>32</b> through which pull wire <b>20</b> extends. As with other embodiments described, it is to be understood that various other suitable actuation devices known to one skilled in the art may be used in connection with the present invention. For example, as alternatives, the actuation device may be embodied as a three-ring cylinder/shaft device, a pistol grip handle/lever or any other structure which permits a surgeon to move the pull wire.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The biopsy instrument according to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> includes an elongate flexible member connected to and extending from the proximal actuation handle. The flexible member includes an irrigation conduit for fluid connection with a fluid source for supplying a fluid to the distal end of the biopsy instrument. As embodied herein and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, elongate flexible member <b>14</b> is connected to and extends from an end of proximal actuation handle <b>12</b> opposite manipulation thumb ring <b>31</b>. Flexible member <b>14</b> includes irrigation conduit <b>72</b> for fluid connection with fluid source <b>632</b> to distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>10</b>. A fluid source conduit <b>631</b> flow-connects fluid source <b>632</b> to the proximal end of irrigation conduit <b>72</b>. Fluid source <b>632</b> typically consists of an irrigation fluid, such as saline solution. In a preferred embodiment, fluid source <b>632</b> and fluid source conduit <b>631</b> are also in fluid connection with the endoscope (not shown) through which biopsy instrument <b>10</b> is threaded. In this preferred embodiment, tee-connector <b>633</b> is provided in fluid source conduit <b>631</b> for flow-connecting fluid source <b>632</b> to both biopsy instrument <b>10</b> and the endoscope. Thus, a single fluid source <b>632</b> may provide irrigation fluid to the distal end of the endoscope to remove debris (blood, tissue, etc.) from the lens of the endoscope and to distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">A pump <b>634</b> may be provided in fluid source conduit <b>631</b> to provide a constant and/or intermittent flow of irrigation fluid from source <b>632</b> to distal end <b>13</b>. Alternatively, fluid source <b>632</b> may be pressurized, or fluid may flow through fluid source conduit <b>631</b> via gravity, by suspending fluid source <b>632</b> at an elevation above the patient being operated upon.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, fluid flow through irrigation conduit <b>72</b> is controlled by a valve <b>644</b> located on fluid source conduit <b>631</b> adjacent to proximal actuation handle <b>12</b>. Preferably, valve <b>644</b> is a spring-biased pinch valve, such as the one previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Flexible member <b>14</b> also includes a control conduit <b>70</b>. Control conduit <b>70</b> is connected to and extends from the end of proximal actuation handle <b>12</b> opposite manipulation thumb ring <b>31</b>. Conduit <b>70</b> provides a channel through which pull wire <b>20</b> extends.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Flexible member <b>14</b> further includes an aspiration conduit <b>74</b>. As described above and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, aspiration conduit <b>74</b> cooperates with and is in fluid communication with irrigation conduit <b>72</b> at distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>10</b>. Thus, fluid flowing distally through irrigation conduit <b>72</b> may return to the proximal end through aspiration conduit <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In a preferred embodiment, aspiration conduit <b>74</b> is in fluid connection, via a fluid vacuum conduit <b>639</b>, with a vacuum <b>11</b> reservoir <b>640</b> towards the proximal end of aspiration conduit <b>74</b>. Vacuum reservoir <b>640</b>, under vacuum pressure, facilitates the flow of fluid or other matter through aspiration conduit <b>74</b> from distal end <b>13</b> towards proximal end <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, biopsy instrument <b>10</b> also includes a sample chamber <b>42</b> and a sample catch member <b>44</b> in-line with aspiration conduit <b>74</b>. Preferably, sample chamber <b>42</b> and sample catch member <b>44</b> are connected or provided proximate to proximal actuation handle <b>12</b> for ease of access. Sample chamber <b>42</b> acts as a filter to trap material flowing through aspiration conduit <b>74</b>. Material, such as biopsy samples, trapped by sample chamber <b>42</b> assembly may then be retrieved by the surgeon.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, an aspiration valve <b>648</b> may be provided on fluid vacuum conduit <b>639</b>, adjacent proximal actuation handle <b>12</b>, to permit a surgeon to start and stop a vacuum effect in aspiration conduit <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The biopsy instrument according to the present invention further includes a distal assembly for use in a surgical operation. The distal assembly is located on the distal end of the flexible member opposite the proximal actuation handle. The distal end assembly used in connection with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref> may be of any of the types described herein. For example, as in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, distal assembly <b>22</b> includes movable jaw <b>90</b> located at distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>10</b>, on the end portion of flexible member <b>14</b> opposite proximal actuation handle <b>12</b>. Movable jaw <b>90</b> includes a cup-like body <b>95</b> and a sharp cutting edge <b>98</b>. Jaw <b>90</b> pivots about pivot pin <b>94</b> to urge cutting edge <b>98</b> against a stationary jaw <b>88</b> opposing movable jaw <b>90</b>. Stationary jaw <b>88</b> includes a concave cavity <b>101</b> and a blunt edge <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Movable jaw <b>90</b> is connected to a distal end of pull wire <b>20</b> opposite to the proximal end connected to actuator spool <b>34</b>. As has been described, this configuration allows a surgeon to cut a biopsy sample by manipulating actuator spool <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Again, it should be understood that while the previously described manipulable distal assembly <b>22</b> may be used with a preferred embodiment of the invention, other manipulable and non-manipulable end effectors may also be used without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For example, alternative end effector assemblies include dual actuating jaws, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The biopsy instrument according to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> further includes means for permitting a surgeon to selectively increase fluid pressure in the irrigation conduit, thereby causing a surge in fluid flow through the distal end of the biopsy instrument. As embodied herein, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, means for permitting a surgeon to selectively increase fluid pressure in irrigation conduit <b>72</b> may include a fluid pressure device located in-line with the irrigation conduit <b>72</b>. Activation of the fluid pressure device permits the surgeon to selectively increase fluid pressure in irrigation conduit <b>72</b>, thereby causing a surge in fluid flow through distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, fluid source <b>632</b> provides irrigation fluid to both biopsy instrument <b>10</b> and the endoscope. Alternatively, the endoscope power unit (not shown), which supplies water, light and air to the endoscope, also supplies water as the irrigation fluid to biopsy instrument <b>10</b>. It is expected that typical irrigation fluid pressures at proximal end <b>11</b> of biopsy instrument <b>10</b> range from 3-5 psia, and that activation of the fluid pressure device may increase the irrigation fluid pressure to 20 psia.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35-37</figref>, the fluid pressure device may include a contractible fluid accumulating chamber, which can be selectively contracted to cause a pressure surge through irrigation conduit. In a first embodiment of a fluid pressure device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-35</figref>, a flexible bellows <b>674</b> defines a fluid accumulating chamber therein. A pleated collapsible wall member <b>676</b> imparts the contractibility attribute to bellows <b>674</b>. Collapsible wall member <b>676</b> could be made of metal, plastic, or other suitable waterproof material. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, the flexible bellows <b>674</b> further includes a fluid inlet port <b>678</b> and a fluid outlet port <b>680</b>. Fluid inlet port <b>678</b> is in fluid connection with fluid source <b>632</b>, thereby permitting the accumulating chamber to fill with fluid. Fluid outlet port <b>680</b> is in fluid connection with the accumulating chamber and with irrigation conduit <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">A suitable valve is provided proximate inlet port <b>678</b> to permit fluid to flow into the fluid accumulating chamber from fluid source <b>632</b> and prohibit fluid from returning thereto. The flexible bellows <b>674</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> includes a check valve <b>682</b><i>a</i>, including a spring <b>684</b><i>a</i>, a spring-biased ball <b>686</b><i>a</i>, and a valve seat <b>688</b><i>a</i>. Check valve <b>682</b><i>a </i>is upstream of inlet port <b>678</b>. In a closed position, spring <b>684</b><i>a </i>urges ball <b>686</b><i>a </i>against seat <b>688</b><i>a</i>. Fluid flowing into fluid inlet port <b>678</b> from fluid source <b>632</b> forces spring-biased ball <b>686</b><i>a </i>against spring <b>684</b><i>a</i>. This force compresses spring <b>684</b><i>a </i>until ball <b>686</b><i>a </i>is no longer held against valve seat <b>688</b><i>a</i>, permitting fluid to flow past ball <b>686</b><i>a </i>and into the contractible fluid accumulating chamber. Fluid that would tend to flow out of fluid inlet port <b>678</b> towards fluid source <b>632</b> pushes spring-biased ball <b>686</b><i>a </i>against valve seat <b>688</b><i>a </i>to thereby block the flow. Check valve <b>682</b><i>a </i>therefore permits fluid from fluid source <b>632</b> to flow into the fluid accumulating chamber, while concurrently prohibiting fluid from flowing out of the fluid accumulating chamber back towards fluid source <b>632</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Similarly, a suitable valve is provided proximate outlet port <b>680</b> to prevent fluid from flowing out of the fluid accumulating chamber until a given fluid pressure is obtained and to prevent fluid from flowing back into the fluid accumulating chamber. The flexible bellows <b>674</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> includes a check valve <b>682</b><i>b</i>, including a spring <b>684</b><i>b</i>, a spring-biased ball <b>686</b><i>b</i>, and a valve seat <b>688</b><i>b</i>. Check valve <b>682</b><i>b </i>is downstream of inlet port <b>678</b>. In a closed position, spring <b>684</b><i>b </i>urges ball <b>686</b><i>b </i>against seat <b>688</b><i>b</i>. Pressurized fluid flowing out of fluid outlet port <b>680</b> opens valve <b>682</b><i>b </i>by forcing spring-biased ball <b>686</b><i>b </i>against spring <b>684</b><i>b</i>. Operation of the flexible bellows <b>674</b> during an endoscopic procedure will be described further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Alternative structures of the fluid pressure device, and more particularly the contractible fluid accumulating chamber, are within the scope of this invention. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, the contractible fluid accumulating chamber of fluid pressure device may include a piston-and-cylinder device <b>690</b> including cylinder <b>694</b> and piston <b>692</b> slidably located within cylinder <b>694</b>. This structure is similar in many respects to the bellows structure previously described. Piston-and-cylinder device <b>690</b> includes fluid inlet port <b>678</b>, fluid outlet port <b>680</b>, and check valves <b>682</b><i>a</i>, <b>682</b><i>b</i>. In the piston-and-cylinder device, fluid accumulates in cylinder <b>694</b>. Depression of piston <b>692</b> causes a pressure surge through irrigation conduit <b>72</b>. It is preferable to locate the piston-and-cylinder device on or adjacent proximal actuation handle <b>12</b> for ease of use by the surgeon.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As a further alternative of the fluid pressure device, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, the contractible fluid accumulating chamber may include a flexible membrane <b>696</b>. Flexible membrane <b>696</b> is preferably made of rubber, polymers, or any other suitably flexible material known in the art. Flexible membrane <b>696</b> defines a fluid accumulating chamber therein. Like the bellows and piston structures previously described, the membrane structure includes fluid inlet port <b>678</b>, fluid outlet port <b>680</b>, and check valves <b>682</b><i>a</i>, <b>682</b><i>b</i>. Preferably, flexible membrane <b>696</b> is formed as a squeeze ball. Deforming the squeeze ball from its undeformed configuration imparts the contractibility attribute to flexible membrane <b>696</b>, causing a pressure surge through irrigation conduit <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that means for selectively increasing the fluid pressure in irrigation conduit <b>72</b> could encompass purely mechanical pressurization devices and also electro-mechanical pressurization devices. It will also be apparent to those skilled in the art that the fluid pressure devices can be situated in various other positions relative to the surgeon. For example, the fluid pressure device may be positioned on the floor proximate the surgeon's foot for foot activation. Foot activation of the fluid pressure device keeps the surgeon's hand free for other activities.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Operation of the invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b>, <b>33</b> and <b>35</b>. As in previously described embodiments, when a surgeon desires to take a tissue sample from within a patient's body without invasive surgery, the surgeon inserts distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>10</b> into an orifice of a patient under treatment. While retaining control of proximal actuation handle <b>12</b> at proximal end <b>11</b>, the surgeon guides distal assembly <b>22</b> through the patient's body to a position adjacent a tissue to be sampled. In a preferred embodiment, the surgeon uses endoscopic technology to ensure proper positioning of the distal assembly <b>22</b>. The surgeon inserts distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>10</b> into an endoscope already inserted and properly located within a patient's body. Distal assembly <b>22</b> is threaded through the endoscope until the surgical site is reached. The tissue to be sampled is then sited within opened jaw <b>90</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Once jaw <b>90</b> is properly positioned, the surgeon slides spool <b>34</b> along shaft <b>30</b> in the proximal direction. This, in turn, axially displaces pull wire <b>20</b> in the proximal direction causing movable jaw <b>90</b> to pivot about pivot pin <b>94</b>. Distal assembly <b>22</b> is thereby closed, and tissue sample <b>112</b> is separated from the surrounding tissue when sharp cutting edge <b>98</b> of movable jaw <b>90</b> comes into contact with blunt edge <b>92</b> of stationary jaw <b>88</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, severed tissue sample <b>112</b> is enclosed within the fluid passageway formed by cup-like body <b>95</b> of movable jaw <b>90</b> and concave cavity <b>101</b> of stationary jaw <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The surgeon then proceeds to initiate flow from fluid source <b>632</b> through the fluid pressure device and through irrigation conduit <b>72</b> by depressing irrigation valve <b>644</b>. In response, fluid flows into the fluid pressure device and fills the contractible fluid accumulating chamber. Once filled, fluid flows to distal end <b>13</b> of irrigation conduit <b>72</b> to flush the surgical region under relatively low pressure. At the same time, or slightly later, the surgeon may initiate a vacuum effect in aspiration conduit <b>74</b> by depressing aspiration valve <b>648</b>. This causes fluid flowing through distal end <b>13</b> of irrigation conduit <b>72</b> to return through aspiration conduit <b>74</b>. Tissue sample <b>112</b> will be swept in the flow, and will begin traveling through aspiration conduit <b>74</b> from distal end <b>13</b> to proximal end <b>11</b> under the combined action of the fluid flow and the vacuum effect. As an alternative, the vacuum effect need not be initiated by the surgeon. Without the vacuum effect, tissue sample <b>112</b> may be flushed through aspiration conduit <b>74</b> under the action of the fluid flow alone.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">However, on occasion, tissue sample <b>112</b> may become lodged in either distal assembly <b>22</b> or in aspiration conduit <b>74</b>. When this happens, the surgeon may then actuate the fluid pressure device by compressing the fluid accumulating chamber. Compressing the accumulating chamber pressurizes the fluid flowing into irrigation conduit <b>72</b>, causing a surge in fluid flow through distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>10</b>. This surge in fluid flow augments the existing flow in the biopsy instrument, thus enabling the surgeon to more effectively and reliably retrieve tissue sample <b>112</b> through aspiration conduit <b>74</b> to sample chamber <b>642</b>. If necessary, the surgeon may actuate the fluid pressure device multiple times to aid in the retrieval of tissue sample <b>112</b>. Similarly, the surgeon may vary the pressure of the fluid flow surge, either by actuating the fluid pressure device slowly for a mild surge or actuating the fluid pressure device quickly for a sharp surge in the fluid flow. The surgeon then recovers tissue sample <b>112</b> from sample chamber <b>642</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The surgeon may then reposition distal end <b>13</b> proximate to the next tissue sample <b>112</b> to be collected, and proceed to obtain and recover a second tissue sample <b>112</b> by repeating the above process. In this manner, the surgeon may recover multiple tissue samples without the necessity of removing distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>10</b> from the body of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">A still further embodiment of a biopsy instrument according to the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. This embodiment generally relates to a method and an apparatus to minimize the manual handling and consequential degradation of biopsy tissue samples through the use of a biopsy instrument having irrigation and aspiration capabilities and including a removable, modular sample collector. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> may be incorporated into any of the several embodiments of a biopsy instrument having irrigation and aspiration capabilities described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">A biopsy instrument according to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> generally includes a distal assembly, a proximal actuation handle, and an elongate flexible member connecting the distal assembly to the proximal actuation handle.

The suction passageway, located within the proximal actuation handle, has an access opening for receiving a sample collector and is in fluid connection with a vacuum source. The sample collector is inserted into the suction passageway to stop and retain aspirated biopsy samples. These general portions of the biopsy instrument will now be more specifically described. The operation of the biopsy instrument will be described thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In accordance with the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, there is provided a biopsy instrument <b>710</b> having a proximal end <b>11</b> and a distal end <b>13</b>. As in previously described embodiments, during a surgical procedure, proximal end <b>11</b> remains external to a patient's body and under the direct physical control of the surgeon. Distal end <b>13</b> is inserted into a passageway or cavity of the patient's body and is positioned proximate to the remote internal operation site. In the preferred embodiment, distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>710</b> is inserted into and threaded through an irrigation endoscope (not shown) which has previously been inserted into the patient's body and positioned proximate to the operation site.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The biopsy instrument according to the present embodiment includes a distal assembly for use in a surgical operation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, distal assembly <b>22</b> is located on the distal end of flexible member <b>14</b> opposite proximal actuation handle <b>712</b>. Embodiments of distal assembly <b>22</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref> have been described above. Distal assembly <b>22</b> includes a movable jaw <b>90</b> and an opposing stationary jaw <b>88</b>. Movable jaw <b>90</b> includes a cup-like body <b>95</b> and a sharp cutting edge <b>98</b>. Movable jaw <b>90</b> pivots about pivot pin <b>94</b> to urge cutting edge <b>98</b> against the stationary jaw <b>88</b>. Stationary jaw <b>88</b> includes a concave cavity <b>101</b> and a blunt edge <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Movable jaw <b>90</b> is connected to a distal end of pull wire <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, the proximal end of pull wire <b>20</b> is connected to actuator spool <b>34</b>. Actuation of actuator spool <b>34</b> moves movable jaw <b>90</b> relative to stationary jaw <b>88</b>, and thereby moves the jaws from an open position to a closed position. Actuation spool <b>34</b> and the attachment of pull wire <b>20</b> to actuation spool <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, has been described above. This configuration allows a surgeon to cut a biopsy sample by manipulating actuator spool <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The biopsy instrument according to the present embodiment also includes an elongate flexible member connected to and extending from the distal assembly. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, elongate flexible member <b>14</b> is connected to distal assembly <b>22</b> and extends in a proximal direction to proximal actuation handle <b>712</b>. Proximal actuation handle <b>712</b> will be described later in greater detail.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In accordance with the present embodiment, the elongate flexible member includes an aspiration conduit. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, flexible member <b>14</b> includes an aspiration conduit <b>74</b> extending from distal end <b>13</b> toward proximal end <b>11</b>. Aspiration conduit <b>74</b> provides a conduit for fluid, tissue samples, and/or other matter to pass from distal end <b>13</b> to proximal end <b>11</b>. As embodied herein, and as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, at distal end <b>13</b> aspiration conduit <b>74</b> is coupled to stationary jaw <b>88</b> of distal assembly <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">As also embodied herein and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, elongate flexible member <b>14</b> may further include an irrigation conduit <b>72</b> for fluid connection with a fluid source <b>632</b> for supplying a fluid to distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>710</b>. Flexible member <b>14</b> includes irrigation conduit <b>72</b> for flow-connecting fluid source <b>632</b> to distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>710</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, at distal end <b>13</b>, irrigation conduit <b>72</b> is coupled to and in fluid connection with movable jaw <b>90</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, irrigation conduit <b>72</b> is coupled to a Luer lock <b>642</b> for flow-connecting irrigation conduit <b>72</b> to fluid source <b>632</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Furthermore, as embodied herein, aspiration conduit <b>74</b> cooperates with and is in fluid communication with irrigation conduit <b>72</b> at distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>710</b>. As described above and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref> and <b>25</b>-<b>26</b>, when stationary jaw <b>88</b> and movable jaw <b>90</b> of distal assembly <b>22</b> are in a closed position, a substantially fluid tight passage is formed therebetween. Because stationary jaw <b>88</b> is coupled to aspiration conduit <b>74</b> and movable jaw <b>90</b> is coupled over irrigation conduit <b>72</b>, a substantially fluid tight coupling of aspiration conduit <b>74</b> and irrigation conduit <b>72</b> is achieved. Thus, fluid flowing distally through irrigation conduit <b>72</b> returns to proximal end <b>11</b> through aspiration conduit <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">As embodied herein and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, fluid source <b>632</b> may be a syringe <b>744</b> filled with a saline irrigation fluid, an anticoagulant, a tissue staining dye, or any other medically necessary or desirable fluid.

Fluid source <b>632</b> may also be pressurized, or fluid may flow through irrigation conduit <b>72</b> via gravity, by suspending fluid source <b>632</b> at an elevation above the patient being operated upon. In these alternate embodiments, fluid flow through irrigation conduit <b>72</b> may be controlled by a valve (not shown) located on irrigation conduit <b>72</b> or on any other conduit flow-connecting irrigation conduit <b>72</b> to fluid source <b>632</b>. The valve may be a spring-biased pinch valve as previously mentioned, although any valve known to persons skilled in the art would be sufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, flexible member <b>14</b> also includes control conduit <b>70</b>. Control conduit <b>70</b> is connected to and extends from distal assembly <b>22</b> at distal end <b>13</b> to proximal actuation handle <b>712</b> at proximal end <b>11</b>. Control conduit <b>70</b> provides a channel through which pull wire <b>20</b> extends.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In accordance with the present embodiment, the biopsy instrument <b>710</b> includes a proximal actuation handle <b>712</b>. As described above and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, proximal actuation handle <b>712</b> includes an elongate shaft <b>30</b> having a manipulation thumb ring <b>31</b> fixed to the end thereof.

Suction passageway <b>762</b> is further in fluid connection with a vacuum reservoir <b>764</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>) via a vacuum conduit <b>766</b>. Vacuum reservoir <b>764</b>, connected to a vacuum source (not shown) and under vacuum pressure, facilitates the flow of fluid, tissue samples, or other matter, through aspiration conduit <b>74</b> and suction passageway <b>762</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38-39</figref>, suction passageway <b>762</b> has an access opening <b>768</b>. In the preferred embodiment, access opening <b>768</b> provides a lateral access to the flow in suction passageway <b>762</b> and is composed of two portions, a securing portion <b>770</b> and a flow-passage portion <b>772</b>. Securing portion <b>770</b> is configured to complement a sample collector handle <b>792</b>, as will be described later in greater detail, that is partially inserted into securing portion <b>770</b> of access opening <b>768</b>. In a preferred embodiment, securing portion <b>770</b> includes a circular flange <b>774</b> having a smooth, slightly tapered central bore <b>776</b>. Flow-passage portion <b>772</b> is configured to complement a sample collector body <b>794</b>, as will also be described later in greater detail, which is inserted into flow-passage portion <b>772</b>. As embodied herein, flow-passage portion <b>772</b> includes a roughly rectangular slot <b>778</b>, with an arcuate downstream wall <b>780</b>, that transects the flow in suction passageway <b>762</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">As embodied herein and best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, proximal actuation handle <b>712</b> includes an aspiration valve <b>782</b> provided on suction passageway <b>762</b>, to permit a surgeon to start and stop a vacuum effect in suction passageway <b>762</b>. Preferably, aspiration valve <b>782</b> is a spring-biased pinch valve, although any other valve also known to persons skilled in the art may be used. Aspiration valve <b>782</b> includes a pivot (not shown), a lever <b>784</b>, and a spring (not shown) which causes the nose <b>786</b> of valve <b>782</b> to pinch suction passageway <b>762</b> shut. A surgeon pressing on heel <b>788</b> of lever <b>784</b> will cause the spring to compress, lever <b>784</b> to rotate around the pivot, nose <b>786</b> to release its pinch on suction passageway <b>762</b>, and a vacuum effect to be established in aspiration conduit <b>74</b> and suction passageway <b>762</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The biopsy instrument according to the present embodiment includes a sample collector to trap and retain biopsy samples severed by operation of the distal assembly <b>22</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, biopsy instrument <b>710</b> includes sample collector assembly <b>790</b> provided in-line with suction passageway <b>762</b>. Sample collector assembly <b>790</b> acts as a filter to trap matter, such as biopsy samples, flowing through suction passageway <b>762</b>. Matter trapped by sample collector assembly <b>790</b> may then be retrieved by the surgeon or nurse for subsequent pathological examination.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40</figref><i>a</i>-<b>40</b><i>b</i>, sample collector assembly <b>790</b> includes catcher handle <b>792</b> and catcher body <b>794</b>. Catcher handle <b>792</b> has a securing end <b>796</b> for insertion into securing portion <b>770</b> of access opening <b>768</b>. In the present embodiment, securing end <b>796</b> includes a cylindrical, slightly tapered plug <b>798</b> that complements the smooth, slightly tapered central bore of securing portion <b>770</b> to provide a seal therewith. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, other access opening configurations and complementary catcher handle securing ends may be used without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, the central bore <b>776</b> of access opening <b>768</b> might further include an o-ring seated in a circumferential slot, or access opening circular flange <b>774</b> might include external threads which couple to a mating, internally threaded collar on catcher handle <b>792</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Catcher handle <b>792</b> also has a gripping end <b>799</b>, opposite to securing end <b>796</b>, for enabling the nurse or surgeon to firmly grip and easily manipulate sample collector <b>790</b>. Although the present embodiment of gripping end <b>799</b> includes a generally flat, circular tab with ribs <b>700</b> for improved gripping, it is to be understood that various other suitable gripping configurations known to persons skilled in the art may be used in connection with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40</figref><i>a</i>-<b>40</b><i>b</i>, catcher body <b>794</b> includes a flow opening <b>702</b>, a screen <b>704</b>, a cover <b>706</b>, and a break-away tab <b>708</b>. Catcher body <b>794</b> is insertable into and configured to complement flow-passage portion <b>772</b> of access opening <b>768</b>. Catcher body <b>794</b> permits fluid flow in suction passageway <b>762</b> to continue downstream, while trapping and retaining any solid matter passing through suction passageway <b>762</b>. Furthermore, as embodied herein, catcher body <b>794</b>, with cover <b>706</b> in a closed position, is configured to fit into a standard pathology and histology processing cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In the present embodiment, catcher body <b>794</b> has a flow opening <b>702</b> on its upstream side and a screen <b>704</b> on its arcuate downstream side. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref><i>a</i>, flow opening <b>702</b> has a rectangular cross-section, although it could have any other cross-section and still be consistent with the scope of the invention. Screen <b>704</b> is located on the downstream side of catcher body <b>794</b> to trap matter, such as tissue samples, after such matter has entered flow opening <b>702</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref><i>a</i>, screen <b>704</b> may consist of a horizontal and vertical latticework. Alternatively, screen <b>704</b> may consist of an array of perforations such as holes or slots. A person skilled in the art could easily size the mesh or the holes in screen <b>704</b> to best accommodate a given flow and sample size. It is further understood that many other screen configurations are known to persons skilled in the art and may be used in connection with the present invention, including a single hole or slot, or multiple slots.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40</figref><i>a</i>-<b>40</b><i>b</i>, catcher body <b>794</b> includes cover <b>706</b> positionable between an open position displaced from flow opening <b>702</b> of catcher body <b>794</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref><i>a</i>) and a closed position overlaying flow opening <b>702</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref><i>b</i>). As embodied herein, cover <b>706</b> may be slidably attached to catcher body via the interaction of a pair of flanges <b>711</b> on catcher body and a pair of channels <b>714</b> on cover <b>706</b>. Alternatively, cover <b>706</b> may be pivotably attached to catcher body <b>794</b> (not shown). Cover <b>706</b> may also be completely detachable from catcher body <b>794</b>, either sliding on or off the end of catcher body <b>794</b> furthest from catcher handle <b>792</b>, or snapping on or off catcher body <b>794</b> by means of any of a variety of flexible snap elements (also not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In the present embodiment, cover <b>706</b> includes a cover screen <b>707</b>. If catcher body <b>794</b> and cover <b>706</b> are used to contain the biopsy samples during pathology processing, cover screen <b>707</b> enables the fluids involved in the pathology process to easily and completely gain access to the sample. Alternatively, cover <b>706</b> may be a solid plate.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In accordance with the present invention and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref><i>b</i>, catcher body <b>794</b> is attached to securing end <b>96</b> of catcher handle <b>792</b> by means of break-away tab <b>708</b>. As embodied herein, break-away tab <b>708</b> includes a short rectangular plate attached at one end to securing end <b>796</b> and at an opposite end to catcher body <b>794</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, cleaving break-away tab <b>708</b>, typically with a snapping motion, permits catcher body <b>794</b> to be detached from catcher handle <b>792</b>. Sample collector <b>790</b> snaps apart at break-away tab <b>708</b> because the cross-sectional moment of inertia of tab <b>708</b> is less than the cross-sectional moment of inertia of securing end <b>796</b> or of catcher body <b>794</b>. Similarly, catcher body <b>794</b> may be twisted off from catcher handle <b>792</b> if the rotational moment of inertia of break-away tab <b>708</b> is less than the rotational moment of inertia of body <b>794</b> and of handle <b>792</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Sample collector <b>790</b> is preferably made of plastic that is chemically inert to the chemicals used in pathology processing, specifically nylon, although other plastics such as polypropylene or polyethylene, or even a suitable glass or metal, may be used.

Catcher handle <b>992</b> has a securing end <b>996</b> for insertion into a sample catcher port <b>848</b>. In this configuration, securing end <b>996</b> includes a plug with an ovoid cross-section and multiple, flexible circumferential rings <b>998</b> that complement sample catcher port <b>848</b> to provide a seal therewith. Rings <b>998</b> are preferable integrally molded to catcher handle <b>992</b>. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art, other access opening configurations and complementary catcher handle securing ends may be used without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, a different cross-section of securing end <b>996</b>, or a fewer or greater number of flexible rings <b>998</b>, or flexible rings <b>998</b> that are not integrally molded to catcher handle <b>992</b> are all within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Catcher handle <b>992</b> has a gripping end <b>999</b>, opposite to securing end <b>996</b>, for enabling the nurse or surgeon to firmly grip and easily manipulate sample collector <b>990</b>.

Catcher body <b>994</b> is insertable into and configured to complement the suction passageway portion of sample catcher port <b>848</b>. Catcher body <b>994</b> permits fluid flow in a suction passageway <b>844</b> to continue downstream, while trapping and retaining any solid matter, such as a tissue sample, passing through suction passageway <b>844</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Similarly to previously described catcher body <b>794</b>, catcher body <b>994</b> has a flow opening <b>902</b> on its upstream side and a screen <b>904</b> on its downstream side.

<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Operation of a biopsy instrument according to the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>38</b>-<b>42</b>. When a surgeon desires to take a tissue sample <b>112</b> from within a patient's body without invasive surgery, the surgeon inserts distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>710</b> into an orifice of a patient under treatment. While retaining control of proximal actuation handle <b>712</b>, the surgeon guides distal assembly <b>22</b> through the patient's body to a position adjacent a tissue to be sampled. In a preferred embodiment, the surgeon uses endoscopic technology to ensure proper positioning of the distal assembly. The surgeon inserts distal end <b>13</b> of biopsy instrument <b>710</b> into an irrigation endoscope already inserted and properly located within a patient's body. Distal assembly <b>22</b> is threaded through the irrigation endoscope until the surgical site is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">At the surgical site, opened movable jaw <b>90</b> is then positioned around the tissue to be sampled, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In a preferred embodiment, once jaw <b>90</b> is properly positioned, the surgeon creates a vacuum effect in aspiration conduit <b>74</b> and within concave cavity <b>101</b> of stationary jaw <b>88</b> by depressing aspiration valve <b>682</b>. This vacuum effect draws the tissue to be sampled into concave cavity <b>101</b> and aids the in the severance of the sample from the surrounding tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The surgeon then proceeds to slide actuator spool <b>34</b> along shaft <b>30</b> of proximal actuation handle <b>712</b> in the proximal direction. This, in turn, axially displaces pull wire <b>20</b> in the proximal direction causing movable jaw <b>90</b> to pivot about pivot pin <b>94</b>. Distal assembly <b>22</b> is thereby closed, and tissue sample <b>112</b> is separated from the surrounding tissue when sharp cutting edge <b>98</b> of movable jaw <b>90</b> comes into contact with blunt edge <b>92</b> of stationary jaw <b>88</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, severed tissue sample <b>112</b> is enclosed within the passageway formed by cup-like body <b>95</b> of movable jaw <b>90</b> and concave cavity <b>101</b> of stationary jaw <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">If not already established in aspiration conduit <b>74</b>, the surgeon initiates a vacuum effect in aspiration conduit <b>74</b> by depressing aspiration valve <b>682</b>. Tissue sample <b>112</b> is aspirated from distal end <b>13</b> through aspiration conduit <b>74</b> and suction passageway <b>662</b> and into sample collector <b>790</b> under the action of the vacuum effect.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">However, on occasion, tissue sample <b>112</b> may become lodged in distal assembly <b>22</b>, aspiration conduit <b>74</b> or in suction passageway <b>662</b>. When this happens, the surgeon may then choose to provide fluid to the biopsy site at distal end <b>13</b>. With a vacuum effect established in aspiration conduit <b>74</b>, any fluid provided to distal end <b>13</b> will be aspirated through aspiration conduit <b>74</b>, and thereby aid in the retrieval of tissue sample <b>112</b>. In a preferred embodiment, irrigation fluid from an irrigation endoscope is provided to the biopsy site. Alternatively, the surgeon may initiate a flow from fluid source <b>632</b> through irrigation conduit <b>72</b> of biopsy instrument <b>710</b> to distal end <b>13</b> in order to aid in the aspiration of tissue sample <b>112</b> to sample collector <b>790</b>. In addition, the pressure of fluid supplied from source <b>632</b> may be increased with the use of pressure increasing devices previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Once tissue sample <b>112</b> is trapped by screen <b>704</b>, the surgeon or nurse may disengage sample collector <b>790</b> from access opening <b>768</b> of proximal actuation handle <b>712</b>. Cover <b>706</b> is then slid, rotated or snapped over flow opening <b>702</b> of catcher body <b>794</b> capturing sample <b>110</b> within catcher body <b>94</b>. The surgeon or nurse then disconnects catcher body <b>794</b> from catcher handle <b>792</b> by snapping or twisting off break-away tab <b>708</b> from securing end <b>796</b>. Catcher body <b>794</b> may be placed in a specimen collection jar for later processing and examination.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">The surgeon may then reposition distal end <b>13</b> proximate to the next tissue sample <b>112</b> to be collected, and proceed to obtain and recover a second tissue sample <b>112</b> by repeating the above process.

<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Another embodiment of a biopsy instrument according to the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>. This embodiment generally relates to a pinch biopsy apparatus with aspiration capabilities and a method of using such. In a pinch biopsy apparatus, as will be described below, it is preferred that both jaws of the distal assembly are manipulable and capable of rotating away from one another. With the jaws in an open position, i.e., rotated away from one another, the operator is able to site the tissue to be sampled deep within the jaws of the distal assembly. Closing the jaws, i.e., rotating the jaws towards each other, causes the tissue within the jaws to be disengaged from the surrounding tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">One advantage of having both jaws of the distal assembly capable of rotating away from one another is that larger tissue samples may be acquired. Because both jaws of a pinch biopsy instrument rotate away from one another, the jaws in their opened position may realize a relatively large included angle. The fully opened jaws may be more completely positioned around a portion of tissue to be sampled as compared to an end effector assembly wherein one of the jaws is stationary. Thus, a pinch biopsy instrument is capable of detaching relatively large tissue samples.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">A second advantage of having both jaws of the distal assembly capable of rotating away from one another is that the tissue to be severed is located directly along the longitudinal axis of the pinch biopsy instrument. Thus, the operator may directly approach the tissue site rather than having to manipulate the biopsy instrument to approach the tissue site from an angle.</p>

<p id="p-0233" num="0232">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, the distal ends of pull wires <b>820</b><i>a</i>, <b>820</b><i>b </i>are shaped to accommodate the geometry of distal assembly <b>822</b>. Bend portions <b>821</b> provide clearance for inner flanges <b>893</b> and outer flanges <b>897</b>. Furthermore, bend portions <b>821</b> slide within channels <b>880</b><i>a</i>, <b>880</b><i>b</i>, respectively, of distal end conduit <b>884</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">According to the present embodiment, actuation of the actuation device pivots the first and second movable jaws relative to the flexible member. Pull wires <b>820</b><i>a</i>, <b>820</b><i>b </i>are coupled to and extend from holes <b>902</b> of jaws <b>890</b> at distal assembly <b>822</b> through control conduits <b>870</b><i>a</i>, <b>870</b><i>b</i>, respectively, of flexible member <b>814</b>. Pull wires <b>820</b><i>a</i>, <b>820</b><i>b </i>then extend through actuation handle <b>812</b> and are coupled to actuation spool <b>34</b>. Moving actuation spool <b>34</b> in a distal direction relative to shaft <b>30</b> causes pull wires <b>820</b><i>a</i>, <b>820</b><i>b </i>to move in a distal direction relative to flexible member <b>814</b> and distal end conduit <b>884</b>. This, in turn, causes holes <b>902</b> of jaws <b>890</b> to move in a distal direction relative to pivot pin <b>894</b> which is coupled to distal end conduit <b>884</b>. Mating edges <b>892</b> of jaws <b>890</b> are thereby rotated away from each other and distal assembly <b>822</b> assumes an opened configuration. Similarly, moving actuation spool <b>34</b> in a proximal direction relative to shaft <b>30</b> causes mating edges <b>892</b> of jaws <b>890</b> to rotate towards one another, whereby distal assembly <b>822</b> assumes a closed configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">The biopsy instrument of the present embodiment includes a sample collector to trap and retain biopsy samples severed by operation of the distal assembly <b>822</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, biopsy instrument <b>810</b> includes sample collector assembly <b>990</b> provided in-line with suction passageway <b>844</b>. Sample collector assembly <b>990</b> acts as a filter to trap matter, such as biopsy samples, flowing through suction passageway <b>844</b>. Matter trapped by sample collector assembly <b>990</b> may then be retrieved by the surgeon or nurse for subsequent pathological examination. Sample collector <b>990</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42</figref><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b</i>, has been previously described.</p>
