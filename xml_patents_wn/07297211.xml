<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Spray devices for the application of liquids onto human skin and hair are well known. Spray applications are used for many types of medicines, hair treatments, deodorants, lotions, and cosmetic agents. One form of spray device for the application of liquids for skin treatment are hand-held spray devices. Usually these hand-held spray devices are comprised of disposable pressurized can spray applicators having a finger actuated spray valve and nozzle. Non-pressurized hand-held spray applicators are also available consisting of reusable trigger-pump spray devices. These disposable and refillable trigger sprayers are held in one hand at less than a meter away from the skin to treat portions of the body. Container sizes for these types of sprayers are adapted to hold volumes of liquids adequate for multiple applications from a single container. Uniform spray applications of a precise dosage or coverage of an entire body are difficult with these types of hand-held spray applicators.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Other types of hand held applicators are those with liquid containers that use liquid pressure or compressed gas for atomization and propulsion. An example of this type of hand-held applicator is a hand-held air-brush sprayer adapted to be used to dispense cosmetic agents. One disadvantage of such air-brush systems is that the liquid containers are of an inappropriate size, often being too large or too small, to coat an entire person or selected parts of a person. In addition, the refilling process for such devices can be messy.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another disadvantage of hand-held air-brush systems is that it is difficult for a person to self-apply an even coat to certain body portions, such as the back. To overcome this problem, professional salons and spas offer trained sunless-tanning applicator personnel to apply material carefully over the entire body of the customer. This situation is often inconvenient and uncomfortable for both the personnel and the customer. In addition, since hand-held airbrush applications usually take 10 to 30 minutes, the process can be irritating to the tanning applicator and the customer due to prolonged exposure to the spray environment. Fatigue is also known to occur in the back, arms, and wrists of applicator personnel due to the repetitive motion of the hand-held brushing process.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Applications of cosmetic agents, such as sunless tanning compounds, with hand-held spray devices require very experienced personnel to avoid mistakes which may result in under- or over-application, missed areas, streaks, and runs. Another drawback that limits the practicality and marketplace potential of hand-held cosmetic sprays in which an assistant is needed is the potential inconvenience and embarrassment to the person being coated, since they must stand for the duration of the application in an unclothed or partially unclothed state.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Non-hand-held systems for dispensing liquid to the human body have also been developed. U.S. Pat. No. 1,982,509 describes a prior system for applying treatment media to a living body. U.S. Pat. No. 1,982,509 describes a carrier device which moves up and down and provides for applying a treatment media to a body. However, U.S. Pat. No. 1,982,509 does not describe for the use of removable liquid containers, or for liquid containers adapted to be of a size for applying a single dosage to portions of a human body as provided by embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Automated systems for self-application of a spray mist to the entire body have recently been introduced for sunless tanning. These systems are housed within cabinets or booths to permit enclosure of an adult and provide for hands-free, uniform, self-application in a private setting. U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,333 to Laughlin, U.S. Pat. No. 6,387,081 to Cooper, U.S. Pat. No. 6,302,122 to Parker et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 6,443,164 to Parker et al. each describe automated systems for coating the human body in which a spray chamber is used. In present systems, several spray nozzles are fed from a single large tank containing sunless tanning solution. These automatic spray systems are designed to dispense approximately five to ten tanning sessions per liter of liquid, and generally use a feeder-tank capacity of eight to twenty liters. Since each customer's dose is drawn from a common tank, the customer has no assurance of the amount applied, nor do they have a choice of the type of lotion to be applied for a certain skin type or desired tanning color. It is not currently practical to adapt present automatic systems to dispense a single dosage from an individually sized container because of the wasted volume of spray liquid that resides in the many hoses that are required to feed each of the many spray nozzles. The various embodiments of the present invention provide for a self-application spray device having a liquid container closely connected to a nozzle system and of a size allowing a customer to dispense an appropriate volume of spray solution of their choice.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a spray device adapted to coat a surface of a human body with a spray liquid, such as a sunless tanning compound, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The spray device <b>505</b> includes a housing <b>510</b> having an attached spray nozzle <b>515</b>. The spray nozzle <b>515</b> includes a jet outlet <b>520</b> for dispensing a spray of liquid to cover a portion of a human body. In another embodiment of the present invention, the spray nozzle <b>515</b> may be comprised of an electrostatic spray nozzle adapted to produce electrostatically charged droplets of the spray liquid. Many types of electrostatic spray nozzles exist in the prior art, of which many are suitable for use in embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The housing <b>510</b> contains a receiver vessel <b>525</b> adapted to receive and support an inserted removable liquid container <b>530</b>. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the removable liquid container <b>530</b> is adapted to be disposable or refillable after use. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the receiver vessel <b>525</b> may be of a shape so that it mates with the outside shape of the removable liquid container <b>530</b> to properly orient the removable liquid container <b>530</b> within the receiver vessel <b>525</b>, as well as ensure that the correct container is used in the spray device <b>505</b>. Upon insertion of the removable liquid container <b>530</b> into the receiver vessel <b>525</b>, a receiver conduit <b>535</b> connected to a liquid valve <b>540</b> punctures a liquid seal in the removable liquid container <b>530</b>. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the removable liquid container <b>530</b> is adapted to be of a size to contain an amount of liquid substantially equal to that required to apply a single dosage of the liquid to be sprayed to coat a surface of a human body. For example, this volume may be in the range of 100 ml to 150 ml. The amount of liquid substantially equal to that required to apply a single dosage may vary in accordance with the type of liquid and efficiency of the spray device, for example, between a range of 100 ml to 500 ml. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the removable liquid container <b>530</b> may be adapted to hold a volume of spray liquid of less than one liter. In accordance with still another embodiment of the present invention, the removable liquid container <b>530</b> may comprise a disposable liquid container or a refillable liquid container.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Upon opening of the liquid valve <b>540</b>, the liquid in the removable liquid container <b>530</b> is allowed to flow through a liquid conduit <b>545</b>, or a liquid channel, to the spray nozzle <b>515</b>, and exit the spray nozzle through jet outlet <b>520</b> in the form of a liquid spray. The removable liquid container <b>530</b> may optionally be pressurized or vented to facilitate the dispensing of liquid from the liquid container <b>530</b>. In addition, the receiver vessel <b>525</b> may be provided with a vent. In accordance with an embodiment of the present embodiment, the spray device <b>505</b> further includes a controller <b>550</b> connected to the liquid valve <b>540</b>. In an embodiment of the present invention, the liquid conduit <b>545</b> is adapted to be of a length such that the distance that the liquid is required to flow between the liquid valve <b>540</b> and the spray nozzle <b>515</b> is short. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the length of the liquid conduit <b>545</b> is less than approximately 160 millimeters. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the liquid conduit <b>545</b> is adapted to hold less than 20 ml of liquid. At least one advantage provided by the liquid conduit <b>545</b> being of a relatively short length and small diameter is that during a single tanning session, sequential use of multiple removable liquid containers can be used without requiring the purging of the liquid conduit <b>545</b>. For example, a particular customer may desire to have a pre-tanning compound from a first removable liquid container be applied, and then subsequently have a tanning compound from a second removable liquid container be applied. In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the liquid conduit <b>545</b> may be adapted to be contained within the liquid valve <b>540</b>, the spray nozzle <b>515</b>, or a fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The controller <b>550</b> functions as a control device to control operation of the liquid valve <b>540</b>. An actuator <b>560</b> is further connected to the controller <b>550</b> to allow an operator to control operation of the controller <b>550</b>. In accordance with various embodiments, the actuator <b>560</b> may be comprised of an electrical switch, a hand-held actuator or remote control, mounted on the housing <b>510</b> of the spray device <b>505</b>, or mounted on a wall or a floor near the person to be coated by the liquid spray, thereby providing remote activation of the spray device <b>505</b> by hand or foot while allowing a person to be coated to stand at an optimum distance away from the spray nozzle <b>515</b>. The remote activation provided by the actuator <b>560</b> allows, for example, for a person being coated to move body parts or completely turn in order to achieve uniform coverage. It should be understood that activation of the spray device <b>505</b> may be controlled either by an operator or the person to be coated. In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the controller <b>550</b> may comprise a timer circuit to control spray duration, or a programmable controller to provide for a variable spray duration. In other embodiments of the present invention other means of initiating a control sequence may be used, such as sensing the insertion of the liquid container into the spray device.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In accordance with still other embodiments of the present invention, the actuator <b>560</b> can be adapted to control the valve <b>540</b> via a wireless connection, such as an infrared or other light signal, a radio signal, a motion signal, or a voice activation or another sound signal. The actuator <b>560</b> can optionally be provided with an electrical connection to connect an operator to earth ground. In still other embodiments, the actuator <b>560</b> may comprise a hydraulic flow device or a pneumatic flow device connected to the spray device <b>505</b> via a tube.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with the present embodiment, the spray device <b>505</b> further includes a sweeping means <b>565</b> that is adapted to oscillate the spray device <b>505</b> about a pivot point <b>570</b> in a sweeping motion <b>575</b>, such as in a predetermined arc, while spraying. The sweeping motion <b>575</b> imparted to the spray nozzle <b>515</b> provides for the liquid spray from the nozzle jet outlet <b>520</b> to provide a larger area of coverage than that provided by a stationary nozzle. The sweeping means <b>565</b> may be comprised of, for example, an oscillating motor, one or more solenoids, or hydraulic actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with an embodiment of the spray device <b>505</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the controller <b>550</b> is further adapted to control the sweeping motion of the spray device <b>505</b>. For example, in addition to starting and stopping the spray jet from the spray jet outlet <b>520</b>, the controller <b>550</b> may be used to start and stop the sweeping movement, control the speed of the sweeping movement, and/or control the range of the sweeping movement of the spray device <b>505</b>. Activation of the controller <b>550</b> to start the sweeping movement of the spray device <b>505</b> can be initiated through use of the actuator <b>560</b> and/or automatically by the controller <b>550</b>. Similarly, stopping of the sweeping movement of the spray device <b>505</b> can be initiated through use of the actuator <b>560</b> and/or automatically by the controller <b>550</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, after activation of the spray device <b>505</b> via actuator <b>560</b>, the spray device <b>505</b> continues to spray the spray liquid until a single dosage of the spray liquid is dispensed and the removable liquid container <b>530</b> is substantially empty of the spray liquid. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the spray of the spray liquid from the spray device <b>505</b>, as well as the sweeping motion of the spray device <b>505</b>, may be momentarily paused during the spray operation in order that the subject being sprayed can reposition themselves, or be automatically repositioned, with respect to the spray device <b>505</b>. For example, during a single spraying operation, the spray of spray liquid from the spray device <b>505</b> may be paused one or more times, the subject may be instructed to turn his or her body in a new orientation, and then the spray of spray liquid from the spray device <b>505</b> may be resumed. Upon final completion of the spraying operation, the removable liquid container is substantially empty of the spray liquid. In accordance with still other embodiments of the present invention, deactivation of the spray device <b>505</b> may be performed either through the use of the actuator <b>560</b> or automatically by controller <b>550</b> after a predetermined time has elapsed, or based on a detected emptying of the removable liquid container.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Although the sweeping motion of the spray device <b>505</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated as being primarily in a vertical direction, it should be understood that other embodiments of the present invention may be adapted to sweep the spray device <b>505</b> in a primarily horizontal direction. In still other embodiments of the spray device <b>505</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the spray device <b>505</b> may be adapted to sweep using a combination of horizontal and vertical motions through the use of multi-axis pivot points.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the removable liquid container <b>530</b> may be adapted to hold a volume of spray liquid equal to that required to hold multiples of a single dosage of the spray liquid while still having a size small enough such that it may be easily installed and removed, as well as depleted before spoilage may occur. For example, in an application in which a typical single dosage of spray liquid is equal to approximately 100 ml to 150 ml, the removable liquid container <b>130</b> may be adapted to hold a volume of spray liquid of less than or equal to approximately one liter. At least one advantage provided by this embodiment is that multiple dosages can be dispensed from a single removable liquid container while still allowing the removable liquid container contents to be depleted before spoilage occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an embodiment of the spray device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated.

The remote controller <b>585</b> may be adapted to be of a size to be held in the hand. The remote controller <b>585</b> allows an operator <b>595</b> to remotely control operation of the spray device <b>580</b>. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the remote controller <b>585</b> allows an operator <b>595</b> or a person to be coated to control dispensing of spray liquid by the spray device <b>580</b>. The remote controller <b>585</b> provides for remote activation of the spray device <b>580</b> by hand or foot while allowing the person to be coated to stand at an optimum distance away from the spray nozzle <b>515</b>. The remote controller <b>585</b> may also allow, for example, for a person being coated to move body parts or completely turn in order to achieve uniform coverage while still retaining control over the spray device <b>580</b>. In other embodiments of the present invention, the spray nozzle <b>515</b> may be comprised of an electrostatic spray nozzle. In such embodiments, the control wire <b>590</b> may be adapted to provide a connection to a ground for the operator <b>595</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition to starting and stopping the spray jet from the spray jet outlet <b>520</b>, the remote controller <b>585</b> may be further adapted to control sweeping means <b>565</b> to oscillate the spray device <b>580</b> about pivot point <b>570</b>.
