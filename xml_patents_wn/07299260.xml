<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A mail retrieval moderator instructs an image memory usage rate calculator to calculate a usage rate of an image memory, and determines whether the usage rage is greater than or equal to 98%. When the answer is “Yes”, there is a risk that the image memory will have a memory overflow if more e-mail is retrieved from the POP3 server. Thus, a timer is reset and the control returns to ST<b>501.</b> When the answer is “No”, there is no risk that the image memory will have a memory overflow even if more e-mail is retrieved from the POP3 server. Thus, e-mail is retrieved from the POP3 server. Accordingly, the apparatus and method for receiving e-mail is capable of securely retrieving e-mail from the mail server, even with a relatively small memory capacity.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an apparatus and method for receiving e-mail.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, internet facsimile terminal apparatuses (IFAX terminal apparatus) for e-mail that transmit/receive data via internet using e-mail, exemplified by disclosures in Japanese Laid Open Application 8-242326 and its corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 5,881,233, have become commercially available.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">These IFAX terminal apparatuses are equipped with the same configurations and user interfaces as G3/G4 facsimile machines, which are normally used in offices and homes. And such an IFAX terminal apparatus is in one body, can be operated by an operation panel with numeric keys, one-touch buttons or the like, and provides information to users using a relatively small LCD screen.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The steps for receiving an e-mail using an IFAX terminal apparatus is briefly explained hereafter. An IFAX terminal apparatus accesses to a mail server for receiving mail (e.g., POP3 server), and while retrieving e-mail stored in a mailbox assigned to an individual mail account, the apparatus stores an attached image file (facsimile data) in its image memory. After finishing the e-mail reception, the apparatus extends the image file and outputs the same to a printer to print the e-mail.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, conventional IFAX terminal apparatuses usually do not have a large capacity in a hard disk, unlike personal computers (PCs), and the image memory capacities to store image files are not necessarily sufficient. Therefore, when an image memory is having a memory overflow, such an apparatus is not capable of storing e-mail in the image memory, even if the apparatus has retrieved the e-mail from a mail server. Consequently, the e-mail cannot be printed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also, even if there is a risk to have a memory overflow, such an apparatus would still retrieve the e-mail, therefore, the e-mail will be deleted from the mail server and will become lost.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, during a memory overflow, e-mail cannot be received/printed normally. Therefore, it is not preferable to have such a problem for a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above-described problems are common not only to internet facsimile apparatuses, but also to e-mail reception apparatuses, without memory with large capacities as in hard disks, which receive e-mail using relatively small memory capacities.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This invention is provided in view of the above-described problems. The object of the present invention is to provide an e-mail reception apparatus and method for receiving e-mail that can securely retrieve e-mail from the mail server, even with a relatively small memory capacity.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To solve the above-described problem, the e-mail reception apparatus in the present invention calculates a usage rate of a memory that stores e-mail, checks whether the calculated usage rate is greater than or equal to a threshold value, with which there is a risk of a memory overflow if more e-mail items are to be retrieved, determines not to retrieve e-mail when the apparatus detects that the usage rate is greater than or equal to the threshold value, and retrieves e-mail when the apparatus determines that the usage rate is less than the threshold value.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The embodiments of the present invention are further explained in the following, in reference to the above-described drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a conceptual rendering illustrating a computer network system in which an internet facsimile terminal apparatus operates according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a system <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an internet facsimile (IFAX) terminal apparatus <b>2</b> is connected to the internet <b>4</b> via a local area network (LAN) <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the LAN <b>3</b>, a mail account (mail address) is assigned to the internet facsimile terminal apparatus <b>2</b>, and a POP (Post Office Protocol) 3 server <b>5</b> is equipped to receive and store e-mail designated to the mail account.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The internet <b>4</b> is connected to PC <b>6</b>, IFAX <b>7</b>, or the like, which transmit e-mail to the internet facsimile terminal apparatus <b>2</b>, via a LAN <b>8</b>. A SMTP server <b>9</b> for a mail server of sending side is connected to the LAN <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the system <b>1</b>, the internet facsimile terminal apparatus <b>2</b> is connected to the internet <b>4</b> via the LAN <b>3</b>, however, the method of connection is not limited to the above. For example, by connecting to an internet connection provider (ISP) via a public system telephone network (PSTN), or an ISDN (integrated service digital network), the internet facsimile terminal apparatus <b>2</b> can access the internet <b>4</b> through the ISP.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the system <b>1</b> as described above, when the IFAX <b>7</b> or the PC <b>6</b> is transmitting a piece of image information as an e-mail item to the internet facsimile terminal apparatus <b>2</b>, the mail account of the internet facsimile terminal apparatus <b>2</b> becomes a destination and the e-mail item with the attached image information is transmitted to the POP3 server <b>5</b>, via SMTP server <b>9</b>. The POP3 server <b>5</b> stores the received e-mail item in a mailbox for the mail account of the internet facsimile terminal apparatus <b>2</b>. The internet facsimile terminal apparatus <b>2</b> periodically or according to the receiver's instruction, accesses the POP3 server <b>5</b>. The communication with the POP3 server <b>5</b> follows a POP3 protocol, one of the e-mail forwarding protocols; however, the method is not limited to the above. If there is an e-mail item stored in the mailbox, the internet facsimile terminal apparatus <b>2</b> receives the e-mail item and prints the contents of the same.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the first embodiment, the e-mail items that the internet facsimile terminal apparatus <b>2</b> receives are e-mail items with attached image files. These e-mail items adhere to standards such as MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), and the image files are stored in the attached file parts after they are transformed into character codes using a format such as Base 64 format. Each part, such as a text part and an attached file part, is divided according to a boundary defined by the header. Further, the format of the image files is TIFF-FX format, in compliance with the RFC2301 standard of IETF. The image files of the TIFF-FX format (TIFF files) is composed of multi-page structure. Additionally, every scanned page is compressed by the compression format that is normally used for facsimile communication, such as MH, MR, and MMR. Such compressed image information (compressed image data) is orderly inserted in each page area (between sub-headers, IFD) of the TIFF file. In other words, e-mail using IFAX has multiple of compressed image data, to correspond to each page of the document, which is converted into a TIFF file and attached to the e-mail.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating hardware of the internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention. In the internet facsimile terminal apparatus <b>2</b>, a CPU <b>21</b> operates a program and controls the entire apparatus. A ROM <b>22</b> stores the program that CPU <b>21</b> operates.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A RAM <b>23</b> has a work area to operate the program and a buffer area that temporarily stores various data such as e-mail and compressed image data.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An image compression and extension circuit <b>24</b> compresses transmitting image information using MH, MR, MMR, etc, and extends compressed image information received into the original image information.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A network control unit (NCU) <b>25</b> is connected to a PSTN <b>26</b>. A modem <b>27</b> is connected to this network control unit <b>25</b>, via an analog signal line <b>28</b>. The modem <b>27</b> modulates and demodulates various data that is transmitted to and received from the other facsimile apparatus via the PSTN <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A LAN interface <b>29</b> controls data transmission and reception via the LAN <b>3</b>. A scanner <b>30</b> scans a document and obtains the image information. A printer <b>31</b> prints various data including received image information.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an e-mail reception function of the internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention. An e-mail reception function is achieved by a program that operates on the IPU <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A timer <b>41</b> counts a lapse of time from the previous check, to check incoming mail periodically in the POP3 server <b>5</b>. After an expiration of a predetermined time interval, the timer <b>41</b> notifies a number of incoming mail item requester <b>42</b> of the expiration. The number of incoming mail item requester <b>42</b> requests, via the LAN interface <b>29</b>, the POP3 server <b>5</b> to notify a number of incoming mail items. Specifically, the number of incoming mail item requester <b>42</b> transmits a STAT command or a LIST command of the POP3 protocols to the POP3 server <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A receiver for a number of incoming mail items <b>43</b> receives the information on a number of incoming mail items that is transmitted by the POP3 server <b>5</b> via the LAN interface <b>29</b>, according to the request by the number of incoming mail item requester <b>42</b>, and delivers the information on the number of incoming mail items to a mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b> checks, from the information on the number of incoming mail items, whether there is an incoming mail item in the POP3 server <b>5</b>, and, if there is an incoming mail item, instructs a mail transmission requester <b>45</b> to retrieve the mail item. Prior to this guidance, whether there is a risk of a memory overflow in an image memory <b>46</b> is checked, and if there is a risk of a memory overflow, the mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b> will not give instructions to retrieve the incoming mail item. This procedure is later explained in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b> also delivers, if there is an incoming mail item, the information on the number of incoming mail items to a number of incoming mail item display <b>47</b>. The number of incoming mail item display <b>47</b> displays the delivered information on the number of incoming mail items, on a display apparatus (e.g., LCD equipped on an operation panel) <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The mail transmission requester <b>45</b> requests the POP3 server <b>5</b> to transmit an e-mail item via the LAN interface <b>29</b>. More specifically, the mail transmission requester <b>45</b> transmits a RETR command of the POP3 protocols to the POP3 server <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to the request by the mail transmission requester <b>45</b>, a mail receiver <b>49</b> receives the e-mail item transmitted by the POP3 server <b>5</b> via the LAN interface <b>29</b>, and delivers the same to a decoder <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The decoder <b>50</b> decodes an image file that is coded into a character code by the Base <b>64</b> format from the sending side, and attached according to the MIME. The decoder <b>50</b> stores the decoded image file in the image memory <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A memory area control table <b>51</b> is used to manage the usage of the memory area in the image memory <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a memory area control table of the internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention. The memory area control table <b>51</b> includes a register of a number of addresses that corresponds to a number of memory areas in the image memory <b>46</b>. When data is written in a memory area, the corresponding address is set to “1” (on), and when the data is erased in the memory area and released, the address is set to “0” (off). A image memory usage rate calculator <b>52</b> calculates a usage rate (%) of the image memory <b>46</b>, from a ratio of the addresses set to “1” in the entire addresses of the memory area control table <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b>, when the memory usage rate calculated by the image memory usage rate calculator <b>52</b> is greater than or equal to the predetermined value (threshold value), with which the image memory <b>46</b> would have a risk of a memory overflow if e-mail is retrieved from the POP3 server <b>5</b>, determines not to retrieve any e-mail even if there are incoming mail items in the POP3 server <b>5</b>. The threshold value is determined by a ratio of currently used memory to an entire memory capacity, and in this example, the predetermined value is set to 98%.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart illustrating steps for the e-mail reception performed by the internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention. The number of incoming mail item requester <b>42</b> checks the timer <b>41</b> (ST<b>501</b>), and checks whether the time is up (ST<b>502</b>). If the time is up, the number of incoming mail item requester <b>42</b> requests the POP3 server <b>5</b> for the number of incoming mail items (ST<b>503</b>). If the time is not up, the control returns to ST<b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The number of incoming mail item receiver <b>43</b> receives information on the number of incoming mail items returned by the POP3 server <b>5</b> (ST<b>504</b>). The number of incoming mail item receiver <b>43</b> delivers the received information on the number of incoming mail items to the mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b> checks whether the number of incoming mail items is zero, based on the delivered information on the number of incoming mail items (ST<b>505</b>). If the answer is “Yes”, the timer <b>41</b> is reset (ST<b>506</b>), and the control returns ST<b>501</b> to wait for another time up. On the other hand, if the answer is “No”, the information on the number of incoming mail items is delivered to the number of incoming mail item display <b>47</b>, and the number of incoming mail items is displayed on the display apparatus <b>48</b> (ST<b>507</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b>, then instructs the image memory usage rate calculator <b>52</b> to calculate a usage rate of the image memory <b>46</b> (ST<b>508</b>). Next, whether the usage rate is greater than or equal to 98% is checked (ST<b>509</b>). If the answer is “Yes”, since there is a risk for the image memory <b>46</b> to have a memory overflow when more e-mail is retrieved from the POP3 server <b>5</b>, the timer <b>41</b> is reset (ST<b>506</b>), and the control returns to ST<b>501</b>. On the other hand, if the answer is “No”, since there is no risk that the image memory <b>46</b> would have a memory overflow even when more e-mail is to be retrieved from the POP3 server <b>5</b>, the e-mail is retrieved from the POP3 server <b>5</b>. Accordingly, as can be seen from these steps, no part of the e-mail is retrieved if there is a risk of memory overflow as a result of the decision in step ST<b>509</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Specifically, the mail transmission requester <b>45</b> requests the POP3 server <b>5</b> for a transmission of an e-mail item (ST<b>510</b>). The mail receiver <b>49</b> receives the e-mail transmitted by the POP3 server <b>5</b> in response to the request (ST<b>511</b>), the decoder <b>50</b> decodes the image file attached to the received e-mail (ST<b>512</b>), and the decoded image file is stored in the image memory <b>46</b> (ST<b>513</b>). Subsequently, whether there are any e-mail items left in the POP3 server <b>5</b> is checked (ST<b>514</b>). If there are any e-mail items left, the reception procedure of ST<b>510</b>-ST<b>513</b> is performed. If there is no e-mail left, the control returns to ST<b>501</b> and waits for another time up.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As described above, according to the first embodiment of the present invention, after determining that there are e-mail items in the POP3 server <b>5</b> at ST<b>505</b>, the mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b> instructs the image memory usage rate calculator <b>52</b> to calculate the usage rate of the image memory <b>46</b> at ST<b>508</b>. Whether the usage rate at ST<b>509</b> is greater than or equal to the threshold value, in other words, whether there is a risk for the image memory <b>46</b> to have a memory overflow, if more e-mail is retrieved from the POP3 server <b>5</b>, is checked. If the answer is “Yes”, e-mail retrieval (ST<b>510</b>-ST<b>514</b>) will not be performed. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent an inconvenient circumstance when the image memory <b>46</b>, with a risk of having a memory overflow, retrieve e-mail from the POP3 server <b>5</b>, but fails to store the image file in the image memory <b>46</b> and to print the e-mail.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, even if the received e-mail is set to be erased from the POP3 server <b>5</b> after completing a normal e-mail reception, when there is a risk for a memory overflow, the apparatus does not perform e-mail retrieval. Therefore, it is possible to avoid a situation that e-mail is erased from a mail server and becomes lost.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As a result, in accordance with the internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention, even the image memory <b>46</b> with a relatively small memory capacity is able to retrieve e-mail securely from the POP3 server <b>5</b> and print the same.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an e-mail reception function of the internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention. Some structural portions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> have the same numerals as in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> of the above-described first embodiment; therefore, the repetitive explanation is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention is different from the above-described first embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as follows. In addition to a timer A <b>61</b> that counts a lapse of time from a previous request for a number of incoming mail items in the same way as the timer <b>41</b> of the first embodiment, there is a timer B <b>62</b> that counts a lapse of time from the time when a determination not to retrieve e-mail is made, because the usage rate of the image memory <b>46</b> is greater than or equal to 98% (“Yes” from ST<b>509</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Also, the internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention is equipped with a forwarding requester <b>63</b>, a report processor <b>64</b>, and a mail transmitter <b>65</b>. The forwarding requester <b>63</b>, when e-mail retrieval is not performed because the usage rate of the image memory <b>46</b> is not less than 98%, even after an expiration of a predetermined time interval at the timer B <b>62</b>, requests the POP3 server <b>5</b> to forward the e-mail to the predetermined destination.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">On the other hand, the report processor <b>64</b> prepares reports regarding a forwarding request made by the forwarding requester <b>63</b>, and regarding a situation that e-mail retrieval is not performed because the usage rate of the image memory <b>46</b> is not less than 98%, even after an expiration of a predetermined time interval at the timer B <b>62</b>. More specifically, a message including these contents of the report are prepared and transmitted to the sender of the e-mail that cannot be retrieved, and to a pre-registered destination by the mail transmitter <b>65</b>. Also, the forwarding request and the report on retrieval error are printed by the printer <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart illustrating steps for the e-mail reception performed by the internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention. Some steps in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> have the same numerals as in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> of the above-described first embodiment; therefore, the repetitive explanation is omitted. Prior to checking the timer A <b>61</b> to determine whether the time is up at ST<b>501</b> and ST<b>502</b>, the timer B <b>62</b> is checked (ST<b>701</b>) to determine whether the timer B <b>62</b> is counting (ST<b>702</b>). Normally, since the timer B <b>62</b> is not counting, the control proceeds to ST<b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">After a confirmation process of a number of incoming mail items of ST<b>501</b>-ST<b>505</b>, if there are any incoming mail items (“Yes” at ST<b>505</b>), the number of incoming mail items is displayed on the display apparatus (ST<b>507</b>), a usage rate of the image memory <b>46</b> is calculated (ST<b>508</b>), and whether the usage rate is greater than or equal to 98% is checked (ST<b>509</b>). In the second embodiment of the present invention, if the usage rate of the image memory <b>46</b> is greater than or equal to 98%, the timer B <b>62</b> starts counting (ST<b>703</b>). Then, after resetting the timer A <b>61</b> (ST<b>506</b>), the control returns to ST<b>701</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the timer B <b>62</b> starts counting, the answer for ST<b>702</b> becomes “Yes”, and the control proceeds to ST<b>801</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an operation when a memory overflow is detected, performed by the internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention. At this time, the mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b> first re-examines whether a usage rate of the image memory <b>46</b> is greater than or equal to 98% (threshold value). If the answer is “No”, the mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b> determines that image memory <b>46</b> has a newly opened area so that the image memory <b>46</b> will not have a memory overflow when more e-mail is retrieved. Therefore, the timer B <b>62</b> stops and clears the counts (ST<b>802</b>), and the control returns to ST<b>701</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">On the other hand, when the answer is “Yes” at ST<b>801</b>, the mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b> checks whether the counting value of the timer B <b>62</b> has exceeded the predetermined time interval (T<b>2</b>) (ST<b>803</b>). If the answer is “Yes”, the forwarding requester <b>63</b> requests the POP 3 server <b>5</b> to forward the incoming e-mail (ST<b>804</b>). Subsequently, the report processor <b>64</b> reports each forwarded transmission to the sender of the e-mail and to the administrator (ST<b>805</b> and ST<b>806</b>). Further, the report processor <b>64</b> prints a forwarding report from the printer <b>31</b> (ST<b>807</b>). After the report, the timer B <b>62</b> stops and clears the counts (ST<b>808</b>), and the control returns to ST<b>701</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Each step of ST<b>805</b>, ST<b>806</b>, and ST<b>807</b> is later described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">If the answer is “No” at ST<b>803</b>, the mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b> checks whether the counting value of the timer B <b>62</b> has exceeded the predetermined time interval (T<b>1</b>) (ST<b>809</b>). If the answer is “Yes”, the display apparatus <b>48</b> displays a message of an e-mail retrieval error (ST<b>810</b>), and a report is prepared to report the e-mail retrieval error to the administrator (ST<b>811</b>). This error report at ST<b>811</b> is later described in detail. If the answer is “No”, at ST<b>809</b>, the control returns to ST<b>701</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flowchart illustrating steps for a forwarding request process performed by the internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention. First, the forwarding requester <b>63</b> obtains the stored e-mail (stored mail) numbers and the number of items that have arrived at the POP3 server <b>5</b> (ST<b>901</b>). Next, a forwarding address that is pre-registered in the RAM <b>23</b> is retrieved (ST<b>902</b>). Then, the stored mail numbers and the forwarding address are notified to the POP3 server <b>5</b>, and mail forwarding is requested (ST<b>903</b>). After that, whether the forwarding request is made for the number of obtained mail items obtained at ST<b>901</b> is checked (ST<b>904</b>), and if there is stored mail remaining without being forwarded, the control returns to ST<b>903</b>. ST<b>903</b> and ST<b>904</b> are repeated until all of the forwarding requests are made for the store mail.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flowchart illustrating steps for reporting mail forwarding to a sender performed by the internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention. First, the report processor <b>64</b> obtains the number of stored mail items from the POP3 server <b>5</b> (ST<b>1001</b>), and the sender's address of the stored mail from the POP3 server <b>5</b> (ST<b>1002</b>). Next, the report processor <b>64</b> prepares a mail forwarding report to a sender, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and transmits the same to the sender's address from the mail transmitter <b>65</b> (ST<b>1003</b>). Subsequently, whether a mail forwarding report is prepared for the number of mail items obtained at ST<b>1001</b> is checked (ST<b>1004</b>). ST<b>1003</b> and ST<b>1004</b> are repeated until all of the forwarding reports are made for the stored mail.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flowchart illustrating steps for reporting mail forwarding to an administrator performed by the internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention. First, the report processor <b>64</b> obtains information of the stored mail such as the sender's address, title, and date and time sent, from the POP3 server <b>5</b> (ST<b>1201</b>). And the report processor <b>64</b> retrieves an administrator's address that is pre-registered in the RAM <b>23</b> (ST<b>1202</b>). Then, the report processor <b>64</b> prepares a mail forwarding report to the administrator, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (ST<b>1203</b>), and transmits the same to the administrator's address from the mail transmitter <b>65</b> (ST<b>1204</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a flowchart illustrating steps for printing a forwarding report performed by the internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention. First, the report processor <b>64</b> obtains information of the stored mail such as the sender's address, title, and date and time sent, from the POP3 server <b>5</b> (ST<b>1401</b>). Next, based on the information obtained from the POP3 server <b>5</b>, a forwarding report is prepared, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, and printed (ST<b>1402</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a flowchart illustrating steps for reporting a mail retrieval error to an administrator performed by the internet facsimile terminal apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention. First, the report processor <b>64</b> prepares mail for a mail retrieval error, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> (ST<b>1601</b>). Next, the report processor <b>64</b> retrieves the administrator's address that is pre-registered in the RAM <b>23</b> (ST<b>1602</b>), and then transmits the mail for the mail retrieval error to the administrator's address from the mail transmitter <b>65</b> (ST<b>1603</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As described above, according to the second embodiment of the present invention, as shown in ST<b>804</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, if e-mail retrieval is not performed during the predetermined time (T<b>2</b>) since the mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b> determines that the usage rate of the image memory <b>46</b> is greater than or equal to the threshold value, the mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b> instructs the forwarding requestor <b>63</b> to request the POP3 server <b>5</b> to forward the e-mail to the predetermined address. Thus, when the image memory <b>46</b> continues to have a risk of a memory overflow, the mail server is requested to forward mail. Therefore, it is possible to transmit e-mail to a person who needs the same quickly, and improve the communication efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Also, as shown in ST<b>805</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the forwarding requester <b>63</b> requests the POP3 server <b>5</b> to forward mail, the report processor <b>64</b> reports the mail forwarding to the sender of the e-mail. Therefore, it is possible to communicate with a sender of the e-mail that the internet facsimile terminal apparatus requested to forward e-mail without retrieving the same.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Further, as shown in ST<b>806</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, when the forwarding requester <b>63</b> requests the POP3 server <b>5</b> to forward mail, an administrator is notified of the same. Therefore, it is possible to notify an administrator that there has been a situation that the internet facsimile terminal apparatus was notable to retrieve e-mail and requested the POP3 server <b>5</b> to forward the same, and to take a corrective measure. In addition to reporting to an administrator, the report can be transmitted to a pre-registered address that has been set up for mail forwarding or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Additionally, as shown in ST<b>807</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, when the forwarding requester <b>63</b> requests to forward mail, a report, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, containing information of the forwarded e-mail such as the title and the sender address, is printed. Therefore, it is possible to obtain information of e-mail forwarded by a user of the internet facsimile terminal apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Furthermore, as shown in ST<b>809</b>, ST<b>810</b>, and ST<b>811</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, if e-mail retrieval is not performed during the predetermined time (T<b>1</b>) since the mail retrieval moderator <b>44</b> determines that the usage rate of the image memory <b>46</b> is greater than or equal to the threshold value, the report processor <b>64</b> reports to the administrator of the same. Therefore, it is possible to notify an administrator when the image memory <b>46</b> continues to have a risk of a memory overflow, and to take a corrective measure.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Here, it is preferable to appropriately set a predetermined time (T<b>1</b>) and wait for a period of time, instead of proceeding to prepare a report immediately after detecting an overflow. This is because, for example, even if the usage rate of the image memory <b>46</b> is greater than or equal to the threshold value due to the facsimile data being stored in the image memory <b>46</b>, the data in the image memory <b>46</b> will be released once a facsimile transmission is completed, and it becomes possible to retrieve e-mail again.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In addition to reporting to an administrator, the report can be transmitted to a pre-registered address for a service center or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Likewise, according to the second embodiment of the present invention, by performing forwarding and report processes when the image memory <b>46</b> continues to have a risk of a memory overflow, it is possible to transmit e-mail to a destination quickly, to solve a memory overflow as soon as possible, and to improve the communication efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments. For example, in the first and second embodiments of the present invention, the internet facsimile terminal apparatus <b>2</b> stores image files attached to e-mail in the image memory <b>46</b>. However, the method is not limited to the above, and the present invention can also be applied to a situation when e-mail retrieved from the POP3 server <b>5</b> is directly stored in a memory. Thus, the present invention can be widely applied to e-mail reception apparatuses that retrieve e-mail from the POP3 server <b>5</b>. Such e-mail reception apparatuses include mobile phones, PHS terminals, and personal data assistants (PDAs).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As known as a prior art, the present invention can be performed using general and commercially available digital computers and microprocessors that are programmed according to the art described in the above embodiments. Also, as known as prior art, the present invention is comprised of computer programs that are produced by people skilled in the art, based on the art described in the above embodiments.</p>
