<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to patient support surfaces.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Healthcare costs and patient well being are effected by the degree of pressure relief for patients confined to beds for significant periods of time. Pressure sores, such as decubitus ulcers, potentially lead to infections and other conditions or complications. These can occur from prolonged pressure exposure, such as experienced by those confined to beds, whether in a hospital, nursing home, or private residence. Considerable efforts have been made to provide mattress systems or patient support surfaces which effectively redistribute and equalize pressure forces at the interactions between the patient and the support surface. Generally speaking, the more sophisticated techniques for achieving such pressure reductions are more involved to manufacture and are therefore more expensive. Several manufacturers today manufacture support surfaces which include several elongated air tubes, cells or cylinders combined with foam pieces or perimeter which surround the air tubes. Examples of embodiments having multiple, elongated air tubes are set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,692,256; 5,412,821, and 5,070,560.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The bed shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,692,256 includes a stepped deck which includes an upper deck, and a lower deck coupled to the upper deck by a vertical deck side wall. Recently, manufacturers have angled the side wall SW of a stepped deck SD, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The space between the outermost air cell AC and the side wall SW is occupied with a resilient foam bolster B. These bolsters however limit the amount of area occupied by the air cells AC.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the foregoing deficiencies associated with support surfaces and the beds associated therewith, there remains a need for a support surface which increases the usable surface area. It thus is to the provision of such that the present invention is primarily directed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A patient support surface comprises a plurality of patient support air cells, each air cell being oriented laterally and having a generally trapezoidal shape along its lateral length, a resilient foam perimeter surrounding the air cells, and a foam topper overlaying the air cells.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring next to the drawings, there is shown a patient support surface <b>10</b> in a preferred form of the invention. The support surface <b>10</b> is adapted to be coupled with a bed <b>11</b> similar to that shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,692,256, which is specifically incorporated herein by reference. The bed <b>10</b> shown in the drawings includes a step deck <b>12</b> having an upper deck <b>13</b>, a lower deck <b>14</b>, and deck side walls <b>15</b>. The deck side walls <b>15</b> are oriented at an inclined angle as they extend upwardly from the lower deck <b>14</b> to the upper deck <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The support surface <b>10</b> has a foam perimeter <b>18</b>, a generally truncated-triangular shaped core <b>19</b>, a foam topper <b>21</b>, and a coverlet <b>22</b>. The foam perimeter <b>18</b> includes an interior well <b>25</b> defined by a floor <b>26</b>, a top surface <b>27</b>, and at least two side walls <b>28</b> having interior facing surfaces <b>29</b> diverging from each other as they extend upwardly from the floor <b>26</b> to the top surface <b>27</b>. The foam perimeter <b>18</b> may be made of any conventionally known mattress bolster material, such as resilient polyurethane.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The core <b>19</b> is comprised of a plurality of generally trapezoidal-shaped, inflatable air cells <b>31</b>. Each air cell <b>31</b> has a bottom wall <b>32</b>, a top wall <b>33</b>, two oppositely disposed side walls <b>34</b> extending between the bottom wall <b>32</b> and the top wall <b>33</b>, and two oppositely disposed end walls <b>35</b> extending between bottom wall <b>32</b> and the top wall <b>22</b>. The ends walls <b>35</b> diverge from each other as they extend from the bottom wall <b>32</b> to the top wall <b>33</b> so that the air cell has a generally trapezoidal shape along its lateral length. The air cells <b>31</b> may be made of a woven nylon fabric fused to a heavy gauge polymeric film. The apparatus or assembly used to inflate the air cells <b>31</b> may be any conventionally known device used for such purposes, as for example that shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,223,369, which is specifically incorporated herein by reference. The air cell material may be designed to be air impervious or air pervious (low air loss), depending upon the desired criteria or parameters of the support surface. The type of material utilized for the air cell may help determine the type of air inflation system associated therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The foam topper <b>21</b> is configured to overlay the core <b>19</b> and top surface <b>27</b> of the perimeter <b>18</b>. The topper <b>21</b> may be made of any conventionally known mattress topper material, such as resilient polyurethane, or multiple layers of different materials.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The coverlet <b>22</b> is configured to overlay the topper <b>21</b> and the top portion of the perimeter <b>18</b>. The coverlet <b>22</b> may be made of any conventionally known coverlet material, such as a polyurethane coated polyester, polyurethane coated nylon, or a combination of one or more layers of these materials.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In use, the trapezoidal configuration of the air cells <b>31</b> nests closely within the confines of the perimeter well <b>25</b>. The angular orientation of the cell end walls <b>35</b> conform to the angular orientation of the deck side walls <b>15</b>. This configuration of the end walls <b>35</b> allows the air cells <b>31</b> to extend nearly to the periphery of the support surface <b>10</b>. This is very different from the prior art support surfaces, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which included a large perimeter area or bolster between the air cells <b>31</b> and the periphery of the support surface due to the generally vertical orientation of the air cell side walls. Hence, the multiple trapezoidal-shaped air cells which form the truncated-triangular shaped core <b>19</b> of the present invention provides a greater amount of patient supporting surface area defined by the air cells <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It should be understood that the core <b>19</b> may not extend along the entire longitudinal length of the support surface <b>10</b>, for example, the foot section of the support surface may be comprised of a foam material, a plurality of different air cells, or other conventionally known materials.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It should also be understood that the walls of the air cells and perimeter are not rigid and therefore the geometric terms used herein are intended to identify general shapes or generalized geometric appearance of objects. Hence, the geometric terms are not intended to be strictly defined in absolute terms, such as perfectly straight walls, surfaces and the like, due to inherent bowing of some materials and the rounding of corners. Similarly, the geometric terms are intended to represent three dimensional shapes in addition to two dimensional shapes, for example, the term trapezoidal also is intended to include an object's thickness rather than simply being planar.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It should also be understood that the number of air cells or the size of each air cell may differ without departure from the teachings herein. Furthermore, each air cell may be comprised of several smaller cells, for example one trapezoidal shaped cell may be formed by a rectangular air cell straddled by two triangular shaped air cells.</p>
