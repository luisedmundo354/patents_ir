<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates generally to the field of image sensors and, more particularly, to such image sensors having continuous flushing of the sensor with a vertical transfer clocking time equal to or greater than its normal operating vertical transfer time.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, a true two phase CCD (charge-coupled device) refers to a device in which there are two physical gates over each pixel, with each gate formed in the silicon under it. In this regard, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there are two-phase voltage lines V<b>1</b> and V<b>2</b>. This charge-coupling concept is used in frame transfer and interline transfer CCD image sensing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As is well known in the art, a CCD <b>1</b> includes a plurality of pixels <b>5</b> for capturing the incident light and converting it into electronic representation. A horizontal shift register <b>10</b> receives the charge passed vertically down from the pixels <b>5</b>, and the shift register <b>10</b> eventually passes them out from the CCD <b>1</b> for further processing. When initiating image capture, the CCD <b>1</b> should be flushed to eliminate undesirable excess charge accumulated during idle periods. In prior art devices, the vertical clocking of the gates during flushing is such that there is a 50% duty cycle in which each clock spends an equal amount of time, t<sub>p</sub>, at the high and low gate voltage. In addition, the rising edge of V<b>1</b> is coincident with the falling edge of V<b>2</b> and vice versa. This provides the condition in which at no time are Vl and V<b>2</b> at the low gate voltages at the same time until the end of flushing. For clarity of understanding, the vertical clocks (not shown) operate continuously for passing the charge via the horizontal shift register <b>10</b> from the CCD <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For thoroughness of understanding and as understood by those skilled in the art, the CCD <b>1</b> may then capture an image during its integration time which is subsequently readout during image readout. The clocking for these cycles are not shown in their entirety, as they are well known in the art, and few exemplary times are shown for clarity of understanding.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a prior art CCD <b>1</b> illustrating its dark field. As illustrated therein, such prior art devices include a non-uniform dark field <b>15</b> such that the outer or peripheral portions have a higher dark field than the central or inner potion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although the presently known CCDs are satisfactory, they include drawbacks. Such prior art devices have high power consumption and require a relatively long latency period before a picture can be captured after pressing the image capture button. This is commonly referred to in the art as picture-taking latency. Further, the prior art CCDs produce non-uniform dark fields which will, in turn, create a non-uniform background for which correction is required.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above. Briefly summarized, according to one aspect of the present invention, the invention relates to a method for reducing shutter latency while maintaining low dark current in the imager and minimizing energy consumption in a digital camera, the method including the steps of (a) providing an imager operating in accumulation mode; and (b) continuous flushing of charges from the imager before capturing an exposure of an image with a time between vertical transfers greater than or equal to time between vertical transfers during normal image readout so that, if continuous flushing for a time necessary to readout all rows of pixels has occurred, the exposure may be captured with substantially zero latency.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, there is shown a two-phase CCD <b>20</b> having a plurality of pixels <b>25</b> of the present invention with its associated clocking scheme. The pixels <b>25</b> are arranged in an array of rows and columns, 4096×4096 in the preferred embodiment for illustrating an exemplary embodiment, although other configurations are obviously also suitable. It is instructive to note that, although a two-phase device is shown, there may be more than two phases as long as the device can be operated in accumulation mode clocking. Accumulation mode is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,115,458, by Burkey et al., titled “Reducing Dark Current In Charge Coupled Devices,” and in “Solid State Imaging with Charge-Coupled Devices,” by Albert J. P. Theuwissen and will not be discussed in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In regard to the operation of the present invention during flushing, the vertical clocking includes clocking V<b>1</b> high for a predetermined time, preferably the minimum time necessary for good vertical transfer efficiency, and V<b>2</b> is clocked high on the falling edge of V<b>1</b> for a predetermined time, also preferably the minimum time necessary for good vertical transfer efficiency. The time the clocks V<b>1</b> and V<b>2</b> are low ranges from equal to or twice the normal operating readout duration for reducing power consumption while retaining minimum dark current. For example, in an Eastman Kodak Company KAF-16801CE sensor, the clocks are preferably clocked high for 10 microseconds. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that different lengths of time that the clock voltages are high will vary according to the specific image sensor. The time the clocks are high is substantially proportional to a square of a width of the CCD.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The horizontal shift register <b>30</b> receives the charges passed as a result of the above clocking and subsequently passes them therefrom for further processing. It is instructive to note that the horizontal clock voltages H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b> are continuously low during flush for further conserving energy. In this case, the horizontal shift register <b>30</b> functions as a drain to continuously drain charge therefrom (as indicated by the arrow) as they are continuously dumped into the shift register <b>30</b>. The horizontal flushing clock voltages H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b> are permitted to go active and start flushing the horizontal register immediately before and during the capture of the image.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">For thoroughness of understanding and as understood by those skilled in the art, the CCD <b>20</b> may then capture an image during its integration or exposure time which is subsequently readout during image readout. The clocking for these cycles are not shown in their entirety, as they are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>, there is shown an alternative embodiment in which fast flushing <b>40</b> (the time between which vertical transfers is minimum) occurs preceding the continuous flush. In this case, the time between vertical transfers is substantially less than the time between vertical transfer during normal image readout.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It facilitates understanding to note that the above-described CCD <b>20</b> creates an exposure that may be captured with substantially zero latency. In summary, the invention includes a method for reducing shutter latency while maintaining low dark current in the imager and minimizing energy consumption in a digital camera. The method includes providing an imager operating in accumulation mode; and continuous flushing of charges from the imager before capturing an exposure of an image with a time between vertical transfers greater than or equal to time between vertical transfers during normal image readout so that, if continuous flushing for a time necessary to readout all rows of pixels has occurred, the exposure may be captured with substantially zero latency after the shutter button has been pressed because the sensor has been completely flushed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown a schematic of the CCD <b>20</b> of the present invention illustrating its substantially uniform dark current as illustrated by its uniform density. This is advantageous because this requires little correction of a captured image, and it also has lower noise in the image.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown a digital camera <b>50</b> for implementing the present invention into a commercially usable embodiment. The CCD <b>20</b> described hereinabove is placed in the digital camera <b>50</b> and functions as the image capture device.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment. However, it will be appreciated that variations and modifications can be effected by a person of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>

<us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement>
<claims id="claims">
<claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001">
<claim-text>1. A method for reducing shutter latency in an imager operating in accumulation mode, wherein the imager comprises an array of pixels arranged in rows and columns with two or more phases per pixel while maintaining low dark current in the imager and minimizing energy consumption, the method comprising the steps of:
<claim-text>(a) transferring excess charge from a row of pixels by setting one vertical clocking voltage operatively connected to one phase of the pixels in a row to a high level when another vertical clocking voltage operatively connected to another phase of the pixels in a row is at a low level and shifting the high level to a low level while shifting the low level to a high level;</claim-text>
<claim-text>(b) setting the vertical clocking voltages to a low level for a time duration selected to be between a minimum time duration that is greater than a time between row transfers during image readout and a maximum time duration of twice the time between row transfers during image readout; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>(c) repeating steps (a) and (b) for a time necessary to readout all rows of pixels such that an exposure may be captured with substantially zero latency.</claim-text>
</claim-text>
</claim>
<claim id="CLM-00002" num="00002">
<claim-text>2. The method as in <claim-ref idref="CLM-00001">claim 1</claim-ref> further comprising horizontal clocking having voltages that are substantially continuously low during the flushing for conserving energy.</claim-text>
</claim>
<claim id="CLM-00003" num="00003">
<claim-text>3. The method as in <claim-ref idref="CLM-00002">claim 2</claim-ref> further comprising providing a horizontal flushing clocking which goes active immediately before capturing an exposure of the image for emptying charge from the horizontal register.</claim-text>
</claim>
<claim id="CLM-00004" num="00004">
<claim-text>4. The method as in <claim-ref idref="CLM-00001">claim 1</claim-ref> further comprising fast flushing, in which the time between transfers of excess charge is minimum and precedes the continuous flushing.</claim-text>
</claim>
<claim id="CLM-00005" num="00005">
<claim-text>5. A camera for reducing shutter latency while maintaining low dark current in the imager and minimizing energy consumption, the camera comprising:
<claim-text>(a) an imager operating in accumulation mode, wherein the imager comprises an array of pixels arranged in rows and columns with two or more phases per pixel; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>(b) two or more vertical clocking voltages each operatively connected to a phase of the pixels in a row and in which one vertical clocking voltage is at a high level when another vertical clocking voltage is at a low level and as the high level is shifted to a low level, the low level is shifted to a high level to transfer a row of excess charge, and after transferring a row of excess charge the two or more vertical clocking voltages are at a low level for a time duration selected to be between a minimum duration that is greater than a time between row transfers during image readout and a maximum duration that is twice the time duration between row transfers during image readout so that, if continuous flushing for a time necessary to readout all rows of pixels has occurred, the exposure may be captured with substantially zero latency.</claim-text>
