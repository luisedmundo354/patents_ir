<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2003-35760, filed on Jun. 3, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an organic electroluminescence device and a method of fabricating the same and, more particularly, to an organic electroluminescence device employing a multi-layered pixel electrode and a method of fabricating the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An organic electroluminescence device may be classified into a bottom-emitting type and a top-emitting type and may also be classified into an active matrix type having a pixel driving circuit in each pixel and a passive matrix type. Where the organic electroluminescence device is a bottom-emitting type, as well as an active matrix type, the pixel driving circuit and various kinds of wiring for applying voltages to the pixel driving circuit may take up space in a pixel, and an aperture ratio may be restricted. Accordingly, in order to improve the aperture ratio, the top-emitting type is introduced.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the top-emitting type organic electroluminescence device, a conductive material having improved reflection characteristics and a suitable work function may be used for a pixel electrode. However, currently there isn't any applicable single material that satisfies such characteristics. Therefore, in order to satisfy the characteristics of the pixel electrode of the top-emitting type organic electroluminescence device, a multi-layered structure is adopted to the pixel electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Korean patent application No. 2000-0058739 discloses an organic electroluminescence device of a top-emitting type. The organic electroluminescence device comprises a substrate, a reflecting plate formed on a top surface of the substrate, a first electrode formed on the top surface of the reflecting plate, an emitting layer formed on a top surface of the first electrode, and a second electrode formed on the emitting layer. Thus, by forming the reflecting plate on the top surface of the substrate, a structure in which the light emitted from the emitting layer is reflected to the opposite direction of the substrate, that is, the top-emitting type organic electroluminescence device is embodied.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a method of fabricating an top-emitting type organic electroluminescence device employing a multi-layered pixel electrode according to the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first pixel electrode film and a second pixel electrode film are successively formed on a substrate <b>10</b>. A photoresist pattern <b>95</b> is formed on the second pixel electrode film. The second pixel electrode film and the first pixel electrode film are etched in turn using the photoresist pattern <b>95</b> as a mask. Subsequently, the photoresist pattern <b>95</b> is removed. Thus, a pixel electrode <b>25</b> consisting of the second pixel electrode <b>22</b> and the first pixel electrode <b>21</b> is formed. Etching the second pixel electrode film and the first pixel electrode film in turn is generally performed by using a wet etching solution, and the photoresist pattern <b>95</b> is removed by using a stripping solution.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the meantime, a galvanic phenomenon occurs when two materials whose electromotive forces are different are simultaneously exposed to an electrolyte solution. As a result, the material having the greater electromotive force is corroded.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In general, since the first pixel electrode <b>21</b> is a reflecting electrode and the second pixel electrode <b>22</b> is a transparent electrode, the pixel electrodes <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> are formed by using different materials. Accordingly, electromotive forces of the pixel electrodes <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> can be different. Consequently, the galvanic phenomenon occurs between the first pixel electrode <b>21</b> and the second pixel electrode <b>22</b> when the first pixel electrode <b>21</b> and the second pixel electrode <b>22</b> are simultaneously exposed to the etching solution or the stripping solution, that is, the electrolyte solution. As a result, an electrode having the greater electromotive force between the second pixel electrode <b>22</b> and the first pixel electrode <b>21</b> is corroded, resulting in a break down of the films of the pixel electrode <b>25</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, the present invention is devised to solve at least the above problem. Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention is to provide an organic electroluminescence device and a fabricating method of the same to prevent a film of the pixel electrode from being broken down by precluding a galvanic phenomenon when forming the pixel electrode.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To explain the present invention more specifically, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the present invention is not restricted by the embodiments described herein but can be embodied in other forms.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the drawings, when a layer lies “on” another layer or a substrate, it is understood that the layer may be formed directly on the other layer or the substrate, or another layer may be interposed between them. Throughout the specification, the same reference numerals represent the same components.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>to <b>2</b><i>e </i>are cross-sectional views for explaining a method of fabricating an organic electroluminescence device employing a two-layered pixel electrode according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, a first pixel electrode film <b>200</b> is formed on a substrate <b>100</b>. In the case of an active matrix organic electroluminescence device, the substrate <b>100</b> may include a thin film transistor (not shown) formed by a conventional method. A first photoresist film may be formed on the first pixel electrode film <b>200</b>, and thereafter the first photoresist film is exposed and developed by using a photomask <b>990</b> so that a first photoresist pattern <b>930</b> is formed. When the first photoresist film is exposed, the exposure may be excessively performed. Thus, not only may a pattern width of the first photoresist pattern <b>930</b> be smaller than a width of a pattern drawn in the photomask <b>990</b>, but a side of the first photoresist pattern <b>930</b> may also be tapered toward its upper part.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>, by etching the first pixel electrode film (<b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>) using the first photoresist pattern <b>930</b> as a mask, a first pixel electrode <b>210</b> is formed. When the first pixel electrode film (<b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>) is etched, the etching may be performed excessively. Thus, a pattern width of the first pixel electrode <b>210</b> can be smaller than a pattern width of the first photoresist pattern <b>930</b>. Moreover, as described above, by making a side of the first photoresist pattern <b>930</b> tapered toward its upper part, a side <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the first pixel electrode <b>210</b> can also be tapered toward its upper part. In other words, an angle of an edge <b>210</b><i>c </i>through which the side <b>210</b><i>a </i>and an upper face <b>210</b><i>b </i>of the first pixel electrode <b>210</b> meet each other may be obtuse. Further, the taper may be dull.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first pixel electrode <b>210</b> may be formed of metal that has excellent reflectivity. According to an embodiment of the invention, the excellent reflectivity means 60% or more reflectivity. The first pixel electrode <b>210</b> may be formed of at least one material selected from a group consisting of aluminum (Al), aluminum alloy, silver (Ag) and silver alloy. Also, the first pixel electrode <b>210</b> may be formed to have thickness of 50 to 300 nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>, on the substrate on which the first pixel electrode <b>210</b> is formed, a second pixel electrode film <b>215</b> may be formed. A second photoresist film is formed on the second pixel electrode film <b>215</b>. Successively, a second photoresist pattern <b>950</b> may be formed by exposing and developing the second photoresist film using the same photomask <b>990</b> as the photomask (<b>990</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>) that exposed the first photoresist film. Unlike the first photoresist pattern (<b>930</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>), the second photoresist pattern <b>950</b> may be formed to have almost the same pattern width as the width of the pattern drawn on the photomask <b>990</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>d</i>, the second pixel electrode film (<b>215</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>) may be etched with a wet etching solution by using the second photoresist pattern <b>950</b> as a mask. Thus, a second pixel electrode <b>220</b> may be formed to entirely cover the first pixel electrode <b>210</b>. Subsequently, a pixel electrode <b>250</b> consisting of the first pixel electrode <b>210</b> and the second pixel electrode <b>220</b> is formed by removing the second photoresist pattern <b>950</b> with a stripping solution.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, in forming the first pixel electrode <b>210</b>, by performing an excessive exposure and an excessive etching, a pattern width of the first pixel electrode <b>210</b> may be formed to be smaller than a pattern width drawn on the photomask (<b>990</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>). A pattern width of the second pixel electrode <b>220</b> may be formed to almost the same as the pattern width drawn on the photomask (<b>990</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>). Consequently, the second pixel electrode <b>220</b> may be formed to entirely cover the first pixel electrode <b>210</b>. Thus, exposure of the first pixel electrode <b>210</b> and the second pixel electrode <b>220</b> simultaneously to a electrolyte solution i.e. the wet etching solution or the stripping solution, can be prevented. Accordingly, the galvanic phenomenon between the first pixel electrode <b>210</b> and the second pixel electrode <b>220</b> can be precluded. As a result, film breakdowns of the pixel electrode <b>250</b> can be lessened or prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Furthermore, in forming the first pixel electrode <b>210</b>, by making the side <b>210</b><i>a </i>tapered toward its upper part, breaking the second pixel electrode <b>220</b> on the edge <b>210</b><i>c </i>of the first pixel electrode <b>210</b> may be prevented. Concurrently, since the first pixel electrode <b>210</b> and the second pixel electrode <b>220</b> may be formed by using the same photomask (<b>990</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>c</i>), a processing cost can be lowered compared with a case of using different photomasks.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the pixel electrode <b>250</b> is an anode, the second pixel electrode <b>220</b> may be formed by using a conductive material that has a work function of 4.5 to 5.8 eV so that a hole injection may be easily performed. Accordingly, the second pixel electrode <b>220</b> may be formed of at least one material selected from a group consisting of indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), nickel (Ni), nickel oxide, platinum (Pt), platinum oxide, gold (Au), gold oxide, iridium (Ir), iridium oxide, chrome (Cr) and chrome oxide. According to an embodiment of the invention, the second pixel electrode <b>220</b> may be formed to have thickness of 1 to 30 nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first pixel electrode <b>210</b> may be comprised of aluminum-neodymium (AlNd), and the second pixel electrode <b>220</b> comprised of indium tin oxide (ITO).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>e</i>, a pixel-defined layer <b>405</b> having an opening <b>405</b><i>a </i>for exposing an upper surface of the second pixel electrode <b>220</b> is formed on the second pixel electrode <b>220</b>. An organic film including at least an organic emitting layer <b>530</b> is formed on the exposed second pixel electrode <b>220</b> and on the pixel-defined layer <b>405</b>. The organic film may further comprise at least one layer selected from a group consisting of a hole injecting layer <b>510</b>, a hole transporting layer <b>520</b>, a hole blocking layer <b>540</b>, an electron transporting layer <b>550</b> and an electron injecting layer <b>560</b>. In order to form the organic film, a conventional method such as a thermal evaporation deposition can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Subsequently, a transparent electrode <b>570</b> may be formed on the organic film, such as to by using a thermal evaporation deposition, a sputtering, etc. Thereafter, the substrate <b>100</b> on which the transparent electrode <b>570</b> is formed is encapsulated. The encapsulation can be fulfilled by attaching an encapsulation plate formed of glass or transparent plastic to the substrate <b>100</b> using adhesives, and by hardening the adhesives using ultraviolet rays or heats. Other encapsulation plate materials, adhesives and adhesive hardening materials may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view for explaining a method of fabricating an organic electroluminescence device employing a three-layered pixel electrode according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The method according to the present embodiment is similar to the method according to the first embodiment except that the pixel electrode has three layers.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a substrate <b>100</b> is provided, and a third pixel electrode <b>206</b> is formed on the substrate <b>100</b>. The third pixel electrode <b>206</b> may be formed to have a side tapered toward its upper part. The first pixel electrode <b>210</b> is formed on the third pixel electrode <b>206</b> to entirely cover the third pixel electrode <b>206</b>. Thus, film breakdown due to the galvanic phenomenon between the third pixel electrode <b>206</b> and the first pixel electrode <b>210</b> can be prevented. Except those described above, the organic electroluminescence device employing the three-layered pixel electrode <b>260</b> may be fabricated in the same method as those described in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The third pixel electrode <b>206</b> may be formed of at least one material selected from a group consisting of indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), nickel (Ni), nickel oxide, platinum (Pt), platinum oxide, gold (Au), gold oxide, iridium (Ir), iridium oxide, chrome (Cr), and chrome oxide. The third pixel electrode <b>206</b> may be formed by using ITO. Alternatively, the third pixel electrode <b>206</b> may be formed by using ITO, the first pixel electrode <b>210</b> formed by using aluminum-neodymium (AlNd), and the second pixel electrode <b>220</b> formed by using indium tin oxide (ITO).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to the present invention as described in detail so far, in forming the multi-layered pixel electrode, the film breakdown due to the galvanic phenomenon is precluded. As a result, defects of the organic electroluminescence device can be decreased, and yield and productivity are improved so that a production cost can be lowered.</p>
