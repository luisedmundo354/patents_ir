<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A fiber optic communication system includes a device of switching and setting wavelength of optical signals used in communication by network-node equipments, which sets the mapping of the wavelength of the optical signal used in communication by the network node equipments, and the input/output ports of an array waveguide grating (AWG), so as to construct a predetermined logical network topology by a plurality of network node equipments which are connected via optical fibers to the array waveguide grating that outputs optical signals inputted to optical input ports, to predetermined optical output ports in accordance with the wavelength thereof. As well as enabling a simple construction, it is easy to realize flexible network design, construction, and operation, and different network groups can also be easily connected to each other. Moreover, a fiber optic communication system having robust security and which can be stably operated even at the time of failure is realized at low cost.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a fiber optic communication system, a wavelength tunable light source unit thereof, a network-node equipment having a wavelength tunable optical receiver unit installed, and a central processing unit and a computer program thereof, that are applied to a geographically-distributed iDC (Internet Data Center) implemented for a local administrative network, and to an IX (Internet exchange) network, and in which, by changing the wavelengths of optical signals used for the connection between network-node equipments, the logical network topology can be easily reconfigured on M network-node equipments (M is an integer no smaller than 2, nor greater than M) that are connected to a uniform-loss and cyclic-frequency (ULCF) arrayed wavelength grating (AWG) having N inputs and N outputs (N is an integer greater than or equal to 2).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, the amount of traffic traveling through fiber optic communication networks has been steadily changing and increasing explosively as is represented by data centers. Moreover, the number of network-node equipments accommodated on a fiber optic communication network and the types of data are becoming various, and it is becoming necessary to dynamically change the network topology, connection configuration, or even traffic capacity. For instance, in the current local public network described in “Proposal for local electronic government synergistic IDC operation for local electronic government implementation” (Chikafumi Shimura, Local management newsletter, vol. 34, June 2001, Nomura Research Institute), there has been a call for: interconnection of municipal networks having different network topologies; installation of additional network-nodes or network-node removal; network topology reconfiguration following organizational integration or organizational expansion; and dynamic implementation of wavelength path reconfiguration in order to bypass failures. Also, there has been a strong call for integration of networks having different network topologies while maintaining their securities, and for superposing and operating networks having different signal formats and operation policies simply and inexpensively. Accordingly a fiber optic communication system has been expected in which connections with any network-node can be selectively established and logical network topologies can be arbitrarily reconfigured, by changing the wavelength of optical signals used for the connection between network nodes, by a wavelength tunable light source unit and a wavelength tunable optical receiver unit installed on network-node equipments in a fiber optic communication network that is physically connected to a uniform-loss and cyclic-frequency (ULCF) arrayed wavelength grating (AWG) in a star-shape via an optical wave guide such as an optical fiber (see also: K. Kato et al, “32×32 full-mesh (1024 path) wavelength-routing WDM network based on uniform-loss cyclic-frequency arrayed-waveguide grating”, Electronics Letters, vol. 36, 1294-1296, 2000).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, in investigations so far, networks are being advanced in which the connection configuration of optical wave guided paths such as optical fibers, which are transmission paths, physically has a ring topology (for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2001-285323, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 7-202845, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2001-184408).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, the network-node equipment disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication Hei 7-202845 is constructed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4-37</figref>. An optical splitter (<b>4</b>-<b>1</b>) is one which splits an input optical signal into two regardless of its wavelength. An optical signal having eight wavelengths which is transmitted through the optical fiber is input thereto, and signals are output to an optical filter <b>4</b>-<b>2</b>, a fixed-wavelength receiver unit A (<b>4</b>-<b>4</b>), and a fixed-wavelength receiver unit B (<b>4</b>-<b>11</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The optical filter <b>4</b>-<b>2</b> has a function of intercepting from among the optical signals of eight wavelengths outputted from the optical splitter <b>4</b>-<b>1</b>, two wavelengths, λs (short wavelength) and λe (long wavelength) that the network terminal transmits and receives, and transmitting the other wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An optical combiner <b>4</b>-<b>3</b> combines the optical signals of six wavelengths transmitted from the optical filter <b>4</b>-<b>2</b> and optical signals of two wavelengths (λs, λe) outputted from a wavelength tunable transponder unit A (<b>4</b>-<b>7</b>) and a wavelength tunable transponder unit B<b>14</b>, and transmits them to optical fibers (not shown). The optical signals transmitted are inputted to the optical splitter <b>1</b> of the neighboring network-node equipment via an optical fiber (not shown in the diagram).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The fixed-wavelength receiver unit A (<b>4</b>-<b>4</b>) comprises a fixed-wavelength optical filter and a photodetector, and has a function of receiving only the optical signal of wavelength λs from among the optical signals of two wavelengths (λs, λe) outputted from the optical splitter <b>4</b>-<b>1</b>, and converting the signal into an electrical signal. Similarly, the fixed-wavelength receiver unit B (<b>4</b>-<b>11</b>) receives only the optical signal of wavelength λe, and converts it into an electrical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Selectors A and B (<b>4</b>-<b>5</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>12</b>) respectively reference received destination information assigned to the received data, and output the received data to a data processing module if the received data is addressed to the own network-node equipment. Also, if the received data is not addressed to the own network-node equipment and is to be relayed, the received data is outputted to a predetermined dual port memory of memory units A and B according to the received destination information.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Memory units A and B (<b>4</b>-<b>6</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>13</b>) have two dual port memories for data that specifies the wavelength of launched optical signal for every wavelength of launched optical signal, and one dual port memory for the data that does not specify the wavelength of launched optical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The wavelength tunable transponder units A and B (<b>4</b>-<b>7</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>14</b>) have a function to convert the transmitted data into an optical signal and transmit it with two respective wavelengths: wavelength λs and wavelength λe. The wavelength tunable transponder unit A (<b>4</b>-<b>7</b>) is paired with the fixed-wavelength receiver unit A, and the wavelength tunable transponder unit <b>4</b>-<b>14</b> is paired with the fixed-wavelength receiver unit B (<b>4</b>-<b>11</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A data processing module <b>4</b>-<b>8</b> of the network-node equipment performs the requested process for the data transmitted from other network-node equipment while performing processes such as assigning received destination information for the data that is to be transmitted from the own network-node equipment to another network-node equipment, and outputs the data to the memory unit A (<b>4</b>-<b>6</b>) or the memory unit B (<b>4</b>-<b>13</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An end of transmission detection unit <b>4</b>-<b>9</b> detects the transmission end of the data stored in each of the dual port memories of the memory unit A (<b>4</b>-<b>6</b>) and the memory unit B (<b>4</b>-<b>13</b>), and outputs a wavelength switch signal to a wavelength controlling unit <b>4</b>-<b>10</b>. The wavelength controlling unit <b>4</b>-<b>10</b> controls the oscillating wavelengths used for the wavelength tunable transponder units A and B to be λs and λe, by regulating the injection current of a tunable laser diode (hereunder referred to as TLD), which is described later.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, when designing a network or changing a network configuration, although there are methods for configuring a plurality of different virtual LANs (VLAN) as different respective logical network topologies in the reconfiguration of logical network topologies, in the installation of a new network-node equipment or removal of network-node equipment, and in the reconfiguration of a logical network topology in order to circumvent failure, there is complexity in each of the various kinds of settings, and a few months to six months is required for the construction. Also these operations have required a lot of work and there has been the problem of the risk of network collapse and so forth caused by human error. Moreover, although it has been possible, by using technology such as traffic engineering (TE) that is capable of selecting routes. according to the amount of traffic, to reconfigure the logical network-topology according to the load on the network, cases in which the amount of traffic exceeds expected traffic are conceivable, such as distributing live concert video images or providing information in a time of disaster, and the complexity of network setting operations and the problems in stable network operation still remain for the present technology. Moreover cases in which it has been necessary to review and reconfigure the physical network topology that have been determined according to the connection configuration of optical fibers have not been few.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Also, the same is true even with reconfiguration of logical network topology using wavelength path by wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology, and this operation also requires work, and dynamic and quick reconfiguration of a logical network topology has been comparatively difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">When automatizing in order to treat these problems, although a collective management method by central-management-equipment or a method of assigning a setting to each individual equipment are common, in the former method, since multiple control information is required to control the wavelength tunable light source and wavelength tunable filter that are provided for the network-node equipments, then when performing network topology reconfiguration, the number of network-node equipments and the load on the central-management-equipment increase, and fast topology reconfiguration has been made difficult. Moreover, in the latter method, since settings for the wavelength tunable light source and the wavelength tunable filter need to be assigned separately to different network-node equipments, the load on the network administrator has increased in initial network configuration or in network reconfiguration when changing the network topology.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, in the network system described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No Hei 7-202845 mentioned above, in which a management method is explained, a network-node equipment autonomously performs controls related to search and determination of the wavelength of optical signals used for connection with other network-node equipments. However the two wavelengths to be used are not regulated to be just two successive adjacent wavelengths, and when the case of connections with many network-node equipments using more than two wavelengths is considered, there is concern of an increase in processing time required for the data processing module in the network-node equipment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4-34</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, in actual fiber optic communication systems, topology reconfiguration needs to be performed promptly according to changes in traffic pattern or efficient network usage, and in terms of stable network operation it is preferable not to require a long time from the start of the topology reconfiguration to its completion, and it has been desirable that high-speed topology reconfiguration be made possible.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In view of the problems mentioned above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a logical topology reconfigurable optical network system, a central-management-equipment, and a wavelength tunable light source unit thereof, and a network-node equipment into which is installed a wavelength tunable optical receiver unit and a computer program thereof, which are applicable to a geographically-distributed iDC (Internet Data Center) implemented for a local administrative network and to an IX (Internet exchange) network, and in which, installation and utilization of the logical topology reconfigurable optical network system, which is realized with a wavelength path routing function of an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) and wavelength tunable light sources mounted on network-node equipments that are physically connected to the AWG in a star shape via optical waveguides such as optical fibers, can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Moreover it is an object to provide an actual fiber optic communication system in which clock time synchronization of all network-node equipments can be performed by a central-management-equipment, and wavelength information for forwarding data signals and wavelength information for receiving data signals required for logical network topology reconfiguration, are transmitted along with trigger time information for logical topology reconfiguration from the central-management-equipment to network-node equipments, and in which network-node equipments can autonomously change wavelengths of launched optical signals and receiving optical signals at high speed when the reconfiguring time of the logical network topology is reached.</p>

<p id="p-0274" num="0273">A second embodiment according to the fiber optic communication system of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-8</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-10</figref>. In the present embodiment, the characteristics of the present invention are described in detail, taking as an example a method of extending the fiber optic communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">The second embodiment is a case where a simple physical star-shaped network topology configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-8</figref> is realized on a small scale. Here, a case is shown in which five base stations <b>1</b>-<b>402</b>A to <b>1</b>-<b>406</b>A provided with network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>402</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>406</b> are connected to a center base station <b>1</b>-<b>401</b>A having the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) <b>1</b>-<b>101</b> described in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-9</figref> shows the physical network configuration when the network configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-8</figref> is extended and the number of network-node equipments is increased, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-10</figref> shows the configuration of the logical network topology in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">The fiber optic communication network shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-9</figref> is an example providing extended base stations <b>1</b>-<b>407</b>A to <b>1</b>-<b>418</b>A having network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>407</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>418</b> that are connected to the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) <b>1</b>-<b>101</b> of the center base station <b>1</b>-<b>401</b> A. Also, in the fiber optic communication network shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-9</figref>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-10</figref>: a ring-shaped logical network topology is configured with base stations <b>1</b>-<b>401</b>A and <b>1</b>-<b>402</b>A and extended base stations <b>1</b>-<b>407</b>A and <b>1</b>-<b>408</b>A; a star-shaped logical network topology is configured with base stations <b>1</b>-<b>401</b>A and <b>1</b>-<b>406</b>A and extended base stations <b>1</b>-<b>413</b>A to <b>1</b>-<b>416</b>A; a ring-shaped logical network topology is configured with base stations <b>1</b>-<b>401</b>A and <b>1</b>-<b>405</b>A and extended base stations <b>1</b>-<b>409</b>A to <b>1</b>-<b>412</b>A; and a star-shaped logical network topology is configured with base stations <b>1</b>-<b>401</b>A, <b>1</b>-<b>403</b>A and <b>1</b>-<b>404</b>A and extended base stations <b>1</b>-<b>417</b>A and <b>1</b>-<b>418</b>A. Furthermore, a star-shaped (mesh-shaped) logical network topology is configured with base stations <b>1</b>-<b>401</b>A and <b>1</b>-<b>405</b>A and extended base stations <b>1</b>-<b>412</b>A and <b>1</b>-<b>418</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">When actually configuring a network, a large-scale network such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-9</figref> is not usually constructed in the initial stage of network construction, and it is usual to expand the scale of the network step by step from a network configuration such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-8</figref>, by expansion of the scale of the network while the network is operating. In the second embodiment, taking the scale of the number of optical input/output ports of the arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG) <b>1</b>-<b>101</b> disposed in the center as an upper limit, according to the network configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-8</figref>, when extending, by connecting the network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>407</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>418</b> to the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) <b>1</b>-<b>101</b> via optical fibers to establish additional extended base stations <b>1</b>-<b>407</b>A to <b>1</b>-<b>418</b>A, the size of the network can be easily upscaled without interrupting or stopping the communication status of the network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>401</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>406</b> that have already been established.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Furthermore, since not only a star-shaped (mesh-shaped) logical network topology but also a ring-shaped logical network topology can be easily configured in the network configuration of the present embodiment as shown in the first embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-1</figref>) above, a fiber optic communication system can be constructed in which different logical network topologies such as a mesh-shaped one, a star-shaped one, and a ring-shaped one coexist on the same star-shaped physical star network topology, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">In the present configuration, since the network-node equipments that are to be connection destinations can be selected simply by changing the wavelengths of the optical signals that each of the network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>401</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>418</b> transmit and receive, then when reconfiguring a logical network topology, reconnection of optical fibers in the initial physical network configuration does not require a long time and high-cost construction work is not required, so that the logical network topology can be reconfigured extremely easily in a short period of time at low cost. Moreover, the logical network topology may also be reconfigured by changing the wavelength allocation of the optical input/output ports in the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) <b>1</b>-<b>101</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0282" num="0281">Specifically, data centers <b>1</b>-<b>701</b>A to <b>1</b>-<b>705</b>A provided with network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>705</b> are connected via optical fibers to a center base station <b>1</b>-<b>101</b> A provided with the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) <b>1</b>-<b>101</b>, and base stations <b>1</b>-<b>706</b>A to <b>1</b>-<b>713</b>A provided with network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>706</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>713</b> are connected via optical fibers to the center base station <b>1</b>-<b>101</b>A.</p>

Moreover, the network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>706</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>709</b> form a RPR (Resilient Packet Ring) network <b>1</b>-<b>723</b> (ring-shaped logical network topology), and the network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>710</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>713</b> form an ether network <b>1</b>-<b>724</b> (star-shaped logical topology), and then an inter-building connection network <b>1</b>-<b>725</b> created by point-to-point connection in a simple star-shaped configuration is formed between the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>707</b> and the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>713</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">As described in the first and second embodiments above, the present embodiment is characterized not only in that the logical network topology can combine a star-shaped (mesh-shaped) logical network topology and a ring-shaped logical network topology despite being a simple star-shaped physical network topology such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-11</figref>, but also in that MPLS (Multi-protocol Label Switching), which is widely known as a routing control method, and a networking technology called RPR (Resilient Packet Ring), which is known as a system that realizes a high-speed method of circumventing failures, can be superposed, and a network in which the network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>705</b> of the data centers <b>1</b>-<b>701</b>A to <b>1</b>-<b>705</b>A are distributed, and an extremely stable and highly secured network such as Internet exchange (IX), can be constructed in an extremely simple manner in a short period of time at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-14</figref>, node numbers <b>1</b> to <b>16</b> denote port numbers of the optical input/output ports of the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) <b>1</b>-<b>101</b>, and in the present embodiment, the respective optical input/output ports having each of node numbers <b>1</b> to <b>13</b> are connected to the network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>713</b>, and the wavelength allocation of optical signals for each of the network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>713</b> is set.

<p id="p-0292" num="0291">In the present embodiment, the logical network configuration and the wavelength allocations of each network-node equipment are described in the case where the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>707</b>, which was accommodated in the ring-shaped logical network topology into which the network-node equipment <b>714</b> was inserted, is newly transferred and established in the star-shaped logical network topology that attributes to the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>710</b>, and the logical topology is reconfigured.

<p id="p-0293" num="0292">Thus, as with the above mentioned embodiment, by simply changing the wavelength allocations of the optical signals used for communication, the logical network topology can be dynamically changed.

Moreover the wavelength allocation of optical signals at each of network-node terminals <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>704</b> has been set.

Moreover, each of the MAC<b>1</b>-<b>700</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b>-<b>700</b><i>c </i>is provided with a function of transmitting back a received signal.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">Also, since the wavelength allocations of the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) <b>1</b>-<b>101</b> are set as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-20</figref>, two-way communication is performed between the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> and the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>702</b> using an optical signal of wavelength λ<b>2</b>, two-way communication is performed between the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>702</b> and the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>703</b> using an optical signal of wavelength λ<b>4</b>, two-way communication is performed between the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>703</b> and the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>704</b> using an optical signal of wavelength λ<b>2</b>, and two-way communication is performed between the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>704</b> and the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> using an optical signal of wavelength λ<b>4</b>.

Also, although the wavelength allocation shown here is for a case where the AWG disposed as the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) <b>1</b>-<b>101</b> disposed at the center is of a 4×4 scale, of course this scale is not limited to 4×4, and needs only to be greater than the capacity size of the network-node equipment.</p>

<p id="p-0300" num="0299">In this case, as the logical network topology in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-22</figref> shows, by respectively turning back the communication that has been performed between the network-node equipment <b>1701</b> and the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>702</b>, and between the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> and the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>704</b> at each of the network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>702</b> and <b>1</b>-<b>704</b> after the optical fiber connecting the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> and the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) has been cut, an optical fiber disconnection failure can be bypassed. Specifically, when the optical fiber that physically connects the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> and the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) <b>1</b>-<b>101</b> is disconnected, the communication in the network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>702</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>704</b> can be maintained by turning back and transmitting the signal received from the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>703</b> to the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>703</b> by the MAC <b>1</b>-<b>700</b><i>c </i>of the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>702</b>, and turning back and transmitting the signal received from the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>703</b> to the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>703</b> by the MAC <b>1</b>-<b>700</b><i>b </i>of the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>704</b>.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Sixth Embodiment PART TWO</heading>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">With the above-mentioned ring-shaped logical network topology, in the method of recovering a network when a failure occurs due to optical fiber disconnection or breakdown of the network-node equipment, a new ring-shaped logical network topology can be reconfigured in the present fiber optic communication system to bypass the network-node equipment experiencing the failure. However, when there are more than 5 network node equipments there are a plurality of bypass routes when a failure occurs, and it is possible to construct a network that is very resilient to failures even when the number of network node equipments increases. An embodiment in which the number of network-node equipments is five is described here.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">As shown in FIG. <b>1</b>-<b>23</b>.<b>1</b>, in the optical signal route and wavelength allocations, in a ring-shaped logical network topology configured so that five network-node, equipments <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> to <b>1</b>-<b>705</b> are connected via optical fibers to a 5×5 arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) having respectively five optical input/output ports, when the optical fiber connected to the network-node equipment <b>5</b> (<b>1</b>-<b>705</b>) is disconnected, the network-node equipment <b>1</b> (<b>1</b>-<b>701</b>) bypasses the network-node equipment <b>5</b> (<b>1</b>-<b>705</b>) experiencing the failure and configures a new route for optical signals on the network-node equipment <b>4</b> (<b>1</b>-<b>704</b>). Hence it becomes possible to configure a ring-shaped logical network topology of, “network-node equipment <b>1</b> (<b>1</b>-<b>701</b>)→network-node equipment <b>2</b> (<b>1</b>-<b>702</b>)→network-node equipment <b>3</b> (<b>1</b>-<b>703</b>)→network-node equipment <b>4</b> (<b>1</b>-<b>704</b>)→network-node equipment <b>1</b> (<b>1</b>-<b>701</b>)”. FIG. <b>1</b>-<b>23</b>.<b>2</b> shows the route and the wavelength allocations of the optical signals at this time. On the other hand, since the network-node equipment <b>1</b> is able to configure a route between other network-node equipments and itself by changing the wavelengths of optical signals, and since other network-node equipments are also able to configure arbitrary routes in the same way, the ring-shaped logical network topology that can be reconfigured is not limited to the alternate route that bypasses the network-node experiencing the failure, and a ring-shaped logical network topology that has a geometrical ring shaped route can be reconfigured. FIG. <b>1</b>-<b>23</b>.<b>3</b> shows a ring-shaped logical network topology configured with the route of optical signals, “network-node equipment <b>1</b> (<b>1</b>-<b>701</b>)→network-node equipment <b>3</b> (<b>1</b>-<b>703</b>)→network-node equipment <b>4</b> (<b>1</b>-<b>704</b>)→network-node equipment <b>2</b> (<b>1</b>-<b>702</b>)→network-node equipment <b>1</b> (<b>1</b>-<b>701</b>)”, and the wavelength allocations at this time. In this way, since a plurality of bypassing routes exist in the ring-shaped logical network topology even when the number of network-node equipments has increased, the recovery of the network at the time of failure can be performed quickly and stably.</p>

<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Tenth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">Next is a description of a tenth embodiment according to the fiber optic communication system of the present invention, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-28</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-28</figref>, the same reference symbols are used for components the same as those in the ninth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-27</figref>, and description thereof is omitted.

<p id="p-0339" num="0338">In this manner, by using the transmitters <b>1</b>-<b>901</b> to <b>908</b> which have wavelength tunable light sources, in the case of constructing the ring-shaped logical network topology, it is possible to tune the wavelengths of the optical signals so as to avoid failure, by skipping (jumping) the network-node equipment which became incommunicable due to the failure occurrence. Similar effects may be also obtained by using multi-wavelength light source arrays instead of wavelength tunable light sources.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Eleventh Embodiment</heading>

<p id="p-0341" num="0340">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-29</figref> and <b>1</b>-<b>30</b>, the same reference symbols are used for components the same as those in the sixth embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-19</figref> and <b>1</b>-<b>20</b>, and description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">Similarly to the sixth embodiment, the present embodiment has a wavelength arrangement having the ring-shaped logical network topology, being a network structure containing four network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> to <b>704</b> where signals travel around all of the network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> to <b>704</b>. In the present embodiment, a feature is that optical signals are transmitted in a single direction or in both directions. The transmitting wavelength is selected by the wavelength tunable light sources arranged in the respective network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> to <b>704</b> so as to transmit from the network-node equipment immediately prior to the failure point, to the next network-node equipment by skipping (jumping) the failure network-node equipment, with respect to a failure such as a disconnection of a specific optical fiber or a failure of a specific network-node equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-29</figref>, in the case where between the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> and the arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) <b>1</b>-<b>101</b> becomes incommunicable, that is between the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> and the network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>702</b> and <b>1</b>-<b>704</b> in the ring-shaped logical network topology, then as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-30</figref>, the wavelength of the optical signal used for communicating with the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> is replaced by the wavelength λ<b>1</b> in the respective network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>702</b> and <b>1</b>-<b>704</b> so as to skip (jump) the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>701</b>, enabling formation of a ring-shaped logical network topology which ensures the communication between the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>702</b> and the network-node equipment <b>1</b>-<b>704</b>. Therefore, in the case of failure occurrence, the ring-shaped logical network topology between communicable network-node equipments can be ensured and the communication can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">When a failure such as the above occurs, it is easily possible to detect the failure and automatically switch the wavelength of the optical signal. By automatically switching the wavelength of the optical signal in this manner, the failure can be dealt with when it occurs, stably at high speed.</p>

<p id="p-0345" num="0344">Next is a description of a twelfth embodiment according to the fiber optic communication system of the present invention, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-31</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-31</figref> shows a physical network topology of the fiber optic communication system in the twelfth embodiment, and the structure thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">The system of the twelfth embodiment is a system where transmitters <b>1</b>-<b>901</b> to <b>904</b> having wavelength tunable light sources, are provided instead of the transmitters <b>1</b>-<b>1101</b> to <b>1104</b> in the abovementioned seventh embodiment, and wavelength tunable filters <b>1</b>-<b>1501</b> to <b>1504</b> are provided between the receivers <b>1</b>-<b>1201</b> to <b>1204</b> and the non-reciprocal optical circuits (optical circulators) <b>1</b>-<b>1001</b> to <b>1004</b>. Here as an example is a description of a case where four network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> to <b>704</b> are connected by single cored optical fibers <b>801</b> to <b>804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">In the respective network-node equipments <b>1</b>-<b>701</b> to <b>704</b>, there are arranged transmitters <b>1</b>-<b>901</b> to <b>904</b> which have wavelength tunable light sources for transmitting signals toward the desired network-node equipment, and wavelength tunable filters <b>1</b>-<b>1501</b> to <b>1504</b> for selecting the optical signal of one wavelength among optical signals of various wavelengths transmitted from other network-node equipments.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">In this example, the example is shown where a pair of receiver <b>1</b>-<b>1201</b> to <b>1204</b> and the wavelength tunable filter <b>1</b>-<b>1501</b> to <b>1504</b> are contained in the respective network-node equipments one-to-one. Of course a plurality of pairs of receivers and wavelength tunable filters may be arranged so as to receive optical signals of a plurality of wavelengths, at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">In the case of modifying the logical network topology, or in the case of adding the network-node equipment, it is necessary to change the wavelength of the light source for transmission in the network-node equipment associated with transmission and reception from and to the network-node equipment. However at the same time it is also necessary to select many wavelengths to be received on the reception side. Therefore, by installing wavelength tunable filters corresponding to the wavelengths received, there is no need to arrange receivers over and above what is needed, thus being economically superior.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">In this embodiment, the case of a single path using single cored optical fibers was described, however a case of using a redundant structure or a double cored optical fibers is similar.

Therefore, in the present fiber optic communication system, information regarding wavelength change and change time are transmitted to the network-node equipment control unit <b>4</b>-<b>1102</b> along with the control signal in advance as described later, and when it reaches the change time, the network-node equipment control unit <b>4</b>-<b>1102</b> changes the wavelengths of the wavelength tunable light sources <b>4</b>-<b>1304</b> to <b>1306</b> and the wavelength tunable filters <b>4</b>-<b>1404</b> to <b>1406</b> autonomously.

<p id="p-0568" num="0567">Clock-time is supplied to the system clock <b>4</b>-<b>2402</b> based on the information of clock time received by the clock time controlling unit <b>4</b>-<b>2102</b>, and as a result, the clock times of the system clock <b>4</b>-<b>2603</b> located in the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b> and the system clock <b>4</b>-<b>2402</b> located in the network-node equipment control unit <b>4</b>-<b>1102</b> are synchronized. Here, the present embodiment describes the clock time controlling unit <b>4</b>-<b>2602</b> located in the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b> as a clock-time distributing server, and the clock time controlling unit <b>4</b>-<b>2102</b> located in the network-node equipment control unit <b>4</b>-<b>1102</b> as a clock-time querying and receiving client.

<p id="p-0573" num="0572">Subsequently, the person, being the topology administrator, performs step S<b>5</b><i>c</i>, “input wavelength path between network-node equipment required for new topology configuration”, for inputting the new reconfigured wavelength path to connect between the network-node equipments, being the topology reconfiguration, for P network-node equipments, being objects to be reconfigured, via the topology administrator console <b>2609</b> (S<b>4</b><i>c</i>, S<b>6</b><i>c</i>, S<b>7</b><i>c</i>, S<b>8</b><i>c </i>and S<b>9</b><i>c</i>). However, at this time, step S<b>6</b><i>c </i>is included for comparing with the wavelength resource information obtained in step S<b>2</b><i>c</i>, “network-node equipment wavelength resource information collecting process”, and in the case where the wavelength resource required to form the new wavelength path that the topology administrator inputs does not exist, step S<b>7</b><i>c</i>, “error message display to the topology administrator console” is performed. Thus it is possible to attract the attention of the topology administrator. The determination in step S<b>6</b><i>c </i>is made with reference to a wavelength allocation table <b>4</b>-<b>9000</b> (wavelength allocation table is described later) stored in a database of topology mapping with wavelength <b>6006</b> described later.</p>
<p id="p-0574" num="0573">In the case where a new topology type for all pieces of the network-node equipment is selected in step S<b>2</b>.<b>2</b><i>c</i>, the new topology type is input in step S<b>3</b>.<b>1</b><i>c </i>for each of N network-node equipments, being objects to be reconfigured (S<b>4</b>.<b>1</b><i>c</i>, S<b>6</b>.<b>1</b><i>c</i>, S<b>7</b>.<b>1</b><i>c</i>, S<b>8</b>.<b>1</b><i>c </i>and S<b>9</b><i>c</i>).

<p id="p-0576" num="0575">Furthermore, subsequently, in a step “specify topology reconfiguration clock-time” (S<b>9</b><i>c</i>), the person, being the topology administrator, inputs the scheduled topology reconfiguration clock-time (t=T), and the input of information regarding the topology reconfiguration terminates.</p>
<p id="p-0577" num="0576">The new wavelength information for the network-node equipment whose topology is to be reconfigured, and the time at which the topology is to be reconfigured, are created and made into a class hierarchy in the central management equipment in step S<b>11</b><i>c</i>, and are transmitted from the central management equipment to the network-node equipment in step S<b>12</b><i>c</i>.

<p id="p-0578" num="0577">When a network-node equipment that is not an object whose topology is to be reconfigured, is connected to a network-node equipment whose topology is scheduled to be reconfigured, depending on the method in which the network-terminal equipment connected to the concerned piece of network-node equipment whose topology is not to be reconfigured is used, it can be considered that the network-node equipment, in which topology reconfiguration accompanying an update of the path information stored in the network-terminal equipment is not to be performed, is disconnected. Accordingly, network-node equipment in which topology reconfiguration is not to be performed is informed of the topology reconfiguration operation. Therefore, for a network-node equipment “j” (where j is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to K, where K=N-P), step S<b>17</b><i>c </i>“send advance notification message of topology reconfiguration to the piece of network-node equipment ‘j’”, is performed, and in steps S<b>17</b><i>c</i>, S<b>18</b><i>c </i>and S<b>19</b><i>c</i>, a message is transmitted to the network-node equipment whose topology is not to be reconfigured. The network-node equipment receiving the present message can transmit a Keep Alive signal for maintaining connectivity to the network-terminal equipment connected to the concerned network-node equipment. Thus it is possible to maintain connectivity of the concerned network-node equipment before and after topology reconfiguration.</p>
<p id="p-0579" num="0578">The network-node equipments whose topology is to be reconfigured, which have received the aforementioned class hierarchy, transmit a message that the aforementioned class reception is completed to the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b>.

<p id="p-0581" num="0580">Firstly, in step S<b>1</b><i>n </i>“clock time synchronization with central management equipment”, a process is performed to synchronize the clock-times of the system clock <b>2402</b> located in the network-node equipment control unit <b>4</b>-<b>1102</b> and the system clock <b>4</b>-<b>2603</b> in the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b>.

<p id="p-0583" num="0582">When the scheduled topology reconfiguration clock-time (T) is reached, a wavelength setup changing process of the wavelength tunable light source and the wavelength tunable filter is performed in steps S<b>7</b><i>n </i>and S<b>8</b><i>n</i>. In steps S<b>7</b><i>n </i>and S<b>8</b><i>n</i>, step S<b>11</b><i>n </i>is performed to determine whether the wavelength change is for a wavelength path that has been used or not, and in the case where the change is for an existing wavelength path, in step S<b>12</b><i>n </i>a wavelength tunable light source output stop process is performed by the wavelength controlling unit <b>4</b>-<b>2002</b>, then step S<b>13</b><i>n </i>is performed to read the new wavelength information stored in the memory unit <b>4</b>-<b>2302</b> by the wavelength controlling unit <b>4</b>-<b>2002</b>. Alternatively, step S<b>13</b><i>n </i>is performed after step S<b>11</b><i>n </i>in the case of a change to a new, unused wavelength path for a wavelength tunable light source before topology reconfiguration, after being determined by step S<b>11</b><i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0584" num="0583">After step S<b>13</b><i>n </i>is performed, a wavelength tunable light source wavelength and wavelength tunable filter change process by the wavelength controlling unit <b>4</b>-<b>2002</b> is performed in steps S<b>14</b><i>n </i>and S<b>15</b><i>n</i>, and subsequently step S<b>16</b><i>n </i>is performed to start the output of the wavelength tunable light source after the reconfiguration.

<p id="p-0613" num="0612"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4-28</figref> is a diagram showing the flow of authentication messages exchanged between network-node equipment administrator consoles <b>4</b>-<b>2705</b> to <b>2708</b>, and an authentication unit <b>4</b>-<b>2610</b>, provided in the network-node equipment <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b> to <b>2504</b>, and the flow of sessions between the authentication unit <b>4</b>-<b>2610</b> and an authentication database <b>2611</b>. The authentication message as shown in the present figure is delivered to an administrator authentication unit <b>4</b>-<b>2610</b>, which functions as a LDAP server using an authentication protocol (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol: LDAP).</p>
<p id="p-0614" num="0613">The administrator authentication unit <b>4</b>-<b>2610</b> performs query sessions <b>4</b>-<b>12001</b> and <b>12002</b> for querying the database <b>4</b>-<b>2611</b> in which information required for authentication of the network-node equipment administrator is stored, determines whether topology reconfiguration is authorized or not, and returns the results to the network-node equipment administrator consoles <b>4</b>-<b>2705</b> to <b>2708</b>.

<p id="p-0615" num="0614"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4-29</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4-31</figref> show flow charts of computer processing showing the operation of a topology controlling agent described later, stored in the memory units <b>4</b>-<b>2301</b> to <b>2304</b> located in the network-node equipment control units <b>4</b>-<b>1101</b> to <b>1104</b> provided in the network-node equipment <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b> to <b>2504</b>. In the present embodiment, since topology reconfiguration may be performed by a person, being a network-node equipment administrator of any of the network-node equipments <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b> to <b>2504</b>, then in the case where topology reconfiguration is delivered to the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b> at the same time from different network-node equipments <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b> to <b>2504</b>, contention control is required. In the present embodiment, in order to realize this control, the statuses of the network-node equipment <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b> to <b>2504</b> are defined by three bits, and comparison of the bit information is performed by the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b>. Here, the process of clock-time synchronization (Sn<b>1</b>) with the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b>, and the wavelength resource information transmission process (S<b>2</b><i>n</i>), are performed similarly to the thirty-fifth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0616" num="0615">Furthermore, when a person, being a network-node equipment administrator of a specific network-node equipment <b>4</b>-<b>2502</b> (here, it is network-node equipment <b>4</b>-<b>2502</b>, but any network-node equipment is possible) performs topology reconfiguration, status bits “000”, which are initialized in step S<b>20</b><i>n </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4-29</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4-31</figref>, are reconfigured to topology reconfiguration reserved status bits “001” in step S<b>23</b><i>n</i>. Then in the subsequent step S<b>24</b><i>n</i>, the status bits “001” are transmitted to the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b> and the other network-node equipments <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b>, <b>2503</b> and <b>2504</b>, and furthermore, it is confirmed whether “001” is duplicated in the status bits of the other network-node equipments <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b>, <b>2503</b> and <b>2504</b> or not in step S<b>25</b><i>c</i>. Thus an operation is performed to avoid contention with topology reconfiguration operations by persons, being the network-node equipment administrators, of the other network-node equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0617" num="0616">After it is determined to be “yes”, being no contention in step S<b>25</b><i>n</i>, it is now possible in step S<b>26</b><i>n </i>to change the paths between network-node equipment, and input a new path, or input a new topology type for all of the network-node equipments, required for the new topology structure.</p>
<p id="p-0618" num="0617">In step S<b>26</b><i>n</i>, path input information is delivered to the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b> after the path input, and at the same time, in the subsequent step S<b>27</b><i>n</i>, it is confirmed by the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b> whether the wavelength resource required for the path change to the new path exists. When there is no problem in the confirmation of wavelength resource, it is possible to input the topology reconfiguration clock-time in the network-node equipment in step S<b>28</b><i>n</i>. At this time, a “topology reconfiguration confirmation” message is transmitted to the other network-node equipments <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b>, <b>2503</b> and <b>2504</b> in step S<b>29</b><i>n</i>. This is aimed at preventing the other network-node equipments <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b>, <b>2503</b> and <b>2504</b> from performing forced topology reconfiguration using the network-node <b>4</b>-<b>2502</b>, and the topology reconfiguration is rejected in a flow chart described later.</p>
<p id="p-0619" num="0618">After the series of flow described above, the message is delivered from the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b> to the network-node equipments <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b> through <b>2504</b>. However, the content is determined in steps S<b>34</b><i>n </i>and S<b>35</b><i>n</i>, and in the case where the network-node equipments <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b> through <b>2504</b> determine that it is a “wavelength change information and change time class” message from the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b>, the network-node equipment control unit <b>4</b>-<b>1102</b> validates its status bits in step S<b>43</b><i>n</i>. In the case of “yes”, the network-node equipment status bits are changed to “100” in step S<b>44</b><i>n</i>, the status bits are transmitted to the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b> in step S<b>45</b><i>n</i>, and control proceeds to step S<b>46</b><i>n </i>for wavelength change.</p>
<p id="p-0620" num="0619">On the other hand, when topology reconfiguration is performed by a person, being the network-node equipment administrator of the network-node equipment <b>4</b>-<b>2502</b>, it is not desirable to the actual operation of the network, for the topology of the other network-node <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b>, <b>2503</b> and <b>2504</b>, having connectivity with the network-node equipment <b>4</b>-<b>2502</b>, to be reconfigured by force. Accordingly, it is necessary to perform processing for determining whether to accept or reject topology reconfiguration in the other network-node <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b>, <b>2503</b> and <b>2504</b>. In the case where an “advance notification of topology reconfiguration message” M<b>2</b> is received, the reception content is determined in step S<b>35</b><i>n</i>, and subsequently it is determined whether topology reconfiguration is approved by the other network-node <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b>, <b>2503</b> and <b>2504</b>. In the case of approval, the network-node equipment status bits are changed to “010” in step S<b>38</b><i>n</i>, the bits are transmitted to the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b> in step S<b>39</b><i>n</i>, and subsequently a signal is awaited from the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b>. When a new signal is received during this wait, and the signal is determined in step S<b>35</b><i>n </i>to be a wavelength change information and change time class from the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b>, the network-node equipment control unit <b>1102</b> validates its status bits in step S<b>43</b><i>n</i>, and in the case of “yes”, the network-node equipment status bits are changed to “100” in step S<b>44</b><i>n</i>, the status bits are transmitted to the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b> in step S<b>45</b><i>n</i>, and control proceeds to step S<b>46</b><i>n </i>for wavelength change. Conversely, in the case where it is determined that topology reconfiguration is rejected by the other network-node equipments <b>4</b>-<b>2501</b>, <b>2503</b> and <b>2504</b> in step S<b>37</b><i>n</i>, the status bits are changed to “100” in step S<b>40</b><i>n</i>, the status bits are transmitted to the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b> in step S<b>41</b><i>n</i>, and also transmitted to the network node that requested topology reconfiguration.</p>
<p id="p-0621" num="0620">Afterwards control proceeds to step S<b>46</b><i>n</i>, and the series of processing of steps S<b>48</b><i>n </i>through S<b>55</b><i>n </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4-32</figref> is performed in the network-node equipment control unit <b>4</b>-<b>1102</b>. That is, in steps S<b>48</b><i>n </i>through S<b>55</b><i>n</i>, the network-node equipment control unit <b>4</b>-<b>1102</b> performs a wavelength tunable light source output stop process, a wavelength data reading process, a wavelength tunable light source wavelength changing process, a wavelength tunable filter wavelength changing process, a wavelength tunable light source output start process, a status monitoring process, a status bit changing process, and a status bit transmission process. However, since the status of the network-node equipment is controlled by bits, differently from the case of the thirty-fifth embodiment, when wavelength change is completed, and a wavelength path is formed, the status bits are changed to “101” in step S<b>54</b><i>n</i>, and subsequently, the bits are transmitted to the central management equipment <b>4</b>-<b>301</b> in step S<b>55</b><i>n</i>.</p>
