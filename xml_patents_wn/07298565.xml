<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">Opto-mechanical switches are used in routing signals from one port to another port. Opto-mechanical switches are the critical building element in fiber optical communication networks and in other fields such as test and measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Compact and stable 2×2 opto-mechanical switches are desirable as the technology shrinks in size and increases in bandwidth. A first embodiment of a conventional 2×2 opto-mechanical switch utilizes a reflection mirror with two dual fiber collimators, which is highly unstable thermally and mechanically. A second embodiment of a conventional 2×2 opto-mechanical switch utilizes a transmitting parallel prism which increases the thermal and mechanical stability. The second embodiment also has better repeatability of performance over the first embodiment. However, in order to keep a workable beam separation for aligning the collimator optics, the size of the prism is relatively large. Therefore, the prism is heavy and places a heavy load on the carrying relay arm.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Accordingly, what is needed is a system and method for overcoming the above-identified issues. The present invention addresses such a need.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0012">The present invention relates generally to opto-mechanical switches and more specifically to compact and high performance switches. The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements. Various modifications to the preferred embodiments and the generic principles and features described herein will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a first embodiment <b>100</b>A of a conventional 2×2 opto-mechanical switch. The opto-mechanical switch <b>100</b>A comprises a reflection mirror <b>107</b><i>a, </i>a pair of dual fiber collimators <b>108</b>A and <b>109</b>A, collimator fibers <b>101</b>A, <b>102</b>A, <b>103</b>A, and <b>104</b>A are collimator fibers, a piece of metal arm <b>105</b>A and a relay <b>106</b>A. The metal arm <b>105</b>A has one side attached to the reflection mirror <b>107</b>A and the other side attached to the relay <b>106</b>A. When a DC voltage is applied, the reflection mirror <b>107</b><i>a </i>can be either in or out of the optical paths and thus 2×2 optical switching can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">If the mirror <b>107</b>A is out of the optical paths, the light signal from collimator fiber <b>101</b>A goes to collimator fiber <b>104</b>A, and the light signal from collimator fiber <b>102</b>A goes to collimator fiber <b>103</b>A. If the reflection mirror <b>107</b>A is in the optical paths, the light signal from collimator fiber <b>101</b>A goes to collimator fiber <b>102</b>A and the light signal from collimator fiber <b>103</b>A goes to collimator fiber <b>104</b>A. When the reflection mirror <b>107</b>A is in the optical paths, the optical signals are very sensitive to the non-repeating or dislocation of the reflection mirror <b>107</b>A and thus the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is not stable thermally and mechanically.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows a second embodiment <b>100</b>B of a conventional 2×2 opto-mechanical switch. The opto-mechanical switch <b>100</b>B comprises a parallel prism <b>107</b>B, single collimators <b>101</b>B, <b>102</b>B, <b>103</b>B and <b>104</b>B, and a relay <b>106</b>B. The opto-mechanical switch <b>100</b>B utilizes a bulky and large size parallel prism <b>107</b>B to exchange the light signals. Four single collimators <b>101</b>B, <b>102</b>B, <b>103</b>B, and <b>104</b>B are utilized. When the parallel prism <b>107</b>B is in the optical paths, the light signal from collimator <b>101</b>B goes to collimator <b>104</b>B and the light signal from collimator <b>102</b>B goes to collimator <b>103</b>B. The large size prism <b>107</b>B is attached to the thin arm <b>105</b>B while the arm <b>105</b>B is attached to the relay <b>106</b>B. The reason for the large size of the parallel prism <b>107</b>B is to separate the two beams of light signals as much as possible in order to make the bonding of the four collimators <b>101</b>B, <b>102</b>B, <b>103</b>B and <b>104</b>B easier. However, the relatively large size and weight of the parallel prism <b>107</b>B can cause a large load on the relay <b>106</b>B and thus make the device more vulnerable to ambient shock and vibration or other seismic activity.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a first embodiment <b>200</b>A of a 2×2 opto-mechanical switch in accordance with the present invention. The opto-mechanical switch <b>200</b>A comprises a parallel prism <b>207</b>A, four pre-fixed 45-degree prisms <b>208</b>A, collimators <b>201</b>A, <b>201</b>A, <b>203</b>A and <b>204</b>A, a metal arm <b>205</b>A and a relay <b>206</b>A. The opto-mechanical switch <b>200</b>A utilizes a smaller parallel prism <b>207</b>A and thus makes the device less vulnerable to ambient shock and vibration. The beam separation function is achieved through the four pre-fixed 45-degree prisms <b>208</b>A. The light passing through the 45-degree prism <b>208</b>A makes two total internal reflections and comes out with a parallel beam and certain distance of the shift.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows a second embodiment of a 2×2 opto-mechanical switch <b>200</b>B in accordance with the present invention. The opto-mechanical switch <b>200</b>B comprises a parallel prism <b>207</b>B, 45-degree prisms <b>208</b>B, collimators <b>201</b>B, <b>202</b>B, <b>203</b>B and <b>204</b>B and relay <b>206</b>B. The opto-mechanical switch <b>200</b>B utilizes the compact parallel prism <b>207</b>B and two portions of each of the 45-degree prisms <b>208</b>B to shift the beams and thus increases the collimator separation. Two longer portions of the 45-degree parallel prisms <b>201</b>B, <b>202</b>B, <b>203</b>B and <b>204</b>B are utilized. Therefore, the switch <b>200</b>B of the present invention is less costly than the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The switch <b>200</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> saves two pieces of the 45 degree prisms <b>208</b>B in comparison with the switch shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is a third embodiment of a 2×2 opto-mechanical switch <b>200</b>C in accordance with the present invention. The opto-mechanical switch <b>200</b>C comprises a parallel prism <b>205</b>C, wedge prisms <b>203</b>C and <b>204</b>C, collimators <b>201</b>C and <b>202</b>C<i>s, </i>collimator fibers <b>201</b>C<i>a, </i><b>201</b>C<i>b, </i><b>202</b>C<i>a, </i>and <b>202</b>C<i>b, </i>and relay <b>207</b>C. The opto-mechanical switch <b>200</b>C utilizes a smaller parallel prism <b>205</b>C and thus makes the mechanism less vulnerable to ambient shock and vibration. The beam separation function is achieved through two wedge prisms <b>203</b>C and <b>204</b>C. The light from collimator <b>201</b>C<i>b </i>will pass through <b>203</b>C wedge prism which deflects the beam to be parallel to the light from collimator fiber <b>201</b>C<i>a </i>after exiting collimator <b>201</b>C. Wedge prism <b>204</b>C converts the beam back to make an angle relative to the neighboring beam. The smaller parallel prism <b>205</b>C is utilized to exchange the two beams as in the previous art. The prisms' <b>203</b>C and <b>204</b>C top angle is designed in a way that the beam deflects an angle equal to the beam angle exiting the collimator. The third embodiment in accordance with the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, compares more favorably in shock and vibration performance to the conventional opto-mechanical switches.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019">An opto-mechanical switch in accordance with the present invention utilizes a transmitting design and thus is more stable to ambient thermal or mechanical change. The embodiments of the present invention also feature much better repeatability than the conventional 2×2 optical switches.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0020">Finally, the embodiments of the present invention provide better shock and vibration performance than the embodiments of the conventional opto-mechanical switches.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0021">Although the present invention has been described in accordance with the embodiments shown, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that there could be variations to the embodiments and those variations would be within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, many modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
