<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to motor vehicle wheel end components. More particularly, the present invention relates to a brake assembly having a unique configuration and manufacturing process for reducing lateral run-out and a unique apparatus for machining the outer braking surfaces of a brake rotor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most motor vehicles today include disc brake systems for the front axle wheel assemblies and many further include disc brakes at the rear axle position. The disc brake rotor is a circular metal disc having opposed braking surfaces that are clamped by brake pads carried by a brake caliper to exert a braking effect. The wheel hub typically incorporates an anti-friction wheel bearing assembly in which one race of the bearing is coupled to the vehicle suspension and the other rotationally mounts the wheel hub, the brake rotor and wheel. Ordinarily, the rotating components of the rotor and hub assembly are manufactured separately and assembled together. This enables the brake rotor to be serviced and replaced if necessary during use. Moreover, the desired material characteristics for a brake rotor and the hub components are different. Although efforts to integrate these components have been proposed, such an approach has not found widespread acceptance.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to enhance performance of the braking system, it is desired to carefully and accurately control the dimensional characteristics of the rotor braking surfaces as the rotor rotates. The thickness variation of the disc and the lateral run-out or lateral deflection of the surfaces as they rotate need to be held to minimum tolerances. However, manufacturers have faced difficulties in achieving enhanced control over these tolerances due to the influence of several factors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Most efforts to date have focused on decreasing run-out by controlling the dimensional characteristics of the rotor and therefore the relationship of the rotor surface to the wheel hub flange or surface. However, despite the fact that the tolerances and dimensional characteristics of the rotors have improved, performance and run-out problems still exist. These run-out problems are due in large part to other components of the wheel end assembly, including the bearing/hub assembly, which is comprised of a wheel hub and a bearing or the knuckle/hub assembly, which is comprised of a knuckle, a wheel hub, and a bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One factor that contributes to this run-out is the stack-up of the individual components in a rotor/knuckle/hub assembly, i.e., their combined tolerances. While the tolerances of each part can be reduced when they are separately machined, when the parts are assembled, the combined tolerances stack up, causing run-out that is still relatively significant. Another factor that contributes to stack-up is any variation in the turning processes that are used to machine the wheel hub flange surface or the rotor surface, when the wheel hub and the rotor are individually machined, in an effort to make them flat. Further, the installation and press condition of the wheel bolts, the assembly process of the rotor/knuckle/hub assembly, and improperly pre-loaded bearings, can all cause misalignment of the rotor surface with respect to the brake pads and thus cause unacceptable run-out. This run-out can cause premature failure of the brake lining due to uneven wear which requires premature replacement of the brake lining at an increased expense. Further, problems due to run-out include, brake judder, steering wheel “nibble” and pedal pulses felt by the user, and warped rotors which result in brake noise and uneven stopping.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Presently available manufacturing methods and designs of rotors and knuckle hub assemblies to which the rotors are attached limit the accuracy to which lateral run-out of braking surfaces can be controlled. These methods and designs are also insufficient to solve the problems associated with run-out, as discussed above. Current methods typically involve finishing the rotor and the hub individually and then assembling the machined parts to form a completed brake rotor assembly. These methods, however, do not solve the run-out problems due to the factors discussed above, including stack-up tolerances, turning process variations, and wheel bolt and bearing installations.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other options have been considered in an effort to solve the run-out problem, but they also all suffer from a variety of disadvantages. One contemplated option for reducing run-out is to separately decrease the run-out of each individual component, by decreasing their respective tolerances during manufacture and then assembling the components. The “stack up” of tolerance variations related to such an approach is still significant and provides only limited system improvement at an increased manufacturing cost. Another contemplated option includes tightening the press-fit tolerance variation between the knuckle, the wheel hub, and the bearing. This, however, significantly increases the difficulty in the assembly process as well as increases the manufacturing cost. Further, this option does not provide the desired reduction in system run-out.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It would therefore be advantageous to design a brake assembly for a motor vehicle that decreases system run-out without significantly increasing the manufacturing cost of the assembly or increasing the manufacturing difficulty.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a brake assembly and a method for manufacturing same that provides reduced brake rotor lateral run-out.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a brake corner assembly and a method for manufacturing same that results in a brake configuration which minimizes brake noise and uneven stopping.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a brake assembly and method for manufacturing same that results in a brake configuration which minimizes uneven brake lining wear and thus the need for frequent lining replacements.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is a related object of the present invention to provide a brake assembly and a method for manufacturing same that results in a brake configuration which increases the life of vehicle brake linings.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a brake assembly and a method for manufacturing same that results in a brake configuration which provides improved performance at relatively lower cost.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a tool to allow for the machining of a brake assembly to provide decreased lateral run-out on the outboard and inboard brake rotor faces.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with the objects of the present invention a brake assembly for a motor vehicle is provided. The brake assembly includes a knuckle having a plurality of apertures formed therein for attachment of the knuckle to a vehicle. The knuckle also includes a bearing retention portion. The knuckle bearing retention portion is in communication with a bearing through press-fitting. The bearing in turn is in rotational communication with a wheel hub. The wheel hub includes a neck portion that is pressed into the bearing, and a flange, having a flange face. The flange face has a plurality of bolt holes formed therein with each of the plurality of bolt holes receiving a wheel bolt passed therethrough. The flange face has a brake rotor secured thereto, which is finished such that it is parallel to the caliper mounting features, and wherein the brake rotor has minimal run out with respect to the bearing axis of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with another object of the present invention, a method for forming a knuckle/hub assembly having reduced run-out is provided. The method includes providing a knuckle having a generally circular bore formed therein. The generally circular knuckle bore has a bearing press-fit therein. A wheel hub having a neck portion and a flange portion with a flange face is provided. The flange face has a plurality of wheel bolts press-fit into bolt holes formed therein. The neck portion of the wheel hub is then journaled into the bearing such that the wheel hub can rotate with respect to the knuckle. A brake rotor is then secured to the wheel hub by locating it over the wheel bolts. Once the brake rotor is assembled to the wheel hub, the brake rotor surfaces are then final finished such that they are co-planar and parallel with respect to the caliper ears or pads.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with another object of the present invention, an assembly for holding a brake assembly while it is final finished is provided. The assembly includes a standard lathe machine with a fixture for clamping and locating the knuckle/hub assembly. The fixture applies a clamping force to the wheel hub and the inner race of the bearing to generate a pre-load on the bearing. The fixture also holds the knuckle in place so that the wheel hub may be rotated. Thereafter, the inner surface of the rotor is final finished so that it is flat and planar so as to provide minimal run-out when measured back to the brake assembly's axis of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention when viewed in accordance with the accompanying drawings and appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BEST MODE(S) OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref> illustrate a preferred knuckle/hub assembly, as generally indicated by reference number <b>10</b>, in accordance with the present invention. The assembly <b>10</b> is comprised of a variety of components, including a knuckle <b>12</b> and a wheel hub <b>14</b>. The knuckle <b>12</b> is preferably constructed of metal and is generally formed by casting while the wheel hub <b>14</b> is preferably constructed of metal. The knuckle and hub can obviously be formed of other materials. The knuckle <b>12</b> preferably has a generally circular bore <b>16</b> formed therein and a plurality of outwardly extending appendages <b>18</b> that attach to the vehicle through a plurality of apertures <b>20</b> formed in the plurality of legs <b>18</b>, as is well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The bore <b>16</b> has a recess <b>22</b> formed therein bounded by an upper snap ring groove <b>24</b> and a lower snap ring <b>26</b> or shoulder for receiving a bearing <b>28</b> press fit therein. A snap ring <b>29</b> is preferably press fit or otherwise secured into the upper snap ring groove <b>24</b> prior to engagement of the bearing <b>28</b> with the knuckle <b>12</b>. It should be understood that while the illustrated assembly has a bore <b>16</b> formed in the knuckle <b>12</b>, the bearing <b>28</b> can be attached or secured to the knuckle <b>12</b> in a variety of configurations. For example, the bearing <b>28</b> can be mounted to an upper surface or other portion of the knuckle <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the bearing <b>28</b> can be only partially disposed in the bore <b>16</b>. Additionally, the bore <b>18</b> can be eliminated altogether.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The bearing <b>28</b> preferably has an outer race <b>31</b> and an inner race <b>33</b>. However, it should be understood that a variety of different bearings may be utilized as well as a variety of different knuckle/bearing attachment configurations. For example, instead of being press-fit with a snap ring, i.e., between the upper retention ring <b>24</b> and the lower retention ring <b>26</b>, the bearing <b>28</b> may be press-fit without a snap ring and held in place with a nut or other known securing methods. Alternatively, the outer race <b>31</b> may be integrally formed with the knuckle <b>12</b> or may be configured as an orbital formed outer race rotation bearing/knuckle assembly. Further, the bearing outer race <b>31</b> could alternatively be bolted to the knuckle <b>12</b> such that the inner race <b>33</b> rotates with the wheel hub <b>14</b>. Moreover, the inner race <b>33</b> may be integrally formed with the wheel hub <b>14</b>. Further, a spindle configuration having a non-driven outer race rotation may also be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the preferred embodiment, the wheel hub <b>14</b> has a neck portion <b>30</b> and a flange portion <b>32</b>. The neck portion <b>30</b> is preferably pressed into contact with the inner race <b>33</b> of the bearing <b>28</b> so that the wheel hub <b>14</b> can rotate with respect to the knuckle <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Alternatively, the neck portion <b>30</b> may be integrally formed with the inner race <b>33</b> or the outer race <b>31</b>. It should be understood that other wheel hub/bearing configurations may also be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The flange portion <b>32</b> has a flange face <b>34</b> and a wheel and rotor pilot portion <b>36</b>. The wheel and rotor pilot portions <b>36</b> extend generally upwardly from the flange face <b>34</b> and has an inner surface <b>38</b>, which defines a spline <b>40</b>. The wheel hub <b>14</b> also has a plurality of bolt holes <b>42</b> formed in the flange face <b>34</b> through which a plurality of respective wheel bolts <b>44</b> are passed. The plurality of wheel bolts <b>44</b> are attached to the flange face <b>34</b> in a predetermined pattern and on the same pitch circle diameter. The wheel bolts <b>44</b> are oriented with the threaded ends extending outwardly so as to connect a rotor <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) and associated wheel onto the hub <b>14</b> in a fashion, which is more clearly described below. Alternatively, the wheel hub <b>14</b> may have bolt holes <b>42</b> that receive lug nuts that are attached to a vehicle wheel and are passed through the bole holes <b>42</b> when the wheel is attached to the wheel hub <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the rotor <b>46</b> comprises a cup <b>48</b> with a central aperture <b>50</b> adapted to receive therethrough a wheel shaft (not shown) affixed to the wheel and rotor pilot portions <b>36</b> and extending outwardly from the flange face <b>34</b>. The cup <b>48</b> is dimensioned to receive the hub flange portion <b>32</b> and includes at its outer end an annular flange <b>52</b> having a plurality of apertures <b>54</b> lying in the same pitch circle diameter relative to the wheel shaft as the wheel bolts <b>44</b> and having a similar pattern so as to accommodate the wheel bolts <b>44</b> therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A pair of parallel, annular discs <b>56</b> spaced from each other by a plurality of rectangular fillets <b>58</b> extend outwardly from the cup <b>48</b> and define braking surfaces for a plurality of brake calipers (not shown) The completion of the assembly to the wheel is done by positioning the wheel over the bolts <b>44</b> and the threading nuts (not shown) over the bolts <b>44</b> so as to secure the wheel between the nuts and the rotor <b>46</b>. This invention addresses, among other things, the problems, which occur between the mating surfaces of the hub flange portion <b>32</b> and the rotor <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, which illustrate the preferred wheel hub <b>14</b> and flange portion <b>32</b> of the present invention. The flange face <b>34</b> has a relief channel <b>60</b> machined therein. It should be understood that the relief channel <b>60</b> may also be forged into the flange face <b>34</b> or may be formed by other known methods. The relief channel <b>60</b> divides the flange face <b>34</b> into an outer flange surface <b>62</b> and an inner flange surface <b>64</b>. The relief channel <b>60</b> is turned into the flange face <b>34</b> so that the plurality of bolt holes <b>42</b> lie in the relief channel <b>60</b>. The plurality of bolt holes <b>42</b> may be formed either before or after the relief channel <b>60</b> has been formed. The relief channel is preferably set below the level of the flange face <b>34</b>, this is to eliminate any surface unevenness caused by press-fitting the wheel bolts <b>44</b> into the bolt holes <b>42</b>. Any unevenness due to press-fitting of the wheel bolts <b>44</b> is compensated for by the relief channel <b>60</b> as any unevenness will not be raised with respect to the flange <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, and therefore does not contribute to any run-out. The relief channel <b>60</b> also allows for final finishing or finish turning to be performed on the assembly <b>10</b> after the bolts <b>44</b> have been seemed to the wheel hub <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The relief channel <b>60</b> is preferably formed in the flange surface <b>34</b> prior to the knuckle <b>12</b>, the bearing <b>28</b>, and the wheel hub <b>14</b> being assembled. However, it should be understood that the relief channel <b>60</b> can be formed in the flange surface <b>34</b> after the wheel hub <b>14</b> is assembled to the bearing <b>28</b> and the knuckle <b>12</b> and before the wheel studs <b>44</b> are press-fit therein. In accordance with the preferred method of forming, the wheel hub <b>14</b> has the relief channel <b>60</b> formed therein. Thereafter, the outer flange surface <b>62</b> and the inner flange surface <b>64</b> are finished. After the finishing process has been completed, the wheel bolts <b>44</b> are press fit into the bolt holes <b>42</b>. Thereafter, the hub <b>14</b> is mounted to the bearing <b>28</b> and the knuckle <b>12</b> to form the completed knuckle/hub assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The assembly <b>10</b> is then placed into a clamping apparatus, as is discussed in more detail below, where it is finish turned or final finished to provide a flat outer flange surface <b>62</b> and a flat inner flange surface <b>64</b> that will contact the rotor <b>46</b> and thus, minimize any run out. The refinishing will provide an inner flange surface <b>64</b> and an outer flange surface <b>62</b> that are co-planar with respect to each other so as to provide a flat flange surface <b>34</b>. The re-finishing process minimizes run-out with respect to not only the rotor, but also to the center of rotation of the assembly <b>68</b>, as established by the bearing <b>28</b>. Further, the method and configuration of the present invention allows the distance between the caliper ears and the flange surfaces <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> to be accurately controlled. Additionally, the parallelism between the caliper ears and the flange surfaces <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> can also be accurately controlled. In the preferred embodiment, each flange surface has a flatness of 20 μm or better. Additionally, the run-out is minimized to 14 μm or better and the co-planarness of the inner and outer surfaces <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> is 20 μm or better. However, the flatness requirements may be varied.</p>

However, when the stem portion <b>206</b> is rotated 90 degrees, its diameter is not large enough to receive the rounded top portion <b>260</b> therewithin or to allow the rounded top portion <b>260</b> to be withdrawn from the recess <b>258</b> if it is positioned therein. Thus, when the puller member <b>98</b> is lowered, it is oriented so as to receive the rounded top portion <b>260</b> therewithin.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">After the puller member <b>98</b> and the puller encasing <b>200</b> have been lowered, the pair of right pistons <b>154</b> and the pair of left pistons <b>186</b> are hydraulically actuated in order to apply a pinching or clamping force to the knuckle <b>12</b>. The right pistons <b>156</b> apply a clamping force to the opposing sides of the upper strut arm <b>155</b> through the use of the gripper portions <b>162</b> and the swiveling gripper portions <b>164</b>. Similarly, the left pistons <b>186</b> apply a clamping force to the opposing sides of the lower ball joint <b>198</b> through the use of the gripper portions <b>192</b> and the swiveling gripper portions <b>196</b>. The lifting of the assembly <b>10</b> by the bayonet <b>132</b> and the lowering of the puller member <b>98</b> forces the knuckle <b>12</b> into contact with the stop portion <b>230</b>. The stop portion <b>230</b> has an annular shoulder <b>262</b> which engages knuckle <b>12</b>. These actions locate the brake assembly <b>300</b> within the lathe and also fix the knuckle <b>12</b> to the lathe separately from any drive mechanism. Further, the knuckle <b>12</b> acted on by the pullers and grippers so that the knuckle is fixed and located. The knuckle <b>12</b> is not exposed to any bearing pre-load force.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">After the assembly <b>300</b> is located, the bayonet <b>132</b> is engaged by rotating the puller member <b>98</b> and the puller encasing <b>200</b> with respect to the surrounding body portion <b>228</b>. The puller member <b>98</b> and the puller encasing <b>200</b> are free to rotate with respect to the body portion <b>228</b> and are rotated 90° in order to engage the bayonet <b>132</b>. Thereafter, a clamping force is introduced by applying pressure to the annular flange <b>236</b> by introducing hydraulic fluid into the lower reservoir <b>244</b> through the second fluid orifice <b>242</b> forcing the puller <b>20</b> upward. By pulling the puller member <b>98</b> up, the bayonet <b>132</b> is also pulled upward such that the lower stop portion <b>222</b> sits on the inner race <b>31</b> of the bearing <b>28</b> in order to apply a force thereto and thus preload the bearing <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">After the assembly <b>300</b> has been located and clamped as described above, the final finishing process of the inner and outer surfaces of the brake rotor <b>46</b> can be performed by a finishing tool. In such a process, the hub <b>14</b> is driven such that it and the brake rotor <b>46</b> are rotating with respect to the knuckle <b>12</b> in which is fixed. The finishing tool is also preferably single tool such as a CNC tool, as is well known in the art. However, a variety of the other finishing tools may alternatively be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">One of the features of the fixture assembly <b>70</b> is to turn the wheel hub <b>14</b>, the brake rotor <b>46</b> and the bearing <b>28</b> compliantly, such that the stem portion <b>206</b> and the annular flange <b>246</b> are free to float and follow the brake assembly bearing's axis of rotation. This helps control the distance between the caliper ears and the rotor <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, which illustrate the brake assembly <b>300</b> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The brake assembly <b>300</b> includes a knuckle <b>302</b> and a wheel hub <b>304</b>. The knuckle <b>302</b> and the wheel hub <b>304</b> have the same configuration as the knuckle <b>12</b> and the wheel hub <b>14</b> described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 13</figref>. Thus, like parts will be identified with similar reference numbers. In this embodiment, a brake rotor <b>306</b> is secured to the flange face <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The brake rotor <b>306</b> has a cup <b>310</b> with a central aperture <b>312</b> formed therein. The central aperture <b>312</b> is adapted to receive therethrough a wheel shaft, which is affixed to the wheel and the rotor pilot portions <b>36</b>. The cup <b>310</b> extends generally actually from the flange face <b>34</b> and is dimensioned to receive the hub flange portion <b>32</b>. The cup <b>310</b> includes at is outer end an annular flange <b>312</b> having a plurality of apertures <b>314</b> formed therein that lie in the same pitch circles diameter relative to the wheel shaft as the wheel bolts <b>44</b> and having a similar pattern so as to accommodate the wheel bolts thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the brake rotor <b>306</b> has a pair of parallel annular discs <b>316</b> spaced from each other by a plurality of rectangular fillets <b>318</b>. The rectangular fillets <b>318</b> extend outwardly from the cup <b>310</b> and define an inner surface <b>320</b> and an outer surface <b>322</b> which act as braking surfaces for a brake caliper <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The brake assembly <b>300</b> in a fully assembled condition has the wheel bolts <b>44</b> pressed through the wheel hub <b>304</b>, the knuckle <b>302</b> rotatably attached to wheel hub <b>304</b> by a bearing <b>28</b>, and the brake rotor <b>306</b> secured to the flange face <b>34</b> of the wheel hub <b>34</b>. The wheel bolt apertures <b>314</b> of the brake rotor <b>306</b> fit over the wheel bolts <b>44</b> with a respective lug nut <b>326</b> securing the brake rotor <b>306</b> fit over the wheel bolts <b>44</b> with a respective lug nut <b>326</b> securing the brake rotor <b>306</b> between the wheel <b>328</b> and the wheel hub <b>304</b>. The wheel <b>328</b> has a wheel tread <b>330</b> secured to the outer surface thereof, as is well known. Further, a drive shaft axle <b>332</b> is in communication with a half shaft <b>334</b>, which extends through the central aperture <b>312</b>. A dust shield <b>336</b> is preferably secured to the knuckle <b>302</b> and extends generally outwardly such that it lies parallel and adjacent to the inner surface <b>320</b> of the brake rotor <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The brake caliper <b>324</b> is preferably disposed adjacent one portion of the brake rotor <b>306</b>. The brake caliper <b>324</b> has a pair of caliper pads <b>338</b>, <b>340</b> that contact the inner surface <b>320</b> and the outer surface <b>322</b> respectively of the brake rotor <b>306</b>. The actuation of the brake caliper <b>324</b> and thus the caliper pads <b>338</b>, <b>340</b> is well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In accordance with the preferred method, the inner surface <b>320</b> and the outer surface <b>322</b> are subjected to a final finishing or refinishing. The final finishing is preferably the same as discussed above, in connection with the wheel hub <b>304</b>. This refinishing process, as discussed above, minimizes lateral run-out of the rotor with respect to the center of rotation of the brake assembly <b>300</b>. Further, the refinishing process allows for the control of distance between the caliper pads <b>338</b>, <b>340</b> and the inner surface <b>320</b> and outer surface <b>322</b>, respectively. To accomplish the refinishing process, the brake assembly <b>300</b> is preferably located into a lathe machine and is processed, as discussed above. It is preferred that the final finishing or re-finishing only be performed on the surfaces <b>320</b>, <b>322</b> of the brake rotor. Alternatively, however, the final finishing process can be performed on both the flange face <b>34</b> of the wheel hub <b>304</b> and the surfaces of the brake rotor <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As discussed above, the brake assembly <b>10</b> is preferably inserted into the fixture assembly <b>70</b> in order to be properly finished such that the distance and parallelism between the brake caliper pads <b>338</b>, <b>340</b> and the surfaces <b>320</b>, <b>322</b> of the brake rotor is established.</p>
