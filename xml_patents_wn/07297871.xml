<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref> are an embodiment of a conventional electric supply apparatus, for example, JP, 2002-17032,A (page 4, FIGS. 4-5).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The electric supply apparatus <b>50</b> is disposed in a sliding door <b>41</b> of a motor vehicle. The electric supply apparatus <b>50</b> has a protector <b>42</b> (a cover is not shown), which is made of a synthetic resin, receiving a wiring harness <b>43</b> flexibly, and a metal leaf spring <b>44</b> to urge the wiring harness <b>43</b> upwardly in the protector <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A lower end portion of the leaf spring <b>44</b> is fixed to a forward and lower portion of the protector <b>42</b> together with the wiring harness <b>43</b>. A front end portion of the leaf spring <b>44</b> supports the wiring harness <b>43</b> slidably. The front end portion of the leaf spring <b>44</b> is covered with a cap <b>49</b> made of a synthetic resin and supports stably the wiring harness <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The wiring harness <b>43</b> has a plurality of electric cables <b>43</b><i>a </i>covered with a corrugate tube <b>43</b><i>b </i>made of a synthetic resin. The flexible corrugated tube <b>43</b><i>b </i>is fixed to the protector <b>42</b> with a tape at the front and lower end portion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One end portion of the electric cables <b>43</b><i>a </i>of the wiring harness <b>43</b> is led out through a front portion of the protector <b>42</b> to auxiliary units of the sliding door <b>41</b>. The corrugated tube <b>43</b><i>b </i>of the wiring harness <b>43</b> is wired to a vehicle body <b>47</b> slidably through an elongated lower opening <b>45</b> of the protector <b>42</b> and a stepping space <b>46</b>. The electric cables <b>43</b><i>a </i>inside the wiring harness <b>43</b> are covered by the corrugated tube <b>43</b><i>b </i>having a high rigidity and water proof to protect from outer interferences, water drops or dusts at a stepping space <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a fully closed state of the sliding door <b>41</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a half opened state close to a fully opened state. The wiring harness <b>43</b> is pulled backwardly at the fully closed state, and pulled forwardly at the fully opened state. When the sliding door <b>41</b> is in the half opened state, the wiring harness <b>43</b> tends to sag downwardly. However, the leaf spring <b>44</b> urges the wiring harness <b>43</b> upwardly to absorb the sag (excess length) and prevent to be sandwiched by other portions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the conventional electric supply apparatus, especially for vehicles having a large sliding distance of a sliding door <b>41</b>, an excess length of the wiring harness <b>43</b> in the protector becomes large so that the height of the protector becomes large and arrangements of other parts in the sliding door are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The corrugated tube <b>43</b><i>b </i>is utilized as a protective tube (protective member) of the wiring harness <b>43</b> in the protector. However, the corrugated tube <b>43</b><i>b </i>has a lower flexibility compared with a net tube (not shown) made of a synthetic resin. It is quite difficult to utilize the different kinds of the protective tubes at the same time. When the sliding door is fully closed or opened, the wiring harness <b>43</b> is strongly pulled so that the lifetime of the wiring harness <b>43</b> is reduced at the portion fixed at the protector <b>42</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention is to provide an electric supply apparatus having a wiring harness protected against outer interferences and rain water, having a small and compact protector, giving a higher flexibility of a wiring harness in the protector, and having a long lifetime of the wiring harness.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a first aspect of the present invention, an electric supply apparatus having a wiring harness includes a protector, a leaf spring disposed in the protector and a spring holder fixed to the leaf spring, wherein the spring holder holds one end portion of a flexible protective member of the wiring harness and one end portion of a rigid protective member of the wiring harness, and wherein the flexible protective member is disposed along the leaf spring and the rigid protective member is arranged from the spring holder to an opening for leading out the wiring harness.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thereby, the wiring harness is bent in a small diameter so that the protector is formed smaller. The rigid protective member is arranged from the protector inside a sliding door to the vehicle body to protect the electric cables inside the wiring harness from outside interferences or rain water. The flexible and rigid protective members are connected to each other with the spring holder. The spring holder fastens the both protective members and is fixed to the leaf spring. When the rigid protective member is pulled from outside, the tension is exerted on the leaf spring so that the flexible protective member is not subjected to the excess tension. A corrugated tube or thick vinyl tube is utilized for the rigid protective member and a thin vinyl tube is utilized for the net tube.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a second aspect of the present invention, the flexible protective member has an insertion member at the one end portion, the insertion member is resin-molded with the flexible protective member and fixed to one side portion of the spring holder.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The insertion member is fixed to the spring holder by means of ribs in the spring holder, locking means such as flexible arms or locking protrusions, or bolts.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a third aspect of the present invention, the spring holder has ribs at the other side portion thereof for engaging with grooves of the rigid protective member.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, a number or positions of the ribs is optional. The corrugated tube is suitable for the protective tube.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, the spring holder has protrusions, the protrusions penetrate into or pushing away the flexible protective member overlaying the rigid protective member so that the protrusions are engaged with the grooves of the rigid protective member.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An outer face of an end portion of the rigid protective member is intimately covered with an inner face of an end portion of the flexible protective member. The protrusions firmly hold the overlapped portion.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, the protective members are protective tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thereby, a bundle of electric cables are completely covered with the protective tubes and protected from outside interferences and rain water.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, the spring holder is separable and split holders are joined together with locking means.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thereby, the both protective members are first set into one split holder and the other split holder is joined to the one holder with locking means to sandwich the both protective tubes. Preferably, the locking means include locking protrusions and engaging frames, or locking arms and engaging recesses.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a seventh aspect of the present invention, the electric supply apparatus further includes an annular wall disposed in the protector, the annular wall holding a base end portion of the leaf spring, the leaf spring arranged around the annular wall, and the wiring harness being bent freely outside of the leaf spring.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The both protective members are connected to each other at a loop portion of the wiring harness through the spring holder. Thereby, when the wiring harness is pulled, the loop portion has a smaller diameter against a bias of the leaf spring and expands outwardly with a restoring force of the leaf spring so as to absorb a sag of the wiring harness. The biasing force of the leaf spring is directly transferred to the protective tubes through the spring holder so that the wiring harness expands and contracts with the spring holder without slipping.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> show an embodiment of an electric supply apparatus according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The electric supply apparatus <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, includes a protector <b>4</b> having a base <b>2</b> and a cover <b>3</b> made of a synthetic resin, a leaf spring <b>6</b>, being made of a metal, wound flexibly around an annular wall <b>5</b> disposed inside the base <b>2</b>, a wiring harness <b>7</b> covered with a corrugated tube (rigid protective member or protective tube) <b>25</b> at one side and a net tube (flexible protective member or protective tube) <b>26</b> at the other side, and arranged around the annular wall <b>5</b> to form a loop portion <b>8</b>, and a spring holder <b>9</b>, being made of a synthetic resin and holding a front end portion of the leaf spring <b>6</b>, for fastening a middle portion of the wiring harness <b>7</b> in a longitudinal direction, or a part of the loop portion <b>8</b> for connecting the corrugated tube <b>25</b> and the net tube <b>26</b> each other. The electric supply apparatus <b>1</b> is mounted to a sliding door, not shown, of a motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The base <b>2</b> and cover <b>3</b> of the protector <b>4</b> each have a triangle or trapezoidal base plate <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> and a peripheral wall <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> respectively. The each peripheral wall <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> has a vertical front wall <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>a</i>, a horizontal upper wall <b>12</b><i>b</i>, <b>13</b><i>b </i>and a sloping rear wall <b>12</b><i>c</i>, <b>13</b><i>c </i>respectively. When the cover <b>3</b> is covered to the base <b>2</b>, the peripheral wall <b>13</b> of the cover <b>3</b> is positioned around and outside the peripheral wall <b>12</b> of the base <b>12</b> and an elongated opening <b>14</b> is formed at a lower end of the protector <b>4</b> for guiding out the wiring harness <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A wiring harness guiding wall <b>15</b> with a curved section extends outwardly from the lower opening <b>14</b> of the cover <b>3</b>. An annular wall <b>16</b> is disposed at the center of the cover <b>3</b> and protrudes toward the base <b>2</b> for engaging with and inside the annular wall <b>5</b> of the base <b>2</b>. The protector <b>4</b> is shorter in height than the conventional one (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). This is because the wiring harness <b>7</b> is received in the flexible net tube <b>26</b> in a loop forming manner along the annular wall <b>5</b>. The protector <b>4</b> is fixed vertically to the sliding door with brackets <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The annular wall <b>5</b> is disposed at about the center of the base <b>2</b>. A spring holder <b>18</b> is integrally disposed at a rear side of the annular wall <b>5</b>, or at the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, a narrow wiring harness lead-out <b>19</b> is disposed at the base plate <b>10</b> and adjacent to the rear side of the spring holder <b>18</b>, and is connected to a U-shaped groove <b>20</b>. The U-shaped groove <b>20</b> is located inside a gutter <b>21</b> extending outwardly from the base plate <b>10</b>. A cutout <b>22</b> is formed in the peripheral wall <b>12</b> of the base <b>2</b> intersecting with the U-shaped groove <b>20</b>. The net tube <b>26</b> is arranged from the annular wall <b>5</b> to the U-shaped groove <b>20</b>. A curved wiring harness guiding wall <b>23</b> is disposed adjacent to the rear side of the wiring harness lead-out <b>19</b> and extends from an upper portion of the annular wall <b>5</b> with an @-shaped character. In the description, the front and rear of the electric supply apparatus <b>1</b> correspond to those of the motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A base end portion of the leaf spring <b>6</b> is press inserted into a slit <b>24</b> and fixed to the spring holder <b>18</b>. The leaf spring <b>6</b> is disposed around about three quarters of the annular wall <b>5</b> and has an outward restoring force. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The leaf spring <b>6</b> is straight without restriction and is bent resiliently to be set to the base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The wiring harness <b>7</b> is arranged around the annular wall <b>5</b> and the leaf spring <b>6</b> in the loop forming manner. The net tube <b>26</b> at one side <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the wiring harness <b>7</b> is upwardly led out through the U-shaped groove <b>20</b> and fixed to the gutter <b>21</b> and arranged in the sliding door to connect auxiliary units such as power window unit, door lock unit or mirror unit (not shown) The corrugated tube <b>25</b> at the other side <b>7</b><i>b </i>of the wiring harness <b>7</b> is arranged into a vehicle body from the guiding wall <b>23</b> through the lower opening <b>14</b>. A corrugated tube <b>25</b> of the wiring harness <b>7</b> can move freely inside the base plate <b>10</b> independently of the net tube <b>26</b> inside the groove <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The spring holder <b>9</b> is fixed to the front end portion of the leaf spring <b>6</b>. The corrugated tube <b>25</b> and the net tube <b>26</b> protecting the wiring harness <b>7</b> are fixed to one side and the other side of the spring holder <b>9</b>, respectively. The net, or knitted, tube <b>26</b> made of a synthetic resin is arranged from the groove <b>20</b> to the spring holder <b>9</b> along the annular wall <b>5</b>. The corrugated tube <b>25</b> made of a synthetic resin is arranged from the spring holder <b>9</b> to the vehicle body through the lower opening <b>14</b>. The net tube <b>26</b> and the corrugated tube <b>25</b> are connected to each other through the spring holder <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The net tube <b>26</b> is more flexible than the corrugated tube <b>25</b>. The corrugated tube <b>25</b> has more rigidity and waterproof than the net tube <b>26</b> and safely protects the wiring harness <b>7</b> from outside interference and water immersion. The corrugated tube <b>7</b> of the embodiment has an oval section, the long axis of which is arranged parallel to the base plate <b>10</b>. The wiring harness <b>7</b> includes the protective tubes <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> and a plurality of electric cables <b>27</b> received therein.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The spring holder <b>9</b> has a nearly reversed V-shaped form, the open portion of V facing to the annular wall <b>5</b>, and can move freely around the annular wall <b>5</b>. The spring holder <b>9</b> has a first receiver face <b>28</b><i>a </i>and a second receiver face <b>29</b><i>a </i>facing to the annular wall <b>5</b>. Both receiver faces <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>29</b><i>a </i>intersect obtusely each other. When the first receiver face <b>28</b><i>a </i>contacts with an outer face of the annular wall <b>5</b>, the second receiver face <b>29</b><i>a </i>concurrently contacts with the outer face of the annular wall <b>5</b> so that the spring holder <b>9</b> can move freely around the annular wall <b>5</b> by means of the intersecting receiver faces <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>29</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The corrugated tube <b>25</b> is fixed at a first holder <b>28</b> having the first receiver face <b>28</b><i>a </i>and the net tube <b>26</b> is fixed at a second holder <b>29</b> having the second receiver face <b>29</b><i>a</i>. An outer face opposing to the receiver faces <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>29</b><i>a </i>of the holder <b>9</b> can be a nearly V-shape or curved shape. The inner face of the holder <b>9</b> may have a curved or arced face instead of the reversed V-shaped face.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that a right side sliding door is fully opened. The sliding door is moved backwardly with the electric supply apparatus <b>1</b>. The wiring harness <b>7</b> is wound around the annular wall <b>5</b> and led out forwardly to a harness holder of the vehicle body, through the lower opening <b>14</b> of the protector <b>4</b> (the cover <b>3</b> is not shown). The net tube <b>26</b>, the spring holder <b>9</b> and a part of the corrugated tube <b>25</b> are curved around the annular wall <b>5</b> in the loop manner and the leaf spring <b>6</b> has a smallest diameter inside the net tube <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A tension F exerted on the wiring harness <b>7</b> acts on the spring holder <b>9</b> through the corrugated tube <b>25</b> and acts on the leaf spring <b>6</b> in a lengthwise direction thereof through the spring holder <b>9</b>. The metal leaf spring <b>6</b> is directly pulled so that the net tube <b>26</b>, extending from the spring holder <b>9</b> to the wiring harness lead-out <b>19</b>, and the electric cables <b>27</b> received therein are hardly pulled and the endurance thereof increases. The leaf spring <b>6</b> is formed with a metal so that the tension does not reduce the endurance.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the spring holder <b>9</b> at the end of the leaf spring <b>6</b> is subjected to an upward and diagonally forward force F<b>1</b> due to the restoring force of the leaf spring <b>6</b>. The loop forming portion <b>8</b> of the wiring harness <b>7</b> is subjected to a downward and diagonally forward force F<b>2</b> at a middle portion of the leaf spring <b>6</b> due to the restoring force of the leaf spring <b>6</b>. The restoring force F<b>1</b> and expanding force F<b>2</b> are perpendicular to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a partially opened state of the sliding door. At this state, the corrugated tube <b>25</b> of the wiring harness <b>7</b> usually hangs down between the vehicle body and the sliding door. However, the restoring force F<b>1</b> of the spring holder <b>9</b> due to the leaf spring <b>6</b> and the expanding force F<b>2</b> of the leaf spring <b>6</b> prevent the wiring harness <b>7</b> from hanging down. Accordingly, the loop portion <b>8</b> of the wiring harness <b>7</b> expands outwardly the annular wall <b>5</b> with a large diameter from the wiring harness lead-out <b>19</b>. The corrugated tube <b>25</b> of the wiring harness <b>7</b> is returned inside the protector <b>4</b> through the lower opening <b>14</b> and the excess length is assuredly received. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the restoring force F<b>1</b> acts forwardly and the expanding force F<b>2</b> acts diagonally forwardly and downwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The front end of the leaf spring <b>6</b> is fixed to the protective tubes <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> at the loop portion <b>8</b> of the wiring harness <b>7</b> through the spring holder <b>9</b>. Then, an urging force of the leaf spring <b>6</b> acts directly on the wiring harness <b>7</b> so that the loop portion <b>8</b> assuredly expands and contracts without slipping and receives the excess length, or sag, of the wiring harness <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the loop portion <b>8</b> expands in diameter, the net tube <b>26</b> and the electric cables <b>27</b> therein are subjected to a compressive force. The compressive force is applied to the leaf spring <b>6</b> through the spring holder <b>9</b> without acting to the net tube <b>26</b> and the electric cables <b>27</b>. Accordingly, the endurance of the net tube <b>26</b> and the electric cables <b>27</b> is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the sliding door fully closed. The sliding door moves to the front side of the vehicle with the electric supply apparatus <b>1</b>. The corrugated tube <b>25</b> of the wiring harness <b>7</b> is led out to the wiring harness holder of the vehicle body, not shown, through the lower opening <b>14</b> of the protector <b>4</b>. The loop portion <b>8</b>, or the net tube <b>26</b> and a part of the corrugated tube <b>25</b>, expands in diameter with the leaf spring <b>6</b> so that the corrugated tube <b>25</b> of the wiring harness <b>7</b> slides backwardly in the lower opening <b>14</b> when the sliding door is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The leaf spring <b>6</b> is directly subjected to a tension exerted on the net tube <b>26</b> through the spring holder <b>9</b>. Hence, similarly to the fully opened state of the sliding door in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the tension is not applied to the net tube <b>26</b> and the electric cables <b>27</b> therein so that the endurance thereof is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the sliding door is opened from the closed state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the operation is reversed from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. When the sliding door is opened, the function of the leaf spring <b>6</b> and the spring holder <b>9</b> are the same as the closing operation of sliding door.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 11</figref> show an embodiment of an electric supply apparatus <b>1</b> of the present invention for connecting the protective tubes <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> each other with the spring holder <b>9</b>.</p>

The second holder <b>29</b> is split into a base portion <b>29</b> and a cover portion <b>29</b> each of which has two opposed semi-oval sectioned ribs <b>35</b>. A pitch of the ribs <b>33</b> has n times pitch of the grooves <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the corrugated tube <b>25</b>, where n is integer such as 1, 2, 3. A distance between the ribs <b>35</b> is slightly larger than the length of the insertion member <b>34</b>. The grooves <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the corrugated tube <b>25</b> form protrusions at the inner wall of the corrugated tube <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The holder base <b>31</b> and holder cover <b>32</b> are joined together with locking means such as locking protrusions <b>36</b> and engaging frames <b>37</b> and form the tube having the oval section. The spring holder <b>9</b> has the inner wall with an oval section and an outer wall with a rectangular section. The locking means are not limited to the locking protrusions <b>36</b> and engaging frames <b>37</b> but may employ locking arms and locking recesses.

Fixing structure of the leaf spring <b>6</b> is same as that of conventional spring caps. An angle between the first receiver face <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the first holder <b>28</b> and the second receiver face <b>29</b><i>a </i>of the second holder <b>29</b> is set to contact with the outer face of the annular wall <b>5</b> of the protector <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the second holder <b>29</b> of the holder cover <b>32</b> is formed not to cover the leaf spring holder <b>51</b> of the holder base <b>31</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, a lower wall <b>70</b> of the second holder <b>29</b> of the holder cover <b>32</b> is joined to an upper portion of the leaf spring holder <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An assembling is performed as follows. The plurality of the electric cables <b>27</b> are inserted into the corrugated tube <b>25</b> and the net tube <b>26</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an end portion of the corrugated tube <b>25</b> is engaged with the first holder <b>28</b> of the holder base <b>31</b>. The insertion member <b>34</b> of the net tube <b>26</b> is engaged with the second holder <b>29</b> of the holder base <b>31</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the holder cover <b>32</b> is covered to the holder base <b>31</b> for locking to obtain the assembly given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. Then, both the corrugated tube <b>25</b> and the net tube <b>26</b> are easily and firmly connected to each other against tension through the spring holder <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the assembled state of the electric cables <b>27</b> inserted into the spring holder of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The rib <b>68</b> of the first holder <b>51</b> at the center and a bent portion of the spring holder <b>9</b> extends inwardly and higher than an end <b>25</b><i>d</i>, or cutting end, of the corrugated tube <b>25</b>. The electric cables <b>27</b> are supported by an end of the rib <b>68</b> and a gap <b>71</b> is formed between the end <b>25</b><i>d </i>and the electric cables <b>27</b> not to contact with each other. This arrangement is same all around the rib <b>68</b> so as to prevent damage and wear to the electric cables <b>27</b> resulting from an interference with the end <b>25</b><i>d </i>of the corrugated tube <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The ribs <b>35</b> of the second holder <b>29</b> also extend inwardly from the net tube <b>26</b> and are higher than that of an inner face at an end of the insertion member <b>34</b>. Hence, the interference between the inner face at the end of the insertion member <b>34</b> and the electric cables <b>27</b> is prevented so as to avoid damage and wear to the electric cables <b>27</b>. The rib <b>35</b> at the bent portion of the spring holder <b>9</b> is integral with the rib <b>68</b>. The insertion member <b>34</b> is a part of the net tube <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the present embodiment, the spring holder <b>9</b> and insertion member <b>34</b> are formed separately. Both the holder base <b>31</b> and the insertion member <b>34</b> or both the holder cover <b>32</b> and the insertion member <b>34</b> can be molded integrally. In this case, the net tube <b>26</b> is fixed with the insertion member <b>34</b>. The net tube <b>26</b> can be insert molded to the holder base <b>31</b> or the holder cover <b>32</b> without the insertion member <b>34</b>. Then, a number of parts is reduced and a connecting structure of the protective tubes is manufactured with low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the above embodiment, the corrugated tube <b>25</b> and the net tube <b>26</b> are utilized as the protective tubes. A flexible and thin vinyl tube (not shown) can be used in place of the net tube <b>26</b>. The insertion member <b>34</b> can be molded integrally with the vinyl tube similarly to the net tube <b>26</b>. The insertion member <b>34</b> can be formed integrally with the holder base <b>31</b> or the holder cover <b>32</b>. The vinyl tube can be directly insert molded to the holder base <b>31</b> and cover <b>32</b> when they are resin molded.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The corrugated tubes <b>25</b> can be disposed at both sides (the first and second holders) of the spring holder <b>9</b> or the net tubes <b>26</b> at the both sides of the spring holder. For either case, the first holder <b>28</b> has a same configuration as that of the second holder <b>29</b>. It is preferable without saying that the corrugated tube <b>25</b> having a relatively high rigidity is utilized at one portion extending to the lower opening <b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and the net tube <b>26</b> having flexibility and freely bent along the annular wall <b>5</b> is utilized at the other portion extending to the gutter <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The oval-sectioned corrugated tube <b>25</b> is utilized for attempting a compact size of the protector <b>4</b> in a thickness direction. A circular-sectioned corrugated tube (not shown) can be used when the protector <b>4</b> has a enough space in the thickness direction. In this case, the inner wall of the spring holder <b>9</b> is formed in a circular. The section of the net tube <b>26</b> has the same section of the corrugated tube <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the embodiment, the spring holder <b>9</b> is bent at the center but can be straight. In the case of the straight spring holder, the protective tube <b>26</b>, the electric cables <b>27</b> therein and the leaf spring <b>6</b> are bend in a small curvature especially at the end of the second holder <b>29</b> and are subjected to a large bending stress. Therefore, the straight type spring holder is only utilized for the annular wall having a large diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 18</figref> show another embodiment of a spring holder for connecting between the protective tubes <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> in an electric supply apparatus of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the embodiment, the net tube <b>26</b> is fixed to the spring holder <b>9</b> with the insertion member <b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 14</figref> show another embodiment. A plurality of thorny protrusions <b>59</b> are disposed inside a holder base <b>57</b> (one split holder) and holder cover <b>58</b> (the other split holder) of a spring holder <b>56</b>. An outer face of an end portion <b>25</b><i>c </i>of the corrugated tube <b>25</b> is covered with an end portion <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the net tube <b>26</b>. Then, the corrugated tube <b>25</b> is covered with the holder base <b>57</b> and holder cover <b>58</b> over the net tube <b>26</b>. The thorny protrusions <b>59</b> penetrate into the net tube <b>26</b> and engage with the grooves <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the corrugated tube <b>25</b> so as to hold the both protective tubes <b>25</b>,<b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In stead of penetrating the thorny protrusions <b>59</b> into the net tube <b>26</b>, the thorny protrusions <b>59</b> may push away the net tube <b>26</b> into the grooves <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the corrugated tube <b>25</b> to engage with the grooves <b>25</b><i>a</i>. In this case, the protrusions <b>59</b> are not necessary thorny. Accordingly, a fitting force between the protrusions <b>59</b> and the net tube <b>26</b> becomes smaller than that attained by penetrating the protrusions <b>59</b> into the net tube <b>26</b>, causing a shift of the net tube <b>26</b> due to the strong tension. However, the strong tension is exerted on the leaf spring <b>6</b> instead of the net tube <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) in the protector <b>4</b> so that the protrusions without the thorns are practically utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As shown if <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 14</figref>, the spring holder <b>56</b> is formed with a synthetic resin. The holder base <b>57</b> and holder cover <b>58</b> each have a semi-oval portion <b>60</b> and the thorny protrusions <b>59</b> are disposed at an each inner wall. The holder base <b>57</b> has a leaf spring holder <b>62</b> extending from the semi-oval portion <b>60</b> and a tapered protruding wall <b>63</b> above the leaf spring holder <b>62</b>. The both semi-oval portions <b>60</b> are locked together with locking protrusions <b>64</b> and engaging frames <b>65</b> to form a cylindrical tube having the oval section.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The thorny protrusions <b>59</b> are arranged in the each semi-oval portion <b>60</b> with an equal pitch which is n times of the pitch of the grooves <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the corrugated tube <b>25</b>, where n is integer such as 1, 2, 3. In the embodiment, three protrusions <b>59</b> are arranged in five lines. The number and lines of the protrusions <b>59</b> are optional depending on the size and shape of the spring holder.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The protrusions <b>59</b> are molded integrally with the semi-oval portions <b>60</b> utilizing a synthetic resin and have a triangular or square pyramid, or conical shape. A flat inner face <b>60</b><i>b </i>having the protrusions <b>59</b> of the each semi-oval portion <b>60</b> faces to a vertical side wall <b>25</b><i>d </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) in a direction of the long axis of the oval-sectioned corrugated tube <b>25</b> and curved inner walls <b>60</b><i>c </i>at an upper and lower portions of the each semi-oval portion <b>60</b> face to curved faces <b>25</b><i>e </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) at an upper and lower portions of the corrugated tube <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The leaf spring holder <b>62</b> extends and bends from the semi-oval portion <b>60</b>. A second receiver face <b>63</b><i>a </i>at the leaf spring holder <b>62</b> is inclined with respect to a first receiver face <b>60</b><i>a </i>of the semi-oval portion <b>60</b> and extends into a direction of tangent of the annular wall <b>5</b> of the protector <b>4</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The leaf spring holder <b>62</b> has the slit <b>66</b> for inserting the base end of the leaf spring <b>6</b> and the locking protrusion <b>40</b> to lock the leaf spring <b>6</b> as similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The first receiver face <b>60</b><i>a </i>of the semi-oval portions <b>60</b> is flush with the engaging frame <b>65</b>, the locking protrusion <b>64</b> engaging with the frame <b>65</b>, and ribs <b>67</b> disposed at both sides of the engaging frame <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The leaf spring holder <b>62</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> can be formed to extend straight from the semi-oval portion <b>60</b> without bending.

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, an inner face of an end portion <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the net tube <b>26</b> covers an outer face of an end portion <b>25</b><i>c </i>of the corrugated tube <b>25</b>. The joined tubes <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> are attached to the holder base <b>57</b>. The leaf spring <b>6</b> is inserted and locked to the leaf spring holder <b>62</b> of the holder base <b>57</b> before or prior to joining the both protective tubes <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the holder cover <b>58</b> covers and sandwiches the end portions <b>25</b><i>c </i>and <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the protective tubes <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> respectively. The thorny protrusions <b>59</b> penetrate into the end portion <b>26</b><i>a </i>and engage with the grooves <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the corrugated tube <b>25</b>. At the same time, the holder base <b>57</b> and holder cover <b>58</b> are locked to each other with the locking means <b>64</b> and <b>65</b>. Accordingly, the corrugated tube <b>25</b> and the net tube <b>26</b> are easily and firmly connected to each other through the spring holder <b>56</b> against the tension.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the above embodiments, the leaf spring holders <b>51</b>, <b>62</b> are disposed at the second holder <b>29</b> of the spring holder <b>9</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and at the protruding wall <b>63</b> of the spring holder <b>56</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, respectively.
