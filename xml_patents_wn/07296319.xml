<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a cleaning device, and more particularly to a brush cleaning device that can be used to clean and sanitize hairbrushes, combs and cosmetic brushes.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The instant invention is directed to a cleaning device that incorporates optimized physical brushing action, water agitation, submersion and/or solution directional features to clean brushes, and which cleans, flushes and sanitizes hairbrushes, combs and cosmetic brushes. In the preferred embodiment, the Archimedes Screw principle of moving both fluid and particles in a determined direction is employed to remove hair, scalp debris and oils from both hairbrushes and combs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the device comprises a tank, brush frame and brush assembly, a motor housing and a top cover. The tank may have a substantially flat bottom and upraised sidewalls defining an interior or central space communicating with an open or partially open top, and is configured to contain water or cleaning solution. The tank may be comprised of a transparent or translucent material to allow the operator to observe the cleaning process, or it may comprise an opaque material. The top cover preferably comprises an opening, plurality of openings or throat opening, in which one or a plurality of brushes, cosmetic brushes, combs or hairbrushes can be inserted so that the bristle portion of each brush or comb to be cleaned and/or sanitized is optimally oriented in the device for cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the preferred embodiment, the cleaning brush and the hair remover have, respectively, a specialized bristle and prong, pattern. The cleaning brush in the preferred embodiment rotates and is arranged, so that bristle-to-bristle (or bristle-to-prong in the case of combs) contact between the cleaning brush and the brush, comb, or cosmetic brush to be cleaned or sanitized, is optimal. In one version of the preferred embodiment, at least one rotating brush preferably comprises a bristle portion configured in a specialized densely packed pattern and/or a double radial spiral pattern about a support column, or “core”.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the preferred embodiment, rotation may be imparted to the rotating brush or brushes by, for example, an electric or battery operated motor, which engages one or more gears communicating with the rotating brush or brushes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the preferred embodiment, a tank receives water or other cleaning liquid and rotating brushes, or a combination of rotating and stationary brushes, are configured so that thorough cleaning and movement of the cleaning fluid can be accomplished without the need for injecting or pressurizing the cleaning liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The device is self-contained, portable and lightweight and achieves thorough cleaning and/or sanitizing of brushes or combs without the need for hose connections or plumbing systems and permits several brushes or combs to be cleaned simultaneously. Water agitation and specialized cleaning means or brushes having a specialized pattern of bristles permits any brush, comb, hairbrush or cosmetic brush to be thoroughly cleaned or sanitized within about a minute or less without shaking, damaging, bending or rotating the brushes or combs themselves. The device may be used to clean brushes and combs used with oil-based as well as water-based makeup or hair preparations.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of presently preferred embodiments of the invention and is not intended to represent the only forms in which the present invention may be constructed and/or utilized. The description sets forth the functions and the sequence of steps for operating the invention in connection with the illustrated embodiments. However, it is to be understood that the same or equivalent functions and sequences may be accomplished by different embodiments that are also intended to be encompassed within the spirit and scope of the invention. References to top/bottom, right/left etc. are relative terms provided for clarity and, unless otherwise noted, are interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> of the drawings, the device of the preferred embodiment generally comprises an upper portion <b>72</b> comprising a pair of openings <b>56</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>56</b>(<i>b</i>), a housing portion <b>74</b>, a roller brush <b>76</b> and a hair remover <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>). In the preferred embodiment, the device <b>64</b> is configured so that the housing portion <b>74</b> (and preferably also the upper portion <b>72</b> so that the two portions are seated) is concave as shown in, by way of example only, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> and <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>). The concave shape of the preferred embodiment, together with the movement of the roller brush <b>76</b>, creates a “hydrodynamic swirl” or cyclone effect in the cleaning fluid forcing the cleaning fluid in a 360° motion around the item to be cleaned, further enhancing cleaning action. The first and second openings are preferably disposed on opposite sides of the roller brush and the device configured in a concave, or rounded crescent shape, so that the first and second openings may be disposed at each end of the rounded crescent shape to allow for optimal use of a swirling or cyclone effect for cleaning. The openings are in communication with the housing portion <b>74</b> and cleaning liquid contained in the housing portion <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The upper portion <b>72</b> and housing portion <b>74</b> may be comprised of a molded plastic material such as, for example, ABS plastic or high-density polyethylene plastic, but may be also be formed of other suitable materials such as steel, other metals or plastics, and also may be formed integral with each other or as separate removable units of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a first example of the preferred embodiment, and by way of example only, the height of the assembled upper portion <b>72</b> and housing portion <b>74</b> may be about 6 to 7 inches, the width about 3 to 4 inches, and the length about 7 to 8 inches, although other dimensions of the device may be suitable. In the preferred embodiment, the device <b>64</b> is space conscious and configured to be portable and to take up only a small footprint on a counter top, a salon bench or other work area. In the preferred embodiment, the device <b>64</b> comprises round or semi-round openings <b>56</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>56</b>(<i>b</i>) sized to permit cleaning of all types of round and square hair brushes and different comb sizes and configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the preferred embodiment, the hair remover <b>60</b> comprises a column <b>78</b>, a plurality of prongs <b>82</b>, a bottom end <b>84</b> and a top end <b>80</b> comprising an edge <b>86</b> for grasping with the fingers. The hair remover <b>60</b> operates by turning prongs <b>82</b> that are preferably specifically spaced and sized, directly into the roller brush <b>76</b> while the roller brush <b>76</b> is in the “on” position.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The roller brush <b>76</b> and hair remover <b>60</b> are preferably disposed in approximate parallel relation to one another when the hair remover <b>60</b> is disposed in the housing portion <b>74</b>. In one version, the hair remover <b>60</b> makes direct contact with the roller brush <b>76</b> at an angle of about 20 to about 30 degrees, which permits optimal hair removal from the roller brush <b>76</b> down to the surface of the core <b>88</b>. In this version, the hair remover <b>60</b> makes contact with the core <b>88</b> of the roller brush <b>76</b> at a set angle to force loose hair onto the hair remover <b>60</b>, but without causing “skipping” or interruption of the rotating mechanism, which in the preferred embodiment may comprise a motor <b>70</b> powered by a 110 AC or 12 V DC power supply, and a gearbox <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the preferred embodiment, the roller brush <b>76</b> optimally rotates at about 300 RPM, although other speeds, such as from about 100 RPM to about 400 RPM may be suitable depending upon the items to be cleaned, size and configuration of the device <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another version of the preferred embodiment the roller brush <b>76</b> and hair remover <b>60</b> are spaced slightly so that they do not touch. In this version, the hair remover may be set at an angle to optimize hair removal from the roller brush <b>76</b>. For example, the hair remover <b>60</b> may be set at an angle of about 20 degrees to about 30 degrees in relation to the roller brush <b>76</b>. To operate the device <b>64</b>, the operator inserts a styling comb <b>62</b>(<i>b</i>) or hairbrush <b>62</b>(<i>a</i>) to be cleaned into openings <b>56</b>(<i>a</i>) and/or <b>56</b>(<i>b</i>). The operator may then press the on/off button <b>58</b> to power the motor <b>70</b>. Motor <b>70</b> preferably communicates with a gearbox <b>68</b> to impart rotation to roller brush <b>76</b>, which cleans the hairbrush <b>62</b>(<i>a</i>) and/or styling comb <b>62</b>(<i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">If operated with the hair remover <b>60</b> in opening <b>56</b>(<i>b</i>), the hair remover <b>60</b> may be removed to discard the hair and debris removed from the hairbrush <b>62</b>(<i>a</i>) or styling comb <b>62</b>(<i>b</i>). To remove the hair remover <b>60</b> from the device, the operator may grasp the edge <b>86</b> and rotate and pull the hair remover <b>60</b> out of the hairbrush, comb and makeup cleaning device <b>64</b> so that accumulated hair from cleaning brushes <b>62</b>(<i>a</i>) or styling combs <b>62</b>(<i>b</i>) can be removed. Once the hair remover <b>60</b> is out of the device <b>64</b>, the operator may remove the hair from the hair remover <b>60</b> by tapping or shaking over a waste receptacle. The device <b>64</b> permits thorough cleaning of hairbrushes and styling combs without the need to manually pull hair from the hairbrush <b>62</b>(<i>a</i>) or styling comb <b>62</b>(<i>b</i>) itself and without compromising cleaning performance of the roller brush <b>76</b> that might occur from accumulated hair from the hairbrush <b>62</b>(<i>a</i>) or styling comb <b>62</b>(<i>b</i>) to be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the openings <b>56</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>56</b>(<i>b</i>) are configured so that the roller brush <b>76</b> sits between them and so that they receive respectively a hairbrush or styling comb to be cleaned <b>62</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>62</b>(<i>b</i>) and/or the hair remover <b>60</b>. In a first version of the preferred embodiment, the roller brush <b>76</b> sits between openings <b>56</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>56</b>(<i>b</i>), which contain respectively, a hair brush to be cleaned <b>62</b>(<i>a</i>) and a hair remover <b>60</b>. In a second version of the preferred embodiment, the device operates with a styling comb <b>62</b>(<i>b</i>) in one of the openings <b>56</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>56</b>(<i>b</i>) and a hair brush <b>62</b>(<i>a</i>) to be cleaned in the other opening. In a third version of the preferred embodiment, a styling comb <b>62</b>(<i>b</i>) to be cleaned is placed in one of the openings <b>56</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>56</b>(<i>b</i>) and the hair remover <b>60</b> is placed in the other opening.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an alternate roller brush <b>76</b> configuration, the device <b>64</b> may comprise at least two roller brushes <b>76</b> that comprise a spiral brush pattern and which are spaced so that they do not touch. In the alternate version, a first roller brush contacts the styling comb or hairbrush to be cleaned and a second roller brush is configured to catch and remove accumulating hair and debris as it accumulates on the first roller brush.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the preferred embodiment, the housing portion <b>74</b> is filled with cleaning fluid and the device <b>64</b> employs agitation of the fluid by the roller brush <b>76</b> and bristle-to-bristle contact with the hairbrush <b>62</b>(<i>a</i>) or styling comb <b>62</b>(<i>b</i>) to pull, lift and whisk away hair and epidermis debris and oils from the hairbrush <b>62</b>(<i>a</i>) or styling comb <b>62</b>(<i>b</i>). Vibration or sonic action and aeration of the cleaning fluid may also be employed in the instant invention to enhance cleaning of the hairbrush <b>62</b>(<i>b</i>), styling comb <b>62</b>(<i>b</i>) or other item to be cleaned by creating an active cleaning environment further removing hair, dirt, debris and oils from the items to be cleaned. In one version of the preferred embodiment, the roller brush and roller brush bristles are configured to create optimal aeration of the cleaning fluid. In one version of the preferred embodiment, the opening <b>56</b>(<i>b</i>), roller brush <b>76</b> and hair remover <b>60</b> are configured and spaced so that the roller brush <b>76</b> and hair remover do not touch and are preferably spaced from one another. By way of example, the end tips of the tufts <b>34</b> of the bristle portion of the roller brush <b>76</b> may be spaced from about 0.05 cm to about 5.0 cm from the hair remover <b>60</b>.</p>
