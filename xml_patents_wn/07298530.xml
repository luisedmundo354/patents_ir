<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Of the many peripherals of a personal computer, the scanner can be said to be essential equipment. Generally speaking, the scanners in today's market have only little difference in terms of function and image scanning quality. Therefore, how to further shrink the size and volume of a scanner to improve the convenience of use has become a focus for R&amp;D engineers in the field of scanners.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a schematic diagram for a conventional optical module. The conventional optical module <b>100</b> comprises a carriage <b>110</b> and a guiding piece <b>120</b>, wherein the carriage <b>110</b> is equipped with a reflective mirror set, a lens and a photoelectric sensing device (not shown in the diagram).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The carriage <b>110</b>, which is coupled to the guiding piece <b>120</b>, can move back and forth along the scan direction D.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the course of scanning, the image light <b>130</b> of the document to be scanned, the reflecting light or the penetrating light of the document to be scanned for instance, enters into the carriage <b>110</b>. The image light <b>130</b>, reflected by the reflective mirror set composed of plural reflective mirrors, will be focused via a lens and received by the photoelectric sensing device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Each reflective mirror of the reflective mirror set, the lens and the photoelectric sensing device are all fixed in the carriage <b>110</b>. The purpose is to keep both the front optical path and the rear optical path at a fixed value such that a clear and quality scan image can be obtained. The front optical path is the path traveled by the image light, emitted by the document to be scanned, reflected via various reflective mirrors, arriving at the lens lastly. The rear optical path refers to the path from the lens to the photoelectric sensing device, The carriage <b>10</b>, having to accommodate all reflective mirrors, the lens and the photoelectric sensing device, is undesirably large.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It can be understood from the above disclosure that an over-sized carriage <b>110</b> will affect the scanner, which the carriage <b>110</b> is installed therein. The consequence is that the overall volume of the scanner cannot be effectively reduced.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The optical module with movable reflective mirrors according to the present invention differs with a conventional optical module in that the former has three carriages while the latter has only one single but bigger carriage. The optical module according to the invention reduces the volume of the scanner in which the carriage is accommodated. Without increasing the volume of the carriage on which a lens and a photoelectric sensing device are installed, a reflective mirror is installed between the lens and the photoelectric sensing device to increase the back focus so the scanner can scan larger documents via such optical module.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a structural diagram for an optical module with movable reflective mirrors according to the preferred embodiment of the invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a side view thereof. The optical module <b>200</b>, which can be set in a scanner for the scanning of documents to be scanned, comprises carriages <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> and <b>230</b>, a guiding piece and a firmware <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The carriage <b>210</b> comprises a reflective mirror <b>212</b>, a lens <b>214</b> and a photoelectric sensing device <b>216</b>, wherein the carriage <b>210</b>, being coupled to the guiding piece <b>240</b>, moves on the guiding piece <b>240</b> along the scanning direction D (the pivotal direction of the guiding piece <b>214</b>) to scan documents.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The carriage <b>220</b> comprises reflective mirrors <b>222</b> and <b>224</b>, wherein the carriage <b>220</b>, being coupled to the guiding piece <b>240</b>, makes relative movement corresponding to the carriage <b>210</b> and moves on the guiding piece <b>240</b> along the scanning direction D.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">By the same analogy, the carriage <b>230</b>, coupled to the guiding piece <b>240</b>, comprises two reflective mirrors <b>232</b> and <b>234</b>, makes relative movement corresponding to the carriage <b>210</b> and moves on the guiding piece <b>240</b> along the scanning direction D.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the image light of the document to be scanned is reflected via reflective mirrors <b>212</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>232</b> and <b>234</b> sequentially then forms an image on the photoelectric sensing device via the focusing of the lens <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The image light <b>260</b> follows an optical characteristic of keeping the front light path unchanged, i.e., the sum of the distance between reflective mirrors <b>222</b> and <b>212</b>, the distance between reflective mirrors <b>232</b> and <b>224</b>, and the distance between the lens <b>214</b> and the reflective mirror <b>234</b> must be kept at a fixed value. The purpose of keeping the front light path of the image light <b>260</b> unchanged can be achieved by installing the carriage <b>210</b> between carriages <b>220</b> and <b>230</b>, meanwhile, keeping the distance between carriages <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> at a fixed value during the course of scanning. A fixed distance between carriages <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> can be achieved by connecting the firmware <b>250</b> between them. As shown in the diagram, the firmware <b>250</b>, passing through the carriage <b>210</b>, connects carriages <b>220</b> and <b>230</b>. While the carriage <b>210</b> can make relative movement corresponding to carriages <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> on the firmware <b>250</b>, carriages <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> can not make relative displacement due to the connection of the firmware <b>250</b> during the course of scanning.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, schematic diagrams illustrating relative positions between each carriage corresponding to the optical module according to the invention of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> during scanning processes. As is shown in the diagrams, all carriages <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> can move back and forth along the scanning direction D during the course of scanning. The carriage <b>220</b> and the carriage <b>230</b> always remain a distance of X+Y, which can be achieved by means of the firmware <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. When the distance between carriages <b>210</b> and <b>230</b> is increased from X to X+a (from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), the distance between carriages <b>10</b> and <b>220</b> will be reduced from Y to Y−a (from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Please refer to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a side view for another reflective mirror layout of the optical module with reflective mirrors according to the preferred embodiment of the invention. Under the circumstance of keeping the front optical path unchanged, the original two-piece designed reflective mirrors <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> of the carriage <b>220</b> can be replaced by a single piece reflective mirror <b>422</b> while the original two-piece designed reflective mirrors <b>232</b> and <b>234</b> of the carriage <b>230</b> can be replaced by a single piece reflective mirror <b>432</b>. Such layout of reflective mirrors reduces not only the number of reflective mirrors but also the volume of the carriage in which the reflective mirrors are installed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, two structural diagrams for the optical module with reflective mirrors according to the preferred embodiment of the invention when back focus is large. Normally, when a larger document is to be scanned, a larger back focus is needed. That is to say, the distance between the lens and the photoelectric sensing device needs to be enlarged. This can be achieved by means of the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Under the circumstance of not increasing the volume of the carriage <b>210</b>, the locations for the lens <b>214</b> and the photoelectric sensing device <b>216</b> can be adjusted with an additional reflective mirror <b>512</b> being installed on the carriage <b>210</b> as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Another design as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is to install reflective mirrors <b>514</b> and <b>516</b> on the two lateral sides of the carriage <b>210</b> respectively to reflect the image light <b>260</b>, which has been focused via the lens <b>216</b>, onto the photoelectric sensing device <b>216</b>. So the back focus can be effectively enlarged permitting the scanning of larger documents.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the above disclosure, the scanner can be a reflection-type image scanner or a penetration-type image scanner; the guiding piece <b>240</b> can be a pivotal shaft or any other elements which enable the carriage to move back and forth along the scanning direction D; the firmware <b>250</b> can be any element, which, connecting carriages <b>220</b> and <b>230</b>, prevents relative displacement between carriages <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> without impeding the movement of the carriage <b>210</b> between carriages <b>220</b> and <b>230</b>; the photoelectric sensing device can be a charged coupled device (CCD) or a complementary mental oxide semiconductor sensor (CMOS sensor).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When compared with a conventional optical module having only one large carriage, the scanning direction of the carriage <b>210</b> according to the invention needs only a thinner thickness because a number of reflective mirrors have been moved to carriages <b>220</b> and <b>230</b>. Being equipped with reflective mirrors only, the thickness for carriages <b>220</b> and <b>230</b> can also be reduced. When compared with the carriage in a conventional optical module, all the carriages in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> are shorter in terms of the height while the carriages in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be even shorter. With the installation of reflective mirrors on the carriage <b>210</b>, the back focus can be enlarged enabling the scanning of larger documents.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The optical module with movable reflective mirrors according to the preferred embodiment of the invention is featured by the advantages of effectively reducing the volume of the scanner in which the optical module is installed, enhancing the convenience of use and enabling the scanning of larger documents.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of a preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements and procedures, and the scope of the appended claims therefore should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements and procedures.</p>
