<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a surface mount package semiconductor die and more specifically relates to a novel lead frame for such packages.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Semiconductor device packages for plural semiconductor die are well known. Such packages have thin conductive lead frames which are stamped or otherwise shaped to provide pads to which die can be mounted and then interconnected by wire bonds. The device is then overmolded, leaving external pins and exposed bottom surfaces for electrical and thermal connection to traces on printed circuit boards (PCBs).</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention is for a novel lead frame for surface mount package which provides die pads which are so arranged as to receive multiple die which preferably form a high voltage (above about 500 volts) three phase inverter with low cost, high die area to package area ratio (a high packaging and power density) and a reduced R<sub>THJC</sub>. The package of the invention has application, for example, to motor drives up to about 100 watts for pumps, fans, and the like and does not need a heat sink.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The lead frame has a first elongated pad for receiving the same power electrode of a plurality of spaced die and three separated pads extending coplanarly parallel to and laterally spaced from the first pad for receiving the other power electrodes of respective ones of other die. A central coplanar spaced wire bond area or strip is insulated from and is placed between the first pad and the plurality of spaced pads, for receiving wire bonds from die of the plurality of spaced pads.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Straight and generally parallel wire bonds then connect die on the first pad to respective ones of the plurality of pads and the die on the plurality of pads are wire bonded to the central wire bond area or strip. This arrangement permits a very simple wire bond operation for low resistance, low inductance connection between the die.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0024">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a three phase inverter circuit which is a typical circuit which can employ the lead frame of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0025">Such circuits will contain 6 die, 3 of which share a first power electrode, and the other 3 sharing a second power electrode. Thus, die <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are MOSFET die sharing a common drain electrode connection while die <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> share a common source electrode connection. While die <b>20</b> to <b>25</b> are shown as MOSFETs, they could be IGBT and diode copacks (or more generally, MOSgated devices) and can be silicon and or III nitride type devices or mixes thereof. The die are sized as desired and could be used for circuits up to about 100 watts.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0026">The drain electrodes of MOSFETs <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are connected to a common terminal Pin <b>1</b> and the source electrodes of MOSFETs <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> are connected to a common terminal Pin <b>4</b>. The gate electrodes of MOSFETs <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are connected to Pin <b>2</b>, Pin <b>5</b> and Pin <b>7</b>, respectively; and the gate electrodes of MOSFETs <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> are connected to terminal Pin <b>3</b>, Pin <b>6</b> and Pin <b>8</b>, respectively. The nodes of MOSFETs <b>20</b>, <b>23</b>; <b>21</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>22</b>, <b>25</b> are connected to terminal Pins <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0027">When the circuit is operated as a 3 phase inverter, Pins <b>1</b> and <b>4</b> are connected to an input DC source and Pins <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> define a 3 phase AC output. The locations of Pins <b>1</b> to <b>11</b> are identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to be later described.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0028">A conventional driver circuit is connected to central pins <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> to drive the inverter operation as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0029">The novel lead frame <b>50</b> of the invention for the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> before die are mounted on the lead frame. Lead frame <b>50</b> may be about 11 mm by 12 mm, as shown (non-critical), and dependent upon die size and power rating, and may be a conventional thin plated copper frame, stamped to the shape shown. The metal remaining after stamping is cross-hatched for clarity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0030">The lead frame <b>50</b> has a lower elongated pad <b>51</b> and upper spaced pads <b>52</b>, <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> all of which are spaced and electrically insulated from one another after die mounting and trimming. A central common source connection pad <b>55</b>, which will receive the sources of die mounted on pad <b>51</b> is provided. The central pad <b>53</b> has lateral extensions <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the lead frame of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> after die mounting, wire bonding and trimming. Thus, MOSFET die <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, which are vertical conduction MOSFETs with a drain electrode on their bottom surface and source and gate electrodes on their top surface, have their drain electrodes soldered or otherwise conductively adhered to the common elongated pad <b>51</b>, and are spaced as shown. Die <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> are centrally mounted on pads <b>52</b>, <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0032">The top source electrodes of die <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are then wire bonded to pads <b>52</b>, <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> respectively by wire bonds <b>60</b>, <b>61</b>; <b>62</b>, <b>63</b> and <b>64</b>, <b>65</b> respectively. Note that wire bonds <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> are connected to pad <b>53</b> vie extensions <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0033">The sources of die <b>20</b> to <b>25</b> are wire bonded to pins <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>4</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0034">The assembled lead frame and die of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is then conventionally overmolded, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, with the pins <b>1</b> to <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref> exposed around the bottom of the package (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), to make surface mount connection to patterns on a printed circuit board. Note that the bottom of the lead frame <b>50</b> can make good thermal connection to the PCB or other support. Further, the bottom of the separated and insulated pads <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>, <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> can be soldered to the PCB board or other support receiving the package for electrical and thermal purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0035">It will be seen that the novel lead frame of the invention provides a flexible pin-out configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0036">The package of the invention employs well known manufacturing techniques and is a low cost package. Standard surface mounting techniques can be used with the package. Further, the package provides a high die size to foot-print ratio, allowing better use of the available PCB area. No heat sink is needed for mounting the device for power ratings less than about 100 watts.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0037">The package has a low R<sub>THJC</sub>, allowing a better use of silicon (reduced die size for a given rating) and thus reduces the cost of the inverter. Further, the package has a low inductance due to the routing of the wire bonds and die placement thereby reducing losses and EMI noise.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0038">It will be apparent that other circuits can be laid out on the lead frame, for example, three half bridges in one package. Multiple die and mixed die sizes can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0039">Although the present invention has been described in relation to particular embodiments thereof, many other variations and modifications and other uses will become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is preferred, therefore, that the present invention be limited not by the specific disclosure herein.</p>
