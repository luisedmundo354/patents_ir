<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to solid state illumination and lighting systems and lamps and deals more specifically with a flat, flexible fluorescent lamp, systems and methods for producing large flat, flexible fluorescent lamps and the construction of such lamps.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fluorescent lamps are generally well known to provide illumination and lighting. A glass tube or envelope is coated or covered on its interior surface with a fluorescent powder typically a phosphor coating using sputtering, vapor deposition or other well known techniques. The tube is filled with an inert gas such as argon or a mixture of argon and neon, and a minute droplet of low pressure mercury vapor. A cap holding an electrode which extends into the glass tube is used to seal each end of the lamp. When the lamp is switched on, a current passes through the electrodes causing them to heat up and emit electrons that electrically charge or ionize the gas within the tube. The ionized gas becomes a conductor allowing increased current, essentially arcing, to jump from one electrode to the other electrode resulting in the emission of ultraviolet radiation. The ultraviolet radiation is then absorbed by the phosphor coating on the inner surface of the tube converting it into visible light. Although fluorescent lamps are in wide spread use in commercial and industrial applications and for lighting systems, there are a number of limitations and drawbacks associated with fluorescent lighting. Typically, the fluorescent tube is limited in the number of different sizes due to the requirement that the lamp must be mounted in a fixture to hold the tube and because the tube must be sealed during manufacture it is impractical to provide many different lengths without custom manufacturer to a given application. Additionally, fluorescent tubes are fragile and unless extreme care is taken in handling the tubes the fluorescent lamp is subject to breakage and possible injury to a user. A further disadvantage of fluorescent lamps is that a high voltage is necessary to start the lamp to initially ionize the inert gas to create the required ultraviolet radiation. Fluorescent lamps are also inefficient with respect to the light produced in that light is directed 360 degrees around the tube and therefore only a portion of the light is directed downward to a work surface or to illuminate a given area. The light that is emitted upward must be reflected through use of reflectors to redirect the light downward to the work surface or area to be illuminated otherwise the light that is generated in the generally upward direction is lost relative to its illumination capability of a work surface or area.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electroluminescent (EL) lamps and lighting systems such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,019,748 and 6,833,669, assigned to the assignee as the present invention are known to provide large scale flexible lighting panels that are flexible and not restricted in size at the time of manufacture so that a user may make the panel in a desired size and shape for a particular lighting application without restrictions on the initial manufacturing process. Such EL lamps are manufacturable using roll-to-roll and web-to-web processing currently in widths up to 54 inches and lengths of 2,400 feet. The disclosures of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,019,748 and 6,833,669 are incorporated herein by reference. The advantage with such EL lamps is that 100 percent of the visible light generated is directed downward toward the work surface or the area to be illuminated and thus increased efficiency over fluorescent lamps. In addition, EL panel lamps such as described above are robust and easily handled by a user without danger of breakage and are flexible so that the EL panel lamps may be bent around corners or conformed to contoured surfaces as required. Although such EL lamps provide benefits over fluorescent lamps, they are relatively expensive in comparison to conventional fluorescent lamps.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although EL lamps provide a flat flexible lamp, they are not entirely satisfactory for general lighting applications which typically require much higher or brighter intensity than that producable by such electroluminescent lamps. Additionally, the life of such lamps is limited and more expensive to produce because EL phosphor is more expensive than fluorescent phosphor such as used in fluorescent lamp tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it would be desirable to combine the benefits of fluorescent lamps and electroluminescent lamps to provide a flat, flexible fluorescent lamp to provide benefits not available in either EL lamps or in fluorescent lamps.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object therefore of the present invention to provide flexible fluorescent lamp that has a brighter intensity, longer life, lower cost to manufacture and a lower operating cost.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a self-luminous base lamp material for construction of a flat flexible fluorescent lamp.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with the present invention, a self-luminous base lamp material for construction of a flat, flexible fluorescent lamp and a flat flexible fluorescent lamp made there from is presented. The self-luminous base lamp material includes a front electrode comprising a continuous coil of ITO/PET film; a rear electrode comprising a continuous coil of aluminum foil polyester film; an ultraviolet light source carried between the front electrode and the rear electrode for emitting ultraviolet light in response to an excitation field created between the front electrode and the rear electrode, and a layer of fluorescent particles in proximity to the ultraviolet light source for emitting visible light in response to absorbing the ultraviolet light. The ultraviolet light source may comprise a glass microsphere containing an inert gas or alternately may comprise UV phosphor particles. In one embodiment, the fluorescent particles are carried in the glass microsphere along with the inert gas. The fluorescent particles may be fluorescent phosphor particles, sulfur particles or sulfur gas. A flat flexible fluorescent lamp constructed using the self-luminous base lamp material is also presented.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">WRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Turning now to the drawings and considering the invention in further detail, the basic concept and operating principles of the present invention are illustrated in a first embodiment of a self-luminous base lamp material forming the basis for the construction of a flat, flexible fluorescent lamp of the present invention. It should be noted that the drawings are not to scale and are presented schematically throughout to provide an understanding of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a cross sectional view of the self-luminous base lamp material and is generally designated <b>10</b> and comprises a layer <b>12</b> of UV (ultraviolet) emitting phosphor particles <b>14</b> mixed in an organic binder <b>16</b> to form a solids in a binder system which is deposited on the surface <b>18</b> of an aluminum/polyester film (AL/PET) <b>20</b> wherein the aluminum <b>22</b> forms and defines a rear foil conductor protected by the polyester (PET) layer <b>24</b>. A clear front conductor layer <b>30</b> comprising an ITO (indium tin oxide)/polyester (PET) film wherein the ITO <b>32</b> is in facing relation with the UV emitting phosphor/binder layer <b>12</b> to sandwich the UV emitting phosphor/binder layer <b>12</b> with the aluminum/PET layer <b>30</b>. The polyester layer <b>34</b> is transparent. A fluorescent phosphor/binder layer <b>40</b> is deposited on the outward facing surface <b>42</b> of the ITO/PET layer <b>30</b> and comprises fluorescent phosphor particles <b>44</b> in an organic binder <b>46</b>. The fluorescent phosphor/binder layer <b>40</b> is covered by a clear polyester film <b>48</b>. The UV light emitting phosphor particles <b>14</b> are selected such that they emit UV light at a 254 nanometer wavelength such that when an electrical voltage potential is applied to the rear foil conductor <b>22</b> and the ITO clear front conductor <b>30</b>, energy is capacitively coupled to the UV emitting phosphor <b>14</b> causing it to emit a photon at the 254 nanometer wavelength which is absorbed by the fluorescent phosphor particle <b>44</b> causing it to emit a photon in the visible light range to produce the desired illumination or light. The fluorescent phosphor particles <b>44</b> are substantially identical to the phosphor powder used in coating the inner surface of conventional fluorescent lamp tubes. The self-luminous base material <b>10</b> embodying the present invention is produced using roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques and systems such as disclosed in the above referenced patent disclosures and are producable in sizes up to 54 inches wide by 2400 feet long with currently known materials.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross sectional view of the self-luminous base lamp material embodying the present invention and is generally designated <b>50</b> and is similar to the self-luminous base lamp material illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout this disclosure. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the UV emitting phosphor particles <b>14</b> and fluorescent phosphor particles <b>44</b> are combined and mixed in an organic binder to form a solids in a binder system single layer <b>52</b> between the rear foil conductor <b>22</b> and the ITO clear front conductor <b>32</b>. In this instance, applying the voltage across the rear foil conductor <b>22</b> and ITO clear front conductor capacitively couples energy to the UV emitting phosphor particles <b>14</b> causing them to emit a UV photon to excite the fluorescent phosphor particle <b>44</b> to emit a photon having a wavelength in the visible light range. Accordingly, it can be seen that the operating principle of the present invention utilizes a photon in the UV wavelength range which is absorbed by a fluorescent particle causing it to emit a photon in the visible light range.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a cross sectional view of a self-luminous base lamp material for use in construction of a flat, flexible fluorescent lamp embodying the present invention is illustrated therein and generally designated <b>80</b>. In this embodiment, a microsphere or glass vessel <b>82</b> approximately 40 microns in diameter encloses a fluorescent phosphor particle <b>84</b> and is filled with an inert gas such as argon/mercury <b>86</b> and is mixed in an organic binder <b>88</b> to form a solids in binder system and is sandwiched between the rear foil conductor <b>22</b> of the aluminum/polyester (AL/PET) film and the ITO clear front conductor <b>32</b> of the indium tin oxide/polyester (ITO/PET) film. The binder <b>88</b> carrying the microsphere <b>82</b> is adhesive in nature to hold the AL/PET film to the ITO/PET film to form the self-luminous base lamp material <b>80</b>. When a proper voltage potential and frequency is applied between the rear foil conductor <b>22</b> and the ITO front conductor <b>32</b> a field is created there between and causes the argon/mercury gas <b>86</b> within the microsphere <b>82</b> to ionize and emit a photon in the ultraviolet (UV) light range which is absorbed by the fluorescent phosphor particle <b>84</b> causing it to emit a photon in the visible light range to produce visible light.</p>
