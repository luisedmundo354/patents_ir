<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A compact, light weight, efficient and cost-effective illumination system for optical displays is disclosed. The illumination system is capable of producing a self-luminous light beam of selected cross-section and spatial distribution in terms of intensity and angle. The illumination system can efficiently couple light from light sources having wide variety of sizes and shapes into light valves of various shapes and sizes. The illumination system includes a light recovery system or a polarization conversion system or a suitable combination of the foregoing.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to projection systems utilizing optical apparatuses that convert non-homogeneous light into substantially homogeneous and collimated illumination over predefined areas. More particularly, the disclosure relates to an optical illumination system, e.g., a light recovery system, for delivering uniform and collimated light to an area such as that of a light valve or display panel.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Light valves based on liquid crystal display technology and MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) technology have been used in various display applications which include, but are not limited to projectors, projection TVs, camcorders, digital still cameras, internet appliances, cell phones and headsets. To operate, light valves require an illumination system for providing light. The light illuminates the valves, which control how the light is displayed so that viewer can perceive images. Light valves are often microscopic in size, allowing highly detailed images. In most of light valve applications, low cost, compact, light weight illumination systems are desirable. In addition, in such applications, a uniform, bright and stable image is an important characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref> show cross-sectional views of known projection systems <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> and <b>220</b> that include illumination systems utilizing light guide integrators and lens plates in order to provide uniform light to display panels <b>17</b>, <b>27</b> and <b>227</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the input light <b>13</b> is focused into the entrance aperture of a straight light guide integrator <b>14</b>. Light beam <b>15</b><i>a </i>exits light guide integrator <b>14</b> more uniformly and homogeneously across the exit aperture in terms of spatial light intensity. The exit aperture of light guide integrator <b>14</b> is imaged onto the image gate of display panel <b>17</b> through a relay lens <b>16</b><i>a</i>. A set of lenses may be used to perform the function of relay lens <b>16</b><i>a </i>and collimate the light beam <b>15</b><i>a</i>. The light beam which passes through a transmissive display panel <b>17</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) or gets reflected by a reflective display panel (not shown) is focused by a field lens <b>16</b><i>b </i>into the aperture of a projection lens <b>18</b>, which in turn projects the image displayed on the display panel <b>17</b> onto a screen <b>19</b>. Where projection systems <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> and <b>220</b> utilize liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, polarizers and analyzers are usually inserted before and after display panels <b>17</b>, <b>27</b> and <b>227</b>, in addition to the components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The light guide <b>14</b> can be straight <b>14</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, tapered <b>14</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, asymmetrical <b>14</b><i>c</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, or hexagonal <b>14</b><i>d</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>. In addition, the light guides <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, <b>14</b><i>c </i>and <b>14</b><i>d </i>can be solid glass rods with polished surfaces, or alternatively, hollow tunnels with reflective surfaces. The light enters the entrance aperture <b>1</b>, <b>3</b> and <b>6</b> and emerges from the exit aperture <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>7</b> more uniformly after experiencing multiple reflections, as in case of hollow light tunnels, or multiple total internal reflections, as in case of solid light rods. The light uniformity at the exit aperture increases with an increase in light guide <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, <b>14</b><i>c </i>and <b>14</b><i>d </i>length L.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the entrance <b>1</b> and exit <b>2</b> apertures of straight light guide <b>14</b><i>a </i>have equal W<sub>1</sub>×W<sub>2 </sub>cross-sectional areas. Tapered light guides <b>14</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> deliver uniform and more collimated light in comparison with straight light guides of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>. A tapered light guide <b>14</b><i>b </i>usually has unequal cross-sectional areas of its entrance A<sub>1 </sub>and exit A<sub>2 </sub>apertures. Entrance <b>3</b> and exit <b>4</b> apertures can have unequal sizes and similar aperture shapes such as square, rectangular or circular as well as unequal sizes and different aperture shapes. Such light guides have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,332,688, of Magarill and U.S. Pat. No. 4,765,718, of Henkes, which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Asymmetrical light guides <b>14</b><i>c </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> are used to compensate for Keystone distortion, illumination overfill regions, and illumination drop-off regions. Asymmetrical light guides have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,517,210, of Peterson and U.S. Pat. No. 5,059,013, of Kantilal Jain, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The light guide described in the '013 patent places a quartz diffuser <b>8</b> with a thickness t<sub>d </sub>at the exit aperture <b>7</b> of a hexagonal light guide <b>14</b><i>d</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>, in order to convert light emerging from the light guide exit aperture into self-luminous light (i.e., each point over the light beam cross section emits light in a selected range of directions or numerical aperture). Disadvantages of projection system that uses a diffuser at the exit aperture of a light guide are lack of compactness as well as the difficulty of controlling the direction and/or shape of diffused light with most of available diffusers, thus, leading to inefficient light coupling and reduced brightness. In general, known projection systems <b>10</b> which utilize light guides <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, <b>14</b><i>c </i>and <b>14</b><i>d </i>to homogenize light suffer from lack of compactness and light losses due to lack of control over the numerical aperture of output light.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B-1C</figref>, the parabolic <b>21</b> and <b>221</b> mirror is used to collimate the light emitted by the light source <b>22</b> and <b>222</b>. Lens arrays <b>23</b> and <b>223</b> divide the substantially collimated input light beam <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>224</b><i>a </i>into sub-beams <b>24</b><i>b </i>and <b>224</b><i>b</i>. Condenser lenses <b>25</b><i>a </i>and <b>225</b> focus, in a superimposing manner, the light output from each micro-lens onto the display panel <b>27</b> and <b>227</b>, and in that the width/height ratio of each lens in lens arrays <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>and <b>223</b> corresponds to the width/height ratio of the display panel cross-section in the xy-plane. The light beams which pass through a transmissive display panel <b>27</b> and <b>227</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B-1C</figref>) or get reflected by a reflective display panel (not shown) are focused by field lenses <b>25</b><i>b </i>and <b>228</b> into the apertures of projection lenses <b>28</b> and <b>229</b>, which in turn project the image displayed on the display panels <b>27</b> and <b>227</b> onto screens <b>29</b> and <b>230</b>. In projection system <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, two separate lens arrays <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b </i>are used rather than a single lens array <b>223</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). Lens array <b>223</b> typically has large number of small-size lenses when compared to lens array <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b</i>, which requires more precise alignment of lenses on both sides of lens array <b>223</b>, thus, resulting in difficult manufacturing and more expensive lens arrays <b>223</b>. Disadvantages of projection systems <b>20</b> and <b>220</b> include lack of compactness, need for alignment of both plates <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b </i>and difficulty to control the cone angle distribution (i.e., numerical aperture) of output light <b>24</b><i>b </i>and <b>224</b><i>b </i>over light valve area, limited light coupling and limited display brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Known projection systems and light integrating technologies suffer from inefficiency in light coupling between components and a lack of compactness. Therefore, there is a need for a compact, light weight, efficient and cost-effective illumination system that provides improved control over spatial distribution of light in terms of intensity and angle over a specific area, such as the active area of a display panel or light valve. Such an illumination system would enable projection systems with smaller light valves arrays, leading to more compact and less expensive projection systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an advantage of the present invention to provide a compact, light weight, efficient and cost-effective illumination system capable of producing a self-luminous light beam of selected cross-section and spatial distribution in terms of intensity and angle. It is a further advantage of the present invention to provide an illumination system that can efficiently couple light from sources having wide variety of sizes and shapes into light valves of various shapes and sizes.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The following detailed description, which references to and incorporates the drawings, describes and illustrates one or more specific embodiments of the invention. These embodiments, offered not to limit but only to exemplify and teach the invention, are shown and described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Thus, where appropriate to avoid obscuring the invention, the description may omit certain information known to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref> show cross-sectional views of exemplary projection systems <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>80</b>, and <b>100</b> that use transmissive display panels <b>37</b> and <b>58</b>, such as liquid crystal display (LCD) panels as well as reflective panels <b>67</b> and <b>108</b>. Examples of reflective panels include reflective LCOS (liquid crystal on silicon) panels and DMD (digital micro mirror) panels. The projection systems <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>80</b> and <b>100</b> each include illumination systems that comprise a light source <b>12</b> housed in an elliptical <b>11</b> mirror, light recovery system <b>34</b> and <b>440</b>, relay lenses <b>36</b> and <b>56</b>, <b>66</b> and <b>106</b>. The projection systems also include display panels <b>37</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>67</b> and <b>108</b>. When an LCD panel is used in projection systems <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>80</b> and <b>100</b>, two additional components, a polarizer and an analyzer, need to be inserted before and after the LCD panel, respectively. In projection systems <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>80</b> and <b>100</b>, light sources housed in parabolic mirrors or other type of mirrors can also be used instead of light source <b>12</b> housed in elliptical mirrors <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The light source <b>12</b> can be any suitable light emitting device having an output intensity and wavelength suitable for the application in which the system is being used. Examples of light sources include incandescent bulbs, LEDs, lasers, arc lights and the like, as well as sources that emit electromagnetic radiation outside of the visible spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A-2D</figref>, the input light <b>33</b> is focused into the entrance aperture of light recovery system <b>34</b> and <b>440</b>. Light beam <b>35</b> exits light recovery system <b>34</b> and <b>440</b> more uniform and homogeneous across the exit aperture in terms of light intensity, color and view angle. The exit aperture of light recovery system <b>34</b> and <b>440</b> is imaged onto the image gate (entry face) of light valves (display panels) <b>37</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>67</b> and <b>108</b> through lenses <b>36</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>66</b> and <b>106</b>. The light beam which passes through the light valves <b>37</b> and <b>58</b> is focused by a field lens <b>38</b> and <b>59</b> into the aperture of projection lenses <b>39</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>69</b> and <b>109</b> which in turn projects the image displayed on the light valve <b>37</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>67</b> and <b>108</b> onto a screen <b>40</b>, <b>61</b>, <b>70</b> and <b>110</b>. In projection system <b>80</b> and <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C-2D</figref>, the image displayed on the light valve <b>67</b> and <b>108</b> is projected onto the screen <b>70</b> and <b>110</b> through projection lenses <b>69</b> and <b>109</b> without using a field lens.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Light recovery system <b>34</b> includes a reflective plate <b>34</b><i>a</i>, a light guide <b>34</b><i>b </i>and a micro-guide plate <b>34</b><i>c</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>. These components are attached together with a thin layer of an optical adhesive which can be applied to the whole or part of the surface areas of plates <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>c</i>. Subsequently, plates <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>c </i>are bonded to both sides of light guide <b>34</b><i>b </i>and finally the adhesive is cured. Perspective views of the light recovery system <b>34</b> after and before the assembly are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, respectively. Light guide <b>34</b><i>b </i>can be solid light guide made of optically transmissive material such as glass with polished surfaces or hollow light guide with reflective sidewalls and can also be straight (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>) or tapered (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>) light guide. Length of light guide ranges from few millimeters to tens of millimeters depending on the size of its entrance and exit apertures, cone angle of light propagating within the light guide <b>34</b><i>b </i>and degree of desired light uniformity. The entrance and exit apertures of light guide <b>34</b><i>b </i>are independent in terms of size and shape and can have different sizes and different shapes such as square, rectangular, circular, trapezoidal, polygonal, asymmetrical and even irregular shapes. Asymmetrical light guides <b>14</b><i>c </i>such as nonrectangular and trapezoidal guides as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> can be used in the light recovery system <b>34</b> to compensate for Keystone distortion, illumination overfill regions, and illumination drop-off regions, which occur when the display panel is tilted obliquely from the optical path <b>5</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. Thus, the use of asymmetrical light guides results in reducing light loss, increasing brightness, and enhancing brightness uniformity across the display panel surface area. Design parameters of asymmetrical light guides <b>14</b><i>c </i>include light guide length L, lengths l<sub>1</sub>, l<sub>2</sub>, l<sub>3 </sub>and l<sub>4 </sub>of input aperture and those of exit aperture, as well as angles β<sub>1</sub>, β<sub>2</sub>, β<sub>3 </sub>and β<sub>4 </sub>of input aperture and those of exit aperture. Cross-sectional areas (in the xy-plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E-2F</figref>) of plates <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>c </i>are preferably made to match the shapes and sizes of the entrance and exit apertures of light guide <b>34</b><i>b</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Keystone distortion, illumination overfill regions, and illumination drop-off regions can be corrected by using rectangular light recovery systems <b>34</b>, <b>440</b> rather than asymmetrical light guide systems. In this case, micro-guide plates <b>34</b><i>c </i>and <b>440</b><i>c </i>are designed to compensate for Keystone distortion, illumination overfill regions, and illumination drop-off regions. The design parameters of micro-elements that can be altered within micro-guide plates <b>34</b><i>c </i>and <b>440</b><i>c </i>to compensate include size of micro-elements (entrance aperture, exit aperture and length), shape of micro-elements entrance and exit apertures (square, rectangular, circular, trapezoidal, asymmetrical and irregular shapes), taper of sidewalls along micro-element length, orientation of each micro-element with respect to the micro-guide array, and distribution of micro-elements over the micro-guide plate surface area. Since micro-guide plates <b>34</b><i>c </i>and <b>440</b><i>c </i>are fabricated with IC like process, it is much easier and less expensive to use these micro-guide plates <b>34</b><i>c </i>and <b>440</b><i>c </i>to compensate for Keystone distortion, illumination overfill regions, and illumination drop-off regions. A light recovery system using this compensation approach has the advantage of using simpler and less expensive rectangular components, rather than more complex asymmetrical light guides.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The operation of the light recovery system <b>34</b> is described as follows. The light beam <b>33</b> is received first by the input plate <b>34</b><i>a </i>and enters the light guide <b>34</b><i>b </i>through the plate's aperture <b>34</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>. Light mixes as it travels within the light guide <b>34</b><i>b </i>and becomes more uniform. Light uniformity at the exit aperture of the light guide increases with the increasing number of light reflections within the light guide <b>34</b><i>b</i>. Some of the light leaving light guide <b>34</b><i>b </i>enters micro-guide plate <b>34</b><i>c </i>through the entrance apertures <b>134</b> of the micro-guides <b>139</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2G-2I</figref>), which in turn reduce the cone angle of the received light beam. The remainder of the light beam strikes the reflective coating <b>138</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2G-2I</figref>) and gets reflected back toward plate <b>34</b><i>a</i>. Part of this light traveling in the opposite direction (i.e., in the negative z direction) passes through aperture <b>34</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>) of plate <b>34</b><i>a </i>and exits toward the light source. A substantial amount of this light strikes the reflective coating <b>34</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>) of plate <b>34</b><i>a </i>and gets reflected back toward plate <b>34</b><i>c</i>. This process continues until a large amount of the light exits through plate <b>34</b><i>c </i>and the remainder exits through aperture <b>34</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> or gets absorbed by the reflective coatings within the light recovery system. As the cone angle of the light beam exiting micro-guide plate <b>34</b><i>c </i>decreases, more light can be utilized by the display panel and projection lens resulting in a more efficient projection system.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> shows an example of a collimating micro-guide plate <b>34</b><i>c</i>. The micro-guide plate <b>39</b> includes one or more optical elements. The optical elements (i.e., micro-elements) are formed and positioned in a specific arrangement for altering at least one optical characteristic of the input light to produce desired characteristics in the output light. The optical elements can include any suitable combination of micro-guides, micro-tunnels, micro-lenses, micro-prisms or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, the plate <b>34</b><i>c </i>includes a distribution of micro-guides <b>139</b>. The distribution of the micro-guides <b>139</b> over the surface of the plate <b>34</b><i>c </i>can be uniform, non-uniform or random. The non-uniform distribution of the micro-guides <b>139</b> can be used to shorten the length of the light guide <b>34</b><i>b </i>while maintaining a desired spatial light distribution at the exit aperture of plate <b>34</b><i>c</i>. In addition to controlling the micro-guide distribution, the size and shape of the input aperture <b>134</b> of each micro-guide <b>139</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>) can be designed so that a selected spatial light intensity across the surface of plate <b>34</b><i>c </i>is delivered to the next stage. Controlling the sidewall <b>135</b> tilt angle, permits control over the light angular distribution across the surface of plate <b>34</b><i>c</i>. The reflective coating <b>138</b> can be applied to the micro-guide sidewalls <b>135</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>. It is possible to utilize total internal reflection phenomenon within the micro-guides by applying the reflective coating <b>138</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>. In this case, plate <b>34</b><i>c </i>includes two plates <b>34</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> and <b>34</b><i>c</i><b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A compact light recovery system <b>440</b> can be made using two plates <b>440</b><i>a </i>and <b>440</b><i>c </i>and without a light guide <b>34</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. An example of plate <b>440</b><i>a </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B-3D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref> show back and front views of plate <b>440</b><i>a</i>.

Plate <b>34</b><i>c </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2H-2I</figref> can be used to perform the function of plate <b>440</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The light recovery systems <b>34</b> and <b>440</b> typically have the same cross section (in the xy-plane) aspect ratio as the display panel used in the projection system.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The operation of the light recovery system <b>440</b> is explained as follows. The light beam <b>53</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2D</figref>) is received first by the input micro-guide array <b>1445</b>, which converts the angle of the light that strikes the micro-guide sidewalls <b>1451</b> (e.g., ray B<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>) into 50°±10° with respect to the optical axis (z-axis). This light continues toward array <b>1443</b> without striking array <b>1442</b>, assuming that the thickness of plate <b>440</b><i>a </i>is made large enough, and eventually exits (e.g., ray B<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>) through the micro-guide sidewalls <b>1456</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>) of array <b>1443</b> with a range of angles close to those of the input beam <b>53</b>. The remainder of the input light <b>53</b> enters through the micro-guides entrance apertures <b>1450</b> (e.g., ray A<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>) and gets a certain amount of collimation depending on the micro-guide sidewall <b>1451</b> tilt angle. This light continues toward array <b>1442</b>, which reflects the incoming light toward the reflective surface <b>1444</b> and away from the input micro-guide array <b>1445</b> by changing its angle into 50°±10°. This light eventually exits (e.g., ray A<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>) through the micro-guide sidewalls <b>1456</b> of array <b>1443</b> with a range of angles close to those of the input beam <b>53</b>. Array <b>1442</b> has a large number (several hundreds to millions) of micro-guides with a tilt angle θ<sub>t </sub>that permits reflecting incident light into 50°±10° range. The micro-guides within array <b>1442</b> can be one-dimensional or two-dimensional, which are typically made in the plate <b>440</b><i>a </i>and coated with a highly reflective coating <b>1446</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, light with a cone angle comparable to that of input beam <b>53</b> (e.g., rays C<b>1</b> and D<b>1</b>) that strikes plate <b>440</b><i>a </i>in the opposite direction (−z direction) gets reflected back (e.g., rays C<b>2</b> and D<b>2</b>) in the forward direction (+z direction). Light that strikes the micro-guide sidewall <b>1456</b> as it travels in the −z direction changes its angle into 50°±10° range, enters the plate's body, recycles within the plate's body and eventually exits in the +z direction through the micro-guide sidewall <b>1456</b> at an angle comparable to its incident angle. Light that strikes the micro-guide sidewall <b>1456</b> as it travels in the +z direction (i.e., light reflected by the reflective coating <b>1444</b> toward array <b>1443</b>) experiences total internal reflection (TIR) and eventually exits in the +z direction through the micro-guide exit aperture <b>1457</b> at an angle comparable to its incident angle. Since a substantial amount of the light that strikes plate <b>440</b><i>a </i>in the −z direction gets reflected back in the forward direction (+z direction), plate <b>440</b><i>a </i>acts as a unidirectional aperture that passes light in one direction, the +z direction. This kind of plate <b>440</b><i>a </i>can be used in many applications such as conventional polarization conversion system (e.g., EP 1 315 022 A1 to Valter Drazic) and conventional recapture light guides used in sequential color display systems (e.g., EP 1 098 536 A2 to Scott Dewald et al.) to enhance their optical efficiencies. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3F-3G</figref> show other implementations of plate <b>440</b><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> shows the use of array <b>1442</b> with a smaller area when compared to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B-3D</figref>, which reflects part of the received light beam from array <b>1445</b> into the 50°±10° range while the remainder of the light passes toward the next stage. It is also possible to reduce the area of array <b>1442</b> to zero and allow the collimated light received from array <b>1445</b> to pass toward the next stage unmodified while array <b>1443</b> converts light received at 50°±10° into its original cone angle (i.e., cone angle before entering array <b>1445</b>) then delivers it to next stage.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref> shows the use of two serial input arrays <b>1445</b> and <b>1449</b>. Each array converts part of the received light into the 50°±10° range. The remainder of the light beam gets reflected into the 50°±10° range by array <b>1442</b>. An optional air gap <b>1448</b> separates the micro-guides of array <b>1449</b> from the body of plate <b>440</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>. This optional air gap does not allow the light traveling within the body of plate <b>440</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> at 50°±10° to exit through array <b>1449</b>. The micro-guide sidewall tilt angle of arrays <b>1443</b>, <b>1445</b>, and <b>1449</b> can be similar or different and preferably ranges from zero to several degrees. The zero degree tilt angle corresponds to straight sidewalls with no taper.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The size of the entrance/exit aperture of each micro-guide within plates <b>34</b><i>c</i>, <b>440</b><i>a</i>, <b>440</b><i>c </i>and <b>534</b><i>a </i>and arrays <b>1442</b>, <b>1443</b>, <b>1445</b>, and <b>1449</b> is preferably ≧5 μm in case of visible light in order to avoid light diffraction phenomenon. However, it is possible to design micro-elements with sizes of entrance/exit aperture being &lt;5 μm. In such case, the design should consider the diffraction phenomenon and behavior of light at such scales to provide homogeneous light distributions in terms of intensity, viewing angle and color over a certain area. Micro-guides can be arranged as a one-dimensional array, two-dimensional array, circular arrays and can be aligned or oriented individually.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The micro-guide arrays disclosed herein are only a subset of possible micro-guide arrays that can be used. Some other micro-elements, array types and configurations that are usable in the systems disclosed herein are discussed in greater detail in related application Ser. No. 10/458,390 filed on Jun. 10, 2003 and application Ser. No. 11/066,616 filed on Feb. 25, 2005, both to Nayef Abu-Ageel.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The light recovery systems <b>34</b> and <b>440</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) have at least four advantages over known light integrators such as solid and hollow light guide (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>D, <b>1</b>E, <b>1</b>F and <b>1</b>G) and fly's eye lens integrators (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B-1C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">First, the light recovery systems <b>34</b> and <b>440</b> provide higher compactness due to the use of the micro-guide array <b>34</b><i>c </i>at the exit aperture of a solid or hollow light guide <b>34</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>) and the use of arrays <b>34</b><i>c </i>and <b>440</b><i>b </i>without light guide <b>34</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). The micro-guide array <b>34</b><i>c </i>reflects part of the light beam toward the input aperture <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>440</b><i>a </i>leading to doubling its path which allows reducing the light guide <b>34</b><i>b </i>by half. In addition, array <b>34</b><i>c </i>can be designed so that even shorter light guides <b>34</b><i>b </i>are used while maintaining the desired spatial light distribution at the exit aperture of the system <b>34</b>. This design can be achieved through a non-uniform distribution of the micro-guides <b>139</b> within plate <b>34</b><i>c </i>and/or through controlling the size of the entrance aperture <b>134</b> of each micro-guide.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Second, the light recovery systems <b>34</b> and <b>440</b> can provide a higher level of light uniformity due to the large number of virtual sources formed by plates <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>c</i>, <b>440</b><i>a </i>and <b>440</b><i>c </i>as well as light guide <b>34</b><i>b</i>. Images of these virtual sources are superimposed on top of each other forming an extremely uniform distribution of light at the exit aperture of the light recovery systems <b>34</b> and <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Third, a higher coupling efficiency between the light source and the display panel (light valve) can be provided by the light recovery systems <b>34</b> and <b>440</b>, resulting in more efficient use of light by the display panel. The enhanced coupling efficiency is achieved by lowering the cone angle population of the light beam delivered to the display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Fourth, the light recovery systems <b>34</b> and <b>440</b> provide self-luminous light across their exit apertures, which is required by some applications. Self luminance of light means that each point across the exit apertures of light recovery systems <b>34</b> and <b>440</b> (i.e., exit apertures of micro-guide array <b>34</b><i>c </i>and <b>440</b><i>c</i>) emits light into a selected numerical aperture of emission. The distribution of the numerical aperture across the exit apertures of light recovery systems <b>34</b> and <b>440</b> can be uniform or non-uniform. It is possible to design each point across the exit apertures of light recovery systems <b>34</b> and <b>440</b> to have its own numerical aperture of emission which is independent of numerical apertures of other points. The diameter of each point is preferably 5 microns or more to avoid light diffraction effects.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref> illustrate polarization conversion systems <b>534</b> and <b>634</b>, respectively, in which no wave plates are needed to convert the polarization of recycled light. In these systems <b>534</b>,<b>634</b>, micro-elements and micro-guide arrays can be designed and aligned to rotate the polarization state of light beam.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The systems <b>534</b> and <b>634</b> include an input plate <b>534</b><i>a</i>, a light guide <b>34</b><i>b</i>, an optional collimating plate <b>34</b><i>c </i>and a reflective polarizer <b>534</b><i>d </i>such as a Proflux™ brand from Moxtek company. Plate <b>34</b><i>c </i>can be removed without impacting the polarization conversion function, but keeping the plate <b>34</b><i>c </i>in the systems <b>534</b>,<b>634</b> reduces the light cone angle and enhances the optical efficiency of a projection system.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Polarization systems <b>534</b> and <b>634</b> have the same implementation except for switching the locations of plate <b>34</b><i>c </i>and reflective polarizer <b>534</b><i>d</i>.

Micro-guides <b>1534</b><i>a </i>have square entrance and exit apertures and are purposely not aligned with plate <b>534</b><i>a </i>axis or the y-axis (which is usually aligned with the reflective polarizer <b>534</b><i>d </i>axis). When the light reflected by the polarizer <b>534</b><i>d </i>enters these micro-guides <b>1534</b><i>a </i>its polarization state gets rotated allowing this light or part of it to pass through the polarizer <b>534</b><i>d </i>when it strikes the polarizer the second time.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Polarization conversion systems (PCSs) <b>534</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>834</b>, <b>934</b>, <b>1034</b>, <b>1134</b>, <b>1234</b> and <b>1334</b> can be substituted for the light recovery systems <b>34</b> and <b>440</b> in the projection systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-D</figref> whenever liquid crystal based micro-displays are utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The polarization conversion systems (PCSs) <b>534</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>834</b>, <b>934</b>, <b>1034</b>, <b>1134</b>, <b>1234</b> and <b>1334</b> of this disclosure have five key advantages over known polarization conversion systems</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">First, the polarization conversion systems disclosed herein can use larger input apertures (i.e., larger cross-sectional area of the PCS) while maintaining the etendue of the input light or that of a lamp/reflector. This leads to increasing the efficiency of the polarization conversion system and displays utilizing such PCSs.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Second, the PCSs disclosed herein provide more control over the spatial light distribution and uniformity in terms of intensity and angle when compared to that of known PCSs. The capability of designing and distributing individual micro-elements within an extraction micro-guide array provides control over the spatial distribution of light intensity and cone angle over the exit aperture of a PCS. For example, the PCSs can provide more light at higher angles, thus, overcoming the typical angle dependent loss in a display system and leading to more uniform light intensity at the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Third, the PCSs disclosed herein provide higher coupling efficiency between the light source and the display panels (i.e., modulator) in a display system by the use of collimating elements within a PCS. This results in a more efficient use of light by the light valve, thus, reducing the required number of light sources and/or their power. In this case, collimating micro-guide arrays decrease the etendue of light beam delivered to the light valve, and thus, enhance coupling efficiency and increase display brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Fourth, the PCSs disclosed herein provide a superior level of compactness and light-weight. The length of the PCS can be lower than the length of known PCS by up to one or more orders of magnitude resulting in very compact light-weight display and illumination systems. In addition, the high PCS efficiency enables the use of small size display panels (≦0.5″) which results in using smaller optical components such as the projection lens, thus, leading to very compact projection systems.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Fifth, lower cost is achieved by using the PCSs of this disclosure due to the reduced size of the optical components used within the projection display system. As the size of optical components is reduced, their cost is reduced and the cost of the overall system is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The light recovery systems <b>34</b> and <b>440</b> and polarization recovery systems <b>534</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>834</b>, <b>934</b>, <b>1034</b>, <b>1134</b>, <b>1234</b> and <b>1334</b> described herein can be used to recycle light reflected by a color wheel in single-modulator sequential color display systems.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Antireflection coating (ARC) such as sub-wavelength structures or gratings can be applied to the front and/or back sides of the plates described herein to reduce Fresnel reflections. In addition, it is possible to use micro-tunnel and micro-guide arrays and fabrication techniques described in related patent application Ser. No. 10/458,390 filed on Jun. 10, 2003 to Nayef Abu-Ageel.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The micro-guide arrays disclosed herein can be made using various methods including, but not limited to, dry etch techniques such as reactive ion etch (RIE) technique, wet etch techniques such as the use of fluoride-based aqueous etching of Pyrex™ substrates or the use of buffered oxide etch (BOE) to form micro-elements in fused silica substrates. Additional fabrication techniques can use photosensitive glasses such as Foturan® produced by Schott Glass, Inc. or combine a spin-on glass (SOG) process and standard LIGA techniques. Further techniques include glass-drawing which is commonly used in fabricating micro-channel plates (MCPs), laser patterning techniques, nano-technology techniques and combinations of two or more of the foregoing techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The illumination systems, light recovery systems and PCSs disclosed herein have broad applications, including, but not limited to, projection displays such as projectors, projection TV, digital TV, home theater and monitors; direct-view displays and micro-displays used in gaming consoles, camcorders, cameras, cell phones, internet appliances, and headsets; lithography and photomask generation equipment; laser thermal processing; microscopy; fiber optic illumination; medical instrumentation and portable patient monitoring; GPS/navigation units; indicators on a car's dashboard; barcode scanners and test-and-measurement equipment.</p>
