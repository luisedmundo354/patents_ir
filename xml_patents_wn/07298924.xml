<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image data enlarging/reducing function, and more particularly to an image data enlarging/reducing apparatus preventing increases of circuit scale and development cost.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, information processing equipment such as a personal computer has been widespread. One of the functions of such information processing equipment is an enlarging/reducing function of image data. Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 6-215123 discloses a technique related thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The image editing device disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 6-215123 enlarges/reduces an image in a horizontal direction. Upon enlargement, it reads the same line or column a plurality of times, while it skips an unnecessary line or column upon reduction. It performs data transfer collectively in a unit of block by direct memory access (DMA).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventionally, rapid enlargement/reduction of image data required a circuit dedicated to image data processing. Adding such a function of rapidly enlarging/reducing image data would increase the circuit scale and/or the development cost of the information processing equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, although Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 6-215123 described above is related to the image data enlarging/reducing technique, enlargement/reduction of the image is conducted solely in the horizontal direction. It does not disclose a technique for enlarging/reducing the image in a vertical direction.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide an image data enlarging/reducing apparatus capable of rapidly enlarging/reducing image data.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of the present invention, an image data enlarging/reducing apparatus enlarging or reducing image data stored in a first storage unit to transfer to a second storage unit includes: a counting unit which counts a line number of the image data stored in the first storage unit; a setting unit in which an offset address is set; a transfer source address generating unit which sequentially increments transfer source addresses and, when the line number counted by the counting unit corresponds to a prescribed line number, adds the offset address set in the setting unit to the respective transfer source addresses to output as addresses to the first storage unit; a transfer destination address generating unit which sequentially increments transfer destination addresses to output as addresses to the second storage unit, and a control unit which controls direct memory access transfer from the first storage unit to the second storage unit.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When the line number counted by the counting unit corresponds to a prescribed line number, the transfer source address generating unit adds the offset address set in the setting unit to the respective transfer source addresses and outputs the same as addresses to the first storage unit. The control unit controls the direct memory access transfer in accordance with the transfer source addresses and the transfer destination addresses. Accordingly, rapid enlargement/reduction of the image data becomes possible.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image data enlarging/reducing apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention includes a computer body <b>1</b>, a display device <b>2</b>, an FD (Flexible Disk) drive <b>3</b> mounted with an FD <b>4</b>, a key board <b>5</b>, a mouse <b>6</b>, a CD-ROM (Compact Disk-Read Only Memory) device <b>7</b> mounted with a CD-ROM <b>8</b>, and a network communication device <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A recording medium such as FD<b>4</b>, CD-ROM <b>8</b> or the like provides an image data enlarging/reducing program. Enlargement/reduction of the image data is carried out by computer body <b>1</b> executing the image data enlarging/reducing program. Alternatively, the image data enlarging/reducing program may be supplied to computer body <b>1</b> from another computer via network communication device <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Computer body <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a CPU (Central Processing Unit) <b>10</b>, a ROM (Read Only Memory) <b>11</b>, a RAM (Random Access Memory) <b>12</b>, and a hard disk <b>13</b>. CPU <b>10</b> performs processing while inputting/outputting data with respect to display device <b>2</b>, FD drive <b>3</b>, key board <b>5</b>, mouse <b>6</b>, CD-ROM device <b>7</b>, network communication device <b>9</b>, ROM <b>11</b>, RAM <b>12</b>, or hard disk <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The image data enlarging/reducing program recorded on FD<b>4</b> or CD-ROM <b>8</b> is temporarily stored in hard disk <b>13</b> via FD drive <b>3</b> or CD-ROM device <b>7</b> by CPU <b>10</b>. CPU <b>10</b> performs enlargement/reduction of the image data by loading the image data enlarging/reducing program from hard disk <b>13</b> to RAM <b>12</b> as appropriate for execution.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a functional configuration of the image data enlarging/reducing apparatus of the first embodiment. The image data enlarging/reducing apparatus includes: a line number determining unit <b>21</b> which determines a line number when reading image data stored in a memory such as RAM <b>12</b>; a read address generating unit <b>22</b> which generates a read address in accordance with the determined result of line number determining unit <b>21</b>; a data reading unit <b>23</b> which reads the image data from the memory in accordance with the read address generated by read address generating unit <b>22</b>; a write address generating unit <b>24</b> which generates a write address where the data read by data reading unit <b>23</b> is to be written; and a data writing unit <b>25</b> which writes the image data to the memory in accordance with the write address generated by write address generating unit <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows, by way of example, image data stored in a memory. In this example, the image data is formed of lines <b>1</b>-N.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> illustrate an operation of the image data enlarging/reducing apparatus of the first embodiment upon enlargement of image data. When image data is stored in a memory A as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, enlargement of the image data is carried out by reading a particular line a plurality of times to write to a memory B. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, lines <b>5</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>15</b> . . . are each read twice for enlargement of the image data in a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate an operation of the image data enlarging/reducing apparatus of the first embodiment upon reduction of image data. When image data is stored in memory A as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, reduction of the image data is carried out by refraining from reading a particular line. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, lines <b>5</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>15</b> . . . are left unread for reduction of the image data in a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart illustrating processing procedure of the image data enlarging/reducing apparatus of the first embodiment. Firstly, line number determining unit <b>21</b> determines whether the line to be read from memory A corresponds to a prescribed line (S<b>11</b>). For example, when image data is to be enlarged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, line number determining unit <b>21</b> determines whether the relevant line is a line to be read a plurality of times. When image data is to be reduced as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, line number determining unit <b>21</b> determines whether the relevant line is a line not to be read.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, read address generating unit <b>22</b> calculates a read address in accordance with the determined result of line number determining unit <b>21</b> (S<b>12</b>). When line number determining unit <b>21</b> determines that the relevant line corresponds to the line to be read a plurality of times (for enlargement of image data), read address generating unit <b>22</b> generates a read address of the relevant line and outputs the same to data reading unit <b>23</b>, and generates the read address of the same line again and outputs the same to data reading unit <b>23</b>. When line number determining unit <b>21</b> determines that the relevant line is the line to be left unread (for reduction of image data), read address generating unit <b>22</b> generates, not the read address of the relevant line, but a read address of a next line and outputs the same to data reading unit <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Data reading unit <b>23</b> sequentially reads the image data from memory A in accordance with the read addresses generated by read address generating unit <b>22</b> (S<b>13</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, write address generating unit <b>24</b> calculates write addresses for writing the data read by data reading unit <b>23</b> to memory B (S<b>14</b>). Write address generating unit <b>24</b> sequentially increments the write addresses and outputs the same to data writing unit <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Lastly, data writing unit <b>25</b> writes the image data to memory B in accordance with the write addresses generated by write address generating unit <b>24</b> (S<b>15</b>). The above-described processes are repeated sequentially for enlargement/reduction of the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As described above, according to the image data enlarging/reducing apparatus of the present embodiment, image data on a prescribed line is read a plurality of times upon enlargement of the image data, while image data on a prescribed line is not read upon reduction of the image data. Thus, a circuit dedicated to enlargement/reduction of the image data becomes unnecessary, and the increase of circuit scale and/or development cost can be prevented.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a schematic configuration of the image data enlarging/reducing apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention. The image data enlarging/reducing apparatus includes a DMA controller <b>31</b> which enlarges/reduces image data by DMA transfer, a memory A <b>32</b> which stores original image data, and a memory B <b>33</b> which stores enlarged/reduced image data.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">DMA controller <b>31</b> includes an offset address setting unit <b>41</b> where an offset address is set, a line number counting unit <b>42</b> which counts a line number, a transfer source address generating unit <b>43</b> which generates a transfer source address, a transfer destination address generating unit <b>44</b> which generates a transfer destination address, and a DMA control unit <b>45</b> which controls the entire DMA controller.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> illustrate an operation of the image data enlarging/reducing apparatus of the second embodiment upon enlargement of image data. When image data is stored in memory A as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, enlargement of the image data is carried out as follows. A block <b>1</b> (lines <b>1</b>-<b>5</b>) stored in memory A is DMA-transferred to memory B, which is followed by DMA transfer of a block <b>2</b> (lines <b>5</b>-<b>9</b>) stored in memory A, including a duplicate of the line included in block <b>1</b>, to memory B. In this case, an offset address in a direction going back by one line (a negative address value) is set in offset address setting unit <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> illustrate an operation of the image data enlarging/reducing apparatus of the second embodiment upon reduction of image data. When image data is stored in memory A as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, reduction of the image data is carried out as follows. A block <b>1</b> (lines <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) stored in memory A is DMA-transferred to memory B, and then a block <b>2</b> (lines <b>6</b>-<b>9</b>) spaced apart from block <b>1</b> by a prescribed line is DMA-transferred to memory B. In this case, an offset address in a direction going ahead by one line (a positive address value) is set in offset address setting unit <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Line number counting unit <b>42</b> counts the number of lines being subjected to the DMA transfer, and outputs the line number to transfer source address generating unit <b>43</b>. When the line number output from line number counting unit <b>42</b> does not correspond to a prescribed line number, transfer source address generating unit <b>43</b> sequentially increments the transfer source addresses and outputs the same to memory A <b>32</b>. When the line number output from line number counting unit <b>42</b> corresponds to the prescribed line number, transfer source address generating unit <b>43</b> adds the offset address set in offset address setting unit <b>41</b> to the respective transfer source addresses, and outputs the resultant addresses to memory A <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Transfer destination address generating unit <b>44</b> sequentially increments the transfer destination addresses and outputs the same to memory B <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">DMA control unit <b>45</b> controls timings of address generation of transfer source address generating unit <b>43</b> and transfer destination address generating unit <b>44</b>. It also generates control signals for memory A <b>32</b> and memory B <b>33</b> to control the DMA transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As described above, according to the image data enlarging/reducing apparatus of the present embodiment, enlargement/reduction of image data is carried out by performing DMA transfer with an offset address being added to each transfer source address when the line number corresponds to a prescribed line number. This enables rapid enlargement/reduction of the image data, and also suppresses the increase of circuit scale and/or development cost.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims.</p>
