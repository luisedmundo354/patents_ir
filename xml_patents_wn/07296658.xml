<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The tree stand support bracket has three mutually pivotable parts and a belt for adjustably securing the length of the belt to fit the size of the tree it is attached to. The pivotable parts are the handle for tightening the belt, a belt strap adjustment portion for holding the free end of the strap and for locking the handle in place, and a belt buckle tree stand attachment portion having a hook for attaching a tree stand to. The tree stand support bracket bends in the middle to better engage a tree. By placing tree stand support brackets in several locations it is easy for a hunter to remove the tree stand from one location and move to another location by unhooking the tree stand from one support bracket and attaching it to another.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to tree stands and more particularly to how to quickly and easily attach a tree stand to a tree with a strap and buckle with a hook thereon for engaging the tree stand and supporting it.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are many devices for supporting a tree stand in a tree. Many require straps or chains connected directly to the tree stand however these devices are difficult to attach to the tree when connected to the tree stand as the tree stand needs to be supported while being attached to the tree. Since tree stands are frequently attached to the tree at an elevated position it is difficult to attach the tree stand to the tree.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are tree stand supports which have a chain or belt for attaching a bracket or frame to a tree and then attaching the tree stand to the bracket, however these devices are generally expensive and not easy to carry around such that only one bracket is used with one tree stand. The brackets must also be made in a particular way to engage the tree stand rather than having a universal easy to carry around inexpensive tree stand support which can be connected to any tree stand such that a hunter can attach a tree stand support to a number of desired trees and then transport the tree stand between the tree stand supports on different trees for hunting at different locations by quickly and easily detaching the tree stand from one tree stand support and then attaching it to another tree stand support already attached to a tree.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Prior tree stand brackets have generally been straight such that their is only one point of contact with a the circumference of a tree which does not provide a lot of vertical support friction with the tree. It is preferred to have the bracket pivot to provide more contact points.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The tree stand support bracket has a belt for placing around the circumference of a tree. The bracket has one end of the belt fixedly attached thereto and the other end adjustably attached to the belt. The bracket has a handle for tightening the belt around the tree and locking into position such that the belt will not come loose. The bracket has a pivot in the middle for pivoting the bracket about the middle such that it bends around the tree for better contact therewith. The bracket has a hook for engaging a rod on a bracket attached to the tree stand such that the tree stand can easily be attached to the tree by raising the tree stand up and placing the rod in the hook on the bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">By having more than one tree stand support bracket attached to desired trees a hunter can easily take a tree stand down and move to a different location without having to take the tree stand support bracket down and then reattaching it to another tree.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the invention to quickly and easily attach or remove a tree stand bracket in a tree.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an object of the invention to quickly and easily attach a tree stand to a tree stand bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an object of the invention to be able to move tree stands to different reselected locations.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an object of the invention to make tree stand brackets inexpensively.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is an object of the invention to make tree stand brackets easily transportable and light weight.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is an object of the invention to make tree stand brackets, which can be attached to any tree stand.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The tree stand support bracket <b>100</b> is used to support a tree stand <b>80</b> on a tree. The tree stand support bracket has a belt <b>20</b> which encircles a tree and can be tightened so that hook <b>45</b> on the belt buckle tree stand attachment portion <b>40</b> is held firmly in place. Since the tree stand supports are light weight and inexpensive a hunter can use more than one tree stand support bracket while hunting. The hunter can place several tree stand support brackets <b>100</b> in different locations such that all he has to do to move the tree stand <b>80</b> is unhook it from hook <b>45</b> and then lift the tree stand <b>80</b> to the hook on the tree stand support bracket <b>100</b> on the tree at the new location and place the rod <b>82</b> on the rod bracket <b>84</b> attached to the tree stand <b>80</b>. The tree stand can thus be moved to various preselected locations quickly and easily.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The tree stand support bracket <b>100</b> has 4 main parts, the belt <b>20</b>, a belt strap adjustment portion <b>30</b> for adjusting the length of the strap <b>20</b>, a belt buckle tree stand attachment portion <b>40</b> for holding the tree stand <b>80</b> and a handle portion <b>50</b> for tightening the strap <b>20</b> to the tree. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the a belt strap adjustment portion <b>30</b> has an aperture <b>36</b>, the a belt buckle tree stand attachment portion <b>40</b> has an aperture <b>46</b> and the handle portion has an aperture <b>56</b> which are aligned an pivot on rivet <b>70</b> such that all three parts pivot with respect to each other. The belt strap adjustment portion <b>30</b> and the belt buckle tree stand attachment portion <b>40</b> pivot with respect to each other to provide a bend in the middle of the tree stand support bracket <b>100</b> such that it bends around the tree to provide a better contact with the tree. The handle portion <b>50</b> has a cross bar for engaging strap <b>20</b> and pulling on the strap as the user pushes on the panel portion <b>52</b> to tighten the strap <b>20</b> in place around the tree <b>10</b> and lock it in place. The handle portion <b>50</b> has an aperture <b>66</b> in its side which aligns with apertures <b>64</b> on belt strap adjustment portion <b>30</b> such that lock pin <b>60</b> extending therethrough and held in place by cotter pin <b>62</b> locks the handle portion <b>50</b> in place ensuring that the belt will not come loose when the tree stand is attached.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The belt strap adjustment portion <b>30</b> has cross bars <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> which allows the belt to be looped through the belt strap adjustment portion <b>30</b> by going over and under the cross bars <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> and then over the cross bar <b>26</b> on handle portion <b>50</b> and back, by doubling over on its path. The strap can be adjusted for length by sliding the belt through the belt strap adjustment portion <b>30</b> and the handle portion <b>50</b>. The free end <b>28</b> of the strap <b>20</b> is preferable near the belt strap adjustment portion <b>30</b> and can easily be threaded therethrough to attach the strap <b>20</b> to the buckle mechanism. The other end of strap <b>20</b> is looped around cross bar <b>42</b> of the belt buckle tree stand attachment portion <b>40</b> and sewn together with stitching <b>24</b> to form a loop securing the strap <b>20</b> to the belt buckle tree stand attachment portion <b>40</b>. The belt buckle tree stand attachment portion <b>40</b> also has a cross bar <b>42</b> near the apertures <b>46</b> and a bracket <b>48</b> having a hook <b>45</b> and a retention spring <b>49</b>. The bracket <b>48</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> showing how a rod <b>82</b> from a tress stand rod bracket <b>84</b> is held by the bracket <b>48</b>. Retention spring <b>49</b> allows the rod <b>82</b> to be admitted to hook <b>45</b> by pressing the free end toward the bracket <b>48</b> near the hook <b>45</b>. The retention spring <b>49</b> then blocks the rod <b>82</b> on rod bracket <b>84</b> from escape thereby securing it to the rod bracket <b>84</b> to the hook <b>45</b> until it is released by pressing the retention spring downward to remove rod <b>82</b>. When rod bracket <b>84</b> is attached to a tree stand by use of bolts through apertures <b>86</b> on bracket <b>84</b> and apertures <b>94</b> on a rung <b>92</b> between rails <b>90</b> on the tree stand <b>80</b> the stand can be secure to the tree stand support bracket <b>100</b>. Since the rod bracket <b>84</b> is easy to attach to any tree stand <b>80</b> the rod bracket <b>84</b> and tree stand support bracket <b>100</b> can be sold as a unit for use with any tree stand. Extra tree stand support brackets <b>100</b> can also be obtained for use with the tree stand <b>80</b>.</p>
