<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to leveling legs for vehicles, and particularly, a hydraulic leveling leg assembly for use with a recreational vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Vehicles, such as a recreational vehicle or semi-trailer, incorporate jacks to support, level, or raise the vehicle. These jacks are commonly known as leveling legs or landing gear, and include at least one extendible member that is telescopically driven from to engage the ground. The extendible member telescopes from a static member fixed to the vehicle, such as by welding, bolting, and the like, at a predetermined height above the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Variations in the height of different vehicles above the ground require custom fitting of the jacks to the specific vehicle in order to fix the jack relative to the vehicle Moreover, once a jack is fixed to a vehicle, the height of the static member relative to the is fixed and cannot be easily changed. This can be a problem if larger tires are placed on the vehicle, or a dip beneath the vehicle, results in the extendible member being to short to properly engage the ground. Accordingly, a need exists for an adjustable height jack, leveling leg, or landing gear, for vehicles.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a leveling leg assembly adapted for mounting to a vehicle. The assembly includes an outer member and an inner member telescoped slidably into the outer member. The inner member has a first end extending beyond the outer member. Means for driving the inner member telescopically drives the inner member out of the outer member from a retracted position toward an extended position. A first bracket is fixed to the outer member, and a second bracket is fixable to the vehicle, wherein one of the first and second brackets has a plurality of holes formed therethrough, and the other of the first and second brackets has at least one hole formed therethrough that is aligned with at least one of the plurality of holes to fix the first bracket relative to the second bracket at a desired height relative to the vehicle. At least one hole of the plurality of holes formed through the one of the first and second brackets is not aligned with the at least one hole formed through the other of the first and second brackets to provide an alternate mounting height for the first bracket relative to the vehicle. In one embodiment the second bracket is boltable to the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A general objective of the present invention is to provide a leveling leg assembly that is height adjustable relative to a vehicle. This objective is accomplished by providing a leveling leg with first and second brackets for mounting the leg to the vehicle, wherein at least one hole of the plurality of holes formed through one of the first and second brackets is not aligned with at least one hole formed through the other of the first and second brackets to provide an alternate mounting height for the first bracket relative to the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another objective of the present invention is to provide an leveling leg assembly that is easily adjustable in height relative to the vehicle. This objective is accomplished by providing a bolt on-bolt on assembly that includes a first bracket that is fixed to an actuator and boltable to a second bracket that is boltable to the vehicle.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, a vehicle <b>10</b>, such as a recreational vehicle, trailer, or the like, has one or more extendible leveling leg assemblies <b>12</b>. Each assembly <b>12</b> has an outer member <b>14</b> fixed to the vehicle <b>10</b> and a telescoping inner member <b>16</b>. Hydraulic fluid <b>19</b> pumped into the outer member <b>14</b> drives the slidably moveable inner member <b>16</b> from a retracted position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to an extended position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, relative to the outer member <b>14</b>. A return spring <b>20</b> urges the inner member <b>16</b> telescopically into the outer member <b>14</b> toward the retracted position. Advantageously, a first bracket <b>22</b> fixed to the outer member <b>14</b> includes a plurality of hole pairs <b>24</b> that are alignable with one or more hole pairs <b>26</b> formed through a second bracket <b>28</b> fixed to the vehicle <b>10</b> to fix the assembly <b>12</b> to the vehicle <b>10</b> at a desired height.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The tube shaped outer member <b>14</b> has open first and second ends <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The first end <b>30</b> is closed by a valve member <b>34</b> that allows the passage of the hydraulic fluid <b>18</b> into and out of the outer member <b>14</b>. The valve member <b>34</b> is sealingly mounted to the outer member first end <b>30</b>, using methods known in the art, such as welding, threadable engagement, and the like. Preferably, the outer member <b>14</b> is a tube having a circular cross section, formed from steel or other suitable material having similar strength characteristics. Moreover, although a round tube is described herein, any shaped tube, such as a square tube, may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The inner member <b>16</b> has a shape corresponding to the outer member <b>14</b> with a first end <b>36</b> disposed inside the outer member <b>14</b> and a second end <b>38</b> extending out of the outer member second end <b>32</b>. The outer dimensions of the inner member <b>16</b> are proportioned so as to form a sliding fit within the inside dimensions of the outer member <b>14</b>. The inner member <b>16</b> is telescopically driven toward the extended position by a driving means that urges the inner member <b>16</b> telescopically out of the to outer member second end <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the preferred embodiment, the inner member <b>16</b> is telescopically driven by a driving means including the hydraulic fluid <b>18</b> pumped into the outer member <b>14</b>. The preferred driving means includes a piston <b>40</b> fixed to the inner member <b>16</b> proximal the inner member first end <b>36</b>. The piston <b>40</b> closes the inner member first end <b>36</b>, and in cooperation with the outer member <b>14</b> and valve member <b>34</b> defines an expandable reservoir <b>42</b> for receiving the hydraulic fluid <b>18</b> through the valve member <b>34</b>. Hydraulic fluid <b>18</b> pumped into the expandable reservoir <b>42</b> through the valve member <b>34</b> urges the inner member <b>16</b> telescopically out of the outer member second end <b>32</b>. Although driving means including hydraulic fluid is preferred, other driving means known in the art, such as a screw jack, rack and pinion, pneumatic, and the like can be used without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Seal members <b>44</b> interposed between the inner and outer members <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> prevent hydraulic fluid <b>18</b> from leaking out of the expandable reservoir <b>42</b> between the inner and outer members <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. In one embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the seal member <b>44</b> is fixed relative to outer member <b>14</b> proximal the outer member second end <b>32</b> to allow for the maximum extension of the inner member <b>16</b> In another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, a seal member <b>44</b> is fixed to the inner member <b>16</b> proximal the inner member first end <b>36</b> and sealingly engages the outer member <b>14</b>. Any number of seal members <b>44</b> can be provided at any position on either the inner and outer members <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A foot <b>46</b> mounted to the inner member second end <b>38</b> engages the ground, or other supporting surface, to support the vehicle <b>10</b>. The foot <b>46</b> provides a large surface area for engagement with the ground to prevent the leveling leg assembly <b>12</b> from sinking or forming a depression in the ground. Preferably, the foot <b>46</b> is pivotally mounted to the inner member <b>16</b> by a pin <b>48</b> inserted through a pair of opposing holes formed through the inner member <b>16</b>. Advantageously, by pivotally mounting the foot <b>46</b> to the inner member <b>16</b>, the foot <b>46</b> pivots to accommodate an uneven ground or other non-level supporting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The return spring <b>20</b> has one end <b>52</b> fixed to relative to the outer member <b>14</b> and an opposing end <b>54</b> fixed to the foot <b>46</b> urges the inner member <b>16</b> back into the outer member <b>14</b> to the retracted position. Although an external tension coil spring is shown, other mechanisms for urging the inner member toward the retracted positions can be provided, such as an internal spring disposed in the outer member, a hydraulic actuator, and the like, without departing from the scope of the invention. Moreover, although one end of the spring is fixed to the outer member and the opposing end is fixed to the foot, if the spring is provided, the ends of the spring can be fixed to any object that allows the spring to urge the inner member toward the retracted position. For example, one end of the spring can be fixed to the vehicle and the opposing end can be fixed to the inner member.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first bracket <b>22</b> fixed, such as by welding, to the outer member <b>14</b> includes a plate <b>56</b> having the first plurality of hole pairs <b>24</b> formed therethrough. The plate <b>56</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is planar, however, the plate <b>56</b> can have any shape, such as disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, without departing from the scope of the invention. Although welding the first bracket <b>22</b> to the outer member <b>14</b> is shown, other methods for fixing the first bracket <b>22</b> relative to the outer member <b>14</b>, such as clamps, bolts, and the like, can be used without departing from the scope of the invention. The first bracket <b>22</b> mates with the second bracket <b>28</b> to fix the outer member <b>14</b> relative to the vehicle <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The second bracket <b>28</b> is bolted to the vehicle <b>10</b>, and includes a plate <b>58</b> having the second plurality of hole pairs <b>26</b> formed therethrough. Additional holes <b>50</b> can be provided for bolting the second bracket <b>28</b> to the vehicle <b>10</b> using bolts <b>51</b>. At least one of the hole pairs <b>24</b> of the first plurality of hole pairs <b>24</b> is aligned with a hole pair <b>26</b> of the second plurality of hole pairs <b>26</b>, and a bolt <b>60</b>, or pin, is inserted through each hole of the aligned hole pairs <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> to fix the outer member <b>14</b> relative to the vehicle <b>10</b>. Advantageously, the hole pairs <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> that are aligned can be selected to correspond to a desired outer member height relative to the ground. Although hole pairs are disclosed and preferred, individual alignable holes can be provided depending upon the particular application and load capacity without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Advantageously, the first and second plurality of hole pairs <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> provides a leveling leg assembly <b>12</b> having a lower position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and an upper position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The lower position is accomplished by aligning the lowest hole pair <b>26</b> in the second bracket <b>28</b> with the highest hole pair <b>24</b> in the first bracket <b>22</b>, and then bolting, or pinning, the brackets <b>22</b>, <b>28</b> together to fix the leveling leg assembly <b>12</b> relative to the vehicle <b>10</b>. The upper position is accomplished by aligning the highest hole pair <b>26</b> in the second bracket <b>28</b> with the lowest hole pair <b>26</b> in the first bracket <b>22</b>, and then bolting, or pinning, the brackets together to fix the leveling leg assembly <b>12</b> relative to the vehicle <b>10</b>. Intermediate positions are accomplished by aligning various combinations of the hole pairs <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and bolting, or pinning, the brackets <b>22</b>, <b>28</b> together to fix the leveling leg assembly <b>12</b> relative to the vehicle <b>10</b>. Advantageously, except in the case in which all of the hole pairs <b>24</b> formed in the first bracket <b>22</b> are aligned with all of the hole pairs <b>26</b> formed in the second bracket <b>28</b> are aligned, at least one hole pair <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> in one of the brackets <b>22</b>, <b>28</b> is not aligned with a hole pair <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> in the other bracket <b>22</b>, <b>28</b> to provide an alternate mounting position for the bracket at an alternate height of the first bracket <b>22</b>, and thus the outer member <b>14</b>, relative to the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Advantageously, bolting the second bracket <b>28</b> to the vehicle <b>10</b> provides a bolt on-bolt on assembly that has advantages over prior at leveling leg assemblies that are welded to a vehicle. In particular, bolting the second bracket <b>28</b> to the vehicle <b>10</b>, and then bolting, or pinning, the first bracket <b>22</b> to the second bracket <b>28</b> allows the second bracket <b>28</b> to be detachably fixed at a desired height relative to the vehicle <b>10</b> and the first bracket <b>22</b> is then detachably fixed to the second bracket <b>28</b> at the desired height. This bolt on-bolt on assembly allows the height of the leveling leg assembly <b>12</b> relative to the vehicle <b>10</b> to be adjusted after installation by removing and rebolting either the second bracket <b>28</b> to the vehicle <b>10</b> or the first bracket <b>22</b> to the second bracket <b>28</b> depending upon the amount of height adjustment required. Of course, the second bracket <b>28</b> can be welded to the vehicle <b>10</b> if the ability to detach the second bracket <b>28</b> from the vehicle <b>10</b> is not desired. Moreover, once the first bracket <b>22</b> is bolted, or pinned, relative to the second bracket <b>28</b>, the first bracket <b>22</b> can be welded to the second bracket <b>28</b> or vehicle <b>10</b> if the ability to adjust the height of the first bracket <b>22</b> relative to the second bracket <b>28</b> is not desired.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an alternate embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, a leveling leg assembly <b>112</b> includes a first bracket <b>122</b> formed from a length of tube steel welded to the outer member <b>114</b>. The first bracket <b>122</b> includes a plurality of hole pairs <b>124</b> formed through opposite sides of the tube. The second bracket <b>128</b> includes a channel <b>129</b> fixed to a substantially planar plate <b>130</b>. The channel <b>129</b> includes a pair of parallel legs <b>131</b> having pairs of holes <b>126</b> that are alignable with the hole pairs <b>124</b> formed in the tube fixed to the outer member <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another alternate embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a leveling leg assembly <b>212</b> includes inner and outer members <b>216</b>, <b>214</b> that define an expandable cavity <b>242</b>. A hydraulic actuator <b>243</b> disposed in the cavity <b>242</b> includes one end <b>245</b> fixed relative to the outer member <b>214</b> and an opposing end <b>246</b> fixed to the inner member <b>216</b>. Actuation of the hydraulic actuator <b>243</b> urges the inner member <b>216</b> telescopically out of the outer member <b>214</b>. The hydraulic actuator <b>243</b> is a self-contained expandable reservoir that is in fluid communication, such as by a hose, with a source of pressurized hydraulic fluid to actuate the actuator <b>243</b>. As a result, a sealing member interposed between the inner and outer members is not required. Moreover, if a double acting hydraulic cylinder is used, a return spring is also not required.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While there has been shown and described what are at present considered the preferred embodiment of the invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
