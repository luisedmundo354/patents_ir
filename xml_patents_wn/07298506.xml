<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus, and in particular, to an image forming apparatus which carries out collation processing with image information to be copied, and a specific image in order to prevent counterfeiting, and to a method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recently, the performance of image forming apparatuses such as a digital coping machines or the like has been improved, and carrying out countermeasures with respect to preventing counterfeiting of paper moneys, securities, or the like has been required. Namely, in an MFP product having a scanner function, it is possible to prepare fraudulent image information of paper moneys, securities, or the like by the scanner function or the like. Therefore, in a copying function, a countermeasure has been carried out in which a function, which is such that the MFP product which is the copy source can be specified by a countermeasure such as adding a tracking pattern to the fraudulent image information or the like, is provided. However, in the scanner function, even if the aforementioned countermeasure is executed, there is the possibility that the image information will be processed after reading the image information. Therefore, at the time of fetching by scanning, processing such as replacing an image which is inappropriate for output with another image, or the like is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Then, at the time of scanning, with respect to a region determined to be fraudulent image information, due to the fraudulent image information being replaced with a mask signal such as a black signal or a white signal which is prepared in advance, the fraudulent image information is prevented from being copied.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in a conventional apparatus, in collation processing with paper moneys, securities, or the like, real-time processing is difficult, and much processing time is required. Therefore, after image information is once stored in a memory, it is necessary to again read the image information for which collation processing has been completed. Therefore, there are the problems that a dedicated memory is required, and the costs increases, and further, time for writing and reading image information is needed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide an image forming apparatus which does not need a memory dedicated for collation processing, and which can reduce costs, by using a delay circuit having a delay time corresponding to collation processing with a specific image for preventing counterfeiting, and a method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to achieve the above object, according to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image forming apparatus comprising: a collating section which collates provided image information with a specific image, and determines whether or not there is a same portion; a delay section which receives the image information, and outputs the image information at least after delaying the image information in accordance with time spent on collation processing by the collating section; an eliminating section which, when the collating section determines that the same portion as in the specific image is included in the image information, substantially eliminates at least the same portion from the image information outputted from the delay section and outputs it; and an image forming section which carries out image formation on a recording medium in accordance with at least one of the image information supplied from the delay section and the image information in which the same portion has been eliminated by the eliminating section.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As described above, in the present invention, in a case of carrying out counterfeiting prevention by collating the image information read by a scanner with a specific image intended to prevent counterfeiting of paper moneys, securities, or the like in a color copying machine, a delay circuit corresponding to the processing time of the collation processing is provided in order to achieve a reduction in costs by omitting a dedicated memory device for the collation processing needing comparatively much time. In accordance therewith, because there is no need to prepare a memory device in which image information read by a scanner is stored in the memory until the collation processing is completed in the conventional apparatus, it is possible to achieve a large reduction in costs by making the structure be compact.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Note that, in the delay circuit at this time, focusing on the fact that, for example, line delay processing formed from a memory is originally built-in in a color MFP product whose printing system is a tandem engine in order to adjust the output timing for each color plate, the memory for the line delay processing can be used in common. In accordance therewith, a dedicated memory circuit for image information is not necessary in order to ensure delay of the processing time in the collation processing at the time of scanning, and a large cost reduction effect can be obtained.</p>

<p id="h-0006" num="0000">&lt;Collation Processing and Delay Processing which are the Features of the Present Invention&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the image forming apparatus having the structure described above, an example of the structure realizing collation processing and the delay processing thereof which are the features of the present invention is shown, centering on the image processing apparatus <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing an image processing apparatus which is the feature portion of the image forming apparatus according to the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image processing apparatus <b>20</b> has a pre high image quality processing section <b>102</b> which receives an image signal read by the scanner <b>62</b> and which carries out high image quality processing, a collation processing section <b>101</b> carrying out collation with an image such as, for example, paper money, securities, or the like which is the object of counterfeiting prevention from the image signal, and an identifying processing section <b>105</b> for detecting a region identifying signal of image information. Moreover, the image processing apparatus <b>20</b> has a post high image quality processing section <b>103</b> receiving output of the pre high image quality processing section <b>102</b> and output of the identifying processing section <b>105</b>. A selector <b>107</b> receiving a collation signal DSC, which is the collated result from the collation processing section <b>101</b>, is provided in the image processing apparatus <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Moreover, the image processing apparatus <b>20</b> has a line delay processing section <b>104</b> which receives a high image quality signal of the post high image quality processing section <b>103</b>, and which considers a delay time for each color signal at the time of carrying out image formation for each of the four photosensitive drums <b>21</b>Y, <b>21</b>M, <b>21</b>C, and <b>21</b>B described above and are tandem types, and considers a delay time at the collation processing section <b>101</b>. The image processing apparatus <b>20</b> has the selector section <b>107</b> which receives image information DATa from the line delay processing section <b>104</b> and image information DATb from a test pattern generation processing section <b>106</b> generating a pattern superposed on image information for preventing counterfeiting, and which outputs a synthesized image DAT in accordance with the collation signal DSC. The output DAT of the selector section <b>107</b> is outputted to the printer engine <b>63</b>, and is formed as an image. However, the output DAT of the selector section <b>107</b> may be outputted to the exterior via a network N.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition, in the line delay processing section <b>104</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> which is a detailed block diagram of the line delay processing section, selectors <b>111</b> through <b>114</b>, to which scanner input signals R, G, B and image signals separated for each color signal of Y, M, C, K are supplied, are provided. Further, in the MFP having a tandem type engine, line delay circuits <b>121</b> through <b>124</b> of the four colors of printing inks which are necessary for adjusting the printing timing are provided (at this time, there is a case in which the Y line delay time itself is 0). This delay time is time of delay aiming for adjusting the timing with the delay time for the collation processing. Moreover, a Y laser driver <b>131</b>, an M laser driver <b>132</b>, a C laser driver <b>133</b>, and a K laser driver <b>134</b>, to which the delayed respective color image signals are inputted, are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In accordance with the image processing apparatus <b>20</b> having such a structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, image processing accompanying appropriate delay processing as follows is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Namely, the image information provided from the scanner <b>62</b> is supplied to the collation processing section <b>101</b>, the pre high image quality processing section <b>102</b>, and the identifying processing section <b>105</b>. The pre high image quality processing section <b>102</b> reads a specific image such as a paper money, a security, or the like which is stored in a storing region included in the collation processing section <b>101</b>, and collates the specific image with the image information read by the scanner <b>62</b>, in order to determine whether or not the image information read by the scanner <b>62</b> is not an image to be an object of counterfeiting prevention such as paper moneys/ securities. The result of this collation processing is supplied as the collation signal DSC to the selector <b>107</b> at the latter stage.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At this time, what should be noted that, because the collation processing at this time is collation processing in which a plurality of color images are compared with one another, a processing time t<sub>1 </sub>becomes a extremely long time such as, as one example, 0.1 to 0.8 seconds. On the other hand, a processing time t<sub>2 </sub>of the pre high image quality processing section <b>102</b>, a processing time t<sub>3 </sub>of the post high image quality processing section <b>102</b>, and a processing time t<sub>2</sub>′ of the identifying processing section are respectively less than or equal to 1 msec which is extremely short. There is a great disparity of 100 times or more in the difference between the both.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is necessary to adjust the timings between the long collation processing time t<sub>1 </sub>and the other extremely short times t<sub>2</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>′, t<sub>3 </sub>(less than or equal to 1 msec) of the high image quality processings and the identifying processing. In a conventional apparatus, a dedicated memory for temporarily storing image information is provided, and this has led to the problems of high costs and increased complexity of operations.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the present invention, as one example, it is supposed that the delay times of the delay circuits <b>121</b> through <b>124</b> for each line of the line delay processing section <b>104</b> are a delay time t<sub>4 </sub>which aims to coordinate timing with the processing time t<sub>1 </sub>of the collation processing section <b>101</b> (it must not be t<sub>1</sub>=t<sub>2</sub>). In accordance therewith, without a new delay circuit being provided, and due to the apparatus being structured such that a memory for delaying collation processing is unnecessary, the most efficient reduction in costs can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Moreover, in this way, when the collation processing section <b>101</b> determines that image information, which is to be an object of counterfeiting prevention, is included in the image information DATa in which processing timings are coordinated, the determination is informed to the selector <b>107</b> by the collation signal DSC.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Here, the test pattern generation processing section <b>106</b> is a circuit generating a test pattern for eliminating such an image to be an object of counterfeiting prevention. Further, for example, this elimination of the image is carried out by a method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by synthesizing processing of the selector <b>107</b> in accordance with the collation signal DSC by using the pattern of the test pattern generating section <b>106</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when a non-output region of a document is detected, a method A and a method B are painting-out methods. In the method A, due to the pattern generated in the test pattern generation processing section <b>106</b> being synthesized with an inappropriate non-output region, the output value only at the inappropriate region is FFhex. In the method B, the output values at all vicinities of the inappropriate non-output region are FFhex. A method C is voiding processing, and the output value only at the inappropriate non-output region is Ohex. Pattern data as shown in this example can be outputted by setting in advance at the test pattern generation section <b>106</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As described above in detail with reference to the drawings, by carrying out delay processing in accordance with the collation processing for preventing counterfeiting, a dedicated memory which had been conventionally needed becomes unnecessary, and a large reduction in costs is possible. Further, in particular, in an MFP structured from a tandem engine, at the time of using a scanner function, a delay circuit needed as a function for preventing counterfeiting can be used in common. Therefore, an image forming apparatus which can largely reduce the costs and a method thereof can be provided, as compared with an MFP conventionally needing a dedicated memory as a component of a counterfeiting preventing circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In accordance with the various embodiments described above, those skilled in the art can realize the present invention. However, it is easy for those skilled in the art to further conceive of various modified examples of these embodiments, and the present invention can be applied to various embodiments without inventive ability. Accordingly, the present invention extends over a broad range which does not contradict the disclosed principles and the novel features, and is not limited to the embodiments described above.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above in detail, in accordance with the present invention, by using the delay circuit having a delay time corresponding to collation processing with a specific image in order to prevent counterfeiting, an image forming apparatus which does not need a dedicated memory for collation processing and which can reduce costs, and a method thereof can be provided.</p>
