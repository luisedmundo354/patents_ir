<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims, under 35 U.S.C. § 119, the priority benefit of Patent Application No. P2003-053540 filed on Aug. 1, 2003 in Republic of Korea; and Patent Application No. P2003-054954 filed on Aug. 8, 2003 in Republic of Korea. The entire contents of each of these applications are herein fully incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a portable computer, and more particularly, to a supporting apparatus of a portable computer for stably supporting an installation state of the portable computer in use.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Examples of a portable computer, which is a computer adapted to be portable, are a notebook computer, a tablet computer, and the like. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a general notebook computer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the notebook computer, a main body <b>1</b> and a display unit <b>3</b> are generally connected to each other through hinge portions <b>5</b>, so that the display unit <b>3</b> can be folded onto the main body <b>1</b> for storage. The notebook computer is unfolded for use as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The main body <b>1</b> is formed in a generally flat plate shape. A main board and other various parts constituting the notebook computer are installed in the main body <b>1</b>. The upper surface of the main body <b>1</b> is provided with a keyboard <b>7</b> as an input device. The display unit <b>3</b> is provided with a display <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the display unit <b>3</b> is folded or unfolded with respect to the main body <b>1</b> through the hinge portions <b>5</b> in the notebook computer constituted as above, if an angle between the display <b>8</b> of the display unit <b>3</b> and the main body <b>1</b> becomes large, the center of gravity of the notebook computer moves toward the display unit <b>3</b>, so that the main body <b>1</b> may be raised, rendering the use of the computer difficult. In order to prevent the raising of the main body <b>1</b>, then the weight and size of the main body <b>1</b> are increased.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the meantime, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a tablet computer <b>10</b>, which is integrally provided with a display <b>13</b>, is used as a portable computer. Such a tablet computer <b>10</b> may be used in a state where a keyboard <b>15</b> is attached thereto. The tablet computer <b>10</b> is formed in a flat plate shape and the entire surface thereof is formed with the display <b>13</b>. Since the display <b>13</b> has a touch screen function, data input can be made with a stylus pen.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The keyboard <b>15</b> is also formed in a flat plate shape having nearly the same area size as the main body <b>11</b>. A plurality of keys <b>16</b> for inputting information are arranged on the keyboard <b>15</b>. A swivel hinge <b>17</b> is provided at the rear end of the keyboard <b>15</b>. The swivel hinge <b>17</b> is for rotating the tablet computer <b>10</b> with the keyboard <b>15</b> connected thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The swivel hinge <b>17</b> is provided with a rotating plate <b>18</b>. The rotating plate <b>18</b> is provided at the keyboard <b>15</b> and then rotates. In addition, the rotating plate <b>18</b> is provided with a connecting plate <b>19</b>. A connecting bracket <b>20</b> is installed in the connecting plate <b>19</b>, wherein the tablet computer <b>10</b> is mounted on the connecting bracket <b>20</b>. The connecting bracket <b>20</b> is extended right and left from the connecting plate <b>19</b> at a predetermined length.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The connecting bracket <b>20</b> is provided with engaging hooks <b>22</b> for engagement with the tablet computer <b>10</b> at both sides of the connecting bracket <b>20</b>. The connecting bracket <b>20</b> is also provided with a connector <b>21</b>, which is used in electric connection for transmitting the information inputted through the keyboard <b>15</b> to the tablet computer <b>10</b>. The connector <b>21</b> is connected to a connector, which is provided at a corresponding position of the tablet computer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Since the tablet computer <b>10</b> is connected to the connecting bracket <b>20</b> of the keyboard <b>15</b>, the tablet computer <b>10</b> can be folded and unfolded with respect to the keyboard <b>15</b> as a notebook computer and can be rotated about the swivel hinge <b>17</b> in use.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The above computers, however, have problems as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">First, in order for the notebook computer to maintain a stable installation state regardless of an unfolded angle of the display unit <b>3</b> with respect to the main body <b>1</b>, there is the problem that the weight and size of the main body <b>1</b> need to be increased. But, this goes against providing a light and compact design. Such a problem is more serious in the tablet computer <b>10</b>. The tablet computer <b>10</b> is provided with all the various parts constituting a computer as well as the display <b>13</b>. Therefore, the tablet computer <b>10</b> is generally heavier than the main body <b>1</b> of the notebook computer, which causes the keyboard <b>15</b> to be raised significantly when the table computer <b>10</b> is unfolded.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, when the keyboard <b>15</b> functions only as a keyboard, since the keyboard <b>15</b> does not have any parts other than the parts related to the keys <b>16</b>, the keyboard <b>15</b> becomes relatively light. However, in such a case, the tablet computer <b>10</b> cannot be supported by the keyboard <b>15</b> when the tablet computer <b>10</b> is mounted to the keyboard <b>15</b>, and the keyboard <b>15</b> will be raised. To address this problem, the keyboard <b>15</b> and the tablet computer <b>10</b> may have the same size, and if necessary, a weight can be added to the keyboard <b>15</b>. But this results in a heavier and larger tablet computer and keyboard, which makes it difficult to carry and use the computer.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Unfortunately, in the portable computers according to the related art, the schemes for stabilizing the support structures are in fact obstacles to providing a light and compact portable computer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly, the present invention is conceived to solve the aforementioned problems and other problems in the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is an object of the present invention to provide a supporting apparatus of a portable computer for stabilizing an installation state of the portable computer for its use.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is another object of the present invention to provide a supporting apparatus of a portable computer, which is light and compact as well as stabilizes the installation state of the portable computer for its use.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a supporting apparatus of a portable computer, which automatically acts to stabilize the installation state of the portable computer for its use.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a supporting apparatus for a portable computer, the portable computer including a base part and a pivoting part pivotally coupled to the base part, the apparatus comprising: a support structure projecting from side rear portions of the base part, so as to provide support for a pivoting of the pivoting part.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of a supporting apparatus of a portable computer according to the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the present application, a “floor” means any surface that provides support, and is not limited to a floor of a room or area.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view showing a first embodiment of a supporting apparatus of a portable computer according to the present invention; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>to <b>4</b><i>c </i>are respectively a plane view, a side view, and a bottom view showing the state that a supporting leg of the supporting apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is projected from a keyboard body; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>c </i>are respectively a plane view, a side view, and a bottom view showing the state that the supporting leg of the supporting apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is received in the keyboard body.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the portable computer is a tablet computer <b>50</b> (pivoting portion). The tablet computer <b>50</b> is optionally mounted on a keyboard <b>60</b> (base portion) and may be pivotally unfolded from the keyboard <b>60</b> at a predetermined angle for use. The tablet computer <b>50</b> includes a display <b>52</b> that occupies nearly the entire surface of the tablet computer <b>50</b>. The tablet computer <b>50</b> is formed in a flat plate shape. Various parts constituting the tablet computer <b>50</b> are installed therein. The display <b>52</b> provided in the tablet computer <b>50</b> generally has a function of a touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The keyboard <b>60</b>, which is optionally connected to the table computer <b>50</b>, is formed in a flat plate shape. The keyboard <b>60</b> is generally manufactured so that the shapes and areas of the corresponding surfaces of the tablet computer <b>50</b> and the keyboard <b>60</b> accord with each other. But is possible to have the keyboard <b>60</b> be smaller than the table computer <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The appearance of the keyboard <b>60</b> is formed by an upper case <b>61</b> and a lower case <b>61</b>′. A plurality of keys <b>62</b> are arranged at the upper surface of the keyboard <b>60</b>. The keys <b>62</b>, through which information is inputted by users and each of which has its own function, are arranged in parallel in several rows. The keys <b>62</b> are arranged at a retracted position from the front end of the upper surface of the keyboard <b>60</b>. Thus, a space between the front end of the upper surface of the keyboard <b>60</b> and the keys <b>62</b> is provided with an armrest <b>62</b>′for supporting users' arms during typing.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c</i>, rotational center portions <b>63</b> are provided at both sides of the rear end of the keyboard <b>60</b>. A connecting bracket <b>64</b> is installed in the rotational center portions <b>63</b>. The connecting bracket <b>64</b> rotates with respect to the rotational center portions <b>63</b>, so that the tablet computer <b>50</b> can be pivotally folded and unfolded with respect to the keyboard <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Engaging hooks <b>65</b> are provided at both ends of the connecting bracket <b>64</b>. The engaging hooks <b>65</b> function to engage the connecting bracket <b>64</b> and the tablet computer <b>50</b>. The connecting bracket <b>64</b> is provided with a connector <b>66</b>. The connector <b>66</b> functions to electrically connect the keyboard <b>60</b> and the tablet computer <b>50</b>. The connector <b>66</b> is connected to a connector provided in the tablet computer <b>50</b> at the same time when the tablet computer <b>50</b> is mounted on the connecting bracket <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the meantime, a supporting leg <b>70</b> is installed at the rear end of the keyboard <b>60</b>. The supporting leg <b>70</b> may be manufactured, for example, by bending a wire of a relatively large diameter into a “Π”-shape. The supporting leg <b>70</b> may be formed by injection molding. Connecting portions <b>71</b> are formed at both ends of the supporting leg <b>70</b> in parallel. The connecting portions <b>71</b> are received into receiving portions (grooves) of the keyboard <b>60</b> that are extending along side edge portions of the keyboard <b>60</b>, or projected at a predetermined length for supporting the keyboard <b>60</b>, to which the tablet computer <b>50</b> is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The connecting portions <b>71</b> of the supporting leg <b>70</b> are formed with stoppers so that the supporting leg <b>70</b> does not get detached completely from the keyboard <b>60</b> or is selectively fixed at certain positions.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The portions of the supporting leg <b>70</b>, except for the connecting portions <b>71</b> of the supporting leg <b>70</b>, are provided with a protecting member <b>72</b>. When the supporting leg <b>70</b> is formed, for example, of metal, the protecting member <b>72</b> surrounds the supporting leg <b>70</b> and then protects its periphery from being damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the supporting leg <b>70</b> is projected from the keyboard <b>60</b> so as to support the tablet computer <b>50</b> coupled thereto, the protecting member <b>72</b> is rested on a floor where the tablet computer <b>50</b> and the keyboard <b>60</b> are supported, so that the height of the whole keyboard <b>60</b> structure is generally uniformly maintained and then the keyboard <b>60</b> is stably supported without motion.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, when the connecting portions <b>71</b> of the supporting leg <b>70</b> are inserted into the rear side portions of the keyboard <b>60</b>, the protecting member <b>72</b> comes in contact with inlets of the receiving portions of the keyboard <b>60</b>, which is fully shown in “A” of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>. As a result, if the connecting portions <b>71</b> of the supporting leg <b>70</b> are inserted fully into the keyboard <b>60</b>, only the protecting member <b>72</b> appears and the protecting member <b>72</b> completes the overall shape of the keyboard <b>60</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>b </i>and <b>5</b><i>c</i>. Therefore, if the protecting member <b>72</b> and the keyboard <b>60</b> are made of the same material, the use of the keyboard <b>60</b> with the supporting legs <b>70</b> inserted therein achieves a sense and appearance of unity.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Friction members <b>74</b> are installed on the bottom of the protecting member <b>72</b> of the supporting leg <b>70</b>. Predetermined frictional forces are generated between the friction members <b>74</b> and the floor supporting the keyboard <b>60</b>, causing the keyboard <b>60</b> not to move arbitrarily. Since the friction members <b>74</b> are provided on the bottom of the protecting member <b>72</b>, the friction members <b>74</b> also practically cause the height of the whole keyboard <b>60</b> to be constantly and uniformly maintained. The friction members <b>74</b> are provided at both sides of the bottom of the protecting member <b>72</b> of the supporting leg <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The operation of the supporting apparatus of the present invention with the above constitutions will be explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">First, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>are side views showing the state that the tablet computer <b>50</b> is mounted on the keyboard <b>60</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. That is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>is a side view showing that the tablet computer <b>50</b> is pivotally unfolded with respect to the upper surface of the keyboard <b>60</b>; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>is a side view showing that the tablet computer <b>50</b> is pivotally folded onto the upper surface of the keyboard <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, the supporting leg <b>70</b> is projected from the rear end of the keyboard <b>60</b> and supported on the floor, so that the tablet computer <b>50</b> is mounted on the keyboard <b>60</b> for use in various states. That is, even though the tablet computer <b>50</b> is pivotally pulled back at a considerable angle from the rear end of the keyboard <b>60</b>, the front end of the keyboard <b>60</b> would not be raised. Thus, in the present invention, by adjustably controlling the length of the supporting leg <b>70</b> projected from the keyboard <b>60</b> (i.e., the amount that the leg <b>70</b> is extended out from the read end of the keyboard <b>60</b>), an unfolded angle of the tablet computer <b>50</b> can be effectively set up variously.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the meantime, the supporting leg <b>70</b> may be fully received into the keyboard <b>60</b>. Such a state is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, and <b>6</b><i>b</i>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>shows that the supporting leg <b>70</b> is inserted completely into the keyboard <b>60</b> and the tablet computer <b>50</b> is folded completely onto the keyboard <b>60</b>. In such a state, the tablet computer <b>50</b> can be portable together with the keyboard <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, a user can extend out the supporting leg <b>70</b> from the keyboard <b>60</b>, causing the keyboard <b>60</b>, to which the tablet computer <b>50</b> is mounted, to be stably supported on the floor. At this time, if the angle between the front surface of the tablet computer <b>50</b> and the upper surface of the keyboard <b>60</b> is large, the supporting leg <b>70</b> can be further pulled out to extend from the keyboard <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9</figref><i>b </i>show a second embodiment of the supporting apparatus of the portable computer according to the present invention. According to this embodiment, the portable computer illustrated in the present embodiment is a tablet computer <b>150</b>, wherein the tablet computer <b>150</b> (pivoting portion) is mounted on a keyboard <b>160</b> (base portion) and then is pivotally unfolded at predetermined angles for use. A display <b>152</b> occupies nearly the entire front surface of the tablet computer <b>150</b>. The tablet computer <b>150</b> is formed in a flat plate shape. Various parts constituting the tablet computer are installed therein. The display <b>152</b> provided in the tablet computer <b>150</b> generally has a function of a touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The keyboard <b>160</b>, which is optionally connected to the tablet computer <b>150</b> for use, is formed in a flat plate shape. The keyboard <b>160</b> is generally manufactured so that the shapes and areas of the corresponding surfaces of the tablet computer <b>150</b> and the keyboard <b>160</b> accord with each other. It is also possible to have the keyboard <b>160</b> that is smaller than the tablet computer <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The appearance of the keyboard <b>160</b> is formed by an upper case <b>161</b> and a lower case <b>161</b>′. A plurality of keys <b>162</b> are arranged at the upper surface of the keyboard <b>160</b>. The keys <b>162</b>, through which information is input by users and each of which has its own function, are arranged in parallel in several rows. The keys <b>162</b> are arranged at a retracted position from the front end of the upper surface of the keyboard <b>160</b>. Thus, a space between the front end of the upper surface of the keyboard <b>160</b> and the keys <b>162</b> is provided with an armrest <b>162</b>‘for supporting users' arms during typing.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Hinge portions <b>163</b> are provided at both sides of the rear end of the keyboard <b>160</b>. A connecting bracket <b>164</b> is installed in the hinge portions <b>163</b>. The connecting bracket <b>164</b> rotates with respect to the hinge portions <b>163</b>, so that the tablet computer <b>150</b> can be pivotally folded and unfolded with respect to the keyboard <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Engaging hooks <b>165</b> are provided at both ends of the connecting bracket <b>164</b>. The engaging hooks <b>165</b> serve to engage the connecting bracket <b>164</b> and the tablet computer <b>150</b>. The connecting bracket <b>164</b> is provided with a connector <b>166</b>. The connector <b>166</b> functions to electrically connect the keyboard <b>160</b> and the tablet computer <b>150</b>. The connector <b>166</b> is connected to a connector provided in the tablet computer <b>150</b> at the same time when the tablet computer <b>150</b> is mounted on the connecting bracket <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the meantime, a supporting leg <b>170</b> is installed at the rear end of the keyboard <b>160</b>. The supporting leg <b>170</b> may be manufactured, for example, by bending a wire of a relatively large diameter into a “π”-shape. The supporting leg <b>170</b> may be formed through the injection molding. Connecting portions <b>171</b> are formed at both ends of the supporting leg <b>170</b> in parallel. The connecting portions <b>171</b> are received into receiving portions (grooves) formed and extending along the side edge portions of the keyboard <b>160</b>, or projected at a predetermined length for supporting the keyboard <b>160</b>, to which the tablet computer <b>150</b> is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The connecting portions <b>171</b> of the supporting leg <b>170</b> may be formed with such structures that the supporting leg <b>170</b> does not get detached from the keyboard <b>160</b> arbitrarily or is selectively fixed certain positions.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The portions of the supporting leg <b>170</b>, except for the connecting portions <b>171</b> of the supporting leg <b>170</b>, are provided with a protecting member <b>172</b>. When the supporting leg <b>170</b> is formed, for example, of metal, the protecting member <b>172</b> surrounds the supporting leg <b>170</b> and then protects its periphery from being damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the supporting leg <b>170</b> is projected from the keyboard <b>160</b> so as to support the tablet computer <b>150</b> coupled thereto, the protecting member <b>172</b> is rested on the floor, so that the height of the whole keyboard <b>160</b> is uniformly maintained and then the keyboard <b>160</b> is stably supported without motion.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition, when the connecting portions <b>171</b> of the supporting leg <b>170</b> are inserted into the rear portions of the keyboard <b>160</b>, the protecting member <b>172</b> comes in contact with inlets of the receiving portions of the keyboard <b>160</b>. Thus, if the connecting portions <b>171</b> of the supporting leg <b>170</b> are inserted fully into the rear side portions of the keyboard <b>160</b> and positioned in a space between the upper case <b>161</b> and the lower case <b>161</b>′, only the protecting member <b>172</b> appears and the protecting member <b>172</b> completes the overall shape of the keyboard <b>160</b>. Therefore, if the protecting member <b>172</b> and the keyboard <b>160</b> are the same material, an appearance of the keyboard <b>160</b> with the supporting leg <b>170</b> received therein may achieve a sense of unity.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Friction members <b>174</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>) are installed on the bottom of the protecting member <b>172</b> of the supporting leg <b>170</b>. Predetermined frictional forces are generated between the friction members <b>174</b> and the floor supporting the keyboard <b>160</b>, causing the keyboard <b>160</b> not to move arbitrarily. Since the friction members <b>174</b> are provided on the bottom of the protecting member <b>172</b>, the friction members <b>174</b> also practically cause the height of the whole keyboard <b>160</b> to be constantly and uniformly maintained. The friction members <b>174</b> are provided at both sides of the bottom of the protecting member <b>172</b> of the supporting leg <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, at least one of the connecting portions <b>171</b> of the supporting leg <b>170</b> is formed with a plurality of stopper holes <b>173</b>. The plurality of stopper holes <b>173</b> are formed at predetermined intervals, but need not be formed at constant intervals. It is preferable that the stopper holes <b>173</b> are formed in both connecting portions <b>171</b>, which are provided at both ends of the supporting leg <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The supporting leg <b>170</b> is subjected to an elastic force in a direction where the supporting leg <b>170</b> is projected out of the keyboard <b>160</b>. That is, elastic members <b>175</b> are installed in the keyboard <b>160</b>, so that the supporting leg <b>170</b> can be projected out of the keyboard <b>160</b>. In the present embodiment, each elastic member <b>175</b> comprises, but is not limited to, a coil spring. The elastic members <b>175</b> may also comprise any constitution providing an elastic force in a direction to which the supporting leg <b>170</b> is projected out. Each elastic member <b>175</b> is installed in the keyboard <b>160</b> and is used to fix an end of the elastic member <b>175</b> to the inner space of the keyboard <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Constitutions for controlling a length of the supporting leg <b>170</b> projected from the rear side of the keyboard <b>160</b> will be explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>, two through installation holes <b>180</b> are formed respectively in the upper case <b>161</b> of both ends of the keyboard <b>160</b>. Annular grooves <b>181</b> corresponding to the through installation holes <b>180</b> are formed on the inner surface of the upper case <b>161</b>. Each of the annular grooves <b>181</b> is formed by an installation member <b>183</b> in the present embodiment. The installation members <b>183</b> are provided on the inner surface of the upper case <b>161</b> and form the annular grooves <b>181</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A leg stopper <b>185</b> is installed in each of the through installation holes <b>180</b>. Each leg stopper <b>185</b> is selectively rested in one of the stopper holes <b>173</b> formed on each of the connecting portions <b>171</b> of the supporting leg <b>170</b>, whereby the length of the supporting leg <b>170</b> projected out of the keyboard <b>160</b> can be varied. Each leg stopper <b>185</b> is installed in the corresponding through installation hole <b>180</b>, so that the upper surface and the lower surface of the leg stoppers <b>185</b> are somewhat projected from the upper surface of the upper case <b>161</b> and the lower surface of the installation member <b>183</b>, respectively. The lower surface of each leg stopper <b>185</b>, which is a latching portion <b>185</b>′, is sized so as to be rested in the stopper holes <b>173</b>. The surface of the latching portion <b>185</b>′ is a curved surface.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A flange <b>186</b> is formed around the outer periphery surface of each of the leg stoppers <b>185</b>. The flange <b>186</b> is rested in the annular groove <b>181</b>, and then prevents the leg stopper <b>185</b> from being out of place arbitrarily.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The leg stopper <b>185</b> intends that the latching portion <b>185</b>′ of the leg stopper <b>185</b> is projected out of the installation member <b>183</b> by push springs <b>188</b>. The push springs <b>188</b> and the elastic members <b>175</b> are designed so that a force for holding the latching portion <b>185</b>′ in the stopper holes <b>173</b> by the push springs <b>188</b> is smaller than a force for projecting the supporting leg <b>170</b> from the keyboard <b>160</b> by the elastic members <b>175</b>. Thus, at a stage where the supporting leg <b>170</b> is fully inserted in the keyboard <b>160</b>, the supporting leg <b>170</b> can be projected out regardless of the leg stoppers <b>185</b> pushed by the push springs <b>188</b>. This is because the force for holding the latching portion <b>185</b>′ in the stopper holes <b>173</b> is smaller than the force for projecting the supporting leg <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">However, when the supporting leg <b>170</b> is almost projected out of the keyboard <b>160</b>, since the elastic force of the elastic members <b>175</b> does not act further, the leg stoppers <b>185</b> prevent the supporting leg <b>170</b> from being further projected, so that the supporting leg <b>170</b> is not projected out.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">For example, it is preferable that the elastic forces from the elastic members <b>175</b> and the push springs <b>188</b> be designed so that the supporting leg <b>170</b> stops when the leg stoppers <b>185</b> are rested in the stopper holes <b>173</b> provided at the front most ends or the next ones of the connecting portions <b>171</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The leg stoppers <b>185</b> are formed so that the upper surfaces of the leg stoppers <b>185</b> are slightly projected from the upper surface of the upper case <b>161</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>. Due to this configuration, if the tablet computer <b>150</b> is folded onto the upper surface of the keyboard <b>160</b>, the tablet computer <b>150</b> pushes the leg stoppers <b>185</b> downwardly, so that the latching portions <b>185</b>′ become forcibly rested in the stopper holes <b>173</b>. Thus, the supporting leg <b>170</b> is not further projected out even by the force from the elastic members <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the meantime, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>, a locking knob <b>190</b> having a hook portion <b>192</b>, which is selectively hooked to one of the stopper holes <b>173</b> of the connecting portion <b>171</b> by a user's option, may be installed additionally on at least one side surface of the keyboard <b>160</b>. The locking knob <b>190</b> is exposed to the outer side surface of the keyboard <b>160</b>, and then may be operated by a user. In the present embodiment, the locking knob <b>190</b> is provided on the side surface of the keyboard <b>160</b> and is moved upward and downward, so that the hook portion <b>192</b> is selectively hooked to one of the stopper holes <b>173</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The locking knob <b>190</b> is optionally provided. The locking knob <b>190</b> is useful when it is necessary that the supporting leg <b>170</b> be received in the keyboard <b>160</b> in the state that the tablet computer <b>150</b> is not rested onto the keyboard <b>160</b>. In addition, the locking knob <b>190</b> is necessary to fix the supporting leg <b>170</b> that is relatively incompletely projected.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Hereinafter, the operation of the second embodiment according to the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a </i>is a side view showing the state that the tablet computer <b>150</b> is unfolded with respect to the upper surface of the keyboard <b>160</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>b </i>is a side view showing the state that the tablet computer <b>150</b> is folded onto the upper surface of the keyboard <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>, the supporting leg <b>170</b> projects from the rear side ends of the keyboard <b>160</b> and supported on the floor, so that the tablet computer <b>150</b> is mounted on the keyboard <b>160</b> for use in various states. In other words, even though the tablet computer <b>150</b> is pulled back at a considerable angle from the rear end of the keyboard <b>160</b>, the front end of the keyboard <b>160</b> would not be raised.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In such a state, the supporting leg <b>170</b> is projected out of the keyboard <b>160</b> by the elastic force of the elastic members <b>175</b>. When the elastic force from the elastic members <b>175</b> is fully applied and does not act any further, the latching portions <b>185</b>′ of the leg stoppers <b>185</b> are rested in the stopper holes <b>173</b> of the connecting portions <b>171</b> by the elastic forces of the push springs <b>188</b>. Therefore, the supporting leg <b>170</b> is not moved within the keyboard <b>160</b> arbitrarily.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the meantime, the extended supporting leg <b>170</b> may be fully inserted into the keyboard <b>160</b>. Such a state is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>b </i>shows the state that the supporting leg <b>170</b> is fully inserted into the keyboard <b>160</b> and the tablet computer <b>150</b> is folded completely onto the keyboard <b>160</b>. In such a state, the tablet computer <b>150</b> and the keyboard <b>60</b> are aligned and become one portable unit. At this time, the tablet computer <b>150</b> is rested onto the upper surface of the keyboard <b>160</b>, by which the upper surfaces of the leg stoppers <b>185</b> are pushed downwardly. Thus, the latching portions <b>185</b>′ are securely and lockingly rested in the stopper holes <b>173</b> of the connecting portions <b>171</b>, whereby the supporting leg <b>170</b> is prevented from getting out of the keyboard <b>160</b> arbitrarily.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In such a state, if a user unfolds the tablet computer <b>150</b> with respect to the keyboard <b>160</b> in order to use the tablet computer <b>150</b>, the tablet computer <b>150</b> does not push the upper surfaces of the leg stoppers <b>185</b> downwardly. Therefore, the leg stoppers <b>185</b> are lifted against the elastic force of the push springs <b>188</b> by the elastic force, which causes the elastic members <b>175</b> to push the supporting leg <b>170</b> out. Thus, the latching portions <b>185</b>′ of the leg stoppers <b>185</b> get out of the stopper holes <b>173</b>, so that the supporting leg <b>170</b> is projected out of the keyboard <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">If the supporting leg <b>170</b> is almost projected from the keyboard <b>160</b>, the elastic force from the elastic members <b>175</b> does not act further upon the supporting leg <b>170</b>. In addition, the supporting leg <b>170</b> is no more projected since the latching portion <b>185</b>′ of each of the leg stoppers <b>185</b> is hooked to the front most one or the adjacent one of the plurality of stopper holes <b>173</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the meantime, the locking knob <b>190</b> may be optionally employed. For example, as discussed above, the installation state of the supporting leg <b>170</b> can be maintained without the locking knob <b>190</b>. However, in such a case, if the tablet computer <b>150</b> is not rested onto the upper surface of the keyboard <b>160</b>, the supporting leg <b>170</b> may be always projected from the keyboard <b>160</b> to a certain extent.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">However, if the locking knob <b>190</b> is employed, the length of the supporting leg <b>170</b> projected from the keyboard <b>160</b> may be adjusted at desire. That is, even when the tablet computer <b>150</b> is not rested onto the keyboard <b>160</b>, the supporting leg <b>170</b> can be maintained as inserted fully into the keyboard <b>160</b> by locking the locking knob <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In addition, the projecting state of the supporting leg <b>170</b> may be fixed by using the locking knob <b>190</b> when the supporting leg <b>170</b> is projected from the keyboard <b>160</b> to the desired extent.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the meantime, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>, if the keyboard <b>160</b>, to which the tablet computer <b>150</b> is mounted, is stably supported on the floor by projecting the supporting leg <b>170</b> from the keyboard <b>160</b>, an input process through the operation of the keys <b>162</b> of the keyboard <b>160</b> can be performed effectively. At this time, if the angle between the front surface of the tablet computer <b>150</b> and the upper surface of the keyboard <b>160</b> becomes large, the supporting leg <b>170</b> can be further projected from the keyboard <b>160</b> at different positions using the stopper holes <b>173</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Although the supporting apparatus according to the first and second embodiments of the present invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>b </i>have been described for use in a tablet computer provided with a keyboard, the supporting apparatus are equally applicable to any device in which a main body such as a display device is pivotally operated with respect to a base unit such as a keyboard part. For instance, the supporting apparatuses of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>b </i>are fully applicable to computer notebooks.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> show a supporting apparatus for a computer according to a third embodiment of the present invention. According to the figures, in the present embodiment, a pivoting portion <b>250</b> is adapted for pivoting upon hinge units <b>263</b> with respect to a base portion <b>260</b>. The pivoting portion <b>250</b> corresponds to, for example, a display unit of a notebook computer or a main body of a tablet computer. The front surface of the pivoting portion <b>250</b>, i.e., a surface that faces the upper surface of the base portion <b>260</b> when the pivoting portion <b>250</b> is folded onto the base portion <b>260</b>, is provided with a display <b>252</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The base portion <b>260</b>, where the portable computer is supported on a floor, corresponds to, for example, a main body (where a main board, memories, hard disk drive, and the like are provided) of the notebook computer or a keyboard (where a plurality of keys are arranged and which may support the tablet computer) of the tablet computer.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The appearance of the base portion <b>260</b> is defined by combining an upper case <b>261</b> and a lower case <b>261</b>′.

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">A driving gear <b>281</b> is provided so as to rotate coaxially with a rotational center of each of the connecting members <b>265</b>. The driving gear <b>281</b> is connected and mounted to each of the connecting members <b>265</b>. The driving gear <b>281</b> is engaged with a driven gear <b>282</b>. The driven gear <b>282</b> is provided on a rotating shaft <b>284</b>, both the ends of which are supported with bearings <b>283</b> provided in the base portion <b>260</b>. The driven gear <b>282</b> integrally rotates with the rotating shaft <b>284</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The rotating shaft <b>284</b> is formed with the driving pinion <b>286</b> so that they rotate integrally. Thus, the driven gear <b>282</b> and the driving pinion <b>286</b> rotate in the same direction. The driving pinion <b>286</b> is engaged with the rack portion <b>273</b> of each of the supporting legs <b>270</b>, <b>270</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The operation of the supporting apparatus according to the third embodiment of the present invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> with the above constitutions will be explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The operation of the supporting apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a </i>to <b>13</b><i>d </i>sequentially.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">When the pivoting portion <b>250</b> is folded onto the base portion <b>260</b>, the supporting legs <b>270</b>, <b>270</b>′ are fully received in the base portion <b>260</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">If a user applies a force to the pivoting portion <b>250</b> in order to pivotally unfold the pivoting portion <b>250</b> with respect to the base portion <b>260</b>, the pivoting portion <b>250</b> and therefore the connecting members <b>265</b> are rotated. At this time, a rotational direction of the connecting member <b>265</b> is denoted by an arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The rotation of the connecting member <b>265</b> causes the driving gear <b>281</b> to rotate in the same direction, and then the driven gear <b>282</b> engaged with the driving gear <b>281</b> rotates in the direction opposite to the arrow A. Since the driven gear <b>282</b> rotates integrally with the rotating shaft <b>284</b>, the rotation of the rotating shaft <b>284</b> causes the driving pinion <b>286</b> to rotate in the same direction. If the driving pinions <b>286</b> rotates, the power is transmitted to the rack portions <b>273</b> engaged therewith. Thus, the supporting legs <b>270</b>, <b>270</b>′ move along the guide channels <b>260</b>′, so that the leading ends of the supporting legs <b>270</b>, <b>270</b>′ are projected out of the base portion <b>260</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b </i>shows that the supporting legs <b>270</b>, <b>270</b>′ are projected out of the base portion <b>260</b> at a certain length.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">If the user continues to unfold the pivoting portion <b>250</b> so that the unfolded angle becomes larger and the pivoting portion <b>250</b> is continuously rotated with respect to the base portion <b>260</b>, the supporting legs <b>270</b>, <b>270</b>′ are projected further. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>c </i>shows that the supporting legs <b>270</b>, <b>270</b>′ are projected out further than the supporting legs <b>270</b>, <b>270</b>′ shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>d </i>shows that the pivoting portion <b>250</b> is maximally unfolded with respect to the base portion <b>260</b>, when the supporting legs <b>270</b>, <b>270</b>′ are fully projected out of the base portion <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">According to this embodiment, the supporting legs <b>270</b>, <b>270</b>′ are automatically extended out from the base portion <b>260</b> when a user begins to unfold the pivoting portion <b>250</b>. The amount of the supporting legs <b>270</b>, <b>270</b>′ being extended out is automatically controlled according to or proportional to the amount of unfolding by the pivoting portion <b>250</b>. The larger the unfolded angle of the pivoting portion <b>250</b> with respect to the base portion <b>260</b>, the further the projected length of the supporting legs <b>270</b>, <b>270</b>′ from the base portion <b>260</b> is. Also, any other schemes which provide such automatic extension of the legs according to a pivoting angle of the pivoting portion may be used. Thus, the whole portable computer is more securely supported. In particular, even though the center of gravity of the whole portable computer may get out of the base portion <b>260</b> when the pivoting portion <b>250</b> is unfolded, the whole portable computer is always well supported by the supporting legs <b>270</b>, <b>270</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above and is defined by the following claims. It is obvious that various modifications and adaptations can be made without departing from the scope of the claims by those skilled in the art of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">For example, in the embodiments of the present invention, the pivoting portion may be a tablet computer or a display unit of a notebook computer, and the base portion may be a keyboard for the tablet computer or a main body of the notebook computer.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Furthermore, in the illustrated embodiments, the pivoting portion and the base portion are of the same size or of substantially the same size, but can be of different size. In particular, in the case of the tablet computer, the base portion may be smaller than the pivoting portion. That is the reason why according to the present invention, the tablet computer is supported geometrically by the projection of the supporting leg(s) from the base portion.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The supporting apparatus of the portable computer according to the present invention may have functional effects as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">First, the present invention is designed so that the base portion is provided with only necessary parts regardless of the weight or size of the pivoting portion, causing the base portion to be light and compact. Thus, the portable computer also becomes more light and compact.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In addition, according to the present invention, the installation state of the portable computer for use is more stable and a user's convenience is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Furthermore, the supporting leg(s) is automatically projected when the pivoting portion is unfolded with respect to the base portion in the portable computer, which provides convenient use.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Also, the supporting leg(s) for stably supporting the portable computer is projected out only in use according to the unfolded angle of the pivoting portion. Otherwise, the supporting leg(s) is received into the base portion, and thus the appearance of the portable computer is simplified when the portable computer is carried.</p>
