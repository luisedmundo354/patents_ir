<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2005-199018 filed Jul. 7, 2005 and 2006-163733 filed Jun. 13, 2006, which are incorporated hereinto by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a cable connector for electrically connecting one ends of cables to a wiring board.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A cable connector is used in practice for electrically connecting electric parts with each other in the interior of an electronic apparatus. For example, the electric parts are electrically connected to a printed circuit board via a flexible printed circuit board (FPC) or a flexible flat cable (FFC). There are a rotary type and a slide type in the cable connector used in practice, which are different in a method for fixing a cable. As disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2001-357920, Japanese Patent Nos. 3579827 and 2692055 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2002-289284, the rotary type cable connector includes a connector body disposed on a printed circuit board and having a cable accommodating section, a plurality of contact terminals provided in the cable accommodating section of the connector body, for electrically connecting an electrode part of the printed circuit board to a terminal section of a flexible printed circuit board, and an actuator member supported in a rotatable manner relative to the connector body, to be attachable to and/or detachable from contact points in the contact terminals of the terminal section in the flexible printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The connector body has, at one end thereof, an inserting port for allowing the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board to be connected thereto. The inserting port is communicated to a cable accommodating section formed in the interior of the connector body. In a cut portion forming a top of the cable accommodating section in the connector body, opposite ends of a proximal part of the actuator member are supported in a rotatable manner. The actuator member occupies either a locked state in which the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board is sandwiched between a pressing surface and a movable terminal section of the respective contact terminal at a predetermined position or an unlocked state in which the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board is released. In the locked state, a site of action of the actuator member is closer to the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board and generally parallel thereto. On the other hand, in the unlocked state, the actuator member opens the cut portion on the top of the cable accommodating section so that the site of action of the actuating member is separated from the flexible printed circuit board to intersect with a plane in which the terminal section of the circuit board is formed to be rotatable until the site of action abuts to a wall surface forming the above-mentioned cut portion of the connector body. Accordingly, to attach or detach the flexible printed circuit board when the actuator member is in the unlocked state, it is desired that the rotational angle of the actuator member is determined to be relatively large to obtain a large opening of the above-mentioned inserting port so that the attachment/detachment of the flexible printed circuit board becomes easier.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The actuator member has a pressing surface for pushing a back surface of the flexible printed circuit board toward the contact points of the contact terminals described later, while bringing the latter into contact with an end of a part of the actuator member opposed to the cable accommodating section.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A plurality of contact terminals are arranged in the cable accommodating section in correspondence to the arrangement of the terminal section in the electrode part of the flexible printed circuit board. Each of these contact terminals includes a fixed terminal portion soldered to the terminal portion of the printed circuit board, a fixed portion, a movable terminal portion, and a coupling portion for connecting the fixed terminal portion to the fixed portion and the movable terminal portion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A front end of the fixed portion of the respective contact terminal is arranged to be opposed to a concavity formed in the actuator member. The movable terminal portion has, at its front end, a contact point to be electrically connected to the electrode section of the flexible printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A coupling section thereof is-fixed to the connector body by being press-fit to a slit formed adjacent to a cable accommodating section.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In such a structure, the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board is electrically connected to the contact point of the respective contact terminal in the following manner. After the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board is inserted into a position in the vicinity of a rear wall defining a rear side of the cable accommodating section through an inserting port, a front end of the actuator member is made to rotate such that a predetermined locked state is obtained. Accordingly, the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board contacts the contact terminal of the movable terminal portion in the contact terminal and is held there, creating a reliabel electric connection. At that time, the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board is sandwiched between the pressing surface of the actuator member and the elastically deformed movable terminal portion of the respective contact terminal.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When the terminal section on one side of the flexible printed circuit board is connected to the cable connector and the terminal section on the other side of the flexible printed circuit board is connected to electric equipment movably disposed in the interior of the electronic apparatus, a bending moment or a pulling force larger than a predetermined value may be applied to the terminal section on the one side of the flexible circuit board. The repeated reciprocation of the electric equipment, for example, may cause such a load. Consequently, the actuator member may be transferred from the locked state to the unlocked state such that the terminal section of the cable connector on the one side of the flexible printed circuit board comes off of the cable connector.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">While taking the above-mentioned problems into account, an object of the present invention is to provide a cable connector for electrically connecting one end of a cable to a circuit board so that a terminal section of a flexible printed circuit board does not come off of the cable connector even if a pulling force or a bending moment larger than a predetermined value is applied to the terminal section on one side of the flexible printed circuit board, while ensuring sufficient opening of an inserting port.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">To achieve the above-mentioned object, the inventive cable connector comprises a cable accommodating section for accommodating one end of a cable, having contact terminals to be electrically connected to a terminal section of the cable and a positioning portion for positioning the cable terminal section relative to the contact terminals, the cable accommodating section communicating with an opening for allowing the cable terminal section to pass therethrough, and an actuator member disposed in the cable accommodating section for rotating movement. The acutator member has a pressing portion in correspondence to the respective contact terminal, the pressing portion comprising a flat surface and a pressing surface for locking or unlocking an electrode section of the cable terminal section relative to a movable contact part of the respective contact terminal. The pressing portion of the actuator member is movably supported by a fixed portion of the contact terminal. Preferably, the fixed portion of the contact terminal includes an angled (or slanted) portion formed continuous with a concavity allowing the fixed portion of the contact terminal to support the actuator member. The fixed portion of the contact terminal preferably formed opposite the movable contact part of the contact terminal at a predetermined distance. When the actuator member is in a locked state, a position of a site of action in the pressing surface of the actuator member relative to the cable terminal section is nearer to the positioning portion in the cable accommodating section than to a position of the movable contact part.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The inventive cable connector may also comprise a cable accommodating section for accommodating one end of a cable, having contact terminals to be electrically connected to a terminal section of the cable and a positioning portion for positioning the cable terminal section relative to the contact terminals, the cable accommodating section communicating to an opening for allowing the cable terminal section to pass therethrough; and an actuator member disposed in the cable accommodating section for rotating movement. The acutator member preferably comprises a pressing portion in correspondence to the respective contact terminal, the pressing portion comprising a flat surface and a pressing surface for locking or unlocking an electrode section of the cable terminal section inserted into the cable accommodating section relative to a movable contact part of the respective contact terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In such a configuration, the relative position of the center of rotation of the pressing portion of the the actuator member relative to an engagement part of a fixed portion of the contact terminal moves as the actuator member rotates.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As apparent from the above description, according to the inventive cable connector, the respective pressing portion of the actuator member is movably supported on the slant surface consecutive to the concavity formed in the fixed portion opposite the movable contact part of the respective contact terminal at a predetermined gap. Thereby, since a position of the operating portion of the pressing surface of the actuator member is nearer to the inner wall in the cable accommodating section than the movable contact part, a terminal section of a flexible printed circuit board does not come off from the cable connector even if a pulling force or a bending moment larger than a predetermined value is applied to the terminal section on one side of the flexible printed circuit board, while ensuring a sufficient opening of an inserting port.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The above and other objects, effects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description of embodiments thereof taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this regard, a shape of the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>is not limited to this example, but a contact terminal <b>20</b><i>ai </i>having a shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> may be used, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The contact terminal <b>20</b><i>ai </i>includes a soldered fixed portion <b>20</b>S to be electrically connected by soldering to an electrode pad used as a conductive layer of the printed circuit board <b>2</b>, a movable contact portion <b>20</b>A having a contact point <b>20</b><i>a </i>to be electrically connected the electrode group <b>6</b>E of the flexible printed circuit board <b>6</b>, a fixed portion <b>20</b>B having an engagement part to be press-fit into a slit <b>4</b><i>e </i>of the connector body <b>4</b>, the fixed portion for supporting a pressing portion <b>8</b>A of the actuator <b>8</b> described later for rotating movement, and a coupling portion <b>20</b>C for coupling a merging point of the movable contact portion <b>20</b>A and the fixed potion <b>20</b>B to the soldered fixed portion <b>20</b>S.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The engagement part is defined by a flat surface portion <b>20</b>Ge formed at a front end of the fixed portion <b>20</b>B, an arc-shaped portion <b>20</b>Gb continued to the flat surface portion <b>20</b>Ge, and a slant portion <b>20</b>Ga continued to the arc-shaped portion <b>20</b>Gb and having a predetermined inclination. The flat surface portion <b>20</b>Ge is formed at a position through which the flat surface <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the pressing portion <b>8</b>A of the actuator <b>8</b> described later passes. A length of the flat surface portion <b>20</b>Ge extending from an end of the arc-shaped portion <b>20</b>Gb is longer than the corresponding length in the above-mentioned contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai. </i>Thereby, when the flexible printed circuit board <b>6</b> is mounted, the engagement of the respective pressing portion of the actuator <b>8</b> to the engagement part thereof is more ensured as a whole.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">On the other end of the short side of the actuator member <b>8</b>, an operating part for coupling the respective short sides of the actuator member <b>8</b> extends in the longitudinal direction of the actuator member <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thereby, the actuator member <b>8</b> supported rotatably via the bearings <b>4</b>BE of the connector body <b>4</b> occupies a locked position wherein the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board <b>6</b> is pinched between the pressing surface <b>8</b><i>c </i>and the movable terminal portion <b>10</b>A of the respective contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and an unlocked position wherein the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board <b>6</b> is released as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. That is, in the locked position, the actuator member <b>8</b> is generally parallel to the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board <b>6</b>, and in the unlocked position, the actuator member <b>8</b> opens the opening <b>4</b>AP of the cable accommodating section <b>4</b>A, intersects with a surface on which the terminal section of the flexible printed circuit board <b>6</b> is formed, and is rotational moveable until it is brought into contact with the slant <b>4</b>SL of the connector body <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to a first method for assembling the actuator member <b>8</b> and the plurality of contact terminals <b>10</b><i>ai </i>in predetermined positions of the connector body <b>4</b>, after the supporting shafts <b>8</b>J of the actuator member <b>8</b> are placed on the bearings <b>4</b>BE, the outer periphery of the fastening member <b>12</b> is first inserted into the groove <b>4</b>G. Then, after the actuator member <b>8</b> is located at the above-mentioned unlocked position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>is press-fit into the interior of the connector body <b>4</b> in the direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> via the slit <b>4</b>S while front ends of the movable contact terminal portion <b>10</b>A and the fixed portion <b>10</b>B are at the head thereof.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, the flat surface portion <b>10</b>Ge of the contact terminal <b>19</b><i>ai </i>is further press-fitted in the same direction. At that time, since there is the arc-shaped portion <b>10</b>Gb of the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>functioning also as a play for avoiding the interference, the engagement is smoothly carried out without being interfered with the flat surface <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the pressing portion <b>8</b>A in the actuator member <b>8</b>. And, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref>, the flat surface portion <b>10</b>Ge of the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>is further pushed in the connector body <b>4</b> in the same direction until the sliding surface <b>8</b><i>d </i>touches to the slant part <b>10</b>Ga, whereby the attachment of the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>to the connector body <b>4</b> is completed.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to a second method for assembling the actuator member <b>8</b> and the plurality of contact terminals <b>10</b><i>ai </i>with predetermined positions of the connector body <b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A to 15D</figref>, after the supporting shafts <b>8</b>J of the actuator member <b>8</b> are placed on the bearings <b>4</b>BE, the outer periphery of the fastening member <b>12</b> is first inserted into the groove <b>4</b>G. Then, after the actuator member <b>8</b> is located at the above-mentioned locked position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>), the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>is press-fitted into the interior of the connector body <b>4</b> in the direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> via the slit <b>4</b>S while front ends of the movable contact terminal portion <b>10</b>A and the fixed portion <b>10</b>B are at the head thereof. At that time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> in enlarged dimension, a position of the sliding surface <b>8</b><i>d </i>of the pressing portion <b>8</b>A in the actuator member <b>8</b> are set to have a predetermined gap CL from a plane common to the flat surfaces <b>10</b>Ge of the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai. </i></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>, the flat surface portion <b>10</b>Ge of the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>is further press-fitted in the same direction. At that time, since there is the arc-shaped portion <b>10</b>Gb of the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>functioning also as a play for avoiding the interference, the engagement is smoothly carried out without being interfered with the pressing portion <b>8</b>A in the actuator member <b>8</b>. And, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 15D</figref>, the flat surface portion <b>10</b>Ge of the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>is further pushed into the connector body <b>4</b> in the same direction until the sliding surface <b>8</b><i>d </i>touches to the slant part <b>10</b>Ga, whereby the attachment of the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>to the connector body <b>4</b> is completed. Accordingly, in the same manner as in the above-mentioned first method, when the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>is attached to the connector body <b>4</b>, there is no risk in that the pressing portion <b>8</b>A of the actuator member <b>8</b> is excessively scraped by the front end of the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai. </i>That is, even if the actuator member <b>8</b> is either in the unlocked position or in the locked position, it is possible to easily attach the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>to the connector body <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In such a structure, when the group of the electrode <b>6</b>E (the back plate <b>6</b>B) of the flexible printed circuit board <b>6</b> to the respective contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai, </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 16A</figref>, a front end of the back plate <b>6</b>B of the flexible printed circuit board <b>6</b> is inserted into the opening <b>4</b>AP while keeping the actuator member <b>8</b> in the unlocked state until it touches to the inner wall <b>4</b><i>a </i>forming the rear side of the cable accommodating section <b>4</b>A. Thereafter, the operating part of the actuator member <b>8</b> is made to rotate counterclockwise as indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> to move toward the locked state.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">At that time, since the sliding surface <b>8</b><i>d </i>of the rotating actuator member <b>8</b> is guided while sliding along the slant part <b>10</b>Ga of the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai, </i>the flat surface <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the pressing portion <b>8</b>A is somewhat moved forward while rotating until it is brought into contact with the back plate <b>6</b>B. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>, a relative position P<b>1</b> of the center of rotation of the pressing portion <b>8</b>A relative to the engagement part in the initial position begins to move along a predetermined locus toward a relative position P<b>2</b> of the center of rotation relative to the engagement part upon the completion of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, the operating part of the actuator member <b>8</b> is made to further rotate in the same direction, and the pressing surface <b>8</b><i>c </i>thereof presses the back plate <b>6</b>B downward, while rotating, toward the contact point section <b>10</b><i>a. </i>And, since the operating part of the actuator member <b>8</b> is further made to rotate until coming close to the surface of the back plate <b>6</b>B as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9D and 16C</figref>, the sliding surface <b>8</b><i>d </i>is supported by the arc-shaped portion <b>10</b>Gb and made to rotate to be in contact with the surface of the back plate <b>6</b>B. Thereby, the pressing surface <b>8</b><i>c </i>further rotates via the back plate <b>6</b>B to a position nearer to the inner wall <b>4</b><i>a </i>than a position of the contact point section <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>disposed directly beneath the same, and made to stop there. At that time, the contact position between the pressing surface <b>8</b><i>c </i>and the back plate <b>6</b>B is closer to the inner wall <b>4</b><i>a </i>than the relative positions P<b>2</b> and P<b>1</b> of the above-mentioned center of rotation of the pressing portion <b>8</b>A relative to the engagement part.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Accordingly, the electrode group <b>6</b>E in the flexible printed circuit board <b>6</b> is pressed to the contact point section <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the movable terminal portion <b>10</b>A in the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>by the pressing surface <b>8</b><i>c </i>of the actuator member <b>8</b>, and held to be electrically connected thereto. The back plate <b>6</b>B of the flexible printed circuit board <b>6</b> is pinched between the pressing surface <b>8</b><i>c </i>of the actuator member <b>8</b> and the elastically deformed movable terminal portion <b>10</b>A of the respective contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai. </i>At that time, since the center of rotation of the pressing portion <b>8</b>A is located directly above the contact point section <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai </i>and the point of application on the pressing surface <b>8</b><i>c </i>is closer to the inner wall <b>4</b><i>a </i>than to the contact point section <b>10</b><i>a, </i>the clockwise rotation of the actuator member <b>8</b> is inhibited even if the pulling force or the bending moment is applied to the other end of the flexible printed circuit board <b>6</b>. Thereby, there is no risk in that the one end of the flexible printed circuit board <b>6</b> is removed from the cable connector.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Further, since the relative position P<b>1</b> of the center of rotation of the pressing portion <b>8</b>A relative to the engagement part moves along the predetermined locus toward the relative position P<b>2</b> which is the center of rotation thereof relative to the engagement part upon the completion of the rotation, it is possible to select a relatively large opening angle of the actuator member <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">On the other hand, when the flexible printed circuit board <b>6</b> located as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref> is removed from the connector body <b>4</b>, the operating part of the actuator member <b>8</b> is made to rotate clockwise as indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>; such that the unlocked state is obtained. At that time, after the sliding surface <b>8</b><i>d </i>of the rotating actuator member <b>8</b> moves around the arc-shaped portion <b>10</b>Gb of the contact terminal <b>10</b><i>ai, </i>the pressing surface <b>8</b><i>c </i>is away from the back plate <b>6</b>B and the sliding surface <b>8</b><i>d </i>is guided while being guided along the slant part <b>10</b>Ga, whereby the flat surface <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the pressing portion <b>8</b>A somewhat moves while rotating, until it approaches the back plate <b>6</b>B. And, as shown in FIG. <b>9</b>A,the upper surface of the actuator member <b>8</b> is brought into contact with the slant <b>4</b>SL of the socket body <b>4</b>. Accordingly, since the flat surface <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the pressing portion <b>8</b>A somewhat moves until it is close to the back plate <b>6</b>B while rotating, the opening angle of the actuator member <b>8</b> becomes larger in comparison with the prior art device.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The present invention has been described in detail with respect to preferred embodiments, and it will now be apparent from the foregoing to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspect, and it is the intention, therefore, in the appended claims to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit of the invention.</p>
