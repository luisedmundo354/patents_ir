<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A precursor to an electron source, having a capability for extending the life of an image display device by substantially preventing 1) a degradation in a degree of vacuum provided in an image display apparatus, 2) short-circuiting between adjacent wire electrodes via a getter, and 3) a degradation in performance characteristics of the electron source, even when used for a long time period. The electron source is for coupling to an image display member to form an image display apparatus, and the image display member is for displaying an image in response to being irradiated by electrons. The precursor preferably comprises a substrate, and an antistatic film provided on a surface of the substrate at a region where electron emitting devices are to be disposed on the precursor to form the electron source, but not on a region of that surface to be coupled to the image display member.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a substrate for forming an electron source, an electron source using the substrate, and an image display device using the electron source.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Two types of electron emitting devices, i.e., thermionic-cathode devices and cold-cathode devices, have been known. For example, surface-conduction-type devices, field-emission-type devices, metal/insulating layer/metal-type devices have been known as the cold-cathode devices.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The surface-conduction-type devices utilize the phenomenon that electron emission occurs by causing a current to flow in a direction parallel to the surface of a small-area thin film formed on a substrate. In the surface-conduction-type devices, electron emitting portions are formed by performing current-supply processing, called current-supply forming, on a conductive film before performing electron emission. That is, the current-supply forming processes supply current by applying a constant DC voltage or a DC voltage that increases at a very slow rate between both ends of a conductive film, to locally destruct or alter the conductive film in order to form electron emitting portions that have a high electric resistance. Cracks are generated at locally destructed, deformed or altered portions of the conductive film. When an appropriate voltage is applied to the conductive film after the current-supply forming, electron emission occurs at portions near the cracks.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An electron-source device includes the above-described electron emitting devices formed on a substrate wherein the electron emitting devices are wired in the form of a simple matrix by a plurality of row-direction wire electrodes and a plurality of column-direction wire electrodes. Particularly, an insulating layer is formed between electrodes at each of portions where the row-direction wire electrodes and the column-direction wire electrodes cross, in order to maintain electrical insulation. The above-described conductive film is formed in order to form electron emitting portions. By supplying current by applying a constant DC voltage or a DC voltage increasing at a very slow rate between both ends of the conductive film, the conductive film is locally destructed or altered in order to form electron emitting portions having a high electric resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A phosphor film including phosphors is formed on a surface of a faceplate (a light-emitting display plate), connected so as to face the electron-source device, opposite to the electron-source device, and phosphors of three primary colors, i.e., red, green and blue, are appropriately coated. A black substance is provided between phosphors constituting the phosphor film, and a metal back made of Al or the like is formed on the phosphor film. The inside of an envelope obtained by connecting the faceplate and the electron-source device using a supporting frame is maintained to a vacuum of about 10<sup>−6 </sup>Torr. In order to provide the substrate with a strength sufficient enough to resist against the atmospheric pressure, a structural supporting member comprising a relatively thin glass plate is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an image display device in which phosphors are caused to emit light by projecting an electron beam emitted from an electron source onto an appropriate one of phosphors, serving as image display members, it is necessary to maintain the inside of an envelope including the electron source and the image display members of the faceplate in a high vacuum. This is because if a gas is generated within the envelope to increase the pressure within the envelope, the gas adversely influences the electron source to reduce the amount of electron emission although the degree of the influence depends on the type of the gas, and it becomes impossible to display a bright image. In some cases, the generated gas is ionized by the electron beam and damages the electron source due to the collision of the ionized gas with the electron source by being accelerated by an electron field for accelerating electrons. Alternatively, discharge may occur within the envelope, to sometimes destruct the device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Usually, the envelope of the image display device is assembled by using a glass supporting frame and bonding connection portions by frit glass or the like, and the inside of the envelope is evacuated to a vacuum of about 10<sup>−7 </sup>Torr by connecting the inside of the envelope to a vacuum pump via an exhaust tube. Then, the exhaust tube is sealed. The vacuum after the sealing is maintained using a getter provided within the envelope. That is, a getter film is formed at a predetermined position within the envelope. The getter film is formed by heating and evaporating a getter material having, for example, Ba as a main component according to high-frequency heating. The inside of the envelope is maintained at a vacuum of about 10<sup>−6 </sup>Torr according to the adsorption function of the getter film.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the above-described image display device, if a voltage is applied to electron emitting devices via external terminals, provided outside of the envelope, via the plurality of row-direction wire electrodes and the plurality of column-direction wire electrodes formed on the substrate for forming an electron source, an electron beam is emitted from each of the electron emitting devices. At the same time, by applying a high voltage of several tens of kV to the metal back formed on the phosphor film of the faceplate via a terminal provided outside of the envelope, the emitted electron beam is accelerated to impinge onto the phosphor film of the faceplate. The phosphors of the respective colors constituting the phosphor film are thereby excited to emit light, so that an image is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some cases, in order to block diffusion of Na, a layer having SiO<sub>2 </sub>as a main component is formed on a substrate containing Na, and an antistatic layer is formed on the substrate in order to prevent charging on the surface of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, the above-described image display device has the following problems.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">First, the above-described coated layer formed on the substrate for forming an electron source may cause difficulty in maintaining the high-vacuum state within the envelope formed by connecting the substrate and the faceplate via the supporting frame, depending on the state of formation of the coated layer. It is estimated that this is because the inside of the coated layer may have gas permeability.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Second, the getter provided on the coated layer within the envelope in order to maintain a vacuum within the envelope may cause a short circuit between adjacent wire electrodes, even if the coated layer is made of an insulator. It is estimated that this is because a large number of bubbles are sometimes formed in the coated layer depending on the state of formation of the coated layer, and the bubbles are burst during heating at a high temperature to provide a state in which the wire electrodes are exposed. This short circuit may greatly degrade the quality of the formed image. Hence, in the worst case, the production yield of the image display device is degraded by manufacturing failed products.</p>

As a result, the second layer <b>6</b> having a thickness of 300 nm, in which the SnO<sub>2 </sub>fine particles (whose resistance was adjusted by doping phosphorus and SnO<sub>2</sub>) were contained with a weight ratio of 80:20, was formed on the high-strain-point glass substrate <b>1</b>, and the first layer <b>7</b> having a thickness of 60 nm which comprises SiO<sub>2 </sub>was formed on the second layer <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Then, an electron-source like the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> was formed by forming surface-conduction-type electron emitting devices on the coated substrate, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref>, as will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">First, device electrodes <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> were formed on layer <b>7</b> in the following manner. A photoresist layer was formed on the layer <b>7</b>, and openings were formed in the photoresist layer according to photolithography to form the desired shape of the electrodes. Then, a Ti film 5 nm thick and a Pt film 10 nm thick were formed according to sputtering, and the photoresist layer was removed by being dissolved by an organic solvent, to form the device electrodes <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> according to lift-off (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). At that time, an interval L between device electrodes and a width W of the electrodes <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> were 20 μm and 600 μm, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Then, row-direction wires <b>72</b> were formed according to screen printing, using a paste material (not shown) containing silver as a metal component (NP-4736S made by Noritake Co., Limited). The m row-direction wires <b>72</b> comprise D<sub>0x1</sub>, D<sub>0x2</sub>, —, D<sub>0xm</sub>. After the screen printing, the printed paste material was dried at 110° C. for 20 minutes, and was then fired at a peak temperature of 500° C. for a peak holding time period of 5 minutes in a heat treating apparatus, to form the row-direction wires <b>72</b> having a thickness of 5 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Then, an insulating layer (not shown) between the row-direction wires <b>72</b> and the column-direction wires <b>73</b> was formed. In order to form the insulating layer, an insulating paste material (not shown) was printed at positions on the row-direction wires <b>72</b> where the row-direction wires <b>72</b> are to cross the column-direction wires <b>73</b>, according to screen printing. After the screen printing, the printed insulating-paste material was fired at a peak temperature of 500° C. for 10 minutes, to form an insulating layer 20 μm thick.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Then, the column-direction wires <b>73</b> were formed in the same manner as in the case of the row-direction wires <b>72</b> except along a different direction. The column-direction wires <b>73</b> comprise n wires, i.e., D<sub>0y1</sub>, D<sub>0y2</sub>, —, D<sub>0yn</sub>. An electron-source substrate in which the row-direction wires <b>72</b> and the column-direction wires <b>73</b> were arranged in the form of a matrix was thus manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Then, a conductive film <b>4</b> was formed between each pair of device electrodes <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>) in the following manner. First, a solution containing an organic compound of palladium was coated over the electrodes <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> for a width of 100 μm using a bubble-jet-type ink-jet apparatus. Then, the coated solution was heated at 300° C. for 30 minutes to provide the conductive film <b>4</b> comprising palladium oxide fine particles. In order to provide excellent electron emission characteristics, the conductive film <b>4</b> preferably contains a film comprising a plurality of fine particles having a particle diameter within a range of 1 nm-20 nm. The thickness of the conductive film <b>4</b> preferably is within a range of 1 nm-50 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An electron emitting portion (gap) <b>5</b> was obtained, for example, by forming a crack in the conductive film <b>4</b> formed between the device electrodes <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> according to forming processing (to be described below) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">It is preferable that a carbon film is formed on the conductive film <b>4</b>, for improving the electron emission characteristics and to reduce temporal changes in the electron emission characteristics. The carbon film is formed, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is an enlarged schematic plan view of a surrounding portion of the gap <b>5</b> in the conductive film <b>4</b> of a surface-conduction-type electron emitting device having the carbon film, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line A-A′ shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the surface-conduction-type electron emitting device includes a carbon film <b>19</b> on both the substrate <b>81</b> within the gap <b>5</b> and the conductive film <b>4</b> so as to form a gap <b>18</b> narrower than the gap <b>5</b> formed between portions of the conductive film <b>4</b> in a state of being connected to the conductive film <b>4</b>. Alternatively, the same effects as in the above-described configuration may be obtained, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, by forming carbon films <b>19</b> on the portions of the conductive films <b>4</b> so as to provide a gap <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Next, a description will be provided of a preferred method for manufacturing the image display device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic diagram of an apparatus used in this method. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the envelope <b>88</b> is connected to a vacuum chamber <b>133</b> via an exhaust tube <b>132</b>, and is further connected to an evacuation apparatus <b>135</b> via a gate valve <b>134</b>. A pressure gauge <b>136</b>, a quadrupole mass spectrometer <b>137</b> and the like are mounted within the vacuum chamber <b>133</b>, in order to measure the inner pressure and the partial pressures of respective gas components. Since it is difficult to directly measure the pressure within the envelope <b>88</b>, processing conditions are controlled by measuring, for example, the pressure within the vacuum chamber <b>133</b>. Gas introducing lines <b>138</b> are connected to the vacuum chamber <b>133</b>, in order to control the atmosphere within the vacuum chamber <b>133</b> by introducing necessary gases into the vacuum chamber <b>133</b>. Sources <b>140</b> of substances to be introduced into chamber <b>133</b> are connected to respective ends of the gas introducing lines <b>138</b>. The substances to be introduced are stored in ampoules, bombs or the like. Introduced-amount control means <b>139</b> for controlling the rate of gas introduction is provided at a mid section of each of the gas introducing lines <b>138</b>. Preferably, a valve capable of controlling a gas flow rate, such as a slow leakage valve, a mass-flow controller, or the like may be used as the introduced-amount control means <b>139</b>, depending on the type of the substance to be introduced.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The inside of the envelope <b>88</b> is evacuated by the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and the forming processing is performed. Current-supply forming will now be described as an example of the forming processing. By supplying current between the device electrodes <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> using a power supply (not shown), the electron emitting portion <b>5</b> is formed on the conductive film <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The applied voltage preferably has the waveform of a pulse. The pulse voltage may be continuously applied by maintaining the peak value constant, or may be applied by increasing the peak value. T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> represent a pulse width and a pulse interval, respectively. Usually, T<sub>1 </sub>is set within a range of 1 μsec-10 msec, and T<sub>2 </sub>is set within a range of 10 μsec-10 msec. The peak value of a triangular wave (the peak voltage during current supply forming) is appropriately selected in accordance with the configuration of the electron emitting device. A voltage is applied, for example, for several seconds to several tens of minutes under the above-described conditions. The pulse waveform is not limited to a triangular wave, but any other desired waveform, such as a rectangular wave or the like, may also be adopted. T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> may be the same ones as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. The peak value (the peak voltage during current-supply forming) of the triangular wave may be increased, for example, by a step of 0.1 V. The current-supply forming is terminated when, for example, a resistance corresponding to about 0.1 V is obtained during the pulse interval T<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It is preferable to perform processing called activation processing for the device subjected to the forming. In the activation processing, the device current I<sub>f </sub>and the emission current I<sub>e </sub>greatly change. The activation processing may, for example, be performed by repeating application of a pulse voltage as in the current-supply forming in an atmosphere containing an organic gas. Such an atmosphere can be obtained by introducing an appropriate organic gas into a vacuum obtained by sufficiently evacuating the inside of the envelope <b>88</b> by an ion pump or the like. A preferable pressure of the organic gas at that time is appropriately set, because it depends on the type of application, the shape of the envelope <b>88</b>, the type of the organic substance, and the like. The appropriate organic substance may be selected from aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as alkene and alkyne, aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, amines, phenol, organic acids, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid, and the like. More specifically, a saturated hydrocarbon represented by a composition formula of C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>, such as methane, ethane, propane or the like, an unsaturated hydrocarbon represented by a composition formula of C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>, such as ethylene, propylene or the like, benzene, toluene, methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methylamine, eithylamine, phenol, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, or a mixture of some of these substances preferably may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to this processing, carbon films <b>19</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>) are deposited from the organic substance present in the atmosphere on the portions of the conductive films <b>19</b>, and the device current I<sub>f </sub>and the emission current I<sub>e </sub>greatly change. The termination of the activation processing is appropriately determined while measuring the device current I<sub>f </sub>and the emission current I<sub>e</sub>. The pulse width, the pulse interval, the peak value of the pulse, and the like are appropriately set. The carbon film comprises, for example, graphite (containing so-called HOPG, PG and GC, where HOPG indicates a state of graphite having a substantially perfect crystal structure, PG indicates a state of graphite having a slightly disturbed crystal structure with a crystal grain of about 20 nm, and GC indicates a state of graphite having a further disturbed crystal structure with a crystal grain of about 2 nm), or non-crystalline carbon (indicating amorphous carbon, and a mixture of amorphous carbon and graphite crystallites), and preferably has a thickness equal to or less than 50 nm, and more preferably has a thickness equal to or less than 30 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">After sufficiently evacuating the inside of the envelope <b>88</b>, the organic substance is introduced into the envelope <b>88</b> from the gas introducing line <b>138</b>. Alternatively, an organic substance remaining in a vacuum atmosphere after evacuating the inside of the envelope <b>88</b> using an oil diffusion pump or a rotary pump may be introduced from line <b>138</b>. In some embodiments, a substance other than the organic substance is introduced whenever necessary. By applying a voltage to each electron emitting device in the atmosphere containing the organic substance obtained in the above-described manner, carbon, a carbon compound, or a mixture of carbon and a carbon compound is deposited on the portions of the conductive films <b>19</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>), and the amount of electron emission drastically increases. In the voltage application, voltage pulses may be simultaneously applied to devices connected to wires of one direction connected in the same manner as in the case of the forming.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It is preferable to perform stabilization processing after completing the activation processing. In this processing, the organic substance within the envelope <b>88</b> is exhausted. The partial pressure of the organic substance within the envelope <b>88</b> in this processing is set to a value with which the above-described carbon and carbon compound are substantially not newly deposited, and preferably is equal to or less than 1.3 ×10<sup>−6 </sup>Pa, and more preferably is equal to or less than 3×10<sup>−8 </sup>Pa. When evacuating the inside of the envelope <b>88</b>, it is preferable to heat the entire envelope <b>88</b> in order to ease the exhaust of molecules of the organic substance adsorbed on the inner wall of the envelope <b>88</b>, and the electron emitting devices. The heating preferably is performed at a temperature within a range of 80-250° C., preferably at least 150° C., for as long a time period as possible. However, the heating conditions are not limited to these temperatures, and any other appropriate suitable conditions may also be adopted, depending on the size and the shape of the envelope <b>88</b>, the configuration of the electron emitting devices, and the like. The pressure within the envelope <b>88</b> must be as low as possible, preferably equal to or less than 1×10<sup>−5 </sup>Pa, and even more preferably, equal to or less than 1.3×10<sup>−6 </sup>Pa.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">It is preferable to maintain the atmosphere when terminating the stabilization processing as the atmosphere during driving. However, the atmosphere is not limited to this atmosphere. If the organic substance is sufficiently removed, sufficiently stable characteristics can be maintained even if the degree of vacuum is more or less degraded. By adopting such a vacuum atmosphere, it is possible to suppress new deposition of carbon or a carbon compound, remove H<sub>2</sub>O, O<sub>2 </sub>and the like absorbed on the envelope <b>88</b>, the substrate and the like, and, as a result, to stabilize the device current I<sub>f </sub>and the emission current I<sub>e</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">After providing the desired pressure, the exhaust tube <b>132</b> is sealed by being heated and melted by a burner. Gettering processing may be performed in order to maintain the pressure within the envelope <b>88</b> after the sealing (coupling of <b>86</b>, <b>82</b> and <b>81</b>). In this processing, a vacuum deposited film is formed by heating a getter (not shown) disposed at a predetermined position within the envelope <b>88</b> according to resistance heating, high-frequency heating or the like, immediately before or after the sealing of the envelope <b>88</b>. Usually, the getter contains Ba as a main component, and maintains the atmosphere within the envelope <b>88</b> according to an absorption function of the vacuum deposited film.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">When disposing the getter, it is preferable to provide the first layer <b>7</b> and the second layer <b>6</b> on the substrate <b>1</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), except for a region <b>100</b> of the substrate <b>1</b> where the getter is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As described above, in the precursor to an electron source according to the present invention, since the first layer <b>7</b> and the second layer <b>6</b> are formed, it is possible to prevent degradation of characteristics of the electron source caused by diffusion of Na from the substrate into the electron emitting devices <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Furthermore, since the second layer <b>6</b> and the first layer <b>7</b> are formed on the substrate <b>1</b>, except for a region of the substrate <b>1</b> which is sealed to a supporting member <b>82</b> and/or a region where the getter film is disposed, the supporting frame <b>82</b> is directly connected to the glass surface of the substrate <b>1</b>, using frit at the sealing region. Hence, air is not leaked from the second layer <b>6</b> containing voids into the envelope <b>88</b>. As a result, the degree of vacuum within the envelope <b>88</b> does not decrease with time, so that the life of the electron source can be prolonged.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">By providing the first layer <b>7</b> and the second layer <b>6</b> on the surface of the substrate <b>1</b> where the electron emitting devices <b>76</b> are to be disposed, but not on a region <b>100</b> of the substrate <b>1</b> where the getter film is disposed, bubbles are not generated within the insulating layer even if heating processing as high as 300° C. is performed at post-processing, and short-circuiting between adjacent wire electrodes <b>73</b> via the getter due to formation of the getter film caused by exposure to the wire electrodes <b>73</b> from insulating layer <b>101</b> cannot occur.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">While the present invention has been described with respect to what are presently considered to be the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the scope of the invention is not limited to only the disclosed embodiments. To the contrary, the present invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest reasonable interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions.</p>
