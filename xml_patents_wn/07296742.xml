<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention contains subject matter related to Japanese Patent Application JP 2004-190795 filed in the Japanese Patent Office on Jun. 29, 2004, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to data processing apparatuses, data processing methods, and portable communication terminal apparatuses. Particularly, the present invention relates to a data processing apparatus, a data processing method, and a portable communication terminal apparatus which are capable of performing high-speed data processing in, for example, an integrated circuit (IC) (large scale integration (LSI)) for contactless communication.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Non-contact type IC card systems, which are well known as contactless communication systems, are often used in, for example, automatic ticket gates in stations.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram schematically showing the structure of an IC card system in related art.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The IC card system in the related art includes a reader-writer (R/W) <b>1</b> and an IC card <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The R/W <b>1</b> transmits a radio signal to generate a radio-frequency (RF) field (electromagnetic field).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The IC card <b>2</b> has an antenna <b>11</b> composed of a loop coil and an LSI <b>12</b> for contactless communication.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When the IC card <b>2</b> comes close to the R/W <b>1</b> and enters the RF field that has a strength greater than a predetermined strength and that is generated by the R/W <b>1</b>, the IC card <b>2</b> receives power produced by electromagnetic induction caused by the radio signal transmitted from the R/W <b>1</b> to start to operate. The IC card <b>2</b> performs data processing, for example, transmits and receives data to and from the R/W <b>1</b> by radio signals.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In other words, since the IC card <b>2</b> does not include a power supply, the IC card <b>2</b> receives the power produced by the electromagnetic induction in the antenna <b>11</b> (loop coil), caused by the radio signal transmitted from the R/W <b>1</b>, to operate the LSI <b>12</b> and performs a variety of data processing.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The LSI <b>12</b> in the IC card <b>2</b> receives the power produced by the electromagnetic induction caused by the radio signal transmitted from the R/W <b>1</b> to operate in the manner described above. The power caused by the radio signal transmitted from the R/W <b>1</b> is reduced in the IC card <b>2</b> as the distance between the R/W <b>1</b> and the IC card <b>2</b> becomes longer.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, if the IC card <b>2</b> receives power E<sub>1 </sub>that is not less than power E<sub>0 </sub>and that is caused by the radio signal transmitted from the R/W <b>1</b> where E<sub>0 </sub>denotes the minimum power for the LSI <b>12</b> in the IC card <b>2</b> to operate, when the IC card <b>2</b> is located at a position P<b>1</b> relatively near to the R/W <b>1</b>, the LSI <b>12</b> can operate at the position P<b>1</b> to perform a variety of data processing.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In contrast, if the IC card <b>2</b> only receives power E<sub>2 </sub>that is less than the power E<sub>0 </sub>and that is caused by the radio signal transmitted from the R/W <b>1</b> when the IC card <b>2</b> is located at a position P<b>2</b> farther away from the R/W <b>1</b> than the position P<b>1</b>, the LSI <b>12</b> cannot operate at the position P<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, the LSI <b>12</b> in the IC card <b>2</b> can operate only within a range near to the R/W <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Increasing the level of the radio signal output from the R/W <b>1</b> can expand the range in which the IC card <b>2</b> can operate. However, the output from the R/W <b>1</b> is restricted by the radio law or interference with a radio signal output from another R/W can cause a problem.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Hence, it is necessary to limit the level of the radio signal in the R/W <b>1</b>, and the IC card <b>2</b> is designed in consideration of low power consumption such that the IC card <b>2</b> can operate with the power caused by the radio signal having the limited level.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The LSI <b>12</b> operates in synchronization with a clock. Setting the frequency of the clock to a lower value (setting the period of the clock to a longer value) is effective in saving the power consumption in the LSI <b>12</b>, and the IC card <b>2</b> is designed such that the LSI <b>12</b> operates in synchronization with the clock having a sufficiently low frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Since it takes some time to perform the data processing in the LSI <b>12</b>, it is necessary for a user to stay at a position, where the LSI <b>12</b> can receive the power sufficient for the LSI <b>12</b> to operate from the R/W <b>1</b>, for at least a time required for the data processing in the LSI <b>12</b> and to hold the IC card <b>2</b> over the R/W <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Incorporating the function of the IC card <b>2</b> into a portable apparatus, such as a portable telephone, has been proposed in recent years. Since the portable telephone has, for example, a battery pack serving as an internal power supply that causes the portable telephone to operate, the LSI <b>12</b> can operate even when the IC card <b>2</b> is away from the R/W <b>1</b> by allowing the IC card <b>2</b> incorporated in the portable telephone to receive the power from the internal power supply.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the automatic ticket gate system has an automatic ticket checker <b>20</b> installed at, for example, a ticket gate in a station. The automatic ticket checker <b>20</b> includes a reader-writer (R/W) <b>21</b> and is provided with a door <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A user holds a portable telephone <b>30</b> over the R/W <b>21</b> while passing through the automatic ticket checker <b>20</b>. When the user holds the portable telephone <b>30</b> over the R/W <b>21</b>, the portable telephone <b>30</b> having a function of an IC card comes close to the R/W <b>21</b> that transmits and receives data to and from the portable telephone <b>30</b> by radio signals. Required data processing is performed between the R/W <b>21</b> and the portable telephone <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the IC card in the portable telephone <b>30</b> has a function of, for example, a commuter pass, the R/W <b>21</b> reads out information concerning the commuter pass section and the expiration date from the IC card in the portable telephone <b>30</b> and confirms the section and the expiration date. If there is no problem with the section and the expiration date, the R/W <b>21</b> opens the door <b>22</b> such that the user carrying the portable telephone <b>30</b> is capable of passing through the automatic ticket checker <b>20</b>. If there is a problem with the section and/or the expiration date, the R/W <b>21</b> closes the door <b>22</b> such that the user carrying the portable telephone <b>30</b> is not capable of passing through the automatic ticket checker <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When the IC card in the portable telephone <b>30</b> has a function of, for example, a prepaid card, the R/W <b>21</b> reads out information concerning the balance of the account for the prepaid card from the IC card in the portable telephone <b>30</b> and confirms whether there is any problem with the balance. If there is no problem with the balance, the R/W <b>21</b> controls the portable telephone <b>30</b> such that the portable telephone <b>30</b> writes the amount of the new balance by subtracting required fees from the current balance. The R/W <b>21</b> simultaneously opens the door <b>22</b> such that the user carrying the portable telephone <b>30</b> is capable of passing through the automatic ticket checker <b>20</b>. If there is any problem with the balance, the R/W <b>21</b> closes the door <b>22</b> such that the user carrying the portable telephone <b>30</b> is not capable of passing through the automatic ticket checker <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the R/W <b>21</b> transmits the data to the portable telephone <b>30</b>, the R/W <b>21</b> modulates a carrier wave having a frequency of, for example, 13.56 MHz in accordance with the data and transmits the modulated wave as a radio signal. When the R/W <b>21</b> receives the data from the portable telephone <b>30</b>, the R/W <b>21</b> transmits the carrier wave (unmodulated wave) having a frequency of, for example, 13.56 MHz as the radio signal. The portable telephone <b>30</b> performs load modulation for the radio signal, which is the carrier wave transmitted from the R/W <b>21</b>, and transmits the modulated data to the R/W <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram schematically showing an example of the structure of the portable telephone <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the portable telephone <b>30</b> includes a card functioning unit <b>41</b> and an external circuit <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The card functioning unit <b>41</b> has a function of an IC card and includes an antenna <b>51</b> composed of a loop coil and an LSI <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The antenna <b>51</b> receives the radio signal from the R/W <b>21</b> and supplies the received radio signal to the LSI <b>52</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The clock generator <b>61</b> generates a clock used for operating the CPU <b>63</b> and supplies the clock to the clock controller <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The clock controller <b>62</b> controls the clock supplied from the clock generator <b>61</b> in accordance with the power supply from which power is supplied to the CPU <b>63</b>. For example, the clock controller <b>62</b> varies the frequency of the clock and supplies the clock to the CPU <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Methods of varying the frequency of the clock supplied from the clock generator <b>61</b>, adopted in the clock controller <b>62</b>, include a method of dividing the clock supplied from the clock generator <b>61</b> and a method of modulating the frequency (frequency modulation). When the clock supplied from the clock generator <b>61</b> is to be divided, the clock frequency is discretely varied to a value corresponding to the division ratio. When the clock supplied from the clock generator <b>61</b> is to be subjected to the frequency modulation, the clock frequency is continuously varied.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The CPU <b>63</b> processes the data, for example, which is transmitted from the R/W <b>21</b> as the radio signal and is received by the antenna <b>51</b>, in synchronization with the clock supplied from the clock controller <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The external circuit <b>42</b> includes an internal power supply <b>71</b>. The external circuit <b>42</b> receives power supplied from the internal power supply <b>71</b> and performs processing similar to that in a portable telephone in the related art.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The internal power supply <b>71</b> is, for example, a battery pack and is removable from the portable telephone <b>30</b>. The internal power supply <b>71</b> is charged with a battery charger (not shown) while being mounted in the portable telephone <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the portable telephone <b>30</b> having the structure described above, the LSI <b>52</b> in the card functioning unit <b>41</b> receives the power generated by electromagnetic induction in the antenna <b>51</b> (the loop coil), the electromagnetic induction being caused by the radio signal supplied from the R/W <b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or the power from the internal power supply <b>71</b> to operate the portable telephone <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Specifically, the LSI <b>52</b> receives the power which is caused by the radio signal supplied from the R/W <b>21</b> or the power from the internal power supply <b>71</b> in the external circuit <b>42</b>. In the LSI <b>52</b>, the clock generator <b>61</b> generates a clock and supplies the generated clock to the clock controller <b>62</b>. The clock controller <b>62</b> varies the frequency of the clock supplied from the clock generator <b>61</b>, if necessary, and supplies the clock to the CPU <b>63</b>. The CPU <b>63</b> performs the data processing in synchronization with the clock supplied from the clock controller <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As described above, the LSI <b>52</b> in the card functioning unit <b>41</b> receives the power caused by the radio signal supplied from the R/W <b>21</b> or the power from the internal power supply <b>71</b> in the external circuit <b>42</b> to perform the data processing.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The data processing when the LSI <b>52</b> in the card functioning unit <b>41</b> receives the power from the internal power supply <b>71</b> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When the LSI <b>52</b> receives the power from the internal power supply <b>71</b>, power sufficient to operate the LSI <b>52</b> is supplied from the internal power supply <b>71</b> to the LSI <b>52</b> except under special circumstances, for example, when a minute amount of electric power remains in the internal power supply <b>71</b> or when the internal power supply <b>71</b> is removed from the portable telephone <b>30</b>. Accordingly, the request for power saving is modest, compared with the case in which the LSI <b>52</b> receives the power caused by the radio signal supplied from the R/W <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the CPU <b>63</b> in the LSI <b>52</b> receives the power from the internal power supply <b>71</b>, the clock controller <b>62</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> controls the frequency of the clock supplied from the clock generator <b>61</b> so as to be equal to a high frequency f<sub>1 </sub>(for example, a frequency higher than the frequency of the clock generated in an IC card in related art) and supplies the clock to the CPU <b>63</b>. Since the CPU <b>63</b> performs the data processing in synchronization with the clock having the high frequency f<sub>1</sub>, high-speed data processing is realized in the CPU <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In addition, since the LSI <b>52</b> receives the power from the internal power supply <b>71</b>, the LSI <b>52</b> can operate even when the card functioning unit <b>41</b> is located at a position P<b>1</b>′ relatively near to the R/W <b>21</b> or even when the card functioning unit <b>41</b> is located at a position P<b>2</b>′ farther away from the R/W <b>21</b> than the position P<b>1</b>′, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It is assumed that the minimum power for the CPU <b>63</b> in the LSI <b>52</b> to perform the data processing in synchronization with the clock having the frequency f<sub>1 </sub>is E<sub>f1 </sub>and that power not lower than the power E<sub>f1 </sub>is supplied from the internal power supply <b>71</b> to the CPU <b>63</b>.</p>
