<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to a double feed detection method of recording media or documents, and a double feed detection apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More specifically, the present invention relates to a method for detecting double feed of sheet materials (feeding and conveying two or more sheets of recording media or documents) in a sheet feeding mechanism or a conveying mechanism used in a copier, a printer, a fax, an image reading scanner, or an automatic document feeder.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Related Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows a configuration of a sheet feeding apparatus (a sheet material feeding apparatus) used in an image reading apparatus that can continuously read several sheets of overlapping documents (sheet materials) for fax or copy. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, reference numeral <b>9110</b> denotes a sheet feeding tray; <b>9101</b>, a batch of documents; <b>9102</b>, a sensor; <b>9103</b>, a separation pad; <b>9105</b>, a securing end; and <b>9106</b>, a sheet roller.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The sensor <b>9102</b> detects that the documents <b>9101</b> are set on the sheet feeding tray <b>9110</b>, and a detection signal is transmitted to a main unit. The separation pad <b>9103</b> provided above the sheet roller <b>9106</b> separates, one by one, leading ends of the documents <b>9101</b> placed in a slanting position on the sheet roller <b>9106</b> so as to facilitate sheet feeding.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The separation pad <b>9103</b> is pressed downward by a spring <b>9104</b>, and an upper end of the spring <b>9104</b> is secured by the securing end <b>9105</b>. Specifically, in the sheet feeding apparatus, the leading ends of the documents <b>9101</b> that abut against the separation pad <b>9103</b> are gradually displaced and separated one by one, due to the weight of the documents, and the separation pad <b>9103</b> being placed in the slanting position with respect to an inserting direction of the documents.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The set documents <b>9101</b> are fed one by one to a pair of conveying rollers <b>9107</b> by the sheet roller <b>9106</b>. A document leading end detection sensor <b>9113</b> notifies the main unit that a leading end of a document reaches the conveying roller <b>9107</b>. Then, the documents <b>9101</b> are successively conveyed. The above example relates to the sheet feeding apparatus used in the image reading apparatus, but a sheet feeding mechanism can be naturally applied to an image forming apparatus such as a copier or a printer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, in the above configuration, although the documents (or recording media) are resistant to double feed, whether the fed or conveyed documents are double fed or not cannot be determined (detected), and thus even if the documents are double fed, image reading (or image forming) is performed based on one sheet of document (or one sheet of recording medium) being conveyed. This prevents appropriate image reading or image forming.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, the invention has an object to provide a double feed detection method that can detect whether recording media or documents are double fed or not, a double feed detection apparatus, and an image forming apparatus and an image reading apparatus including the double feed detection apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention provides a double feed detection method for detecting whether sheet materials are double fed or not, including the steps of: applying an external force by bringing external force application means into contact with a sheet material; detecting the external force applied to the sheet material by detection means; and determining whether the sheet materials are double fed or not using a signal obtained from the detection means.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The external force is applied by bringing the external force application means into contact with the sheet material from a non-contact state between the external force application means and the sheet material, or the external force is applied to the sheet material from a contact state between the external force application means and the sheet material.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The external force may be applied in a state where the sheet material is standing still, or a state where the sheet material is being conveyed. The state where the sheet material is being conveyed means a state where the sheet material is being moved relative to the external force application means or the detection means.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, the invention provides a double feed detection apparatus of sheet materials including: external force application means; and detection means, wherein (1) the external force application means apply an external force by making contact with a sheet material from a non-contact state, or (2) the external force is applied with a contact state between the external force application means and the sheet material being kept. When the external force application means and the detection means are opposed to each other with the sheet material therebetween, a distance between the external force application means and the detection means changes (specifically, becomes short) at the time of the application of the external force. Of course, a range of variation of the distance is larger in the former case (1). In the case (2), the external force is applied in a state where the external force application means and the detection means contacts with the sheet material. The detection means includes means having a detection element exposed or covered.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The sheet material means a recording medium or a document (hereinafter referred to as ârecording medium or the likeâ) as mentioned above. The recording medium includes plain paper, glossy paper and an overhead transparency. Double feed detection according to the invention can be effectively applied to an image forming apparatus such as a printer on which one type of recording medium (for example, plain paper) is loaded.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the invention, double feed of the sheet materials (feeding and conveying two or more sheets of recording media or documents) in a sheet feeding mechanism or a conveying mechanism is detected, and the invention can detect double feed in the following states:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0019">1) a state where two or more sheet materials are conveyed in a completely overlapping manner,</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0020">2) a state where two or more sheet materials are conveyed in a displaced and overlapping manner.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">The invention can further detect the following state:
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0022">3) a state where a sheet material is bent and folded, which looks like two or more sheet materials, is conveyed.</li>
</ul>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0043">Now, the invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an overview of a double feed detection method of sheet materials according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0045">First, external force application means is used to apply a predetermined external force to a sheet material (S<b>1</b>). In this case, the sheet material is held between a first member and a second member such that the external force is applied, and the force is applied from at least one of the members. The sheet material may be held at the same time as the application of the force, or the sheet material may be previously held before the force is applied. Then, the external force is detected by detection means (S<b>2</b>), and a detected signal is used to determine whether the sheet materials are double fed or not (S<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0046">According to the embodiment, whether the sheet materials are double fed or not can be determined using a difference between a detection signal in a double feed state and a detection signal in a non double feed state.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically shows the embodiment. A sheet material <b>2200</b> is placed such that external force application means <b>2100</b> makes contact with the sheet material <b>2200</b> to apply an external force thereon. The applied force is detected by detection means <b>2300</b>. The detection means is a unit for detecting a degree of the force applied to the sheet material. Reference numeral <b>2400</b> denotes a conveying tray on which the detection means <b>2300</b> is provided. When the force is applied, the sheet material is preferably standing still (a state where the sheet material is not being substantially conveyed). This is because, in the detection means <b>2300</b>, a detection signal may sometimes include a surface state of the sheet material as the sheet material moves. Of course, the sheet material does not have to stand still as long as double feed detection can be performed. If the force is applied to moving sheet materials, a state where the number of overlapping sheet materials changes in a moving direction, such as a state where two or more sheet materials are conveyed in a displaced and overlapping manner, can be detected as a change of an output signal. In the embodiment, an external force except ultrasound is applied to the sheet material.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0048">In the step S<b>1</b> of applying the external force, the external force application means <b>2100</b> may be:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0049">means having an external force application member that applies the external force to the sheet material based on making contact with the sheet material; or</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0050">means configured so as to blow gas such as air. The external force application member is preferably driven by a drive source. The external force used in the invention may be any force including electromagnetism, heat, expansion/compression of a medium such as gas caused by heat, vibration, or a mechanical force. The drive source may include:</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0051">means that holds the external force application member above the sheet material, and can appropriately drop the member on the sheet material;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0052">means that drives the external force application member by mechanical or electromagnetic energy (for example, mechanical means such as a spring, or electromagnetic means such as a solenoid or a voice coil); or</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0053">vibration means for vibrating the external force application member (for example, a piezoelectric actuator, an electrostatic actuator, or an electromagnetic vibration generator). A drive source denoted by reference numeral <b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> uses a spring force of a spring <b>210</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0054">The external force application means and the sheet material may be brought into contact with each other at the time of the application of the force, or the both are previously brought into contact with each other, and the force is applied from the contact state. When the external force application means and the detection means are opposed to each other with the sheet material therebetween in the former case, a distance between the application means and the detection means changes (becomes shorter) at the time of the application of the force. When the force application means and the force detection means are opposed to each other with the sheet material therebetween, both the force application means and the force detection means may be brought into contact with the sheet material at the time of the application of the force. It is also preferable to displace the sheet material using a displacement member such as a roller or an auxiliary member so as to keep the sheet material under conveyance at a certain distance from the external force application means and the detection means, or bring the sheet material into contact with the means, which effectively stabilizes the detection.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0055">When the force application means applies the force to the sheet material, the sheet material is sometimes slightly deformed (recessed) depending on a degree of the force, thus the force may be applied to an end or the like of the sheet material.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0056">For example, an impact force may be applied to the sheet material by the external force application member, and methods thereof include:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0057">a method in which the external force application member is hit against the sheet material from a distant position; or</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0058">a method in which an impact force is applied to the sheet material from the external force application member, with an external force application member kept in contact with a sheet material P. Specifically, while the external force is applied by the external force application member anyhow with the member being in contact with the sheet material,</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0059">the external force application member may be brought into contact with the sheet material only when the external force is applied, or</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0060">the external force application member may be previously brought into contact with the sheet material before the external force is applied. When the external force application means and the external force detection means are opposed to each other with the sheet material therebetween in the former case, a distance between the external force application means and the external force detection means changes (becomes shorter) at the time of the application of the external force. When the external force application member is previously brought into contact with the sheet material before the external force is applied, the external force is applied with the external force application member and the external force detection means kept in contact with the sheet material.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0061">Alternatively, an external force application member in a vibrating state may be brought into contact with the sheet material to apply vibration to the sheet material instead of the impact force.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0062">In the application of the force, it is preferable that a leading end detection sensor (for example, <b>9113</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) is used to detect a leading end of the sheet material, and then a force is applied to a position of the sheet material at a predetermined distance (for example, a standardized value of 29.7 cm when an A4-size sheet is longitudinally conveyed) from a position of the leading end. Depending on the state of double feed and the application position of the force, it may be incorrectly determined that the sheet materials are not double fed, although they are actually double fed, but applying the force to the above described position causes the force to be applied to a reliably overlapping portion, when the sheet materials are double fed. The predetermined distance herein is a standardized value of a recording medium such as paper.</p>

When a displacement member (described later in detail) is placed in a position opposite the external force application member, the displacement member may be operated as the external force receiving member (specifically, the displacement member may receive the external force without a separate external force receiving member), and when the displacement member is not placed in a position opposite the external force application member, the external force receiving member may be provided in a position opposite the external force application member. Such an external force receiving member may have a flat or curved contact surface with the sheet material. It is also preferable, in terms of life of an element or the like, that a recess is provided in a position opposite a tip of the external force application means with the sheet material therebetween to disperse the external force concentrated on one point.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0082">Next, the step of detecting the external force applied to the sheet material (S<b>2</b>) and the step of determining whether the sheet materials are double fed or not (S<b>3</b>) will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0083">The detection may be performed using detection means having, for example, a piezoelectric element, and in this case, the external force is detected as a voltage signal. The piezoelectric element as the detection means may be provided on at least one of the first and the second members, and may be provided on both of the members. A possible configuration is such that a recording medium is held between the piezoelectric element on the first member and the second member (specifically, a configuration in which the piezoelectric element receives the force via the sheet material). The force may be applied by the first member itself on which the piezoelectric element is placed, may be applied by the second member, or may be applied by both of them.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0084">A position of the piezoelectric element is not limited as long as the piezoelectric element can detect the force. Thus, for example, a detection unit may be provided in a position opposite the force application means with the sheet material therebetween. Further, the force application means itself may be provided with a member that vibrates on receiving a force (for example, a leaf spring) to determine double feed by changes of the member. It is also possible that the force application means itself include a piezoelectric element as detection means, or the detection means is provided on both the force application means and an opposite position with a sheet therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0085">On the other hand, the above described external force detection means may contain inorganic materials or organic materials having piezoelectric properties, and may contain, for example, inorganic materials such as PZT (lead zirconate titanate) or PLZT, BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, PMNâPT (Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3â</sub>PbTiO<sub>3</sub>) or organic piezoelectric materials.

<p id="p-0085" num="0111">The processing circuit for the signal processing can perform signal processing using a first signal received by the detection means due to the force when the sheet material is not held, and using a second signal received by the sensor due to the force when the sheet material is held.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0112">An example of signal processing when the impact force is applied as the external force will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0113">As the electrical signal from the piezoelectric element, for example, changes of the voltage signal with time can be detected. An impact applied to the sheet material appears as a gradually attenuating signal, and a peak level of the signal, the number of peaks of the signal during attenuation, time that elapses during the attenuation, a degree of change of the peak level due to the attenuation, or the like, differ depending on the presence or absence of the double feed of the recording media, or the number of double fed media.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0114">Specifically, when the impact force is applied, signals detected by the detection means differ depending on the number of sheet materials, and thus whether the sheet materials are double fed or not (a degree of the double feed as required) can be determined based on the peak level and the time between the peaks of the detection signal.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0115">The inventor uses, as an example, plain paper (CP-250: New Printer Paper manufactured by Canon Inc.), and applies the same impact force to one sheet of paper and two to four sheets of double fed paper, and the degrees of changes of a first peak (P<b>1</b>) after the impact is applied and a succeeding second peak (P<b>2</b>) are calculated as a ratio of a second peak (P<b>2</b>) level to a first peak (P<b>1</b>) level. The values are 0.52 for one sheet (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), 0.60 for two sheets (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), 0.75 for three sheets (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), and 0.78 for four sheets (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), and different from each other, which reveals that the double feed detection of the recording media can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0116">The signal, which is obtained by the detection means used for determining the double feed, and analysis thereof include the following specific examples.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0117">First, the double feed can be determined from a voltage value of a voltage peak generated from the detection means depending on the impact force. The double feed can be also determined from the change of the voltage value with time.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0118">The application of the impact force causes an impact application member <b>2100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to recoil due to a reaction force from the sheet material. Depending on application methods of the impact force, the recoil causes the impact application means <b>2100</b> to hit against the sheet material several times. The double feed can be determined from intervals between the voltage peaks generated by the hit due to the several times of recoil. The double feed can be also determined from the voltage value of the voltage peak for each hit. The double feed can be further determined by changes of the interval and the voltage value.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0119">Further, the application of the impact force causes vibration of the impact application member, the sheet material and surroundings. The vibration caused by the impact force can be detected to determine the double feed from frequency components thereof. The double feed can be also determined from strength or vibration attenuation. Similar determination can be performed by detecting sound vibration, which is the caused vibration traveling through the air.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0120">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>9</b>, the horizontal axes show time (50 ms/div.), and the vertical axes show detection signals (an output voltage of the piezoelectric element as 10 mV/div., but in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, 30 mV/div.).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0121">The first peak level successively changes depending on the case of one sheet, and the difference in the double feed states of two to four sheets, and there is a change from 10 mV to 40 mV. The peak herein means the circled spot in the drawings, and the peak level means a value that is obtained by subtracting a value of a voltage signal before the application of the impact force (at this time, the impact force is sufficiently attenuated) from the value of the voltage signal at the peak. Pretreatment of the sheet itself may be performed for obtaining different signals due to the impact. The types of the recording media whose double feed can be determined are not limited to those described above.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0122">Next, an example of signal processing when the vibration is applied as the external force will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0123">It has been shown that when vibration with a predetermined frequency from the vibration generator is applied to one sheet material and a plurality of double fed sheet materials, and motion of the sheet materials by the vibration is detected by a sensor (when the recording medium is held between the vibration generator and the sensor), a peak value differs depending on the presence and absence of the double feed of the recording media or the number of double fed media.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0124">The signal, which is obtained by the detection means used for determining the double feed, and analysis thereof include the following specific examples.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0125">First, the double feed can be determined from the voltage value generated from the detection means depending on the vibration. The double feed can be also determined from the change of the voltage value with time.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0126">Further, the application of the vibration causes vibration of the vibration application member, the sheet material and surroundings. The caused vibration can be detected to determine the double feed from frequency components thereof. Similar determination can be performed by detecting sound vibration, which is the caused vibration traveling through the air.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0127">The double feed can be also determined from strength, vibration attenuation, or a phase shift from an applied signal.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0128">When plain paper (CP-250: New Printer Paper manufactured by Canon Inc.) is used, and vibration with an amplitude of 25 V and a frequency of 230 KHz is applied to one sheet material and two to four double fed sheet materials, the values are 560 mV for one sheet (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), 420 mV for two sheets (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>), 160 mV for three sheets (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), and 120 mV for four sheets (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>), and different from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0129">Therefore, if a table is prepared in which signals of the double feed of the sheet materials are previously recorded, the double feed detection of the recording medium can be performed based on the table. The determination can be performed automatically or performed from detected signals by a person. The types of the recording media whose double feed can be determined are not limited to those described above. When the signal of the double feed of the recording medium differs depending on types of the media, environmental conditions or conveying states, a plurality of tables corresponding to each condition or state may be prepared to perform determination based thereon. The frequency of the applied vibration may be in a range from some ten KHz to some MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0130">In the case of an image forming apparatus, when the double feed of the sheet materials is detected, a CPU provided inside or outside the image forming apparatus controls (adjusts) to change print modes. The change of the print modes includes, for example, stop of printing, stop of recording media conveyance, adjustment of a conveying condition such as adjustment of a pressing force on a roller used for conveyance, adjustment of an image forming condition, generation of a warning signal. Such control performed by an internal CPU allows sending and receiving of data signals to and from the outside to be omitted. Of course, a person may input the print modes from an external computer. This solves problems caused by the double feed of the recording media. Information on the type of a print sheet and a print mode may be sent to an image forming apparatus (for example, a printer) from a computer connected thereto to change the print modes based on the information. When the double feed is detected in an image reading apparatus, reading may be stropped at that time. When the double feed is detected, the sheet may be simply conveyed to a sheet delivery unit without image forming, or the conveyance itself may be stopped to warn a user.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0131">When the double feed state is detected, the sheet may be delivered without printing. A warning of the double feed may be displayed on the image forming apparatus itself, or on a computer screen of each user via a network. Of course, image forming can be performed while detecting the double feed state to then notify the user.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0132">The invention allows the presence and absence (that is, no sheet material is conveyed) of the sheet material may be detected, besides the presence and absence of the double feed state, thus can be used as means for detecting whether the sheet material is in a desired position.</p>

The output voltage has a plurality of peaks, and the first peak is 34.3 mV, the second peak is 17.9 mV, and the ratio of the second peak (P<b>2</b>) level to the first peak (P<b>1</b>) level is 0.52. The processing apparatus records these data for determining the double feed. Similar tests are conducted in the double feed states of two, three, or four sheets, and the output data are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. Specifically, the ratio tends to increase as the number of double fed sheets increases.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0137">In the processing apparatus, the peak levels and attenuation of the voltages in the initial state without any print sheet <b>101</b>, when one print sheet <b>101</b> is held, and when two to four double fed print sheets are held, are previously recorded in a data table, and the table and the output data are compared to determine the double feed of the recording media. Instead of the determination by the peak level and the attenuation as described above, the voltage value at each peak may be compared to determine the double feed. A time interval from the first peak to the second peak may be used to determine the double feed. Time that elapses during attenuation may be calculated from a waveform attenuation curve for comparison and determination. An arithmetical operation apparatus connected to the printer changes the print mode when the double feed detection apparatus of the recording medium detects the double feed. Alternatively, the sheet may be delivered without printing.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0138">In this embodiment, the holding guide is the pinch roller <b>102</b>, but the structure of the holding guide is not limited, and a separate holding guide may be provided on a pinch roller shaft. An output voltage when the sheet is held is determined as VB, and compared with a value (for example, a peak level) when a voltage in the case of one sheet conveyance is determined as VA, and (VA-VB)/VA may be used.</p>
