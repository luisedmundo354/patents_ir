<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is directed, in general, to mixing circuits for radios and, more specifically, to harmonic rejection for switching mixers.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An architecture for high-performance direct conversion radios is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/440,026 entitled “CHOPPER-DIRECT-CONVERSION (CDC) RADIO ARCHITECTURE” and filed May 16, 2003, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. The architecture disclosed employs a phase-alternating mixer (PAM) that outputs a double-sideband (DSB) signal for use throughout the receiver circuitry. Such double-sideband signal paths eliminate the use of baseband frequencies that are generally problematic in large-scale circuit integration. In addition, problems associated with direct-conversion, such as local oscillator (LO) leakages, direct current (DC) offsets, low frequency noise and the like are all eliminated by relocating the local oscillator frequency away from the radio frequency (RF) employed for transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When harmonic or alias signals are presented to the input of the radio, these unwanted signals interfere with the desired signal and degrade the quality of reception. To improve receiver quality, a surface acoustic wave (SAW) band select filter might be employed before the phase-alternating mixer to reject the unwanted signals. However, a better approach would be to design both the harmonic and alias rejection functions into the basic mixer circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is, therefore, a need in the art for a harmonic rejection circuit that may be integrated into any type of mixer circuit, such as a phase-alternating mixer of the type described above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To address the above-discussed deficiencies of the prior art, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide, for use in a mixing circuit, rejection of local oscillator harmonic response with a pair of harmonic gating switches serially connected to the outputs of a balanced differential switching mixer and controlled by a gate clock signal having twice the frequency of a local oscillator signal controlling the switching mixer. An aperture or duty cycle of the gate clock signal determines which harmonic is rejected or suppressed, which is preferably a third and/or fifth harmonic since response of the balanced differential switching mixer to even harmonics is negligible. The resulting simple, efficient circuit is readily integrated directly into a phase-alternating mixer structure for a chopper-direct-conversion radio.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the invention that follows. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter that form the subject of the claims of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that they may readily use the conception and the specific embodiment disclosed as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. Those skilled in the art will also realize that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3A</figref> through <b>4</b>, discussed below, and the various embodiments used to describe the principles of the present invention in this patent document are by way of illustration only and should not be construed in any way to limit the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will understand that the principles of the present invention may be implemented in any suitably arranged device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a wireless communications system including a receiver having a harmonic-rejection gated switching mixer according to one embodiment of the present invention. Wireless communications system <b>100</b> includes a transmitter <b>101</b>, a receiver <b>102</b>, and at least one communications channel <b>103</b> communicably coupling the transmitter <b>101</b> and receiver <b>102</b>. Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be employed for voice communications, video transmission or data transmission. Accordingly, receiver <b>102</b> may be a mobile telephone, a satellite or terrestrial television receiver, a data processing system such as a wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) with Internet access capabilities, or some combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Those skilled in the art will recognize that the complete structure and operation of a wireless communications system or a receiver therein are not depicted or described herein. Instead, for simplicity and clarity, only so much of a wireless communications system and associated receiver as is unique to the present invention or necessary for an understanding of the present invention is depicted and described.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Receiver <b>102</b> preferably employs the chopper-direct-conversion architecture described above. Receiver <b>102</b> includes a circuit <b>104</b>, preferably implemented in a single integrated circuit, receiving a wireless radio frequency (RF) signal on an input <b>105</b> from an antenna (not shown). The received signal is passed through filter(s) and low noise amplifier <b>106</b>, then split into a differential signal and passed as dual inputs to a switching mixer <b>107</b> controlled by a local oscillator (LO) signal. A series-connected harmonic gating circuit <b>108</b> receives the outputs of switching mixer <b>107</b> and is controlled by a gate clock signal running at twice the frequency of the local oscillator. The output of the harmonic gating circuit <b>108</b> is passed through a channel filter and automatic gain control (AGC) amplifier(s) <b>109</b> to produce the baseband output signal at output <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Mixers of the type employed in radio receivers may generally be categorized in two classes: multiplying mixers and switching mixers. Multiplying mixers simply perform a multiplying function where the output is the product of two input signals. Such mixers typically produce relatively low harmonic response, and therefore usually require no harmonic rejection circuit. Switching mixers, on the other hand, respond to odd harmonic frequencies because the local oscillator input is driven with a “harmonic-rich” square wave. However multiplying mixers are costly, so switching mixers are gaining popularity in modern radios due to the superior linearity, simplicity and many integration advantages provided. For these and other reasons, the gated-switching mixer of the present invention employs the switching mixer approach.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Harmonic response within a switching mixer is generally determined by three parameters: (1) band select filter response characteristics when a radio frequency surface acoustic wave filter is employed before the mixer as described above; (2) board parasitic and low noise amplifier/mixer high frequency roll-offs; and (3) mixer intrinsic harmonic response. Among those parameters, the radio frequency surface acoustic wave response characteristics are generally the most significant contributor to harmonic response.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> plots the input-to-output transfer response of a high performance radio frequency surface acoustic wave filter connecting the antenna output to a receiver with a nominal center frequency of 1.84 giga-Hertz (GHz). At 5.52 GHz, the first odd harmonic (equal to three times the center frequency), the surface acoustic wave filter provides a minimum rejection of 30 decibels (dB). When implementing high performance radios, however, that level of rejection (30 dB) together with other intrinsic rejections may fall short of the 70 to 80 dB rejection target. The gated-switching mixer of the present invention is designed to remove this pitfall.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The addition of harmonic gating circuit <b>108</b> to a conventional direct-conversion radio architecture as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> utilizes a gating function to reject unwanted harmonics and forms the gated-switching mixer of the present invention. The gated-switching mixer is self-contained and may be employed in any direct-conversion, super-heterodyne radio, including the chopper-direct-conversion architecture with phase-alternating mixers described in the co-pending application identified above. With a slight modification, the gated-switching mixer depicted and described herein may be employed, as transformed, for up-conversion applications in radio transmitters.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/163,489 entitled “HARMONIC REJECTION MIXER” and filed Jun. 6, 2002, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a harmonic rejection circuit utilizing a parallel mixing configuration. Due to the multiple parallel mixers, the harmonic rejection mixer disclosed in that application is capable of providing multiple nulls as several harmonic frequencies (e.g., the 3<sup>rd </sup>and 5<sup>th </sup>harmonics). The serial gating configuration of the gated-switching mixer of the present invention, which targets a low-cost solution, does not allow similar provision for multiple frequency nulls, and thus can reject only one harmonic frequency (e.g., either the 3<sup>rd </sup>or the 5<sup>th </sup>harmonic). However, rejection one harmonic is satisfactory for the chopper-direct-conversion phase-alternating mixer architecture.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrate timing waveforms for the response of a gated-switching mixer according to one embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates application of the fundamental (i.e., transmission) frequency to the gated-switching mixer circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> raises the applied frequency to the 3<sup>rd </sup>harmonic. In both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, numbers on the left of the plot identify particular traces. The first trace (<b>1</b>) on each plot illustrates a local oscillator (LO) signal controlling the switching mixer and having a frequency arbitrarily selected for the purposes of illustration to equal a normalized value of 15. The second trace (<b>2</b>) illustrates the harmonic gating circuit gate clock, which has a frequency=LO×2=30 and an aperture in the example shown of 240° (that is, the signal is high for 240′ and low for 120°).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The third trace (<b>3</b>) in each plot illustrates the antenna input, which for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is RF=(LO×1)+offset=17, using an offset of 2, and for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is RF=(LO×3)+offset=47. The frequency offset of 2 is added to the RF signal to create a beat frequency of 2 at the baseband outputs (traces <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>, described below), enhancing the effectiveness of the illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Trace <b>4</b> illustrates the switching mixer output taken before the harmonic gating function, and is equivalent to conventional direct-conversion unfiltered baseband output. Trace <b>5</b> (the thinner of the two super-imposed traces) illustrates, for the purposes of comparison, a filtered version of trace <b>4</b> equivalent to the conventional direct-conversion baseband output—that is, at the output <b>110</b> of the circuit depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> if the harmonic gating circuit <b>108</b> is removed and the outputs of the switching mixer <b>107</b> are fed directly to the channel filter and AGC amplifier(s) <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Trace <b>6</b> illustrates a gated version of trace <b>4</b>, taken at the output of the harmonic gating circuit and incorporating the effect of harmonic filtering. Trace <b>7</b> (the thicker of the two superimposed traces) illustrates a filtered version of trace <b>6</b>, the final baseband output of a gated-switching mixer as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the harmonic gating function is effective in attenuating the 3<sup>rd </sup>harmonic response (trace <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is the input 3<sup>rd </sup>harmonic) to nearly zero (trace <b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the output). However, the conventional direct-conversion baseband output (trace <b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) has a large output due to the absence of harmonic rejection.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a plot of the harmonic response as a function of the harmonic gating circuit gate clock for a gated-switching mixer according to one embodiment of the present invention. The rejection frequency response of the gated-switching mixer according to the present invention is determined by the aperture width of the harmonic gate (i.e., the duty cycle of the gate clock controlling harmonic gating circuit <b>109</b>). Since the aperture width is the only controlling variable, the gated-switching mixer does not have provision for inserting nulls at multiple frequencies in the manner of the harmonic rejection mixer described above.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The harmonic responses of a variable duty cycle square (rectangular) wave gate clock signal for the harmonic gating circuit are plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. For the sake of clarity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the duty cycle values only up to 55%. Values higher than 55% result in mirror images of the values from 0% to 50% (i.e., the values for 66.6% mirror those for 33.3% because 1-0.66=0.33).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the gate clock signal exhibits a 50% duty cycle, all even harmonics are eliminated. In addition, the magnitudes of all of the odd harmonics follow the Fourier transform, such that the 3<sup>rd </sup>harmonic exhibits a magnitude of −9.5 dB, the 5<sup>th </sup>harmonic exhibits a magnitude of −14 dB, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When the gate clock signal has a 33.3% duty cycle (high for 120° and low for 240°), the magnitude of the 3<sup>rd </sup>harmonic becomes zero. Similarly, the magnitudes of the 6<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, and all 3×n<sup>th </sup>(where n is any positive, non-zero integer) harmonics are also zero. Accordingly, the gated-switching mixer of the present invention adapts this property and applies a 33.3% duty cycle to the gate clock for the harmonic gating circuit to reject the 3<sup>rd </sup>harmonic (as well as the 6<sup>th </sup>harmonic, the 9<sup>th </sup>harmonic, etc.). It should be noted that aperture widths corresponding to duty cycles of 33.3% and 66.6% are identical from a spectral perspective.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Since the gated-switching mixer depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> utilizes a fully balanced differential structure, the circuit does not respond to even harmonics. Thus the duty cycle of the gate clock is selected to reject the 3<sup>rd </sup>harmonic (or optionally the 5<sup>th </sup>harmonic instead). It should be noted that while nulls at multiple frequencies are not possible for the gated-switching mixer, selection of a 36.6% duty cycle results in a compromise suppression of both the 3<sup>rd </sup>and 5<sup>th </sup>harmonics at −19 dB.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates harmonic gating by two serial switches <b>108</b> connected to the output of the switching mixer <b>107</b>. In alternative embodiments, the switches may be relocated to the input side of the switching mixer, or the gating signal may be coded directly into the local oscillator input to the switching mixer (i.e., modifying the LO signal to incorporate switching appropriate for the selected gate clock duty cycle). For high-speed applications, a parallel shunting scheme may be utilized in which the signal gating function is achieved by shorting the mixer outputs to ground through two shunting switches or transistors, providing a low circuit impedance level.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In still another modification, a third “dummy” current path may be added to the existing two paths through the fully balanced differential switching mixer, similar to a Gilbert cell. When the harmonic gate is active (the mixer output is gated off), the differential currents through the differential signal pair in the switching mixer are totally branched off onto the additional current path, which gates off the mixer outputs without disrupting the circuit node impedances or other circuit parameters. Such an implementation would work well for high performance designs.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The gated-switching mixer of the present invention is simple and effective, enhancing the harmonic response of virtually any type of mixer. Importantly, when the harmonic rejection feature of the gated-switching mixer is incorporated into a chopper-direct-conversion architecture, the resulting performance level surpasses currently available radio architectures.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Although the present invention has been described in detail, those skilled in the art will understand that various changes, substitutions, variations, enhancements, nuances, gradations, lesser forms, alterations, revisions, improvements and knock-offs of the invention disclosed herein may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.</p>
