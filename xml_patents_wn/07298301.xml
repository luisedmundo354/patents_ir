<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to integrated circuits utilized for data processing applications. More particularly, the present invention relates to a data processing circuit and method for serializing data.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Integrated circuits are commonly utilized in digital and mixed signal systems for processing data. For example, integrated circuits typically form the basic building blocks for computer systems, digital data communications systems, and industrial data processing systems as well as other electronic systems. One particular example of a digital data communication system that may benefit from advanced data processing techniques is a telecommunication system such as a serial optical network (“SONET”) system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The rise of the information age has put ever increasing demands on integrated circuits used to process data. For example, systems previously designed to carry only sound, such as the telephone system, are now being designed to carry digital and mixed signal data between both individual users and large data processing networks such as computer networks. As more users store and communicate data using data networks, more and more data must be processed by the integrated circuits that are used to build the data processing systems. Accordingly, to keep up with the increasing data processing demands, integrated circuits must be designed to process data at ever increasing speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Integrated circuits used for data processing applications commonly require that data from a variety of different data sources be combined and transmitted over a single data line. For example, many systems require that parallel digital data signals be combined and transmitted serially over a single data line to another part of the system. A common circuit used to perform such a task is a serializer or multiplexer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a functional diagram of a typical multiplexer commonly used and well known in the art. The multiplexer <b>100</b> includes input lines D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> for receiving data Din<b>0</b> and Din<b>1</b>, a select line for receiving a select control signal, and an output line. The multiplexer couples only one of the input lines to the output line in accordance with the particular state of the select control signal. For a 2-input multiplexer, the select line may receive a binary logic signal for coupling each of the input lines to the output line.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, as the speed of data processing systems increases, traditional multiplexer circuits used to serialize data may fail to work effectively. For example, one problem is that the multiplexer circuitry must be designed and timed such the data received on each of the input lines of the multiplexer is available at the output of the multiplexer when the particular input line is selected by the select line. If the timing of the data received on each of the multiplexer inputs and the control signals received on the select line are not precisely controlled, then the output may contain erroneous data, and the system will not work.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, what is needed is a data processing system and method that can serialize data at very high frequencies. Additionally, what is needed is a synchronous data serialization circuit that can process data from multiple data sources at very high frequencies.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with the present invention a data processing circuit includes a first data path for processing first data, the first data path including a first data storage circuit, a second data path for processing second data, the second data path including a second data storage circuit, a multiplexer having a first input coupled to the first data path and a second input coupled to the second data path, the multiplexer having a select input coupled to a clock signal, and a delay circuit configured to delay storage of the second data in the second data storage circuit, wherein the first data storage circuit stores the first data in response to receiving a first timing signal, and the second data storage circuit stores the second data in response to receiving a second timing signal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the first data storage circuit is a flip-flop that receives and stores the first data in response to a clock signal making a transition in a first direction, such as the rising edge of a clock, for example. Additionally, in one embodiment, the second data storage circuit is a flip-flop that receives and stores the second data in response to a clock signal making a transition in a second direction opposite the first direction, such as the falling edge of a clock, for example. Furthermore, in one embodiment, the delay circuit is configured to receive the second data on a first input and transmit delayed second data to an input of the second data storage circuit.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A data processing circuit and method according to the present invention solves the problems associated with prior art data serialization circuits and methods and provides a particularly advantageous solution for high speed data processing systems. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a data processing circuit <b>200</b> including a multiplexer <b>210</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. Data processing circuit <b>200</b> includes a multiplexer <b>210</b>, a first data path <b>220</b>, and a second data path <b>230</b>. First data path <b>220</b> receives and processes data Din<b>0</b> on data input line <b>221</b>. The first data path <b>220</b> includes a data storage circuit <b>225</b> for storing the data Din<b>0</b> received on the data input line <b>221</b>. The data storage circuit <b>225</b> may be a clocked data storage circuit that stores the data on data input line <b>221</b> in response to receiving a timing signal on line <b>222</b>. The output of first data path <b>220</b> is coupled to an input line <b>211</b> of multiplexer <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Second data path <b>230</b> receives data Din<b>1</b> on data input line <b>231</b>. The second data path <b>230</b> also receives a clock signal (“CLK”) on clock signal line <b>232</b>. The second data path <b>230</b> also includes a data storage circuit <b>250</b> for storing the data Din<b>1</b> received on the data input line <b>231</b>. The data storage circuit <b>250</b> may be a clocked data storage circuit that stores the data on data input line <b>231</b> in response to receiving a timing signal. The timing signals may be, for example, positive or negative transitions (e.g., rising or falling edges) of CLK on clock signal line <b>232</b>. However, timing signals may also be derived from CLK. The output of second data path <b>230</b> is coupled to a second input line <b>212</b> of multiplexer <b>210</b>. The second data path also generates a select signal on select input <b>213</b> for controlling the multiplexer <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The second data path <b>230</b> also includes a delay circuit <b>240</b>. The delay circuit <b>240</b> is configured to delay the storage of the data Din<b>1</b> on data input line <b>231</b> in the data storage circuit <b>250</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, the delay circuit <b>240</b> delays the storage of input data Din<b>1</b> by approximately one-half the period of CLK. This advantageously results in a phase relationship between the data on multiplexer input lines <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> of one-half the period of CLK. The data processing system <b>200</b> may also be referred to herein as a synchronous multiplexer circuit. It is to be understood that a synchronous multiplexer circuit may be either a stand alone system, or integrated as part of a larger integrated data processing system. It is further to be understood that the amount of delay may vary depending on the circuit application.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a data processing circuit <b>300</b> according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The data processing circuit <b>300</b> includes a multiplexer <b>310</b>, a D type flip-flop (“DFF”) <b>320</b>, a delay cell circuit <b>340</b>, and a second DFF <b>350</b>. The DFF <b>320</b> is coupled to receive a first data bit Din<b>0</b> on data input line <b>321</b>. A clock signal CLK is received on clock line <b>332</b>. The clock line is divided, and clock signals are transmitted to DFF <b>320</b> on line <b>322</b>, DFF <b>350</b> on line <b>333</b>, and multiplexer <b>310</b> on line <b>313</b>. DFF <b>320</b> is a rising edge triggered flip-flop. Accordingly, the DFF <b>320</b> stores data Din<b>0</b> in response to receiving a rising edge of the clock signal on line <b>322</b>. It is to be understood, however, that the polarity of the devices used, as well as the logic, could be changed without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, logic signals may be transmitted on individual single lines having voltage or current signals with rising and falling edges, or alternatively, multiple lines may be used for positive and negative transitions of a differential signal, as discussed in more detail below. The stored data bit in DFF <b>320</b> is transmitted on the DFF Q output to the multiplexer <b>310</b> over multiplexer input line <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to one embodiment, the delay cell circuit <b>340</b> is configured to receive data Din<b>1</b> on data input line <b>331</b>. The output of the delay cell circuit <b>340</b> is coupled to the D input of DFF <b>350</b>. The delay cell circuit <b>340</b> is configured to delay the data Din<b>1</b> by approximately one-half a clock period. The DFF <b>350</b> receives delayed data bits Q<b>1</b> on input line <b>351</b> and a clock signal on line <b>333</b>. DFF <b>350</b> is a falling edge triggered flip-flop. Accordingly, DFF <b>350</b> stores delayed data Q<b>1</b> in response to receiving a falling edge of the clock signal on line <b>333</b>. However, it is to be understood that the polarity of the devices used could be changed without departing from the scope of the present invention. The stored delayed data bit in DFF <b>350</b> is transmitted on the DFF Q output to the multiplexer <b>310</b> over multiplexer input line <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Multiplexer <b>310</b> receives a stored data value Q<b>0</b> on multiplexer input line <b>311</b> and a stored delayed data value Q<b>2</b> on multiplexer input line <b>312</b>. Multiplexer input lines <b>311</b> and <b>312</b> are selectively coupled to a single multiplexer serial output line <b>314</b>, which carries serial data Dout<b>0</b>. The multiplexer <b>310</b> is controlled by a signal received on a select input line <b>313</b>. As previously stated, select input line <b>313</b> is coupled to divided clock line <b>332</b>. Therefore, the multiplexer <b>310</b> will couple the stored data bit Q<b>0</b> on line <b>311</b> to the serial output line <b>314</b> during a first portion of the clock signal period, and multiplexer <b>310</b> will couple the stored delayed data bit Q<b>2</b> on line <b>312</b> to the serial output line <b>314</b> during a second portion of the clock signal period.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a timing diagram of the exemplary data processing circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to aid in understanding the operation of the circuit. The first three timelines show the relation between the received data Din<b>0</b> and Din<b>1</b> on input lines <b>321</b> and <b>331</b>, respectively, and the clock signal CLK. Data Din<b>0</b> on input line <b>321</b> is stored into DFF <b>320</b> on the rising edge of CLK as shown at timing marker t<b>1</b>. Timing marker t<b>1</b> is also helpful to illustrate the relation between data Din<b>1</b> on input line <b>331</b> and delayed data Q<b>1</b> at the output of delay cell circuit <b>340</b>. According to one exemplary embodiment, the delay cell circuit <b>340</b> delays the input data Din<b>1</b> by approximately one-half the clock signal period. The delayed data Q<b>1</b> on line <b>351</b> is stored in DFF <b>350</b> on the falling edge of CLK as shown at timing marker t<b>2</b>. Furthermore, when the clock signal transitions from high to low at t<b>2</b>, then during the low portion of the clock period, the stored data Q<b>0</b> on multiplexer input line <b>311</b> is coupled to the output <b>314</b>. When the clock signal transitions from low to high, then during the high portion of the clock period, the stored delayed data Q<b>2</b> on multiplexer input line <b>312</b> is coupled to the output <b>314</b>. Accordingly, data received by the circuit on lines <b>321</b> and <b>331</b> may be combined on line <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also helps to illustrate a method according to the present invention of serializing data received in parallel. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the method includes receiving and storing the first data bit Din<b>0</b> in a first clocked data storage circuit in response to a first timing signal, such as the rising edge of a clock, for example. A second data bit Din<b>1</b> may be received and delayed by a delay cell circuit such as the one illustrated at <b>340</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The delayed data bit Q<b>1</b> is then stored in a second clocked data storage circuit in response to a second timing signal, such as the falling edge of the clock, for example. The stored first data bit Q<b>0</b> may then be coupled to the serial output during a first portion of the clock signal, and the stored delayed second data bit Q<b>2</b> may be coupled to the serial output during a second portion of the clock signal.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a data processing circuit <b>500</b> according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The data processing circuit <b>500</b> includes a multiplexer <b>510</b>, a D type flip-flop (“DFF”) <b>520</b>, a first delay cell circuit <b>540</b>, a second DFF <b>550</b>, and a second delay cell <b>560</b>. Data processing circuit <b>500</b> is particularly advantageous for implementations where the propagation delay of the DFFs are close to, or greater than, one-half of a clock period. The DFF <b>520</b> is coupled to receive a first data bit Din<b>0</b> on data input line <b>521</b>. A clock signal CLK is received on clock line <b>532</b>. The clock line is divided, and clock signals are transmitted to DFF <b>520</b> on line <b>522</b>, DFF <b>550</b> on line <b>533</b>, and second delay cell <b>560</b> on line <b>534</b>. DFF <b>520</b> may be a rising edge triggered flip-flop. Accordingly, the DFF <b>520</b> stores data Din<b>0</b> in response to receiving a rising edge of the clock signal on line <b>522</b>. The stored data bit in DFF <b>520</b> is transmitted on the DFF Q output to the multiplexer <b>510</b> over multiplexer input line <b>511</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first delay cell circuit <b>540</b> is configured to receive data Din<b>1</b> on data input line <b>531</b>. The output of the delay cell circuit <b>540</b> is coupled to the D input of DFF <b>550</b>. The delay cell circuit <b>540</b> is configured to delay the data Din<b>1</b> by approximately one-half a clock period. The DFF <b>550</b> receives delayed data bits Q<b>1</b> on input line <b>551</b> and a clock signal on line <b>533</b>. DFF <b>550</b> may be a falling edge triggered flip-flop. Accordingly, DFF <b>550</b> stores delayed data Q<b>1</b> in response to receiving a falling edge of the clock signal on line <b>533</b>. The stored delayed data bit in DFF <b>550</b> is transmitted on the DFF Q output to the multiplexer <b>510</b> over multiplexer input line <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Multiplexer <b>510</b> receives a stored data value Q<b>0</b> on multiplexer input line <b>511</b> and a stored delayed data value Q<b>2</b> on multiplexer input line <b>512</b>. Multiplexer input lines <b>511</b> and <b>512</b> are selectively coupled to a single multiplexer serial output line <b>514</b>, which carries serial data Dout<b>0</b>. The multiplexer <b>510</b> is controlled by a signal received on a select input line <b>513</b>. However, due to delays in the DFFs, it may be necessary to delay the reception of the clock signal at the select input line <b>513</b> of the multiplexer. Thus, the second delay cell circuit <b>560</b> receives the clock signal on delay input line <b>534</b> and generates a delayed version of the clock signal on multiplexer select input line <b>513</b>. Therefore, the multiplexer <b>510</b> will couple the stored data bit Q<b>0</b> on line <b>511</b> to the serial output line <b>514</b> during a first portion of the delayed clock signal period, and multiplexer <b>510</b> will couple the stored delayed data bit Q<b>2</b> on line <b>512</b> to the serial output line <b>514</b> during a second portion of the delayed clock signal period. In this manner, the second delay circuit element <b>560</b> compensates for delays introduced into the system by the DFFs.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Features and advantages of the present invention have particular significance in applications that required very high frequency operation. For high speed applications, the circuit blocks described above may be implemented using current-controlled complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (i.e., C<sup>3</sup>MOS™) logic, which is described in more detail in commonly owned U.S. application Ser. No. 09/484,856 entitled “CURRENT-CONTROLLED CMOS LOGIC-FAMILY” filed Jan. 18, 2000 by Armond Hairapetian, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates a C<sup>3</sup>MOS delay circuit <b>600</b> that may be used to implement high frequency delay cells according to one embodiment of the present invention. The delay circuit includes a pair of differentially connected MOS transistors <b>601</b> and <b>602</b>. Load resistors <b>604</b> and <b>603</b> are series connected to inductors <b>605</b> and <b>606</b>. The series connected resistor-inductors are coupled between a power supply line <b>607</b> and the drains of MOS transistors <b>601</b> and <b>602</b>. The sources of transistors <b>601</b> and <b>602</b> are coupled together and through a current source <b>650</b> to ground <b>610</b>. The inductors provide shunt peaking to further improve the bandwidth of the circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Input signals are received at the input of transistors <b>601</b> and <b>602</b> on differential data lines <b>620</b> (i.e., Vinp) and <b>630</b> (i.e., Vinn). The outputs of the circuit may be taken at the drains of transistors <b>601</b> and <b>602</b>. Thus, when using a C<sup>3</sup>MOS logic implementation, it is to be understood that data will be transmitted or received, or both, on a pair of differential data lines. Thus, delay cell <b>540</b>, receiving Din<b>1</b>, and delay cell <b>560</b>, receiving CLK, may both receive differential signals when implemented using C<sup>3</sup>MOS logic. In one embodiment, the delay between the input and output of delay circuit <b>600</b> may be less than 1 picosecond. However, the delay of actual implementations may vary with processing. In order to obtain more control over the delay of delay circuit <b>600</b>, a capacitor array <b>640</b> may be used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. Capacitor array <b>640</b> includes first and second capacitors <b>641</b> and <b>642</b> that are each series connected to switches <b>643</b> and <b>644</b>, respectively. A parallel combination of switched capacitors may be connected between each of the outputs of the delay circuit <b>600</b> and ground <b>610</b>. Thus, the delay time between the input and output of the delay circuit <b>600</b> can be varied by selectively activating/deactivating (i.e., ON/OFF) the switches <b>643</b> and <b>644</b>, thereby selectively coupling capacitors <b>641</b> and <b>642</b> to an output of the delay circuit <b>600</b>. When one or both of the switches <b>643</b> and <b>644</b> are switched ON, the capacitance on the output node will increase, and a longer delay will result. Switching the capacitors out of the circuit will correspondingly reduce the delay.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a C<sup>3</sup>MOS clocked D type flip-flop <b>700</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. DFF <b>700</b> includes series connected latches <b>700</b>A and <b>700</b>B that each include a differential pair of transistors <b>701</b>-<b>702</b> and <b>705</b>-<b>706</b>. Latch <b>700</b>A includes a first differential pair <b>701</b>-<b>702</b> that receives differential inputs Vinp and Vinn at the gate terminals, and a second differential pair of transistors <b>703</b>-<b>704</b> that have their gate and drain terminals cross-coupled to the outputs of the first differential pair <b>701</b>-<b>702</b>. Clocked transistors <b>712</b> and <b>7</b>.<b>11</b> respectively connect common-source nodes of differential pairs <b>701</b>-<b>702</b> and <b>703</b>-<b>704</b> to a current-source <b>750</b>. Complementary clock signals CKn and CKp drive the gate terminals of clocked transistors <b>712</b> and <b>711</b>. The first differential pair <b>701</b>-<b>702</b> of latch <b>700</b>A also includes load resistors <b>721</b> and <b>723</b> that are each connected in series with inductors <b>722</b> and <b>724</b> between a voltage supply <b>730</b> and the drains of transistors <b>701</b> and <b>702</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A C<sup>3</sup>MOS master-slave flip-flop <b>700</b> can be made by combining the two latches <b>700</b>A and <b>700</b>B as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. A first latch <b>700</b>A receives differential input signals Vinp and Vinn and generates differential output signals Vlqn and Vlqp. The differential output signals Vlqn and Vlqp are then applied to the differential inputs of transistors <b>705</b> and <b>706</b> of a second latch <b>700</b>B. The differential pair <b>705</b>-<b>706</b> of latch <b>700</b>B also includes load resistors <b>725</b> and <b>727</b> that are each connected in series with inductors <b>726</b> and <b>728</b> between a voltage supply <b>730</b> and the drains of transistors <b>705</b> and <b>706</b>, respectively.

The differential outputs Vqn and Vqp of second latch <b>700</b>B provide the outputs of flip-flop <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an exemplary C<sup>3</sup>MOS implementation for a 2:1 multiplexer according to one embodiment of the present invention. Multiplexer <b>800</b> includes a differential pair of transistors <b>801</b>-<b>802</b> and <b>803</b>-<b>804</b> for each input, but multiplexer <b>800</b> further includes select transistors <b>805</b> and <b>806</b> inserted between the common source terminals of the differential pairs and the current source <b>850</b>. By asserting one of the select input signals, such as, for example, differential clock signals CKn or CKp, the bias current is steered to the differential pair associated with that select transistor. Thus, signal CKn steers the bias current to the differential pair with Vinp<b>1</b> and Vinn<b>1</b> inputs, and signal CKp steers the bias current to the differential pair with Vinp<b>2</b> and Vinn<b>2</b> inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, the present invention may be utilized in a system processing data in the gigahertz range (i.e. above 1 GHz). For instance, one application the present invention may be used in a system that combines C<sup>3</sup>MOS logic with conventional CMOS logic to achieve an optimum balance between speed and power consumption. According to this embodiment, an integrated circuit utilizes C<sup>3</sup>MOS logic for the ultra high speed (e.g., GHz) portions of the circuitry, and conventional CMOS logic for the relatively lower speed sections. For example, to enable an integrated circuit to be used in ultra high speed applications, the input and output circuitry that interfaces with and processes the high speed signals is implemented using C<sup>3</sup>MOS. The circuit also employs C<sup>3</sup>MOS to divide down the frequency of the signals being processed to a low enough frequency where conventional CMOS logic can be used. The core of the circuit, according to this embodiment, is therefore implemented by conventional CMOS logic that consumes zero static current. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a simplified block diagram illustrating this exemplary embodiment of the invention. A C<sup>3</sup>MOS input circuit <b>900</b> receives a high frequency input signal IN and outputs a divided down version of the signal IN/n. The lower frequency signal IN/n is then processes by core circuitry <b>902</b> that is implemented in conventional CMOS logic. A synchronous data serialization circuit according to the present invention may then be used in C<sup>3</sup>MOS output circuit <b>904</b> to convert the processed IN/n signal back to the original frequency (or any other desired frequency) before driving it onto the output node OUT.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an exemplary circuit application of the C<sup>3</sup>MOS/CMOS combined logic wherein C<sup>3</sup>MOS logic is used to deserialize and serialize the signal stream while CMOS logic is used as the core signal processing logic circuitry. C<sup>3</sup>MOS input circuitry <b>1000</b> is a deserializer that receives a serial bit stream at a high frequency of, for example, 2 GHz. A 2 GHz input clock signal CLK is divided down to 1 GHz using a C<sup>3</sup>MOS flip-flop <b>1002</b>, such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, that is connected in a ÷2 feedback configuration. The 1 GHz output of flip-flop <b>1002</b> is then supplied to clock inputs of a pair of C<sup>3</sup>MOS latches <b>1004</b> and <b>1006</b>. Latches <b>1004</b> and <b>1006</b> receive the 2 GHz input bit stream at their inputs and respectively sample the rising and falling edges of the input bit stream in response to the 1 GHz clock signal CLK/2. The signal CLK/2 which is applied to the inputs of each latch, samples the input data preferably at its center. It is to be noted that the rise and fall times of the signal in CMOS logic is often very dependent on process variations and device matching. C<sup>3</sup>MOS logic, on the other hand, is differential in nature and therefore provides much improved margins for sampling.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, block <b>1000</b> thus deserializes the input bit stream with its frequency halved to allow for the use of conventional CMOS logic to process the signals. The signals at the outputs of latches <b>1004</b> and <b>1006</b> are applied to parallel processing circuitry <b>1008</b> that are implemented in conventional CMOS logic operating at 1 GHz. The reverse is performed at the output. Thus, a serializer <b>1010</b> according to the present invention may receive the output signals from processing circuitry <b>1008</b> and serializes them using C<sup>3</sup>MOS logic. The final output signal is a bit stream with the original 2 GHz frequency. Circuit applications wherein this technique can advantageously be employed include high speed single or multi-channel serial links in communication systems.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As apparent from the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, this technique doubles the amount of the core signal processing circuitry. However, since this part of the circuit is implemented in conventional CMOS logic, current dissipation is not increased by the doubling of the circuitry. Those skilled in the art appreciate that there can be more than one level of deserializing and serializing if further reduction in operating frequency is desired. That is, the frequency of the input signal can be divided down further by 4 or 8 or more if desired, and then later recombined using the serializer techniques of the present invention. As each resulting bit stream will require its own signal processing circuitry, the amount and size of the overall circuitry increases in direct proportion to the number by which the input signal frequency is divided. For each application, therefore, there is an optimum number depending on the speed, power and area requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a simplified block diagram of a tranceiver system that utilizes C<sup>3</sup>MOS/CMOS combined logic to facilitate interconnecting high speed fiber optic communication channels. The exemplary tranceiver of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is typically found along fiber optic channels in high speed telecommunication networks. The tranceiver includes at its input an optical input system <b>1100</b> such as, for example, a photo detect and driver circuit that receives the input signal from the fiber optic channel. Circuit <b>1100</b> converts fiber-optic signal to packets of data and supplies it to a clock data recovery (CDR) circuit <b>1102</b>. CDR circuit <b>1102</b> recovers the clock and data signals that may be in the frequency range of about 2.5 GHz. Established telecommunication standards require the tranceiver to perform various functions, including data monitoring and error correction. These functions are performed at a lower frequency. Thus, the tranceiver uses a demultiplexer <b>1104</b> which deserializes the 2.5 GHz data stream into, for example, 16 parallel signals having a frequency of about 115 MHz. An application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) <b>1106</b> then performs the monitoring and error correction functions at the lower (115 MHz) frequency. The present invention may then be utilized to implement a multiplexer and clock multiplication unit (CMU) <b>1108</b> to convert the parallel signals back into a single bit stream at 2.5 GHz. This signal is then coupled to an optical output system <b>1112</b> that retransmits the data back onto the fiber optic channel by a laser driver, for example. The combined C<sup>3</sup>MOS/CMOS techniques allow demultiplexer <b>1104</b>, ASIC <b>1106</b> and a multiplexer and CMU <b>1108</b>, which utilizes the present invention, to be fabricated on a single silicon die.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Having fully described several embodiments of the present invention, other equivalent or alternative methods of practicing the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, the polarity of the signals used to control the storing of data bits received and selection of the multiplexer may be modified. Additionally, alternate configurations of the delay cell circuit for delaying the storing of the data in the storage circuit in the second signal path could be used. Furthermore, other clocked data storage circuits structures could be used such as latches, other FF structures, or other forms of regenerative memories. These and other embodiments as well as alternatives and equivalents to the invention will be recognizable to those of skill in the art after reading the description of the present invention. The scope of the invention should not, therefore, be determined solely by reference to the above description, but instead should be determined with reference to the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents and alternatives.</p>
