<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2004-61503, filed on Aug. 4, 2004 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a cooking device, and more particularly to a cooking device in which a cooking compartment is divided by a partition.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a cooking device, such as a microwave oven or an electric oven, it is desirable to have a cooking chamber in a housing and a heating device for heating the food to be placed in the cooking chamber. The cooking chamber is divided into an upper cooking chamber and a lower cooking chamber by a partition so that the space in the cooking chamber can be effectively utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, recently, a cooking device has been developed which has heating devices installed in the upper cooking chamber and the lower cooking chamber and capable of controlling temperature in the respective cooking chambers independently. Different foods are placed in the upper cooking chamber and the lower cooking chamber, respectively, and heated at different temperatures simultaneously, so that various foods can be cooked rapidly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the conventional cooking device, since the upper cooking chamber and the lower cooking chamber are heated at different temperatures, heat is transferred through the partition. This heat transfer affects the temperature in the respective cooking chambers so that the temperatures in the cooking chambers cannot be precisely controlled.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional aspects and/or advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Exemplary embodiments have been made in view of the above-mentioned problems, and an aspect of the invention is to provide a cooking device capable of independently controlling temperatures in respective cooking chambers by installing separate ventilating devices in the respective cooking chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with one aspect, exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a partitioning member, installed in a cooking chamber, for partitioning the cooking chamber into a first cooking chamber and a second cooking chamber, a heater for heating food to be placed in the cooking chamber, and a ventilating device for ventilating air in the first cooking chamber and the second cooking chamber, independently.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Exemplary embodiments of a cooking device may further include a controller for controlling the heater to maintain the second cooking chamber at a predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Moreover, the controller may be set to drive the ventilating device when the second cooking chamber is not maintained at the predetermined temperature due to heat transfer from the first cooking chamber to the second cooking chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The controller may be set to stop the ventilating device when the temperature in the second cooking chamber is under the predetermined temperature due to the operation of the ventilation device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The cooking device, according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, may further include a controller for driving the heater when the temperature in the second cooking chamber is under a predetermined temperature, and for driving the ventilating device when the temperature in the second cooking chamber exceeds the predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The cooking device, according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, may further include a controller for controlling the ventilating device to ventilate the air in the cooking chamber at a predetermined time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Exemplary embodiments of a partitioning member may have a partition for dividing the cooking chamber into an upper cooking chamber and a lower cooking chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The heater may include an upper heating section for heating the food placed in the upper cooking chamber, and a lower heating section for heating the food placed in the lower cooking chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The ventilating device may include an air intake pipe for communicating an air intake hole formed at the front side of the cooking device with the cooking chamber, and a blower, installed at an intermediate portion of the air intake pipe, for ventilating the air in the cooking chamber by force.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The air intake pipe may be branched into a first branch pipe communicated with the first cooking chamber, and a second branch pipe communicated with the second cooking chamber, and the cooking device may further include a valve, installed at a branched point of the air intake pipe, for selectively communicating the air intake hole with the first cooking chamber or the second cooking chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">To achieve the above and/or other aspects and advantages, embodiments of the present invention may include a method for maintaining the temperature in a first cooking chamber of a cooking device including at least first and second cooking chambers, the method including supplying heat to first and second cooking chambers; measuring the temperature in the first chamber; comparing the temperature in the first cooking chamber to a first predetermined temperature; and ventilating air into the first cooking chamber until the temperature in the first cooking chamber equals the predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The air may be prevented from reaching the first cooking chamber when the temperature of the first cooking chamber equals the first predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The method may further comprise measuring the temperature in the second cooking chamber; comparing the temperature in the second cooking chamber to a second predetermined temperature; and ventilating air into the second cooking chamber until the temperature in the second cooking chamber equals the predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The air may be prevented from reaching the second cooking chamber when the temperature of the first cooking chamber equals the second predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The method may further include the operation of exhausting air in the first cooking chamber at a predetermined time interval.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout. Exemplary embodiments are described below to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An exemplary embodiment of a cooking device, according to the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is formed with a cooking chamber <b>10</b> at the lower side of a main body housing <b>1</b>. A door <b>2</b> is installed at the front side of the cooking chamber <b>10</b>, to pivot upward and downward so as to open and close the cooking chamber <b>10</b>. At the front upper side of the cooking chamber <b>10</b>, a manipulation section <b>4</b> for controlling the temperature in the cooking chamber <b>10</b> by a user and a display <b>3</b> for displaying the cooking status information are installed. An air-intake hole <b>5</b> is formed at the right side of the display <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The cooking chamber <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is installed with a partition <b>19</b>. The partition <b>19</b> divides the cooking chamber <b>10</b> into an upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>and a lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b</i>. The user places the food on the partition <b>19</b> when cooking the food in the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a</i>, and places the food on the bottom of the cooking chamber <b>10</b> when cooking the food in the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b</i>, and then heats the food in the cooking chamber <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Rear walls of the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>are formed with an upper hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>and a lower hole <b>12</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Heated hot air is introduced through the upper hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the lower hole <b>12</b><i>b</i>. An upper exhaust port <b>11</b> and an upper intake port <b>13</b> are formed to suck and exhaust air by communicating the interior of the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>with the exterior, and a lower exhaust port <b>15</b> and a lower intake port <b>17</b> are formed to suck and exhaust air by communicating the interior of the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>with the exterior.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an intake pipe <b>21</b> extends from the intake hole <b>5</b> formed at the front side of the main body <b>1</b> to a rear inside of the main body <b>1</b>, and a blower <b>23</b> is installed at an intermediate portion of the intake pipe <b>21</b>, so as to suck the exterior air by force. The intake pipe <b>21</b> is branched into an upper branch pipe <b>27</b><i>a </i>and a lower branch pipe <b>27</b><i>b</i>, and is installed with a valve <b>26</b> at the branching point. The valve <b>26</b> selectively communicates the intake pipe <b>21</b> with either the upper branch pipe <b>27</b><i>a </i>or the lower branch pipe <b>27</b><i>b</i>, or communicates the intake pipe <b>21</b> with both the upper branch pipe <b>27</b><i>a </i>and the lower branch pipe <b>27</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the upper branch pipe <b>27</b><i>a </i>is communicated with the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>via the upper intake hole <b>13</b>, and the lower branch pipe <b>27</b><i>b </i>is communicated with the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>via the lower intake hole <b>17</b>. Thus, the outside air introduced into the main body <b>1</b> through the intake hole <b>5</b> may be supplied to the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b</i>, independently.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Moreover, an upper exhaust pipe <b>28</b><i>a </i>and a lower exhaust pipe <b>28</b><i>b </i>are installed at rear sides of the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b</i>, respectively. The upper exhaust pipe <b>28</b><i>a </i>and the lower exhaust pipe <b>28</b><i>b </i>are joined to each other so as to form a single exhaust pipe <b>29</b>. The upper exhaust pipe <b>28</b><i>a </i>is communicated with the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>via the upper exhaust port <b>11</b>, and the lower exhaust pipe <b>28</b><i>b </i>is communicated with the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>via the lower exhaust port <b>15</b>. Thus, the outside air supplied to the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>is circulated within the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b</i>, and then exhausted to the exterior via the exhaust pipe <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, an upper heating section <b>30</b><i>a </i>for heating food placed in the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>and a lower heating section <b>30</b><i>b </i>for heating food to be placed in the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>are installed at rear sides of the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b</i>, respectively. When electric power is supplied, the temperature of the heating sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>is increased. Blower fans <b>31</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>b </i>and motors <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>installed at rear sides of the heating sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>blow heated ambient air around the heating sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>into the cooking chamber <b>10</b>. At this time, the heated ambient air around the heating sections <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>is supplied into the cooking chamber <b>10</b> via the upper hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the lower hole <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">To use the cooking device constructed as described above, the foods are placed in the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b</i>, respectively. The foods placed in the cooking chambers <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>are cooked by being heated at predetermined temperatures. If the food placed in the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>is set to be heated at 300 degrees centigrade, and the food placed in the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>is set to be heated at 120 degrees centigrade, heat is transferred from the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>to the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>via the partition <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If the heat is continuously transferred, the temperature in the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>cannot be maintained at a proper temperature, that is, 120 degrees centigrade, even when the electric power to be supplied to the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>is cut off. Thus, if a proper amount of outside air is supplied into the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>via the lower intake hole <b>17</b>, the air temperature in the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>is lowered. When the air temperature in the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>is lowered to the predetermined temperature, that is, 120 degrees centigrade, the valve <b>26</b> is closed so as to halt the introduction of the outside air into the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b</i>. This process may be performed by installing a temperature sensor <b>45</b><i>a </i>in the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>and a temperature sensor <b>45</b><i>b </i>in the lower cooking chamber <b>45</b><i>b</i>, and by providing a controller <b>40</b> for driving the blower <b>23</b> and closing/opening the valve <b>26</b> by using information about the temperature received from at least one of the temperature sensors <b>45</b><i>a </i>and <b>45</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Moreover, since it is difficult to hermetically seal the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>by using the partition <b>19</b>, there may be an air stream present between the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, since the smell of the food placed in the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>may be mixed with the smell of the food placed in the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the inherent smell of the food to be cooked may be lost. Even in this case, this problem can be solved by exhausting the air in the upper cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the lower cooking chamber <b>10</b><i>b </i>at a predetermined time interval. Further, this function can be automatically performed by the controller <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, according to exemplary embodiments of the cooking device of the present invention, the temperatures in the respective cooking chambers can be independently controlled by installing independent ventilating devices in the respective cooking chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Moreover, the food placed in one cooking chamber can be prevented from absorbing the smell of the food placed in the other cooking chamber due to the air stream between the cooking chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although a few exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these exemplary embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their equivalents.</p>
