<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to microelectronic devices and more particularly to transistors, for example, metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs).</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electrical circuits requiring high power handling capability (&gt;20 watts) while operating at high frequencies such as radio frequencies (500 MHz), S-band (3 GHz) and X-band (10 GHz) have in recent years become more prevalent. Because of the increase in high power, high frequency circuits there has been a corresponding increase in demand for transistors that are capable of reliably operating at radio frequencies and above while still being capable of handling higher power loads. Previously, bipolar transistors and power metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) have been used for high power applications but the power handling capability of such devices may be limited at higher operating frequencies. Junction field-effect transistors (JFETs) were commonly used for high frequency applications but the power handling capability of previously known JFETs may also be limited.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, metal-semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs) have been developed for high frequency applications. The MESFET construction may be preferable for high frequency applications because only majority carriers carry current. The MESFET design may be preferred over current MOSFET designs because the reduced gate capacitance permits faster switching times of the gate input. Therefore, although all field-effect transistors utilize only majority carriers to carry current, the Schottky gate structure of the MESFET may make the MESFET more desirable for high frequency applications.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to the type of structure, and perhaps more fundamentally, the characteristics of the semiconductor material from which a transistor is formed also affects the operating parameters. Of the characteristics that affect a transistor's operating parameters, the electron mobility, saturated electron drift velocity, electric breakdown field and thermal conductivity may have the greatest effect on a transistor's high frequency and high power characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Electron mobility is the measurement of how rapidly an electron is accelerated to its saturated velocity in the presence of an electric field. In the past, semiconductor materials which have a high electron mobility were preferred because more current could be developed with a lesser field, resulting in faster response times when a field is applied. Saturated electron drift velocity is the maximum velocity that an electron can obtain in the semiconductor material. Materials with higher saturated electron drift velocities are preferred for high frequency applications because the higher velocity translates to shorter times from source to drain.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Electric breakdown field is the field strength at which breakdown of the Schottky junction and the current through the gate of the device suddenly increases. A high electric breakdown field material is preferred for high power, high frequency transistors because larger electric fields generally can be supported by a given dimension of material. Larger electric fields allow for faster transients as the electrons can be accelerated more quickly by larger electric fields than by smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thermal conductivity is the ability of the semiconductor material to dissipate heat. In typical operations, all transistors generate heat. In turn, high power and high frequency transistors usually generate larger amounts of heat than small signal transistors. As the temperature of the semiconductor material increases, the junction leakage currents generally increase and the current through the field effect transistor generally decreases due to a decrease in carrier mobility with an increase in temperature. Therefore, if the heat is dissipated from the semiconductor, the material will remain at a lower temperature and be capable of carrying larger currents with lower leakage currents.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the past, high frequency MESFETs have been manufactured of n-type III-V compounds, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) because of their high electron mobilities. Although these devices provided increased operating frequencies and moderately increased power handling capability, the relatively low breakdown voltage and the lower thermal conductivity of these materials have limited their usefulness in high power applications.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Silicon carbide (SiC) has been known for many years to have excellent physical and electronic properties which should theoretically allow production of electronic devices that can operate at higher temperatures, higher power and higher frequency than devices produced from silicon (Si) or GaAs. The high electric breakdown field of about 4×10<sup>6 </sup>V/cm, high saturated electron drift velocity of about 2.0×10<sup>7 </sup>cm/sec and high thermal conductivity of about 4.9 W/cm-° K. indicate that SiC would be suitable for high frequency, high power applications. Unfortunately, difficulty in manufacturing has limited the usefulness of SiC for high power and high frequency applications.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">MESFETs have been produced having channel layers of silicon carbide have been produced on silicon substrates (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,762,806 to Suzuki et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,028 to Kondoh et al.). Because the semiconductor layers of a MESFET are epitaxial, the layer upon which each epitaxial layer is grown affects the characteristics of the device. Thus, a SiC epitaxial layer grown on a Si substrate generally has different electrical and thermal characteristics then a SiC epitaxial layer grown on a different substrate. Although the SiC on Si substrate devices described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,762,806 and 4,757,028 may have exhibited improved thermal characteristics, the use of a Si substrate generally limits the ability of such devices to dissipate heat. Furthermore, the growth of SiC on Si generally results in defects in the epitaxial layers that result in high leakage current when the device is in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Other MESFETs have been developed using SiC substrates. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/540,488 filed Jun. 19, 1990 and now abandoned, the disclosure of which is incorporated entirely herein by reference, describes a SiC MESFET having epitaxial layers of SiC grown on a SiC substrate. These devices exhibited improved thermal characteristics over previous devices because of the improved crystal quality of the epitaxial layers grown on SiC substrates. However, to obtain high power and high frequency it may be necessary to overcome the limitations of SiC's lower electron mobility.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Similarly, commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,554 to Palmour describes a SiC MESFET having source and drain contacts formed on n<sup>+</sup> regions of SiC and an optional lightly doped epitaxial layer between the substrate and the n-type layer in which the channel is formed. U.S. Pat. No. 5,925,895 to Sriram et al. also describes a SiC MESFET and a structure that is described as overcoming “surface effects” which may reduce the performance of the MESFET for high frequency operation. Sriram et al. also describes SiC MESFETs which use n<sup>+</sup> source and drain contact regions as well as a p-type buffer layer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, conventional SiC FET structures may provide the constant characteristics during the entire operating range of the FET, i.e. from fully open channel to near pinch-off voltage, by using a very thin, highly doped channel (a delta doped channel) offset from the gate by a lightly doped region of similar conductivity type. Delta doped channels are discussed in detail in an article by Yokogawa et al. entitled <i>Electronic Properties of Nitrogen Delta</i>-<i>Doped Silicon Carbide Layers</i>, MRS Fall Symposium, 2000 and an article by Konstantinov et al. entitled <i>Investigation of Lo</i>-<i>Hi</i>-<i>Lo and Delta Doped Silicon Carbide Structure</i>, MRS Fall Symposium, 2000. However, further improvements may be made in SiC MESFETs.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">For example, it may be important that SiC MESFETs have high breakdown voltages and relatively low leakage currents if they are used in high efficiency, high power, high linearity radio frequency (RF) applications. In an attempt to provide high breakdown voltages, devices have been provided having highly compensated substrates, such as Vanadium doped semi-insulating SiC. These devices typically provide adequate breakdown voltages as well as low leakage currents, but may sacrifice device performance due to unwanted trapping effects in the substrate. Furthermore, devices having highly doped p-type layers under the channel of the FET have been provided and have been successful in providing good electron confinement and low leakage currents. However, these devices generally contain excessive parasitics that may degrade the RF performance of the device. Accordingly, further improvements may be made with respect to existing SiC FET devices such that they may provide improved breakdown voltages without sacrificing other performance characteristics of the device.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the present invention provide a unit cell of a metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MESFET). The unit cell of the MESFET includes a MESFET having a source, a drain and a gate. The gate is disposed between the source and the drain and on an n-type conductivity channel layer. A p-type conductivity region is provided beneath the source and has an end that extends towards the drain. The p-type conductivity region is spaced apart from the n-type conductivity channel layer and is electrically coupled to the source.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments of the present invention, the gate may extend into the n-type conductivity channel layer. The gate may have a first sidewall and a second sidewall. The first sidewall of the gate may be associated with the source side of the gate and the second sidewall may be associated with the drain side of the gate. The p-type conductivity region may extend from beneath the source to the first sidewall of the gate without extending past the first sidewall of the gate, from beneath the source to the second sidewall of the gate without extending past the second sidewall of the gate or from beneath the source to between the first and second sidewalls of the gate. In some embodiments, the p-type conductivity region extends from beneath the source to within about 0.1 to about 0.3 μm of the first sidewall on the source side of the first sidewall. In certain embodiments, the p-type conductivity region extends from beneath a source contact and/or a source implant region without extending to beneath a drain contact. The p-type conductivity region may also extend from beneath a source contact and/or a source implant region without extending to beneath a drain implant region.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In further embodiments of the present invention, the MESFET is a silicon carbide (SiC) MESFET having a SiC substrate.

The n-type conductivity channel layer may include n-type conductivity SiC and the p-type conductivity region may include p-type conductivity SiC.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In still further embodiments of the present invention, the p-type conductivity region may have a carrier concentration of from about 1.0×10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>to about 1.0×10<sup>20 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>. The n-type conductivity channel layer may include a first n-type conductivity channel layer and a second n-type conductivity channel layer. The first n-type conductivity channel layer may have a carrier concentration of about 3×10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>and the second n-type conductivity channel layer may have a carrier concentration of about 1×10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>. The first n-type conductivity channel layer may have a thickness of about 0.28 μm and the second n-type conductivity channel layer may have a thickness of about 900 Å. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the n-type conductivity channel layer includes first, second and third n-type conductivity channel layers. The first, second and third n-type conductivity channel layers may have respective first, second and third carrier concentrations.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments of the present invention, the MESFET may further include a buffer layer on a SiC substrate.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present invention will now be described with reference to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 8B</figref>, which illustrate various embodiments of the present invention. As illustrated in the Figures, the sizes of layers or regions are exaggerated for illustrative purposes and, thus, are provided to illustrate the general structures of the present invention. Furthermore, various aspects of the present invention are described with reference to a layer being formed on a substrate or other layer. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, references to a layer being formed “on” another layer or substrate contemplates that additional layers may intervene. References to a layer being formed on another layer or substrate without an intervening layer are described herein as being formed “directly on” the layer or substrate. Furthermore, relative terms such as beneath may be used herein to describe one layer or regions relationship to another layer or region as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that these terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in the Figures is turned over, layers or regions described as “beneath” other layers or regions would now be oriented “above” these other layers or regions. The term “beneath” is intended to encompass both above and beneath in this situation. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It will be understood that although the terms first and second are used herein to describe various regions, layers and/or sections, these regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second region, layer or section, and similarly, a second region, layer or section may be termed a first region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 8B</figref> that illustrate various embodiments of the present invention and various processes of fabricating embodiments of the present invention. A transistor, for example, a metal-semiconductor field effect transistor (MESFET), is provided having p-type conductivity regions beneath the sources of the MESFET having ends that extend towards the drains of the MESFET. As described in detail below, the presence of this p-type conductivity region, for example, p-type conductivity silicon carbide (SiC), may provide, for example, devices having improved breakdown voltages without compromising other performance characteristics of the device. Improved breakdown voltages may be provided because the presence of the p-type conductivity region may inhibit electron injection from the source, which in turn may increase breakdown voltage. Transistors according to embodiments of the present invention may be useful in, for example, high efficiency linear power amplifiers, such as power amplifiers for base stations using complex modulation schemes such as code division multiple access (CDMA) and/or Wideband CDMA (WCDMA).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, transistors, for example, metal-semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs), according to embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a substrate <b>10</b> is provided. The substrate <b>10</b> may be a single crystal bulk silicon carbide (SiC) substrate of either p-type or n-type conductivity or semi-insulating. The substrate <b>10</b> of either p-type or n-type may be very lightly doped. The substrate may be formed of silicon carbide selected from the group of 6H, 4H, 15R or 3C silicon carbide. Although the present invention is described herein with reference to a SiC substrate, the present invention should not be limited to SiC. For example, in some embodiments, the substrate <b>10</b> may also include, for example, gallium arsenide (GaAs) and/or Gallium Nitride (GaN).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An optional buffer layer <b>12</b> of, for example, p-type silicon carbide may be provided on the substrate <b>10</b>. The buffer layer <b>12</b> may be formed of p-type conductivity silicon carbide of 6H, 4H, 15R or 3C polytype. The buffer layer <b>12</b> may, for example, have a carrier concentration of from about 0.5×10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>to about 3.0×10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>. Suitable dopants include aluminum, boron and/or gallium. The buffer layer <b>12</b> may have a thickness of about 2.0 μm. Although the buffer layer <b>12</b> is described above as p-type silicon carbide, the invention should not be limited to this configuration. Alternatively, the buffer layer <b>12</b> may be undoped silicon carbide (i.e. not intentionally doped) or very low-doped n-type conductivity silicon carbide. If a very low doped n-type silicon carbide is utilized for the buffer layer <b>12</b>, the carrier concentration of the buffer layer <b>12</b> is preferably less than about 5.0×10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a p<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b> is provided beneath a source of the device that has an end that extends towards the drain of the device. As used herein, “p<sup>+</sup>” or “n<sup>+</sup>” refer to regions that are defined by higher carrier concentrations than are present in adjacent or other regions of the same or another layer or substrate. In some embodiments of the present invention, the p<sup>+</sup> conductivity region <b>14</b> may extend from beneath a source contact <b>26</b> and/or from beneath an n<sup>+</sup> source implant region <b>13</b> without extending to beneath an n<sup>+</sup> drain implant region <b>17</b>. In further embodiments of the present invention, the p<sup>+</sup> conductivity region <b>14</b> may extend from beneath the source contact <b>26</b> and/or from beneath the n<sup>+</sup> source implant region <b>13</b> without extending to beneath a drain contact <b>22</b>. In still further embodiments, the p<sup>+</sup> conductivity region <b>14</b> may further extend from beneath the source contact <b>26</b> and/or from beneath the n<sup>+</sup> source implant region <b>13</b> to the first sidewall of the gate <b>31</b> without extending past the first sidewall of the gate <b>31</b>, from beneath the source contact <b>26</b> and/or from beneath the n<sup>+</sup> source implant region <b>13</b> to the second sidewall of the gate <b>33</b> without extending past the second sidewall of the gate <b>33</b> or from beneath the source contact <b>26</b> and/or from beneath the n<sup>+</sup> source implant region <b>13</b> to a point between the first sidewall <b>31</b> and the second sidewall <b>33</b> of the gate <b>24</b>. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the p<sup>+</sup> conductivity region <b>14</b> may extend to a point within about 0.1 to about 0.3 μm of the first sidewall <b>31</b> of the gate <b>24</b> on the source side.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The p<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b> is a region of p-type conductivity, for example, p-type conductivity silicon carbide. For the p<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b>, carrier concentrations of from about 1.0×10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>to about 1.0×10<sup>20 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>may be suitable, but carrier concentrations as high as possible are preferred. The carrier concentration may not be constant throughout the p<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b>, but it is preferable that the carrier concentration be as high as possible at the surface of the p<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b> to facilitate the formation of ohmic contacts thereon. In some embodiments of the present invention, the p<sup>+</sup> conductivity region <b>14</b> may be provided in the substrate <b>10</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The p<sup>+</sup> conductivity region <b>14</b> may, for example, extend about 0.4 μm into the buffer layer <b>12</b> or the substrate <b>10</b>. The presence of the p<sup>+</sup> conductivity region <b>14</b> beneath the source region may inhibit electron injection from the source, thus, possibly providing an improved breakdown voltage. Furthermore, the fact that the p<sup>+</sup> conductivity region <b>14</b> does not extend to beneath the drain region may hinder the introduction of parasitics into the device and, thus, device performance may not be influenced.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The buffer layer <b>12</b> may be disposed between the substrate <b>10</b> and a second buffer layer <b>16</b>. The second buffer layer <b>16</b> may be, for example, p-type silicon carbide having a carrier concentration of from about 1×10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>to about 5×10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>, but typically about 1.5×10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>. The p-type silicon carbide buffer layer <b>16</b> may also have a thickness of from about 0.5 μm to about 1.0 μm. Although the second buffer layer <b>16</b> is described above as being of p-type conductivity silicon carbide, it will be understood that the present invention is not limited to this configuration. Alternatively, for example, the second buffer layer <b>16</b> may be of n-type conductivity, for example, very lightly doped n-type conductivity SiC or undoped SiC as discussed above with respect to buffer layer <b>12</b>. In some embodiments of the present invention, the second buffer layer <b>16</b> may be provided directly on the substrate <b>10</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b> is provided on the second buffer layer <b>16</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b> may be formed of n-type conductivity silicon carbide of 6H, 4H, 15R or 3C polytype. The n-type conductivity channel layer may include one or more layers of, for example, n-type conductivity silicon carbide having different carrier concentrations. For example, the n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b> may include a first n-type conductivity channel layer <b>15</b> and a second n-type conductivity channel layer <b>19</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Alternatively, the n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b> may include first, second and third layers of n-type conductivity SiC as discussed in detail in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/136,456 to Sriram, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, n<sup>+</sup> regions <b>13</b> and <b>17</b> are provided in the source and drain regions of the device, respectively. Regions <b>13</b> and <b>17</b> are typically of n-type conductivity silicon carbide and have carrier concentrations that are greater than the carrier concentration of the n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b>. For the n<sup>+</sup> regions <b>13</b> and <b>17</b>, carrier concentrations of about 1×10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>may be suitable, but carrier concentrations as high as possible are preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Ohmic contacts <b>26</b> and <b>22</b> are provided on the implanted regions <b>13</b> and <b>17</b>, respectively, and are spaced apart so as to provide the source contact <b>26</b> and the drain contact <b>22</b>. Ohmic contact <b>25</b> is provided on the p<sup>+</sup> conductivity region <b>14</b> to provide a p<sup>+</sup> contact <b>25</b>. The ohmic contacts <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>22</b> are preferably formed of nickel or other suitable metals. The p<sup>+</sup> conductivity region <b>14</b> is maintained at the same potential as the source by, for example, electrically coupling the p<sup>+</sup> ohmic contact <b>25</b> to the source contact <b>26</b>. An insulator layer <b>20</b>, such as an oxide, may be further provided on the exposed surface of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Transistors according to certain embodiments of the present invention include a first recess <b>43</b> and a contact via hole <b>42</b>. The first recess <b>43</b> is provided between first and second n<sup>+</sup> regions <b>13</b> and <b>17</b>, i.e. between the source region and the drain region. The first recess <b>43</b> extends into the n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b> and exposes the n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b>. The contact via hole <b>42</b> is provided adjacent the source region <b>13</b> and exposes at least a portion of the p<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Transistors according to embodiments of the present invention may include a double recessed structure containing first and second recesses as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In particular, a first recess <b>53</b> has a floor <b>60</b> that extends through the first n-type conductivity channel layer <b>19</b> to the second n-type channel layer <b>15</b>. A second recess <b>54</b> is provided between the sidewalls <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> of the first recess. A first sidewall <b>61</b> of the first recess <b>53</b> is between the source <b>26</b> and the gate <b>24</b> and a second sidewall <b>62</b> of the first recess <b>53</b> is between the drain <b>22</b> and the gate <b>24</b>. The floor of the second recess <b>54</b> extends into the second n-type conductivity channel layer <b>15</b>, for example, a distance of about 600 Å. The double recessed structure is discussed further in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/136,456 to Sriram.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the gate contact <b>24</b> may be provided in the first recess <b>43</b> between the source region <b>13</b> and the drain region <b>17</b>. In embodiments of the present invention having a double recessed structure as discussed above, the gate <b>24</b> may be disposed in the second recess <b>54</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Furthermore, in certain embodiments of the present invention, the gate contact <b>24</b> may be disposed on the n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and may not be provided in, for example, the first recess <b>43</b> or the second recess <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The gate contact <b>24</b> may be formed of chromium, platinum, platinum silicide, nickel, and/or TiWN, however, other metals such as gold, known to one skilled in the art to achieve the Schottky effect, may be used. The Schottky gate contact <b>24</b> typically has a three layer structure. Such a structure may have advantages because of the high adhesion of chromium (Cr). For example, the gate contact <b>24</b> can optionally include a first gate layer of chromium (Cr) contacting the n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b>. The gate contact <b>24</b> may further include an overlayer of platinum (Pt) and gold <b>32</b> or other highly conductive metal. Alternatively, the gate contact <b>24</b> may include a first layer of nickel in the first recess <b>43</b> on the n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b>. The gate contact <b>24</b> may further include an overlayer on the first layer of nickel that includes a layer of gold.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, metal overlayers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> may be provided on the source and p<sup>+</sup> contacts <b>26</b> and <b>25</b>, the drain contact <b>22</b> and the gate contact <b>24</b>, respectively. The overlayers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> may be gold, silver, aluminum, platinum and/or copper. Other suitable highly conductive metals may also be used for the overlayer. Furthermore, the metal overlayer <b>28</b> may electrically couple the p<sup>+</sup> contact <b>25</b> of the p<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b> to the source contact <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In selecting the dimensions of the MESFET, the width of the gate is defined as the dimension of the gate perpendicular to the flow of current. As shown in the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the gate width runs into and out of the page. The length of the gate is the dimension of the gate parallel to the flow of current. As seen in the cross-sectional views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the gate length is the dimension of the gate <b>24</b> that is in contact with the n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b>. For example, the gate length of the MESFET according to certain embodiments of the present invention may be from about 0.4 μm to about 0.7 μm. Another important dimension is the source to gate distance, which is shown in the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as the distance from the source contact <b>26</b> or n<sup>+</sup> region <b>13</b>, to the gate contact <b>24</b>. The source to gate distance according to certain embodiments of the present invention may be from about 0.5 μm to about 0.7 μm. Furthermore, the distance from the drain <b>22</b> to the gate <b>24</b> may be from about 1.5 μm to about 2 μm. Embodiments of the present invention may further include a plurality of unit cells of MESFETs, and the distance from a first gate of the unit cells to a second gate may be, for example, from about 20 μm to about 50 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2H</figref> illustrate the fabrication of FETs according to embodiments of the present invention. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an optional buffer layer <b>12</b> may be grown or deposited on a substrate <b>10</b>. The substrate <b>10</b> may be a semi-insulating SiC substrate, a p-type substrate or an n-type substrate. The substrate <b>10</b> may be very lightly doped. The buffer layer <b>12</b> may be of p-type conductivity silicon carbide having a carrier concentration of about 3.0×10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>or less, but typically 1.0×10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>or less. Alternatively, the buffer layer <b>12</b> may be n-type silicon carbide or undoped silicon carbide.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">If the substrate <b>10</b> is semi-insulating it may be fabricated as described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,218,680 to Carter et al. entitled “Semi-insulating Silicon Carbide Without Vanadium Domination”, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein as if set forth in its entirety. Such a semi-insulating substrate may be produced by providing silicon carbide substrates with sufficiently high levels of point defects and sufficiently matched levels of p-type and n-type dopants such that the resistivity of the silicon carbide substrate is dominated by the point defects. Such a domination may be accomplished by fabricating the silicon carbide substrate at elevated temperatures with source powders that have concentrations of heavy metals, transition elements or other deep level trapping elements of less than about 1×10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>and preferably less than about 1.0×10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>. For example, temperatures between about 2360° C. and 2380° C. with the seed being about 300° C. to about 500° C. lower may be utilized. Thus, it is preferred that the semi-insulating substrate be substantially free of heavy metal, transition element dopants or other deep level trapping elements, such as vanadium, such that the resistivity of the substrate is not dominated by such heavy metals or transition elements. While it is preferred that the semi-insulating substrate be free of such heavy metal, transition element dopants or deep level trapping elements, such elements may be present in measurable amounts while still benefiting from the teachings of the present invention if the presence of such materials does not substantially affect the electrical properties of the MESFETs described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a mask <b>45</b> may be formed for implanting the p<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b>. The p<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b> is typically formed by ion implantation of, for example, aluminum, boron and/or gallium, followed by a high temperature anneal. Suitable anneal temperatures may be from about 1300 to about 1600° C., typically about 1500° C. The ion implantation may be performed on the regions that are not covered by the mask <b>45</b> to form p<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Thus, the ions are implanted in portions of the buffer layer <b>12</b>, if present, or the substrate <b>10</b>, to provide a highly doped region of p-type conductivity, for example, p-type conductivity silicon carbide. Once implanted, the dopants are annealed to activate the implant. The highly doped region of p-type conductivity may extend about 0.4 μm into the buffer layer <b>12</b> or the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a mask <b>50</b> may be formed for implanting n<sup>+</sup> regions <b>13</b> and <b>17</b>. Regions <b>13</b> and <b>17</b> are typically formed by ion implantation of, for example, nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P), followed by a high temperature anneal. Suitable anneal temperatures may be from about 1100 to about 1600° C.

Thus, the ions are implanted in portions of the n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b> to provide highly doped regions of n-type conductivity, for example, n-type conductivity SiC, having higher carrier concentrations than the n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b>. Once implanted, the dopants are annealed to activate the implant.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the substrate <b>10</b>, the buffer layer <b>12</b>, the p<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b>, the second buffer layer <b>16</b> and the n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b> may be etched to form an isolation mesa.

The sidewalls of the mesa extend downward past the p<sup>+</sup> conductivity region <b>14</b>. The mesa may be formed to extend into the substrate <b>10</b> of the device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. The mesa may extend past the depletion region of the device to confine current flow in the device to the mesa and reduce the capacitance of the device. The mesa is preferably formed by reactive ion etching the above described device, however, other methods known to one skilled in the art may be used to form the mesa. Furthermore, if a mesa is not utilized the device may be isolated using other methods such as proton bombardment, counterdoping with compensating atoms or other methods known to those skilled in the art.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> further illustrates the formation of a first recess <b>43</b> of the MESFET. The first recess <b>43</b> may be formed by forming a mask <b>47</b> and then etching through the n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b> to form the first recess <b>43</b> according to the mask <b>47</b>. The first recess <b>43</b> may be formed by an etching process, such as a dry or wet etch process. For example, the first recess <b>43</b> may be formed by dry etching, for example, Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) or Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) etching. The mask <b>47</b> may be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As discussed above, embodiments of the present invention may include a double recessed structure instead of the single recess <b>43</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a first recess <b>53</b> of the double recessed structure may be formed by forming a mask for the first recess <b>53</b> and etching through the first n-type conductivity channel layer <b>19</b> to form the first recess <b>53</b> according to the mask.

The second n-type conductivity channel layer <b>15</b> may be etched into a distance of, for example, about 600 Å to form the second recess <b>54</b>. Methods of fabricating the double recessed structure are discussed further in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/136,456 to Sriram.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> illustrates the formation of an insulator layer <b>20</b>, for example, an oxide layer, after the first recess <b>43</b> has been formed as discussed above.

The oxidation process may remove, for example, SiC that may have been damaged by the etch process and may also smooth out roughness that may have been created on the surface by the etch.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, contact windows may be etched through the insulator layer <b>20</b> to the n<sup>+</sup> regions <b>13</b> and <b>17</b>. A third contact window <b>41</b> may be etched in the insulator layer <b>20</b> above the highly doped p<sup>+</sup> region <b>14</b>. Nickel may then be evaporated to deposit the source and drain contacts <b>26</b> and <b>22</b>, respectively. The nickel may be annealed to form the ohmic contacts <b>26</b> and <b>22</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>. Such a deposition and annealing process may be carried out utilizing conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, the ohmic contacts <b>26</b> and <b>22</b> may be annealed at a temperature of from about 950° C. to about 1100° C. for about 2 minutes. However, other times and temperatures may also be utilized. Times from about 30 seconds to about 10 minutes may be, for example, acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, a contact via hole <b>42</b> of the MESFET may be formed. The contact via hole <b>42</b> may be etched in the portion of the MESFET defined by window <b>41</b> in the insulator layer <b>20</b>. The n-type conductivity channel layer <b>18</b> and the second buffer layer <b>16</b> may be etched through to expose the p<sup>+</sup> conductivity region <b>14</b> to form the contact via hole <b>42</b>. The etching process may be, for example, a dry or wet etch process. As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, nickel may be evaporated to deposit the p<sup>+</sup> contact <b>25</b>. The nickel may be annealed to form the ohmic contact <b>25</b>. Such a deposition and annealing process may be carried out utilizing conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, the ohmic contact <b>25</b> may be annealed at a temperature of from about 600° C. to about 1050° C.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref> illustrates the formation of the gate contact <b>24</b> and the overlayers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>. For example, a window may be opened in the insulator <b>20</b> and a layer of chromium may be deposited in the first recess <b>43</b>. Typically, the chromium layer is formed by evaporative deposition. The gate structure may then be completed by deposition of platinum and gold. As will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the overlayers <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> may be formed either before or after formation of the gate structure. In fact, if the titanium/platinum/gold structure is utilized, the platinum and gold portions of the overlayer may be formed in the same processing steps as the platinum and gold portions <b>32</b> of the gate structure. Accordingly, the overlayers <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> may be formed prior to the formation of a gate contact or after the formation of a gate contact. As further illustrated, the source contact <b>26</b> and the p<sup>+</sup> contact share a single overlayer <b>28</b>, which electrically couples the source to the highly doped p-type conductivity region <b>14</b>. Alternatively, as discussed above the first recess <b>43</b> may be a double recess structure and the gate may be disposed within the double recessed structure.</p>
