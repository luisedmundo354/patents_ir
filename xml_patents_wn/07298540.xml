<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to optical channel routers that can independently route each of a plurality of wavelength division multiplexed optical channels to one of two separate outputs. More particularly, the present invention relates to such optical channel routers wherein, additionally, the relative intensities of the channels are equalized.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a wavelength division multiplexing optical communication system, information is carried by multiple channels each with a distinct wavelength. It is often necessary to add or drop a wavelength channel in optical links or networks. This can be achieved by a wavelength router that sends different wavelength channels to different locations. In addition to wavelength routing, the different wavelength channels typically have unequal intensities as they travel through the system. These unequal intensities can compromise the integrity of the information carried by the channels.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there exists a need for an improved channel equalizer and router for an optical network. The improved channel equalizer and router should be able to dynamically adjust optical intensity of each wavelength channel by a different amount while also performing the function of wavelength routing. The present invention addresses such a need.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A dynamic equalizing optical channel router includes an input port for receiving a wavelength division multiplexed composite optical signal comprising a plurality of channels; at least one output port; a diffraction grating optically coupled to the input and output ports; a lens optically coupled to the diffraction grating at a side opposite to the input and output ports; an array of steering devices optically coupled to the lens at a side opposite to the diffraction grating, wherein each channel is reflected by a different steering device of the array; and a plurality of attenuators, wherein each channel reflected by the array traverses one of the attenuators and the diffraction grating to the at least one output port. The router is able to dynamically adjust optical intensity of each wavelength channel by a different amount while also performing the function of wavelength routing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one preferred embodiment, the dynamic equalizing wavelength router comprises an input, at least two outputs, a diffraction grating optically coupled to the input and the at least two outputs, a lens optically coupled to the diffraction grating, an array of micro mirrors optically coupled to the lens opposite to the diffraction grating and at least two output apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect of the present invention, the diffraction grating receives an input wavelength division multiplexed composite optical signal comprising a plurality of channels of different respective wavelengths and separates each channel to a different respective path. The lens focuses each one of the separated channels onto a different respective element of the array of micro-mirrors. Each individual element of the array of micro-mirrors reflects a channel back through the lens, through one of the at least two output apertures and to the diffraction grating along one of at least two alternative reflection pathways. The reflection pathway of each channel determines the output port to which the channel is directed as well as the degree of attenuation at the aperture through which it passes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another preferred embodiment, the dynamic equalizing wavelength router comprises an input, at least two outputs, a diffraction grating optically coupled to the input and the at least two outputs, a lens optically coupled to the diffraction grating, an array of polarization steering devices optically coupled to the lens opposite to the diffraction grating and at least one polarizer, wherein each polarization steering device within the array of polarization steering devices comprises a segmented polarization modulator, a birefringent beam displacer and a reflector comprising two reflective surfaces at an angle to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect of the present invention, the diffraction grating receives an input wavelength division multiplexed composite optical signal comprising a plurality of channels of different respective wavelengths and separates each channel to a different respective path. The lens focuses each one of the separated channels onto a different respective element of the array of polarization steering devices such that the channel passes through a first polarization-controlling segment of the segmented polarization modulator comprising the element. Subsequently, the birefringent beam displacer deflects each channel to one or another of the two reflective surfaces according to the polarization provided by the polarization-controlling segment. The reflected channels pass through second polarization controlling segments of the segmented polarization modulator comprising the element such that a controlled, variable intensity of each channel is transmitted through the at least one polarizer and to one of the at least two outputs according to the polarization of the light comprising the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the dynamic equalizing wavelength router comprises an input, at least two outputs, a diffraction grating optically coupled to the input and the at least two outputs, a first lens optically coupled to the diffraction grating, a first polarization modulator array comprising a first segment and a second polarization modulator array comprising a second segment optically coupled to the lens opposite to the diffraction grating, a Wollaston prism optically coupled to the first and second polarization modulator arrays opposite to the first lens, a second lens optically coupled to the Wollaston prism opposite to the polarization modulator arrays, at least two optical wedges optically coupled to the second lens opposite to the Wollaston prism, an angled reflector optically coupled to the second lens and the at least two optical wedges and at least one polarizer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect of the present invention, the diffraction grating receives an input wavelength division multiplexed composite optical signal comprising a plurality of channels of different respective wavelengths and separates each channel to a different respective path. The lens focuses each one of the separated channels onto a respective polarization-controlling element of the first polarization modulator array. Subsequently, the Wollaston prism deflects, according to the polarization provided by the polarization-controlling element, each channel to one or another of the two reflective surfaces comprising the angled reflector. The reflected channels pass back through the Wollaston prism and through respective polarization-controlling elements of the second polarization modulator array. The second polarization-controlling elements modulate the polarization of each channel such that a controlled, variable intensity of each channel is transmitted through the at least one polarizer and to one of the at least two outputs according to the polarization of the light comprising the channel.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention provides dynamic equalizing wavelength router. The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements. Various modifications to the preferred embodiment will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and the generic principles herein may be applied to other embodiments. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiment shown but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">To more particularly describe the features of the present invention, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref> in conjunction with the discussion below.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A functional diagram of dynamic equalizing wavelength routers is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A hypothetical spectrum of the incoming aggregated optical signal is shown in box <b>40</b>. This incoming signal is input to the dynamic equalizing wavelength router <b>50</b> from input port <b>52</b> and contains multiple wavelength channels, for instance, channels <b>1</b>-<b>7</b>, with different optical strengths. The dynamic equalizing wavelength router <b>50</b> directs any incoming wavelength channels to either of the two outgoing fiber ports <b>54</b><i>a</i>-<b>54</b><i>b. </i>At the same time, the strength of each of the channels <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> can be adjusted to achieve channel equalization as illustrated in boxes <b>42</b><i>a</i>-<b>42</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Three mutually orthogonal views of a first preferred embodiment of a dynamic equalizing wavelength router in accordance with the present invention are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The dynamic equalizing wavelength router <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is based on a micro-mirror array <b>132</b> modulator. In the router <b>200</b>, a micro-mirror array <b>132</b> is disposed such that a different respective micro-mirror comprising the array <b>132</b> is disposed at each of the focal points <b>114</b><i>a, </i><b>114</b><i>b, </i>etc. The “Side View” of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is assumed to represent a projection of the apparatus <b>200</b> onto the y-z plane and shows three channels λ<sub>i</sub>, λ<sub>j </sub>and λ<sub>k </sub>dispersed by grating <b>130</b> and respectively focused to different points <b>114</b><i>a, </i><b>114</b><i>b </i>and <b>114</b><i>c </i>by focal lens <b>131</b>. Each micro mirror of the array <b>132</b> is disposed at a respective one of the focal points <b>114</b><i>a, </i><b>114</b><i>b </i>and <b>114</b><i>c </i>as shown in the Side View of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Within the dynamic equalizing router <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>), a collimated input beam <b>120</b> is first spatially separated into wavelength channels by a diffraction grating <b>130</b>. For example, the separated paths <b>107</b>, <b>109</b> and <b>113</b> of the three channels λ<sub>i</sub>, λ<sub>j </sub>and λ<sub>k</sub>, respectively, are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Different wavelength channels are then focused onto different mirror “pixels” of the micro-mirror array modulator <b>132</b> by the focal lens <b>131</b>. Each “mirror pixel”, which is a separate independently controlled member of the micro-mirror array <b>132</b>, can assume at least two positions, reflecting each wavelength into either a first direction <b>142</b> or a second direction <b>141</b> as illustrated in the x-y view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Each mirror comprising the array <b>132</b> may be tilted independently of every other micro-mirror. The Top View shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a projection onto the x-y plane and shows the operation of only one mirror comprising the micro-mirror array <b>132</b>, i.e., the particular mirror <b>132</b><i>a </i>disposed at the focal point <b>114</b><i>a </i>and receiving the channel λ<sub>i</sub>. The mirror disposed at the point <b>114</b><i>a </i>receives the λ<sub>i </sub>channel focused by lens <b>131</b> and can tilt into any of a plurality of positions so as to redirect the reflected beam along a plurality of return paths back through the apparatus <b>200</b>. The reflected channels or wavelengths propagating along each of the paths <b>141</b>-<b>142</b> are then recombined by the same diffraction grating <b>130</b> into output beams <b>121</b> and <b>122</b>. By controlling the micro-mirror array <b>132</b>, one can direct each wavelength into either one of the two output ports.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, to control the intensity of each wavelength channel, limiting apertures <b>151</b> and <b>152</b> are placed within the output beams <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> or the output beams <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>. In practice, the lens apertures of output fiber collimators (not shown) can serve the purpose of these limiting apertures. The individual mirror pixels are controlled so that a portion of the beam is outside the limiting apertures. This way, by controlling the position of the mirror pixels attenuation of each wavelength channel can be achieved. Each mirror pixel can be configured to assume a continuous range of positions to accomplish continuous tuning of optical intensity of a wavelength channel.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The following illustrated embodiments of the present invention utilize polarization steering devices to replace the micro-mirror array modulator <b>132</b> to realize solid-state non-moving part wavelength routers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> provides an illustration of a second embodiment of a dynamic equalizing wavelength router in accordance with the present invention. Within the dynamic equalizing router <b>250</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>), an array <b>133</b> of polarization steering devices is utilized instead of an array of micro-mirrors. One representative element <b>133</b><i>a </i>of the polarization steering device array <b>133</b> is shown in the “Top View” of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The dynamic equalizing router <b>250</b> further comprises polarizers <b>153</b> and <b>154</b>, instead of apertures, disposed in the paths of the two output beams <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An enlarged and more-detailed diagram of the representative polarization steering device element <b>133</b><i>a </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a cross section of the element <b>133</b><i>a </i>within the x-y plane. The polarization steering device element <b>133</b><i>a </i>includes a polarization modulator <b>213</b>, a birefringent polarization beam displacer <b>214</b> and an angled reflector <b>215</b>. The polarization modulator <b>213</b> can be a magneto-optical device, a liquid crystal device, or other polarization modulator that can rotate polarization of incident beams. The polarization modulator <b>213</b> further includes three segments, <b>225</b>, <b>226</b>, and <b>227</b>. Each segment can be controlled independently. The birefringent polarization beam displacer <b>214</b> is a planar parallel uni-axial crystal plate with its optic axis inclined in the x-y plane. The angled reflector <b>215</b> consists of two reflective surfaces <b>216</b> and <b>217</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">After passing through segment <b>226</b> of the polarization modulator <b>213</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), the incident beam <b>210</b> becomes polarized parallel to either the x or z axis depending on a control signal sent to the center segment <b>226</b>. If the beam after the modulator <b>213</b> is polarized in the z-axis, it is not displaced by the beam displacer <b>214</b>. In this case the beam will be reflected by surface <b>216</b> forming returned beam <b>212</b>. On the other hand, if after passing through the polarization modulator, the beam becomes polarized in the x-direction, the beam will be displaced by beam displacer <b>214</b> with a vector component of the displacement along the x-direction. Because of the displacement, the beam will be reflected by surface <b>217</b>, which makes an angle from surface <b>216</b>. The returned beam <b>211</b> thus will propagate in a direction significantly different from beam <b>212</b>. The required displacement of beam displacer <b>214</b> is on the order of the beam size at the reflecting surfaces. In case the incident beam <b>210</b> is focused on the reflecting surfaces <b>216</b>-<b>217</b>, the required displacement can be fairly small. Because displacement is linearly proportional to the thickness of the beam displacer, this means a very thin beam displacer will be sufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Segments <b>225</b> and <b>227</b> are used to control the polarization state of the returned beam <b>211</b> and <b>212</b>, respectively. After passing through segments <b>225</b> and <b>227</b>, the returned beams can be polarized in either the x or z direction, or in any state in between, depending upon control signals applied to the segments. After passing through polarizers <b>153</b>-<b>154</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>), these different polarization states will result in different intensities. Using this mechanism, the intensities of the output beams <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> can be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order to direct different wavelength channels into different output ports, the polarization modulator <b>213</b> is pixelized in the z direction. In other words, the array <b>133</b> comprises a plurality of devices similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, wherein the separate devices are disposed along a line or curve in extending into or out of the plane of the drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The single beam displacer <b>214</b> and angled reflector <b>215</b> can suffice for all such elements of the array <b>133</b>. However, a different polarization modulator <b>213</b> is generally required for each respective element of the array <b>133</b>. The polarization steering device <b>133</b> can replace the micro-mirror array <b>132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The input beam <b>120</b> will be focused onto the two mirror surfaces <b>216</b> and <b>217</b>. Because the polarization steering device can be fairly thin, defocus effect at the polarization modulator may be negligible.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Essentially, wavelength routing is achieved through polarization steering by segment <b>226</b>, and wavelength-selective attenuation is accomplished through polarization modulation by segments <b>225</b> and <b>227</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Although the input beam <b>120</b> is assumed to be linearly polarized in the second embodiment as well as the following embodiments, the invention can easily handle arbitrarily polarized and unpolarized input beams. As shown in the inset <b>260</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, an arbitrarily polarized or unpolarized beam <b>254</b> can be separated into two parallel beams <b>255</b><i>a</i>-<b>255</b><i>b </i>with a birefringent beam displacer <b>251</b>. After the beam displacer <b>251</b>, a half-wave plate <b>252</b> is inserted into one of the beams to rotate the polarization by 90 degrees. The output beams are thus both linearly polarized. Using this device in the input and output beams (that is, to the left of grating <b>130</b> in the y-z view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>), the embodiments using polarization steering devices become polarization independent.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an illustration of a third preferred embodiment of a dynamic equalizing wavelength router in accordance with the present invention. The dynamic equalizing wavelength router <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> utilizes another type of polarization steering device. The polarization steering device uses a Wollaston prism <b>346</b> (or a birefringent wedge) to split the two polarizations onto two reflective surfaces of the angled mirror <b>368</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a Wollaston prism <b>346</b> is utilized comprising the two birefringent wedges <b>346</b><i>a</i>-<b>346</b><i>b. </i>The router <b>400</b> further comprises a segmented polarization modulator <b>350</b> optically coupled between the lens <b>131</b> and the Wollaston prism <b>346</b>, a second lens <b>348</b> optically coupled to the Wollaston prism <b>346</b> and two optical wedges <b>366</b> and <b>367</b> optically coupled between the second lens <b>348</b> and the angled mirror <b>368</b> in the paths of the reflected beams <b>141</b>-<b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The segmented polarization modulator <b>350</b> comprises a lower segment <b>60</b> comprising a first polarization modulator array and an upper segment <b>61</b> comprising a second polarization modulator array. Each polarization modulator array comprises a plurality of elements or “pixels”. The individual pixels of each segment, which are indicated by dashed lines in the inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, are individually controllable.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The diffracted channels <b>332</b> are focused on segment <b>60</b> of the segmented polarization modulator <b>350</b>, with one wavelength or channel on each pixel. Each pixel of segment <b>60</b> modulates the polarization of the wavelength passing through it by a controlled variable amount. The Wollaston prism <b>346</b> then deflects all the wavelengths according to their respective polarizations. For instance, after passing through segment <b>60</b> of the polarization modulator <b>350</b>, the polarization of light of the incoming wavelength <b>107</b> may be oriented along the x-axis or along the z-axis. The Wollaston prism then deflects this light along the pathway <b>141</b> (indicated by dotted lines) or along the pathway <b>142</b> (indicated by dashed lines) according to its polarization. These pathways reflect from different respective portions of the angled mirror <b>368</b> so as to pass back through one of the two optical wedges <b>366</b>, <b>367</b>, the second lens <b>348</b>, the Wollaston prism <b>346</b>, the segmented polarization modulator <b>350</b> and the lens <b>131</b> to the grating <b>130</b>. The two pathways <b>141</b>-<b>142</b> lead to different outputs as described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">To achieve attenuation of each wavelength, the two optical wedges <b>366</b>, <b>367</b> are inserted into the return beams as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The wedges <b>366</b>, <b>367</b> are designed so that the return beams <b>141</b>-<b>142</b> are focused on segment <b>61</b> of the polarization modulator <b>350</b>. Pixels of segment <b>61</b> are then controlled to modulate the polarization states of each wavelength. Again, when the output beams subsequently pass through a polarizer or polarizers (not drawn in the figure) disposed in the output beams, each wavelength channel will have a different amount of attenuation depending on its polarization state.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It may be noted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that the additional refraction caused by the optical wedges <b>366</b>-<b>367</b> may cause variation in the focal points of the return beams <b>141</b>-<b>142</b>. In practice, in order to keep incoming and return beams focused at the same plane of the polarization modulator <b>350</b>, a planar parallel plate (not shown) with the same thickness as wedges <b>366</b>, <b>367</b> should be placed in the incoming beam between the two wedges. It is also noted that instead of placing wedges in the return beams <b>141</b>-<b>142</b>, one could alternatively place a single wedge in the center beam to achieve the same beam separation effect at the modulator plane.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an illustration of a fourth preferred embodiment of a dynamic equalizing wavelength router in accordance with the present invention. The fourth embodiment <b>500</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is similar to the third embodiment <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) except that the wedges are oriented with their changing thickness along the z direction (that is, into or out of the plane of the drawing). Further, the pixels of the polarization modulator <b>351</b> are configured differently than those within the polarization modulator <b>350</b>. The incoming beam and return beams are thus separated in the z direction. The incoming beams or channels are focused on pixel set <b>64</b>, whereas return beams or channels are focused on pixel set <b>65</b> of the segmented polarization modulator <b>351</b>. Similar to other embodiments, pixel set <b>64</b> controls the direction of output beams and pixel set <b>65</b> controls attenuation of each wavelength channel.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A dynamic equalizing optical channel router has been disclosed. The router in accordance with the present invention comprises an input port for receiving a wavelength division multiplexed composite optical signal comprising a plurality of channels; at least one output port; a diffraction grating optically coupled to the input and output ports; a lens optically coupled to the diffraction grating at a side opposite to the input and output ports; an array of steering devices optically coupled to the lens at a side opposite to the diffraction grating, wherein each channel is reflected by a different steering device of the array; and a plurality of attenuators, wherein each channel reflected by the array traverses one of the attenuators and the diffraction grating to the at least one output port. The router in accordance with the present invention is able to dynamically adjust optical intensity of each wavelength channel by a different amount while also performing the function of wavelength routing.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although the present invention has been described in accordance with the embodiments shown, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that there could be variations to the embodiments and those variations would be within the spirit and scope of the present invention.
