<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the production of vinyl siding panels having the appearance of rough-sawn cedar shake shingles, for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,593,479 and 5,455,099, it is known to injection mold the panel or vacuum-form a precut sheet and then trim and punch and form the edge portions of the sheet, to form a hook-shaped lower portion along the panel and an upper portion which defines a groove and forms a nailing flange. It is also known to extrude or form a flat sheet of plastics material and then direct the sheet onto the upper run of an endless flexible belt conveyor for vacuum-forming the sheet, for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,982,868 and 5,314,325. The endless flexible belt is constructed of a porous material and defines cavities into which the hot plastic sheet is sucked by a vacuum source under the upper run of the endless belt. The door sheet is then cooled and cut at longitudinally spaced intervals to produce vacuum-formed garage door panels or other articles. It has been found that the endless flexible conveyor belts for producing vacuum-formed articles are expensive to construct, have a relatively short service life and do not conduct heat rapidly away from the vacuum-form sheet.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The subject invention provides a method and an apparatus for continuously producing elongated siding panels. The apparatus comprises a conveyor, a plurality of mold plates, and a die for extruding a sheet of material onto the mold plates. The mold plates are formed of a rigid material and positioned adjacent one another and supported by the conveyor for forming the elongated siding panels. Each of the mold plates has an upper edge portion and a lower edge portion with an intermediate portion therebetween. A plurality of vacuum passages are disposed within each of the intermediate portion, the upper edge portion, and the lower edge portion for vacuum-forming the sheet onto the mold plates. The intermediate portion has an aesthetic pattern for imparting the pattern to the sheet of material with the adjacent mold plates having different aesthetic patterns. The lower edge portion has a lower leg extending substantially perpendicular from the intermediate portion defining a horizontal plane and a projection portion between the lower edge portion and the intermediate portion extends beyond the horizontal plane for imparting a jagged pattern to the intermediate portion.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One advantage of the subject invention is that the siding panel has a realistic appearance that is enhanced by the projection portion extending at different amounts beyond the horizontal plane. The projection portion gives the siding panel a jagged appearance which is more similar to actual shake siding. Another advantage of the projection portion is that when the siding panels are fastened to a structure, moisture is not able to get behind the siding panels because the moisture is not able to follow the projection portion. Whereas the moisture does travel along the generally flat bottom of the prior art siding panels and damages the structure. Therefore, it is advantageous that the subject invention does not allow the moisture to travel along the projection portion and behind the siding panels.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates portions of two elongated siding panels <b>10</b> connected together as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and each siding panel has a length of about five feet. Each siding panel is formed from a sheet of rigid plastics material such as polyvinylchloride or “vinyl” and includes a series of ten generally rectangular shingle panels <b>12</b> each having a different and distinct wood grain appearance. The shingle panels <b>12</b> are integrally connected by flat recessed strip portions <b>14</b> defining grooves, and each panel <b>10</b> has a longitudinally extending hook-shaped lower portion <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Each panel <b>10</b> also has a longitudinally extending upper flange portion <b>18</b> which extends from a step or shoulder portion <b>19</b> and is integrally connected to a folded-over flange portion <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The folded-over flange portion <b>22</b> cooperates with the flange portion <b>18</b> to form a double wall nailing flange <b>24</b> and a slot or groove <b>26</b> for receiving and retaining the hook-shaped lower edge portion <b>16</b> of the above overlapping panel <b>10</b>. The folded-over flange portion <b>22</b> has a bottom lip <b>28</b> which is spaced above the shoulder portion <b>19</b> to facilitate inserting the hook-shaped lower edge portion <b>16</b> into the groove <b>26</b>. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the upper nailing flange <b>24</b> of each panel <b>10</b> has a series of longitudinally spaced slots <b>31</b> for receiving longitudinally spaced nails which attach the panel <b>10</b> to a vertical wall surface <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the siding panels <b>10</b> are continuously produced from a flat sheet S of plastics material or polyvinylchloride which has a substantially uniform thickness and which is produced by a flat sheet die on a plastics extruder (not shown), as well known in the art. The hot vinyl sheet S from the extruder is directed onto the top or upper run of an endless vacuum-forming machine or conveyor <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The conveyor includes a pair of endless flexible length chains <b>52</b> which carry a continuous series of separate aluminum carrier plates or slats <b>54</b>, with one carrier slat corresponding to one of the shingle panels <b>12</b>. The opposite end portions of each carrier slat <b>54</b> are guided along the upper run of the endless conveyor by a pair of opposing guide tracks or rails <b>56</b> each constructed of a set of strips of solid low friction plastics materials.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each of the rectangular carrier slats <b>54</b> has a center hole <b>58</b>, and the slats are supported for horizontal sliding movement along a set of stationary elongated support plates <b>62</b> each constructed of a low friction solid plastics material. As the continuous series of carrier slats <b>54</b> move along the top surface of the support plates <b>62</b>, the holes <b>58</b> align with longitudinally extending slots <b>66</b> within the support plates <b>62</b>. The slots <b>66</b> connect with corresponding slots <b>67</b> within the top wall of a longitudinally extending suction or vacuum manifold <b>70</b> connected by longitudinally spaced tube <b>72</b> to a vacuum source or pump.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each of the carrier slats <b>54</b> has a width equal to the width of the corresponding shingle panel <b>12</b> plus one of the separator strip portions <b>14</b>. A shingle mold plate <b>75</b> has the same width as its corresponding carrier slat <b>54</b> and is secured to its carrier slat <b>54</b> by a set of screws (not shown) extending through the slat <b>54</b> and threaded into the mold plate <b>75</b>. Each mold plate <b>75</b> includes a rectangular intermediate section <b>78</b> defining a recessed cavity <b>81</b> having a wood grain surface texture corresponding to the desired wood grain appearance on the corresponding shingle <b>12</b>. The intermediate section <b>78</b> of each mold plate <b>75</b> has a bottom vacuum cavity <b>83</b> which connects the center vacuum hole or passage <b>58</b> to narrow vacuum slots <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> at opposite ends of the mold section <b>78</b> and to a top mold section <b>88</b> and a bottom mold section <b>92</b>. The top mold section <b>88</b> has a stepped top surface <b>94</b> and three rows of small holes or passages <b>96</b> which extend from steps in the top surface to a vacuum cavity or passage <b>99</b> formed in the bottom of the mold section <b>88</b> and connected to the vacuum passage <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The bottom section <b>92</b> of each mold plate <b>75</b> has a set of longitudinally spaced holes <b>102</b> which connect a vacuum passage <b>104</b> extending from the vacuum passage <b>83</b> to a vacuum passage <b>106</b> under a cap plate <b>108</b>. Thus, the suction or partial vacuum within the manifold <b>70</b> creates a vacuum within the passages <b>83</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>99</b>, <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> and the holes <b>96</b> and <b>102</b> within each mold plate <b>75</b> as the mold plate and its supporting carrier slat <b>54</b> move along the stationary support plates <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as the hot extruded sheet S progressively contacts the succession of mold plates <b>75</b> which move along the upper run of the endless conveyor <b>50</b> at a speed corresponding to the extrusion rate for the sheet S, the longitudinal center portion of the sheet is progressively sucked into the cavities <b>81</b> to form the shingle panels <b>12</b>, and the lower and upper portions of the sheet S are progressively sucked into the undercut cavities defined by the bottom mold sections <b>92</b> and cap members <b>108</b> and onto the stepped surfaces <b>94</b> of the top sections <b>88</b> of the mold plates <b>75</b> to provide the sheet with a cross-sectional configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">After the sheet S is vacuum-formed within the mold plates <b>75</b> and is cooled as the sheet moves along the top run of the conveyor with the aid of air blowers and/or water streams directed against the moving carrier slats <b>54</b>, the opposite edge portions <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> of the sheet are trimmed from the vacuum-formed sheet by cutting or slitting the sheet at the corners <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The separated portions or trim of the edge portions <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> are directed into a suitable scrap chopper (not shown) for reducing the trim into fine particles which are conveyed back to the material supply hopper for the extruder.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After the trimming operation, the vacuum-formed sheet is reheated along a line or the step <b>124</b>, and the outer stepped flange portion <b>118</b> of the sheet is progressively folded back onto the flange portion <b>18</b> to form the cross-sectional configuration for the upper edge portion of the panel, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The double wall nailing flange <b>24</b> is then progressively punched with the longitudinally spaced slots <b>31</b>. As the vacuum-formed strip or sheet continues to move horizontally after the slots <b>31</b> are punched, the sheet is cut laterally at longitudinally spaced intervals, for example, intervals of 5 feet, for successively producing the siding panels <b>10</b> which are ready for installation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, siding panels <b>130</b> are continuously produced by vacuum-forming endless conveyor apparatus in accordance with the invention, and each siding panel <b>130</b> includes a series of integrally connected shingle panels <b>132</b> separated by grooves formed by strip portions <b>134</b>. Each shingle panel <b>132</b> has a wood grain pattern and a hook-shaped bottom portion <b>136</b> connecting tapering hook-shaped inclined portions <b>138</b> to provide each shingle panel <b>132</b> with generally a partial octagonal configuration. Each siding panel <b>130</b> also includes an upper portion having a series of longitudinally spaced and outwardly projecting tabs or projections <b>142</b> which are vertically aligned with the strip portions <b>134</b> and define corresponding undercut grooves <b>143</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) for receiving the hook-shaped bottom portions <b>136</b> of the shingle panels <b>132</b> of an overlapping siding panel <b>130</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the hook-shaped bottom portion <b>136</b> of each shingle panel <b>132</b> has a straight upper edge <b>144</b> and each projecting tab <b>142</b> has a straight horizontal edge <b>147</b> at the upper end of the corresponding groove <b>143</b>. This provides for a positive and accurate connection of vertically adjacent overlapping siding panels <b>130</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The upper portion of each siding panel <b>130</b> also has a longitudinally extending continuous nailing flange <b>152</b> having longitudinally spaced slots <b>153</b> for receiving fasteners, such as the nails <b>156</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), for attaching each siding panel <b>130</b> to a vertical wall <b>158</b>. At opposite ends of each panel <b>130</b>, the projections <b>142</b> are half size, and a flange <b>159</b> projects from one end of each panel <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a series of the siding panels <b>130</b> are continuously produced by a vacuum-forming endless conveyor machine or apparatus <b>160</b> which is generally constructed as described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for continuously producing the siding panels <b>10</b>. The machine <b>160</b> includes a pair of endless conveyor chains <b>162</b> which are constructed the same as the conveyor chains <b>52</b> and are directed about a corresponding set of sprockets <b>164</b> mounted on parallel spaced shafts (not shown) located at opposite ends of the machine <b>160</b>. A series of rectangular aluminum slats <b>166</b> are constructed the same as the slats <b>54</b> and are attached to the conveyor chains <b>162</b>, and the opposite end portions of the slats <b>166</b> are guided by an opposing set of parallel spaced guide tracks or rails <b>168</b> which are constructed the same as the guide rails <b>56</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As also described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the conveyor slats <b>166</b> are supported along the upper run of the conveyor by the support plate <b>62</b> having longitudinally spaced slots <b>66</b> which connect with the vacuum manifold <b>70</b>. Each of the slats <b>166</b> has a center hole <b>58</b> which aligns with the slots <b>66</b> as the slats <b>166</b> slide horizontally on top of the support plate <b>62</b> for creating a continuous vacuum above each conveyor slat <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A series of aluminum mold plates <b>175</b> are attached to corresponding conveyor slats <b>166</b> in the same manner as the mold plates <b>75</b> are attached to the conveyor slats <b>54</b> described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Each mold plate <b>175</b> has a shingle forming cavity <b>178</b> with the impression of a wood grain shingle and a border rib <b>181</b> which mates with the border rib <b>181</b> of the adjacent mold plate <b>175</b> to form the groove defining strip portions <b>134</b> between the shingle panels <b>132</b>. Each of the mold plates <b>175</b> also has an undercut cavity <b>183</b> configured to form the bottom hook portions <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> of each shingle panel <b>132</b>. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, each adjacent pair of abutting mold plates <b>175</b> cooperate to define another undercut cavity <b>186</b> which is configured to form the projecting tab <b>142</b> and undercut groove <b>143</b> in vertical alignment with each strip portion <b>134</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Each mold plate <b>175</b> has small vacuum passages (not shown) which connect the cavities <b>178</b>, <b>183</b> and <b>186</b> to a vacuum cavity <b>188</b> formed within the bottom of each mold plate in the same manner and for the same purpose as the vacuum cavity or chamber <b>83</b> described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a generally flat sheet S<b>1</b> of thermoplastic material or PVC is continuously extruded from an extruder head <b>200</b> onto the mold plates <b>175</b> which form the upper linear run of the endless conveyor vacuum-forming machine <b>160</b>, and the vacuum created within the cavities <b>178</b>, <b>183</b> and <b>186</b> immediately sucks the hot sheet S<b>1</b> into the cavities. As the hot sheet S<b>1</b> is sucked into the vacuum mold plates <b>175</b>, a set of vacuum-forming assist members or plugs <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> are quickly extended or inserted into the corresponding cavities <b>183</b> and <b>186</b> and then quickly retracted to assure that the plastic sheet S<b>1</b> completely fills the cavities to form the portions <b>136</b> and <b>142</b> of each single panel <b>132</b>. Each of the vacuum assist plugs <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> is supported for reciprocating movement on an incline by a corresponding piston rod <b>206</b> extending from a fluid or air cylinder <b>208</b> and by a corresponding guide rod <b>210</b> which reciprocates in a guide block <b>211</b> mounted on the outer end of the corresponding cylinder <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Each of the air cylinders <b>208</b> is supported by a corresponding plate or bracket <b>214</b> projecting upwardly from a carriage member or platform <b>216</b>. The carriage platform <b>216</b> is supported for horizontal reciprocating movement by a pair of slides or guide rods <b>218</b> extending between a pair of support plates <b>219</b> mounted on a stationary support plate <b>222</b>. A fluid or air cylinder <b>224</b> is also mounted on the plate <b>222</b> and has a piston rod <b>226</b> connected to an arm <b>228</b> projecting laterally from the carriage platform <b>216</b>. An L-shaped locking or actuator arm or lever <b>232</b> is pivotally supported by the carriage platform <b>216</b> and is pivoted by a fluid or air cylinder <b>234</b>. The locking or actuating lever <b>232</b> releasably and successively engages a series of actuating pins <b>236</b> projecting laterally or horizontally from the mold plates <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In operation of the endless conveyor vacuum-forming machine <b>160</b> for continuously producing the siding panels <b>130</b>, the continuously extruded sheet S<b>1</b> of PVC is directed under a guide roller <b>242</b> and onto the continuously moving mold plates <b>175</b> forming the upper run of the endless conveyor or machine <b>160</b>. The speed of the conveyor machine is controlled to match the speed of the sheet S<b>1</b>, and the intermediate portion of the sheet is progressively sucked into the shingle cavities <b>178</b> and into the undercut cavities <b>183</b> and <b>186</b> of the mold plates. The vacuum assist plugs <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> are quickly and simultaneously extended by actuation of the cylinders <b>208</b> and press the portions of the hot sheet within the undercut cavities <b>183</b> and <b>186</b> further into the cavities. Thus, the plugs assist the vacuum within the cavities for forming the undercut U-shaped portions <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> of the siding panels within the lower portion of the sheet and also form the projecting tabs <b>142</b> and the undercut grooves <b>143</b> within the upper portion of the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The plugs <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> travel with the vacuum-formed sheet S<b>1</b> by movement of the carriage platform <b>216</b> in response to actuation of the air cylinder <b>234</b> to tilt the lever <b>232</b> for engaging a moving pin <b>236</b> on the conveyor. As soon as the vacuum assist plugs <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> are retracted, the tilting lever <b>232</b> disengages with the pin <b>236</b>, and the carriage platform <b>216</b> returns to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> to its home position by the biasing force exerted by the air cylinder <b>224</b> to extend its piston rod <b>226</b>. The timing of the actuation of the cylinders <b>208</b> and the cylinder <b>234</b> is controlled by electrically actuated valves (not shown) in time relation with the linear movement of the mold plates <b>175</b> on the endless conveyor chains <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, as the intermediate portion of the sheet S<b>1</b> is progressively vacuum formed into the mold plate cavities, the lower edge portion of the sheet is held against the top surfaces of the mold plates by a series of hold-down rollers <b>246</b> supported by a horizontally adjustable bar <b>248</b>. After the continuously moving vacuum-formed sheet S<b>1</b> is somewhat cooled on the conveyor mold plates <b>175</b> by conducting heat from the mold plates and is stripped from the mold plates, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the upper edge portion of the continuously moving vacuum-formed sheet is progressively punched by conventional punch and die machine <b>252</b> to form the longitudinally spaced slots <b>153</b>, after which the upper portion of the sheet is trimmed by a rotating vertical saw blade <b>256</b>. Simultaneously, the lower portion of the strip is trimmed by a horizontal circular saw blade <b>258</b> which is positioned to form the hook-shaped lower edge portions <b>136</b> and <b>138</b>, thereby completing the continuous forming of the siding panels <b>130</b>. Downstream of the saws <b>256</b> and <b>258</b>, the continuous strip of integrally connected siding panels <b>130</b> is cut transversely at longitudinally spaced predetermined intervals, such as five feet, by a traveling reciprocating circular saw for successively producing the separate siding panels <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>, by interchanging the mold plates <b>175</b> on the conveyor slats <b>166</b>, siding panels having shingle panels with different bottom contours or configurations and different wood grain patterns may be continuously produced on the vacuum-forming machine <b>160</b> in place of the siding panels <b>130</b>. For example, a siding panel <b>270</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) having shingle panels with a partial hexagon bottom configuration, a siding panel <b>272</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) having shingle panels with mitered bottom corners, a siding panel <b>274</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) having shingle panels with a rounded bottom configuration, a siding panel <b>276</b> having shingle panels with a half cove bottom configuration or a siding panel <b>278</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) having shingle panels with a square bottom configuration may each be continuously produced on the apparatus or machine <b>160</b> simply by selecting the corresponding interchangeable mold plates <b>175</b>. In each of the siding panels, the lower hook-shaped bottom portion of each shingle panel has a straight edge <b>144</b>, and each projecting tab has a straight edge <b>147</b> defining an undercut groove, in the same location and with the same spacing therebetween as the straight edges <b>144</b> and <b>147</b> described above in connection with the siding panels <b>130</b>. As a result, all of the siding panels <b>130</b>, <b>270</b>, <b>272</b>, <b>274</b>, <b>276</b> and <b>278</b> are interchangeable which permits various combinations of the siding panels to be attached to a vertical wall surface.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">From the drawings and the above description, it is apparent that the continuous production of vacuum-formed siding panels in accordance with the invention, provides desirable features and advantages. For example, the continuous forming of the extruded flat sheet S or S<b>1</b> with the continuous succession of mold plates <b>75</b> or <b>175</b> on the endless conveyor <b>50</b> or <b>160</b>, provides for efficiently and economically producing the siding panels with different shingle panels each having sharp detail and one or more undercut portions. The close fitting aluminum mold plates along the upper run of the conveyor also efficiently and precisely form the lower and upper portions of each siding panel. The separate aluminum mold plates further provide the conveyor or machine with a long service life for producing a large volume of siding panels, and the mold plates may be rapidly cooled by cooling water or air during the continuous production of the siding panels. The vacuum-forming assist plugs <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> which travel with the sheet S<b>1</b>, also help in producing precision shingle panels with precision undercut portions.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, another embodiment of an apparatus for continuously producing elongated siding panels <b>310</b> is illustrated generally at <b>300</b>. The apparatus <b>300</b> includes a forming station <b>302</b>, a trimming station <b>304</b>, a bending station <b>306</b>, and a finishing station <b>308</b>. The forming station <b>302</b> is shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and includes a conveyor <b>360</b>, a plurality of mold plates <b>376</b>, and an extruder die <b>400</b> for extruding a sheet of material S<b>3</b> onto the mold plates <b>376</b>. A guide roller <b>342</b> directs the sheet of material S<b>3</b> onto the plates <b>376</b> and material rollers <b>346</b> ensure that the material S<b>3</b> is in contact with the mold plates <b>376</b>. The conveyor <b>360</b> is preferably an endless conveyor belt; however, other types of conveyors may accommodate the subject invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">After the sheet of material S<b>3</b> has been vacuum formed and while still traveling on the conveyor <b>360</b>, a plurality of coolers <b>320</b> cool the entire sheet of material S<b>3</b> below the temperature for vacuum forming. A lower edge portion <b>392</b> and an upper edge portion <b>388</b> are both formed while the sheet of material S<b>3</b> is above the temperature for vacuum forming. Preferably, the entire lower edge portion <b>392</b> is formed prior to being removed from the conveyor <b>360</b> and while the sheet of material S<b>3</b> is above the temperature for vacuum forming. At the end of the conveyor <b>360</b>, the sheet of material S<b>3</b> is removed from the mold plates <b>376</b> and is below the temperature for vacuum forming.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">After the sheet of material S<b>3</b> has been removed, the trimming station <b>304</b> trims excess material S<b>3</b> from both the lower edge portion <b>392</b> and the upper edge portion <b>388</b>, if necessary. The lower edge portion <b>392</b> may be formed without excess material S<b>3</b> so the lower edge portion <b>392</b> may not require trimming. The trimming station <b>304</b> may include circular-type saws, knives, slicers, or the like. The trimming station <b>304</b> includes a horizontal blade <b>358</b> for trimming the lower edge portion <b>392</b> and a vertical blade <b>356</b> for trimming the upper edge portion <b>388</b>. Depending upon the orientation of the sheet of material S<b>3</b>, those skilled in the art appreciate that the blades may be positioned differently while still practicing the subject invention.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The mold plates <b>376</b> are formed of a rigid material and are positioned adjacent one another. In one embodiment, the mold plates <b>376</b> are cast of aluminum. The mold plates <b>376</b> are supported by the conveyor <b>360</b> and form the elongated siding panels <b>310</b> from the extruded sheet of material S<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to the formation of the upper and the lower edge portions <b>388</b>, <b>392</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 18A</figref> show cross-sectional views of the mold plates <b>376</b> having the sheet of material S<b>3</b> disposed thereon. Each of the mold plates <b>376</b> has the upper edge portion <b>388</b> and the lower edge portion <b>392</b> with an intermediate portion <b>378</b> therebetween. A plurality of vacuum passages <b>382</b> are disposed within each of the intermediate portion <b>378</b>, the upper edge portion <b>388</b>, and the lower edge portion <b>392</b> for vacuum-forming the sheet of material S<b>3</b> onto the mold plates <b>376</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The intermediate portion <b>378</b> has an aesthetic pattern <b>381</b> for imparting the pattern to the sheet of material S<b>3</b>. The mold plates <b>376</b> are arranged on the conveyor <b>360</b> so that the mold plates <b>376</b> adjacent one another have different aesthetic patterns <b>381</b>. This allows the siding panels <b>310</b> to achieve a realistic appearance while in use. For example, the conveyor <b>360</b> may carry eighty mold plates <b>376</b>, but when the elongated siding panel <b>310</b> is sectioned into desired lengths, only eight mold plates <b>376</b> form the sectioned panel, such as for a five-foot panel. Therefore, the eight mold plates <b>376</b> adjacent one another have different aesthetic patterns <b>381</b> to improve the realistic appearance of the sectioned panel.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The lower edge portion <b>392</b> has a lower leg <b>336</b> extending substantially perpendicular from the intermediate portion <b>378</b> defining a horizontal plane. The lower leg <b>336</b> is collinear along each of the adjacent mold plates <b>376</b> to allow for alignment between adjacent siding panels <b>310</b>. A projection portion <b>340</b> between the lower edge portion <b>392</b> and the intermediate portion <b>378</b> extends beyond the horizontal plane and imparts a jagged pattern to the intermediate portion <b>378</b>. The jagged pattern also enhances the realistic appearance of the siding panel <b>310</b>. Another advantage of the projection portion <b>340</b> is that when the siding panels <b>310</b> are fastened to a structure <b>350</b>, moisture is not able to get behind the siding panels <b>310</b>. Said another way, moisture is not able to follow the projection portion <b>340</b> because of the angle, whereas the moisture does travel along the generally flat bottom of the prior art siding panels <b>310</b>. Any moisture that is trapped behind the siding panels <b>310</b> may damage the structure <b>350</b>, therefore, it is advantageous that the subject invention does not allow the moisture to travel behind the siding panels <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the projection portion <b>340</b> is illustrated as angling upwardly at an angle of less than ninety degrees from the intermediate portion <b>378</b> toward the lower leg <b>336</b>. The projection portion <b>340</b> is also illustrated as having a rounded nose <b>354</b>; however, the projection portion <b>340</b> may terminate in a point to further decrease the likelihood of the moisture traveling behind the siding panels <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17C and 17D</figref>, the realistic appearance of the siding panels <b>310</b> can be further enhanced by extending the projection portion <b>340</b> a different amount beyond the horizontal plane within one of the mold plates <b>376</b>. If each of the mold plates <b>376</b> has the projection portion <b>340</b> extending at different amounts within each mold plate <b>376</b>, the siding panel <b>310</b> will have increased jaggedness. One example of the siding panel <b>310</b> having the projection portion <b>340</b> extending at different amounts in a single mold plate <b>376</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref>. Referring to the right-most panel, the projection portion <b>340</b> extends further on the right-hand side than it does on the left-hand side. The center-most panel has the projection portion <b>340</b> extending generally the same amount with smaller variations within the single mold plate <b>376</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref> is a rear view of the siding panel <b>310</b> illustrating the projection portion <b>340</b> extending beyond the lower leg <b>336</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The realistic appearance is further enhanced by the projection portion <b>340</b> of the adjacent mold plates <b>376</b> extending a different amount beyond the horizontal plane relative to the next adjacent mold plate <b>376</b>. The difference between adjacent mold plates <b>376</b> further increases the jaggedness of the siding panel <b>310</b>, thereby increasing the realistic appearance of the panel. It has been determined that if the projection portion <b>340</b> extends too far down and out from the intermediate portion <b>378</b> and the lower leg <b>336</b>, the material S<b>3</b> becomes to thin at the projection portion <b>340</b>. Therefore, the projection portion <b>340</b> should extend at most 0.5 inches laterally beyond the horizontal plane and at most 0.5 inches vertically beyond the intermediate portion <b>378</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</figref>, the lower edge portion <b>392</b> may also have the aesthetic pattern <b>381</b> thereon for imparting the pattern to the sheet of material S<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, one embodiment of the upper edge portion <b>388</b> is illustrated. The upper edge portion <b>388</b> defines a mounting flange <b>362</b> which may include having a locking groove <b>364</b> for mating with the lower edge portion <b>392</b> of a vertically overlapping panel. The mounting flange <b>362</b> also includes slots <b>314</b> for receiving fasteners to secure to the structure <b>350</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, another embodiment of the upper edge portion <b>388</b> is illustrated. The upper edge portion <b>388</b> includes an L-shaped projection <b>366</b> extending from the upper edge portion <b>388</b> for forming an interlock <b>368</b>. The interlock <b>368</b> has two corners <b>370</b> with one of the corners <b>370</b> having a substantially right angle <b>372</b> for mating with the lower edge portion <b>392</b> of a vertically overlapping panel. The interlock <b>368</b> creates a more secure connection between adjacent siding panels <b>310</b> because the corner <b>370</b> having the right angle <b>372</b> is more difficult to unlock from the lower edge portion <b>392</b>. Further, the interlock <b>368</b> allows the siding panel <b>310</b> to withstand higher winds without becoming unfastened from adjacent panels or the structure <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the apparatus <b>300</b> includes a cap <b>309</b> extending from the lower leg <b>336</b> forming a cap leg <b>311</b> and the lower edge portion <b>392</b> having a generally C-shape. The cap leg <b>311</b> extends upwardly from the horizontal plane for engaging adjacent panels <b>310</b>. The generally C-shaped lower edge portion <b>392</b> mates with the upper edge portion <b>388</b> of adjacent siding panels <b>310</b> when secured to the structure <b>350</b>. The cap <b>309</b> includes a locking channel <b>374</b> for forming into the sheet of material S<b>3</b> to secure to the upper edge portion <b>388</b> of a vertically overlapping panel. More specifically, the locking groove <b>364</b> co-acts with the locking channel <b>374</b> to secure adjacent panels to the structure <b>350</b>. It is to be appreciated that the siding panels may be formed with or without the locking groove <b>364</b>, while still securing fastened to adjacent panels. Further, the locking channel <b>374</b> may be removed and a locking leg <b>363</b> may be used to engage the locking groove <b>364</b>. The locking leg <b>363</b> biases the cap leg <b>311</b> outwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The cap <b>309</b> also includes a connector <b>380</b> pivotally connecting the cap <b>309</b> to the lower leg <b>336</b>. The cap <b>309</b> is moveable between an open position and a closed position for allowing removal of the elongated siding panel <b>310</b>. Application of the vacuum through the vacuum passages <b>382</b> seals the cap <b>309</b> against the lower leg <b>336</b>. When the sheet of material S<b>3</b> reaches the end of the conveyor <b>360</b>, the sheet of material S<b>3</b> is removed from the mold plates <b>376</b> and forces the cap <b>309</b> to the open position. A biasing device <b>384</b> biases the cap <b>309</b> from the open position to the closed position so that after the material S<b>3</b> is removed, the biasing device <b>384</b> forces the cap <b>309</b> back to the closed position. The biasing device <b>384</b> is illustrated as a spring interconnecting the cap <b>309</b> to the lower leg <b>336</b>, however, the biasing device <b>384</b> may include other devices, such as, but not limited to, actuated cylinders to move the cap <b>309</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the bending station <b>306</b> is illustrated. The bending station <b>306</b> includes a heater <b>390</b> positioned downstream from the extruder <b>400</b> for heating the sheet of material S<b>3</b> after the sheet of material S<b>3</b> has been removed from the mold plates <b>376</b> and after the entire sheet of material S<b>3</b> has been cooled. The heater <b>390</b> further includes a manifold <b>393</b> defining a plurality of apertures <b>394</b> disposed in a straight line as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. The heater <b>390</b> heats a line <b>324</b> spaced inward from a terminal edge of either one of the upper and the lower edge portions <b>388</b>, <b>392</b>. The line <b>324</b> divides the edge portion into a first part <b>414</b> spaced inward from the line <b>324</b> and a second part <b>416</b> spaced outward from the line <b>324</b>. In one preferred embodiment, only a single heater <b>390</b> is required since the lower edge portion <b>392</b> is formed while the entire sheet of material S<b>3</b> is above the temperature for vacuum forming and does not require additional bending. However, both edge portions may be heated and bent to form final profiles of the edge portions.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Once the line <b>324</b> is heated along the edge portion, the bending station <b>306</b> bends the second part <b>416</b> relative to the first part <b>414</b> for finishing the edge portion. For example, referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, the details of the upper edge portion <b>388</b>, such as the locking groove or the interlock, are formed substantially simultaneously with the remainder of the siding panel <b>310</b>. However, the upper edge portion <b>388</b> needs to be finished after it has been removed from the mold plates <b>376</b>. Therefore, after the heater <b>390</b> heats the line <b>324</b>, the bending station <b>306</b> bends the second part <b>416</b> relative to the first part <b>414</b> to form the profile shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a micro-switch cam <b>420</b> is disposed in one of the upper edge portion <b>388</b> and the lower edge portion <b>392</b> at longitudinally spaced intervals for activating a cutting mechanism <b>422</b> to cut the sheet of material S<b>3</b> into a succession of separate elongated siding panels <b>310</b>. As the micro-switch cam <b>420</b> approaches the cutting mechanism <b>422</b>, a micro-switch <b>423</b> detects the micro-switch cam <b>420</b> and activates the cutting mechanism <b>422</b>. The cutting mechanism <b>422</b> secures the sheet of material S<b>3</b> by slowing or stopping the material S<b>3</b> and then the material S<b>3</b> is cut. The micro-switch cam <b>420</b> is formed into the sheet of material S<b>3</b> by the mold plates <b>376</b> while the sheet of material S<b>3</b> is above the temperature for vacuum forming.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to the example described above having eight mold plates <b>376</b> forming one siding panel <b>310</b>, the micro-switch cam <b>420</b> may be located every eighth mold plates <b>376</b>. Those skilled in the art recognize that if the siding panel <b>310</b> is to be cut into ten foot sections, then sixteen mold plates <b>376</b> may form one siding panel <b>310</b> and the micro-switch cam <b>420</b> would be located every sixteenth mold plate <b>376</b>. The mold plate <b>376</b> that divides the lengths of the siding panels <b>310</b> may be further defined as a divider plate <b>421</b> that is substantially flat and that only includes the micro-switch cam <b>420</b> and does not have an aesthetic pattern <b>381</b> disposed thereon. The cutting mechanism <b>422</b> does not cut the siding panel <b>310</b> in the aesthetic pattern <b>381</b> but only where the siding panel <b>310</b> does not have the aesthetic pattern <b>381</b>. The substantially flat section would be hidden by adjacent siding panels <b>310</b> during use. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the finishing station also includes a punch <b>312</b> for punching slots <b>314</b> into the mounting flange <b>362</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Another embodiment of the apparatus <b>300</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> and includes a plug assist <b>402</b> adjacent the conveyor <b>360</b>. The plug assist <b>402</b> urges the sheet of material S<b>3</b> into at least one of the intermediate portion <b>378</b>, the upper edge portion <b>388</b>, and the lower edge portion <b>392</b> as the sheet of material S<b>3</b> is vacuum formed. The plug assist <b>402</b> preferably includes a plurality of mold inserts <b>404</b> rotatably engaging adjacent mold plates <b>376</b> as the conveyor <b>360</b> is operated. Other prior art plug assists limit the rate of speed that the conveyor <b>360</b> is able to operate because the plug assist <b>402</b> has to be reset each time. The plug assist <b>402</b> according to the subject invention moves at the same speed of the conveyor <b>360</b> and therefore the conveyor <b>360</b> can be operated at maximum speeds. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the plug assist <b>402</b> is a wheel having mold inserts <b>404</b> about the circumference of the wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the plug assist <b>402</b> is illustrated in more detail. The plug assist <b>402</b> includes a shaft <b>406</b> fixed relative to the conveyor <b>360</b> that supports the plurality of mold inserts <b>404</b> substantially horizontally for rotation about the shaft <b>406</b>. In one embodiment, a common drive <b>408</b> connects to the conveyor <b>360</b> and the shaft <b>406</b> for driving the conveyor <b>360</b> and the shaft <b>406</b> simultaneously. Alternatively, the shaft <b>406</b> may be driven by a drive separate from the conveyor <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> includes a plurality of separate and distinct mold inserts <b>410</b> that travel along with the conveyor <b>360</b>. The mold inserts <b>410</b> are urged into contact with the sheet of material S<b>3</b> by following a track <b>418</b>. The mold inserts <b>410</b> travel with the sheet of material S<b>3</b> at the speed of the conveyor <b>360</b>. At a predetermined point, the mold inserts <b>410</b> separate from the sheet of material S<b>3</b> and cycle back to the beginning. The track <b>418</b> may be a chain drive <b>419</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. The separate mold inserts <b>410</b> would travel back toward the start of the conveyor <b>360</b> in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. At least one mold insert engages the sheet of material S<b>3</b> as it travels along the conveyor <b>360</b>. Preferably, there would be at least eight mold inserts <b>410</b> spaced from one another that travel with the conveyor <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The subject invention further provides a method of continuously producing elongated siding panels <b>310</b>. Each of the panels <b>310</b> have the upper edge portion <b>388</b>, the intermediate portion <b>378</b> having the aesthetic pattern <b>381</b>, and the lower edge portion <b>392</b>. The lower leg <b>336</b> extends substantially perpendicular from the intermediate portion <b>378</b> defining the horizontal plane and the cap leg <b>311</b> extends upwardly from the horizontal plane such the lower edge portion <b>392</b> is substantially C-shaped. The method includes the steps of extruding the sheet of material S<b>3</b> having the temperature sufficient for vacuum forming and directing the sheet of material S<b>3</b> onto the plurality of mold plates <b>376</b> carried by the conveyor <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, a vacuum is progressively applied to the mold plates <b>376</b> as the mold plates <b>376</b> travel along the conveyor <b>360</b> and the sheet of material S<b>3</b> is drawn into the mold plates <b>376</b> when the vacuum is applied. The upper edge portion <b>388</b>, the intermediate portion <b>378</b>, and the lower edge portion <b>392</b> are formed while the entire sheet of material S<b>3</b> has the sufficient temperature for vacuum forming. The projection portion <b>340</b> between the lower edge portion <b>392</b> and the intermediate portion <b>378</b> is also formed simultaneously with the forming of the lower edge portion <b>392</b> and the intermediate portion <b>378</b>. Likewise, the cap <b>309</b> is sealed against the lower leg <b>336</b> and the locking channel <b>374</b> in the lower edge portion <b>392</b> is formed while the entire sheet of material S<b>3</b> is above the temperature for vacuum forming and the locking groove <b>364</b>, if present, in the upper edge portion <b>388</b> is also formed simultaneously with the formation of the locking channel <b>374</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">After forming, the entire sheet of material S<b>3</b> is cooled below the temperature sufficient for vacuum forming. If necessary, the excess material S<b>3</b> is trimmed from the upper and the lower edge portions <b>388</b>, <b>392</b> prior to finishing. The subject invention heats the line <b>324</b> spaced inward from a terminal edge of the upper edge portion <b>388</b>. The line <b>324</b> divides the upper edge portion <b>388</b> into the first part <b>414</b> spaced inward from the line <b>324</b> and the second part <b>416</b> spaced outward from the line <b>324</b>. The first part <b>414</b> and the second part <b>416</b> remain at a temperature below the temperature of the line <b>324</b> even though the line <b>324</b> has been re-heated. The second part <b>416</b> is bent relative to the first part <b>414</b> to define the interlock <b>368</b> of the upper edge portion <b>388</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">After the upper edge portion <b>388</b> is complete, the siding panel <b>310</b> reaches the finishing station <b>308</b>. The slots <b>314</b> are punched into the mounting flange <b>362</b> and then the micro-switch cam <b>420</b> is detected and the sheet of material S<b>3</b> is cut at longitudinally spaced intervals to produce the succession of separate elongated siding panels <b>310</b> in response to detecting the micro-switch cam <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">While the methods and forms of apparatus and the siding panels herein described constitute preferred embodiments of the invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the precise methods and forms of apparatus and siding panels described, and that changes may be made therein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims. For example, it is within the scope of the invention to produce siding panels with a single elongated mold plate for each elongated siding panel and attach forward end portions of the mold plates to one pair of endless conveyor chains and the rearward end portions of the mold plates to another pair of endless conveyor chains so that the mold plates always remain horizontal as they travel with the endless conveyor chains.</p>
