<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a system diagram of a medical ultrasound system <b>10</b> in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The medical ultrasound system <b>10</b> includes an ultrasound platform <b>12</b>, which provides a user (e.g., a medical technician) with capabilities to generate, process and display ultrasound images using a probe (also referred to as a probe head or an autoclavable probe) <b>18</b>. The probe <b>18</b> includes a sensor assembly (e.g., a transducer assembly) for taking ultrasound images. For example, the probe <b>18</b> may be a sterilizable finger mounted probe, and may include an array of ultrasound sensors for ultrasound imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The probe <b>18</b> is coupled to the platform <b>12</b> via a cable <b>16</b> and a connector assembly <b>14</b>. The cable <b>16</b> should be a multi-wire cable that can carry multiple signals at the same time. The connector assembly <b>14</b> includes a sterilizable connector, which may be a large pin count, low insertion force, steam autoclavable connector suitable for medical ultrasound applications.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The probe <b>18</b> may be sterilized, for example, through immersion in a disinfecting liquid and/or steam autoclaving. The sterilizable connector may also be sterilized in a similar manner. The disinfecting liquid, for example, may include Glutaraldehyde (Cidex) and/or Clorohexidine-gluconate solutions. During steam autoclaving, for example, the probe and the attached connector may be exposed to 206.8 Kpa (kilopascal) (or 30 psi (pound per square inch)) steam for 15 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The connector assembly <b>14</b> also includes an adapter assembly. The adapter assembly includes a connector (also referred to as a mating connector) to be mated to the sterilizable connector and a connector (also referred to as a standard connector) to be mated to the ultrasound platform (i.e., a standard connector). The standard connector, for example, can mate to a connector of a standard medical ultrasound system, such that the sterilizable connector of the present invention can be used with conventional medical ultrasound systems. Otherwise, the sterilizable probe attached to the sterilizable connector may not be compatible with existing commercial medical ultrasound systems, thus limiting marketability thereof. The standard connector may be any common ultrasound connector including, but not limited to, DL series of Zero Insertion Force (ZIF) connectors available from ITT Cannon. In other embodiments, the connector assembly <b>14</b> may not include an adapter assembly; instead, the sterilizable connector may connect directly with a mating connector on the ultrasound platform <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref> illustrate exemplary embodiments of a probe and cable. In each of these exemplary embodiments, the probe is used to provide high frequency sound waves (i.e., ultrasound), which are coupled to an imaging subject across an acoustic seal. The acoustic seal may include a sound conductive gel, which couples the sound waves between the probe and the imaging subject.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref> illustrates an open-ended finger type probe, in practice, the probes can be close-ended or open-nail ended (in which only the finger nail portion of the probe is open ended), and/or any other suitable probes that are sterilizable through immersion and/or steam autoclaving. In one exemplary embodiment, for example, the probes should withstand at least 1,000 cleaning and sterilization cycles without substantial degradation in performance.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates a first exemplary embodiment of a probe and cable assembly <b>20</b> in accordance with the present invention. A probe <b>22</b> is coupled via a cable <b>24</b> to a wrist connector <b>28</b> on a cuff mount <b>25</b>, which can be worn on a wrist of the user. The probe <b>22</b>, the cable <b>24</b>, the cuff mount <b>25</b> and the wrist connector <b>28</b> are immersible in a disinfecting liquid (e.g., Glutaraldehyde (Cidex) and/or Clorohexidine-gluconate solutions) and/or steam autoclavable for sterilization. The probe <b>22</b>, for example, is a finger mounted probe. The cable <b>24</b>, for example, may be formed from a flexible planar circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The wrist connector <b>28</b> can be detachably connected to an ultrasound platform using a cable <b>30</b>. The cable <b>30</b> has a connector <b>29</b> for coupling with the wrist connector <b>28</b> and a connector <b>32</b> for connecting to the ultrasound platform. Since the cable <b>30</b> is detachable from the cuff mount <b>25</b>, the wrist connector <b>28</b>, the cable <b>24</b>, and the probe <b>22</b>, which together may be referred as an immersible probe assembly, the cable <b>30</b> is not necessarily sterilizable, e.g., through immersion or steam autoclaving.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The probe <b>22</b> can perhaps be better described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. The probe <b>22</b> has a generally cylindrical finger mount <b>144</b>, which is shaped for wearing on a finger of the user in much the same manner as a ring. In order to allow different users having different finger sizes to wear a same-sized probe <b>22</b>, a finger cot <b>140</b> that may have varying sizes and thicknesses can be worn over the user's finger first prior to wearing the finger mount <b>144</b>. The probe <b>22</b> also has formed thereon a sensor housing <b>142</b> for mounting a sensor assembly therein. Probes in the exemplary embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C-2E</figref> may also have a configuration that is substantially the same as the configuration of probe <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one exemplary embodiment, the sensor assembly, for example, may include an array of 96 sensors (i.e., transducers) having a pitch of about 4 mils (i.e., approximately 101.6 micro meters), an elevation focus of 35 milimeter (mm) radius and an elevation of 6 mm. The sensor assembly may be for operation at 5 mega Hertz (MHz) or 7.5 MHz, or any other suitable frequency. The acoustic frequency may be 6+ MHz with a −6 dB bandwidth greater than 40%. The impedance of the sensor array may be between approximately 400 and approximately 700 ohms over approximately 4.5 to approximately 9 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates a probe <b>200</b> that can be used instead of the probe <b>22</b> or the probes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C-2E</figref>. The probe <b>200</b> has an outer housing <b>202</b>, which has a hemispherical tip <b>203</b> and a generally cylindrical section <b>204</b>. The hemispherical tip <b>203</b> and the generally cylindrical section <b>204</b> define an elongated cavity through which a finger of a user can be inserted. The open end of the generally cylindrical section <b>204</b> has a circular cross-section whose radius is larger than that of the circular cross-section of the end abutting the hemispherical tip <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">On the outer surface of the generally cylindrical section <b>204</b> is formed thereon a sensor housing <b>206</b> for mounting a sensor therein. The sensor housing <b>206</b> has a substantially rectangular block shape, and has an opening <b>207</b> at the bottom (i.e., side opposite the side attached to the cylindrical section <b>204</b>) for emitting ultrasound waves, and for sensing the reflected ultrasound waves for imaging. A finger cot <b>205</b> having various different sizes and thicknesses may be worn on the finger before wearing the probe <b>200</b>, such that users having various different finger sizes may use a one-size-fits-all probe.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates a second exemplary embodiment of a probe and cable assembly <b>40</b> in accordance with the present invention. A probe <b>42</b> is coupled via a cable <b>46</b> to a sterilizable connector <b>48</b>. The sterilizable connector <b>48</b> interfaces with a cable <b>52</b> via a connector <b>50</b>. At the other end of the cable <b>52</b> is a connector <b>54</b>, which may be a standard connector for connecting to a ultrasound medical platform. The probe <b>42</b>, for example, is a finger mounted probe. The probe <b>42</b>, the cable <b>46</b> and the connector <b>48</b> are sterilizable, for example, through immersion in a disinfecting liquid (e.g., Glutaraldehyde (Cidex) and/or Clorohexidine-gluconate solutions) and/or steam autoclaving. The cable <b>52</b> and its connectors <b>50</b> and <b>54</b> can be detached from the sterilizable connector <b>48</b>, and are not necessarily sterilizable.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The sterilizable connector <b>48</b> may be mounted on a belt or at the back of a user such that the user can easily unplug the immersible sub-assembly including the probe <b>42</b>, the cable <b>46</b> and the sterilizable connector <b>48</b> from the cable <b>52</b>, and at the same time not be encumbered by the loose end of the cable <b>46</b>.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In operation, the adapter <b>400</b> (including the standard ultrasound equipment connector <b>413</b>) is pushed into its mate (the equipment connector <b>401</b>) and the cross-shaped key fits into a slot in the equipment connector <b>401</b>. As the main shaft <b>422</b> is rotated using the toggle latch <b>425</b>, the key engages the equipment connector <b>401</b>, thereby bringing the adapter <b>400</b> and the mating connector <b>401</b> closer together. At approximately 90 degrees of rotation, the key locks into place. To disengage the two mating connectors, the process is simply reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The toggle latch assembly described above is known to those skilled in the art. Those skilled in the art would also appreciate that the short shaft for forming the “key” may be replaced by other shaped components, and the selection of the “key” is based on the type of ultrasound platform used. In addition, any other mating/locking mechanism known to those skilled in the art may be used instead of the toggle latch assembly to mate the adapter to the ultrasound platform as long as such mating/locking mechanism is supported by the ultrasound platform.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The adapter <b>400</b> also includes an alignment frame <b>404</b>, an adapter probe mate <b>406</b>, a backing plate <b>405</b> and a shuttle rear plate <b>411</b>. The adapter probe mate <b>406</b> has a plurality of contacts <b>410</b> formed thereon. These contacts <b>410</b> correspond to and are for forming electrical connections with the contacts <b>133</b> of the sterilizable connector <b>112</b> via an anisotropic contact pad <b>408</b> (i.e., z-axis conductive pad). The contacts <b>410</b> are electrically connected to an adapter flexible circuit <b>420</b> that are electrically connected through the connector <b>413</b> to the equipment connector <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The alignment frame <b>404</b> includes a wider opening <b>424</b> and a narrower opening <b>434</b>. The probe mate <b>406</b> also has a corresponding wider region <b>427</b> and a narrower region <b>429</b>. The sides of the wider opening <b>424</b> and the wider region <b>427</b> are shaped to match the convex protrusions <b>134</b> of the sterilizable connector <b>112</b>. Therefore, the sterilizable connector <b>112</b> can initially be mated via the contact pad <b>408</b> with the wider region <b>427</b> of the adapter probe mate <b>406</b> through the wider opening <b>424</b>. The narrower opening <b>434</b> has formed along its side peripheries vertical protrusions <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The adapter probe mate <b>406</b> is mounted on the shuttle rear plate <b>411</b> through an opening <b>442</b> on the adapter housing <b>403</b>. The adapter probe mate <b>406</b> and the shuttle rear plate <b>411</b> are slidably mounted on the adapter housing <b>403</b> such that they can together slide up and down.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the sterilizable connector <b>112</b> is first aligned with the wider opening <b>424</b> of the alignment frame <b>404</b> and the wider region <b>427</b> of the adapter probe mate <b>406</b>. Then, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 10A</figref>, the sterilizable connector <b>112</b> is mated with the adapter probe mate <b>406</b> via the contact pad <b>408</b> through the wider opening <b>424</b>. The adapter <b>400</b> at this point is already mated with the equipment connector <b>401</b> using the toggle latch assembly <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8C and 10B</figref>, after the contact is made, the sterilizable connector <b>112</b> is slid down with respect to the adapter housing <b>403</b>. Along with the sterilizable connector, the adapter probe mate <b>406</b> and the shuttle rear plate <b>411</b> are also slid down. The alignment frame <b>404</b>, however, remains stationary with respect to the adapter housing <b>403</b>. Since the narrower opening <b>434</b> has formed along its side peripheries vertical protrusions <b>440</b>, as the sterilizable connector <b>112</b> is slid down, the convex protrusions <b>134</b> are pinned under the vertical protrusions <b>440</b>, such that the sterilizable connector <b>112</b> is tightly coupled to the adapter probe mate <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As the contact surfaces are brought close together, multiple thin parallel wires between the electrical contacts in the contact pad <b>408</b> are deformed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, for example), and electrical connections are made between corresponding electrical contacts. This way, the contact pad <b>408</b> electrically connects the contacts <b>133</b> with the contacts <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a connector assembly in an exemplary embodiment according to the present invention, where a sterilizable connector <b>500</b> interfaces with an adapter assembly <b>502</b>, which includes a standard ultrasound equipment connector <b>514</b> and a mating connector <b>510</b>. The connector assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, for example, can be used as the connector assembly <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Since the adapter assembly <b>502</b> can be coupled and de-coupled with the sterilizable connector <b>500</b>, it may not need to be sterilizable. The sterilizable connector <b>500</b> interfaces with the standard ultrasound equipment connector <b>514</b> via the mating connector <b>510</b>. The mating connector <b>510</b> may also be referred to as an adapter.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As discussed above, in other embodiments, the mating connector <b>510</b> may be mounted on the ultrasound platform instead of interfacing with the standard ultrasound equipment connector <b>514</b>. In these embodiments, the sterilizable connector <b>500</b> can be connected directly to the ultrasound platform.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The sterilizable connector <b>500</b> includes multiple electrical contacts <b>506</b> mounted thereon to electrically interface with mating contacts <b>512</b> on the mating connector <b>510</b>. The sterilizable connector <b>500</b> includes a flexible printed wiring board that is molded into a probe connector housing <b>504</b>. This provides for an inexpensive and rugged design that, due to its integrated one-piece design, is autoclavable (i.e., steam sterilizable). A cable <b>508</b> (also referred to as a probe connector cable or a probe cable) should also be sealed at one end to and within the probe connector housing <b>504</b> so that steam sterilization does not damage the sterilizable connector <b>500</b> by introducing moisture into it. The cable <b>508</b> should be a multi-wire cable that can conduct various different signals between the ultrasound platform <b>12</b> and the probe <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">When electrical connections are made between the sterilizable connector <b>500</b> and the adapter assembly <b>502</b>, they are held in place, for example, using a locking mechanism known to those skilled in the art. The locking mechanism may include rotate-and-lock mechanism, slide-and-lock mechanism and/or any other suitable locking mechanism for tightly coupling two electrical contact surfaces together, and is used to ensure good electrical contacts between the electrical contacts <b>506</b> and the mating contacts <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a mating surface view of the sterilizable connector <b>500</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the sterilizable connector includes a printed wiring board (i.e., flexible circuit or printed wiring substrate) <b>520</b> molded in the probe connector housing <b>504</b>. The printed wiring board <b>520</b> has formed thereon a number of wires <b>522</b> (e.g., wire traces) for carrying various different electrical signals and/or to provide power and ground. The printed wires <b>522</b>, for example, are electrically coupled to the electrical contacts <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the sterilizable connector <b>500</b> includes the printed wiring board <b>520</b>, the cable <b>508</b>, and a backing <b>530</b> that are molded together in the probe connector housing <b>504</b>. The sterilizable connector <b>500</b> also includes contacts <b>532</b> for connecting the printed wiring board <b>520</b> to the cable <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The materials used to construct the sterilizable connector <b>500</b> should be selected such that a seamless, hermetic bond between the components can be formed. Further, a chemical bond may also be formed between the components. Such construction should avoid even the smallest of cracks or seams in which pathogens can survive. The materials should also be selected such that the probe connector housing <b>504</b> will survive repeated autoclaving cycles without losing its hermetic seal or mechanical integrity. The probe connector housing <b>504</b>, for example, may be made of polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">All external material (for all the probes and connectors of the present invention) that may come into contact with human body should be FDA certified. Those skilled in the art would know how to select FDA certified materials that meet requirements for fabricating the probes and the sterilizable connectors of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The electrical contacts <b>506</b> in the exemplary embodiment may also be referred to as gold contacts or gold bumps when it is formed by plating a relatively thick gold layer over printed wiring (e.g., copper wiring) <b>522</b> of the flexible printed wiring board <b>520</b> (i.e., flexible circuit). The gold contacts are selected for the exemplary embodiment because of at least the following properties. Pure gold is a soft, highly conductive and low reactivity metal. The high conductivity and softness provide for an excellent low contact force electrical connection. The low reactivity should ensure that the contact surface will not be adversely affected by harsh environmental conditions (such as encountered during autoclaving).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As discussed above, the autoclavable connector is realized through the use of gold plated contacts on a unitized molded connector in the described exemplary embodiment. Another notable feature of the described exemplary embodiment is the properties of the backing <b>530</b> for the flexible printed wiring board <b>520</b>. The backing <b>530</b> should be selected to have appropriate compliance to allow motion between the mating (or contact) surfaces (i.e., electrical contacts <b>506</b> and the mating contacts <b>512</b>) as the connection is made. In addition, the backing <b>530</b> should provide a spring force to keep the two surfaces in contact. Further, a relative motion between the mating surfaces provides a mechanism for removing contaminants between the mating surfaces, thereby allowing a reliable electrical connection between the electrical contacts and the mating contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a connector assembly in another exemplary embodiment according to the present invention, where a sterilizable connector <b>600</b> interfaces with an adapter assembly <b>202</b>, which includes a mating connector <b>622</b> and a standard ultrasound equipment connector (also referred to as a standard connector) <b>620</b>. A cable <b>606</b> (which may be multi-wire) is connected to connector sections <b>604</b> and <b>608</b> of the sterilizable connector <b>600</b>. In other embodiments, the connector sections <b>604</b> and <b>608</b> may be a single integrated component. The connector assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, for example, may be used as the connector assembly <b>14</b> coupled to the ultrasound platform <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As discussed above, in other embodiments, the mating connector <b>622</b> may be mounted on the ultrasound platform instead of interfacing with the standard ultrasound equipment connector <b>620</b>. In these embodiments, the sterilizable connector <b>600</b> can be connected directly to the ultrasound platform.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The connector assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> may be said to incorporate a “contact pad” design, in which anisotropic conducting contact pads (i.e., z-axis conductive pads) <b>614</b>, <b>616</b> (also referred to as contact pads) are used, respectively, to make the electrical connection between sterilizable connector's contacts <b>610</b>, <b>612</b> and mating connector's contacts <b>624</b>, <b>626</b>. Using the “contact pad” design, the connector contacts can be made out of a hard, electrically conductive material and yet have reliable electrical connection using relatively low forces to mate the connectors. Use of the “contact pad” design, therefore should provide a significant increase in connector lifetime. In addition, using removable contact pads may simplify cleaning of the adapter assembly <b>602</b> since the contact pads <b>614</b> and <b>616</b> may be disposable. Further, the contact pads <b>614</b> and <b>616</b> are deformable, and should be able to provide the contaminant removing mechanical motion and spring force.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When electrical connections are made between the sterilizable connector <b>600</b> and the adapter assembly <b>602</b>, they are held in place, for example, using a locking mechanism known to those skilled in the art. The locking mechanism may include rotate-and-lock mechanism, slide-and-lock mechanism and/or any other suitable locking mechanism for tightly coupling two electrical contact surfaces together, and is used to ensure good electrical contacts between the contacts <b>610</b> and <b>624</b> using the contact pad <b>614</b>, and between the contacts <b>612</b> and <b>626</b> using the contact pad <b>616</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates the anisotropic conducting contact pad <b>614</b> that interfaces between the sterilizable connector <b>608</b> and the mating connector <b>622</b>. The contact pad <b>616</b> has substantially the same configuration and usage as the contact pad <b>614</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the contact pad <b>614</b> includes multiple thin parallel wires <b>630</b> that are imbedded in a compliant polymer matrix <b>634</b>. The polymer matrix <b>634</b> serves to insulate each wire as well as to provide suitable compliant mechanical support. The resultant structure should conduct electrical current in only one direction, hence the thin parallel wires <b>630</b> function as anisotropic conductors.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Due to their anisotropic conductive nature, the contact pads <b>614</b> and <b>616</b> can be used to connect multiple sets of contact surfaces without shorting adjacent conductive contacts. In other words, the polymer matrix <b>634</b> prevents the embedded wires from touching each other so as to prevent shorts between them. Further, the compression due to mating forces causes the connecting wires to deform to deformed wires <b>632</b>. This motion serves to remove surface contaminants, thereby permitting a reliable electrical contact. The polymer matrix <b>634</b> should be selected such that it provides the necessary spring force to keep the deformed wires <b>632</b> in constant contact with the electrical contact surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The anisotropic conducting contact pads (or contact pads) are typically used to provide low-insertion-force, multi-contact connections between high value and/or fragile electronic components and a mating connector. The advantage of this connector system is the ability to make extremely dense, large quantity, reliable, very low force electrical connections. The anisotropic conducting contact pads may be disposable. The general use of the anisotropic conducting contact pads and the selection of suitable polymer matrix are known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In this exemplary embodiment, the use of the contact pads allows the use of a hard contact surface between the two mating connectors. Hard contact surfaces reduce the scratching and pitting in the contacts seen in traditional gold contact designs. Such pitting may provide a safe haven for pathological agents. These agents could be chemical in nature and hence not be removed by standard cleaning methods, even though autoclaving would render them sterile. Though physical contact between the connector and the body or its fluids would be extremely unlikely, such chemicals, through normal handling, could be transferred to and contaminate other parts of the probe which may then be placed in bodily contact.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The ‘V’ shape of the sterilizable connector <b>608</b> serves to self-center the contact surfaces <b>610</b> and <b>612</b> (i.e., electrical contacts) to the contact surfaces <b>624</b> and <b>626</b> (i.e., mating contacts) during mating as well as to provide lateral as well as normal forces to the contact pads <b>614</b> and <b>616</b>. The latter is suitable to help with the necessary wire-to-contact-surface wiping action suitable for removing surface contaminants.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The sterilizable connector <b>600</b> should have a unitized molded assembly. The materials used to construct the sterilizable connector <b>600</b> should be selected such that a seamless, hermetic bond between the components can be formed. Further, a chemical bond between the components may also be formed. Such construction should avoid even the smallest of cracks or seams in which pathogens can survive. The material for the connector sections <b>604</b> and <b>608</b> should be selected such that they will survive repeated autoclaving cycles without losing their hermetic seal or mechanical integrity. The connector sections <b>604</b> and <b>608</b>, for example, may be made of polymer. All external material that may come into contact with human body should be FDA certified. Those skilled in the art would know how to select FDA certified materials that meet requirements for fabricating the autoclavable connector of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the invention can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential character hereof. The present description is therefore considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is indicated by the appended claims, and all changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalents thereof are intended to be embraced therein.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">For example, even though the present invention has been described herein in reference to medical ultrasound systems, it is broadly applicable to any medical or other systems that require use of portable sensor assemblies and/or sterilization of one or more connectors.</p>
