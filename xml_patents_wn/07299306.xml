<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A memory controller controls access to and from one or more memory module(s), such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM), SDRAM and DDR-SDRAM. A sequencer core within the memory controller issues commands to either control, read or write to the memory module. In the case of a write transaction, the sequencer core issues a command to write data at a particular address. The command to write, the data, and the address are transmitted to the memory module, and the memory module writes the data to the address.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the case of a read transaction, the sequencer core issues a command to read data at a particular address in the memory module. When the memory module is DDR-SDRAM, unlike the case of a write transaction, after sending the command to read an address, the memory controller requires a response from the memory module. The response includes the data stored at the address.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The response from the memory module can require a variable amount of time. When the memory module responds to a read request, the memory module transmits the data at the address, with a data strobe signal (DQS). The DQS indicates to the receiving memory controller that the data is transmitted. In response to receiving the DQS signal, the memory controller reads the incoming data and stores the data into a read data queue by registering data on the rising and falling edges of DQS.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The DQS is typically a voltage pulse with a predetermined voltage and width. The memory controller detects the DQS by comparing a signal to a predetermined threshold. The threshold is usually a proportion of the voltage. When the signal exceeds the threshold, the memory controller detects the rising edge of DQS and when the signal falls below the threshold, falling edge of DQS is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The memory controller and the memory module are typically implemented as separate integrated circuits. The integrated circuits are fused to a motherboard and conduct read and write transactions over a printed circuit, connecting the memory module and the memory controller.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Printed circuits are susceptible to noise signals. Noise signals can be caused by a number of different factors, such as cross-talk, simultaneous switching noise and ground bounce. If the magnitude of the noise signals exceed the predetermined voltage, the memory controller might erroneously detect a transition on DQS and read erroneous signals as data.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such systems with the present invention as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Presented herein is a system, method, and apparatus for Dual Numerically Controlled Delay Logic for DQS Gating. In one embodiment, there is a requesting node for transmitting a request to a responding node. The responding node provides a response, as well as a signal indicating the response is ready. The signal indicating the response is ready is received by logic. The logic transmits another signal to the requesting node indicating that the response is ready, based on the request and the response ready signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is illustrated a block diagram of a requesting node <b>105</b> and a responding node <b>110</b>, configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The requesting node <b>105</b> requests a transaction from the responding node <b>110</b>. The requesting node <b>105</b> can comprise a wide variety of devices, including, for example, a controller, a master circuit, or a client. The responding node <b>110</b> comprises, for example, a memory module, a slave circuit, a database, or a server. The transaction can comprise, for example, a memory read, a database query, or a function.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">After receiving the request, the responding node <b>110</b> can perform any number of operations to generate a response. The response can comprise, for example, the contents of the particular memory location(s), database hits, or a return value for a function. After the responding node <b>110</b> generates the response, the responding node <b>110</b> transmits the response to the requesting node <b>105</b>. The responding node <b>110</b> also transmits a ready signal indicating that the response is ready to be received.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The response does not necessarily follow the request immediately. The time between the request and the response can be affected by several factors, including the time for the request and the time for response to propagate. Accordingly, the requesting node <b>110</b> utilizes a signal indicating the presence of the response. Therefore, the responding node <b>110</b> also transmits a response ready signal indicating that the response is ready.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">However, the requesting node <b>105</b> and the responding node <b>110</b> are separated by a communication medium. The communication medium may be susceptible to noise signals. If the magnitude of the noise signals exceeds a certain degree, the requesting node <b>105</b> may erroneously detect the response ready signal. Erroneous detection of the response ready signal causes the requesting node <b>105</b> to receive an erroneous response.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The likelihood of erroneous detection of the ready signal can be significantly reduced by logic <b>115</b>, which is proximate to the requesting node <b>105</b> or incorporated therein, that signals the requesting node <b>105</b> when the response is ready. It is noted that the response is generated as a result of the request. Accordingly, a legitimate response ready signal will occur within substantially the same period of time as the delayed request. Therefore the logic receives the response ready signal and the request signal. If the response ready signal and the delayed request signal are within substantially the same period of time, the logic will transmit another signal to the requesting node <b>105</b> indicating that the response is ready.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The period of time during which the request and the response ready signal arrive in order for the logic to transmit the another signal, can be predetermined or programmable based on response times that are empirically measured.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is illustrated a signal flow diagram describing the operation of the nodes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The requesting node <b>105</b> transmits a request <b>205</b> to the responding node <b>110</b>. The request <b>205</b> is also received at logic <b>115</b>. Responsive thereto, the responding node <b>110</b> generates a response. The responding node <b>110</b> transmits a response ready signal <b>210</b> indicating that the response is ready, and the response <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The response ready signal <b>210</b> is also received at the logic <b>115</b>. In the case where the response ready signal <b>210</b> and the delayed request <b>205</b> are received within substantially the same period of time, the logic transmits another signal <b>220</b> to the requesting node <b>205</b>, indicating that the response <b>215</b> is ready. Upon receiving the signal <b>220</b>, the requesting node <b>105</b> accepts the response (action <b>225</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an exemplary embodiment, the foregoing can be incorporated into a DDR-SDRAM memory reading system. A memory controller and a memory module are typically implemented as separate integrated circuits. The integrated circuits are fused to a motherboard and conduct read and write transactions over a printed circuit, connecting the memory module and the memory controller.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Printed circuits are susceptible to noise signals. Noise signals can be caused by a number of different factors, such as cross-talk, simultaneous switching noise and ground bounce. If the magnitude of the noise signals exceed the predetermined voltage, the memory controller might erroneously detect a response ready signal and read erroneous signals as data.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is illustrated a block diagram describing a circuit <b>300</b> for transferring data in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The circuit <b>300</b> includes a memory controller <b>305</b> and a DDR-SDRAM memory module <b>310</b>. The memory controller <b>305</b> controls access to and from the memory module <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the case of a read transaction, the memory controller <b>305</b> transmits a request to read data at a particular address in the memory module <b>310</b>. The response from the memory module can require a variable amount of time. When the memory module <b>310</b> responds to a read request, the memory module transmits the data at the address, with a data strobe signal (DQS). The DQS indicates that the data is transmitted. The DQS signal toggles with each packet of data transmitted by the DDR-SDRAM.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The requesting node <b>305</b> and the responding node <b>310</b> are affixed to a motherboard <b>312</b> comprising any number of printed circuits. The requesting node <b>305</b> and the responding node <b>310</b> communicate the foregoing signals via several of the printed circuits. As noted above, printed circuits are susceptible to noise signals from a variety of sources. If the magnitude of the noise signals exceeds a certain degree, the printed circuit may simulate an erroneous DQS signal. If the DQS signal is received directly by the memory controller <b>305</b>, the memory controller <b>305</b> may erroneously detect a DQS signal and read erroneous data.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To significantly reduce this possibility, logic <b>315</b> receives the DQS signal. It is noted that the DQS signal is transmitted as a result of the request for a read transaction. Accordingly, a legitimate DQS signal will occur within substantially the same period of time as the read request. Therefore the logic receives the read request and the DQS signal. If the DQS signal and the delayed read request signal are within substantially the same period of time, the logic will transmit another signal to the memory controller <b>305</b> indicating that the data is ready.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is illustrated a block diagram describing the memory controller <b>305</b> configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The memory controller <b>305</b> comprises a sequencer core <b>405</b> and a queue <b>410</b>. During a read transaction, the sequencer core <b>405</b> transmits the read request to the logic <b>315</b> and the memory module <b>310</b>. The queue <b>410</b> receives the output of the logic <b>315</b> and the data signals. The queue <b>410</b> registers the data signals on the rising and falling edges of the output of logic <b>315</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is illustrated a block diagram of the logic <b>315</b>. The logic <b>315</b> receives the DQS signal from the memory module <b>310</b>. Due to the presence of noise signals, the logic <b>315</b> prevents detection of erroneous DQS signals at the memory controller <b>305</b>. As noted, the DQS signal is transmitted in response to the read request transaction. Accordingly, a legitimate DQS signal is transmitted between a first and second time following transmission of the read request. The first time is the shortest possible response time to a read request, such as one clock cycle. The second time is the longest possible response time to a read request. Therefore, the logic <b>315</b> distinguishes legitimate DQS signals from erroneous DQS signals by examining the timing relationship of the DQS signal with a read request.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If the DQS signal is received between the first and second times after a read request, the DQS signal is legitimate and the logic <b>315</b> transmits another signal to the memory controller <b>305</b>. The signal transmitted by the logic <b>315</b> causes the memory controller <b>305</b> to read the data signals. If the DQS signal is not received between the first and second times after a read request, the DQS signal is erroneous and the logic <b>315</b> does not transmit a signal to the memory controller <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The logic <b>315</b> includes an AND gate <b>505</b>, an OR gate <b>510</b>, a first numerically controlled delay logic (NCDL) <b>520</b>, and a second NCDL <b>515</b>. The logic receives the DQS signal at the AND gate <b>505</b>. The output of the logic <b>315</b> is the output of the AND gate <b>505</b>. The output of the AND gate <b>505</b> is a “0”, except between the first time and the second time following a read request. Between the first time and the second time following the read request, the output of the AND gate is the logical value of the DQS signal. However, outside of the first time and the second time, the output of the AND gate remains “0”, regardless of the logical value of the DQS signal. In the foregoing manner, the logic <b>315</b> prevents erroneous detection of DQS signals by the memory controller <b>305</b>. As the difference between the first time and the second time can be wider than the read request signal width, the logic <b>315</b> uses two NCDLs to individually control the rising and falling edges of the signal that gates the DQS signal.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Another input to the AND gate <b>505</b> is connected to the output of the OR gate <b>510</b>. The output of the OR gate <b>510</b> is set between the first time and the second time following a read request. The first NCDL <b>520</b> receives the read request and delays the read request until the first time. At the first time, the first NCDL <b>520</b> propagates the read request signal to the OR gate <b>510</b>. When the OR gate <b>510</b> receives the propagated read request signal from the first NCDL <b>520</b>, the OR gate <b>510</b> outputs a logical “1”. The output of the first NCDL <b>520</b> is also input to the second NCDL <b>515</b>. The second NCDL <b>515</b> delays the output of the first NCDL <b>520</b> until the second time. At the second time, the second NCDL <b>515</b> propagates the falling edge output of the first NCDL <b>520</b> to the OR gate <b>510</b>. Responsive thereto, the OR gate <b>510</b> generates a “0” output.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is illustrated a timing diagram describing operations of the logic <b>315</b>. At time, t=1, the memory controller <b>305</b> transmits a read request to the memory module <b>310</b>. The read request is also received at the first NCDL <b>520</b>. The first NCDL <b>520</b> delays the signal until the first time after the read request, t=2. At t=2, the first NCDL <b>520</b> propagates the rising edge of the signal to the OR gate <b>510</b>, causing the OR gate <b>510</b> to generate a logical “1” output. The logical “1” is received by the AND gate <b>505</b>. Upon receiving the logical “1” from the OR gate <b>510</b>, the output of the AND gate <b>505</b> is equivalent to the DQS signal. At t=3, the DQS signal transmitted by the memory module is received by the AND gate <b>505</b>. Responsive thereto, the AND gate <b>505</b> transmits a logical “1” signal. The output of the AND gate <b>505</b> is the output of the logic <b>315</b> that is provided to the memory controller <b>305</b>, and indicates that the data is ready to be received.</p>
