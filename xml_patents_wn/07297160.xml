<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Hydrophilic, arylsiloxy-containing macromonomers have at least a terminal hydrophilic group attached to an arylsiloxy group. The aryl groups attached to siloxy groups can be substituted with other hydrophilic groups. Polymers comprising such hydrophilic, arylsiloxy-containing macromonomers avoid or reduce the risk of forming vacuoles of absorbed water.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to high refractive-index, hydrophilic, arylsiloxy-containing monomers, macromonomers, and polymers, and ophthalmic devices comprising such polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Since the 1940s ophthalmic devices in the form of intraocular lens (“IOL”) implants have been utilized as replacements for diseased or damaged natural ocular lenses. In most cases, an intraocular lens is implanted within an eye at the time of surgically removing the diseased or damaged natural lens, such as for example, in the case of cataracts. For decades, the preferred material for fabricating such intraocular lens implants was poly(methyl methacrylate), which is a rigid, glassy polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Softer, more flexible IOL implants have gained in popularity in more recent years due to their ability to be compressed, folded, rolled or otherwise deformed. Such softer IOL implants may be deformed prior to insertion thereof through an incision in the cornea of an eye. Following insertion of the IOL in an eye, the IOL returns to its original pre-deformed shape due to the memory characteristics of the soft material. Softer, more flexible IOL implants as just described may be implanted into an eye through an incision that is much smaller, i.e., less than 4.0 mm, than that necessary for more rigid IOLs, i.e., 5.5 to 7.0 mm. A larger incision is necessary for more rigid IOL implants because the lens must be inserted through an incision in the cornea slightly larger than the diameter of the inflexible IOL optic portion. Accordingly, more rigid IOL implants have become less popular in the market since larger incisions have been found to be associated with an increased incidence of postoperative complications, such as induced astigmatism.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With recent advances in small-incision cataract surgery, increased emphasis has been placed on developing soft, foldable materials suitable for use in artificial IOL implants. In general, the materials of current commercial IOLs fall into one of three general categories: silicones, hydrophilic acrylics and hydrophobic acrylics.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, high water content hydrophilic acrylics, or “hydrogels,” have relatively low refractive indices, making them less desirable than other materials with respect to minimal incision size. Low refractive-index materials require a thicker IOL optic portion to achieve a given refractive power. Silicone materials may have a higher refractive index than high-water content hydrogels, but some particular silicone materials tend to unfold explosively after being placed in the eye in a folded position. Explosive unfolding can potentially damage the corneal endothelium and/or rupture the natural lens capsule and associated zonules. Low glass-transition-temperature hydrophobic acrylic materials are desirable because they typically have a high refractive index and unfold more slowly and more controllably than silicone materials. Unfortunately, low glass-transition-temperature hydrophobic acrylic materials, which contain little or no water initially, tend to absorb water over time and form pockets of water or vacuoles in vivo, causing light reflections or “glistenings.” Furthermore, it may be difficult to achieve ideal folding and unfolding characteristics due to the temperature sensitivity of some acrylic polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Because of the noted shortcomings of current polymeric materials available for use in the manufacture of ophthalmic implants, there is a need for stable, biocompatible polymeric materials having desirable physical characteristics and refractive indices.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In general, the present invention provides hydrophilic, siloxy-containing monomers and macromonomers having high refractive indices and polymeric compositions comprising such monomers or macromonomers. A monomer or a macromonomer of the present invention has at least a polymerizable functional group, at least an aryl group, and at least a hydrophilic group, each attached directly or indirectly to a silicon atom of a siloxy group. A hydrophilic group can be attached indirectly to a silicon atom through a linking group that can comprise other hydrophobic or hydrophilic groups or a combination thereof. A hydrophilic group also can be attached through another siloxy group. The polymeric compositions of the present invention have refractive index of about 1.4 or greater. In some embodiments, the refractive index is in the range from about 1.4 to about 1.7. In some other embodiments, the refractive index is in the range from about 1.45 to about 1.6.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one aspect, a polymeric composition of the present invention has an equilibrium water content of greater than about 4.5 percent (by weight), thus avoiding problems related to the formation of water vacuoles. In addition, a polymeric composition of the present invention can have a relatively high elongation, such as about 80 percent or greater. Accordingly, in many aspects, the subject polymeric compositions are more suitable for use in the manufacture of ophthalmic devices than many prior-art polymeric materials.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Current commercial hydrophobic acrylic-based ophthalmic products have water content less than 4.5 percent by weight. These hydrophobic products tend to absorb water over time in vivo and form water vacuoles or “glistenings.” In contrast, a polymeric composition comprising units of hydrophilic, arylsiloxy-containing monomers or macromonomers of the present invention tend to absorb water rapidly to equilibrium level. Although applicants do not wish to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the absorbed water also is distributed throughout the polymeric composition because of its association with the hydrophilic substituents in the aromatic monomers. Therefore, polymeric compositions of the present invention do not present the risk of formation of water vacuoles in vivo.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The polymeric compositions of the present invention are transparent, flexible, of relatively high refractive index and of relatively high elongation. The polymeric compositions of the present invention with the desirable physical properties noted above are particularly useful in the manufacture of ophthalmic devices such as, but not limited to, relatively thin, foldable IOLs, contact lenses, corneal rings, corneal inlays, and keratoprostheses. Furthermore, absorbed water in the polymeric compositions of the present invention does not tend to form water vacuoles. Thus, the polymeric compositions of the present invention are more advantageously used in ophthalmic device applications than prior-art acrylic compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">IOLs having relatively thin optic portions are critical in enabling a surgeon to minimize surgical incision size. Keeping the surgical incision size to a minimum reduces intraoperative trauma and postoperative complications. A relatively thin IOL optic portion is also critical for accommodating certain anatomical locations in the eye such as the anterior chamber and the ciliary sulcus. IOLs may be placed in the anterior chamber for increasing visual acuity in either aphakic or phakic eyes, or placed in the ciliary sulcus for increasing visual acuity in phakic eyes.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The polymeric compositions of the present invention have the flexibility required to allow implants manufactured from the same to be folded or deformed for insertion into an eye through the smallest possible surgical incision, i.e., 3.5 mm or smaller.</p>
