<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a method for the production of filter-tipped cigarettes from tobacco rods, which are severed centrally during transportation to produce part-rods, the part-rods being moved apart, and being connected by means of wrapping paper to a filter piece and cigarette units thus formed being severed centrally in the region of the filter piece. The invention also relates to an apparatus for carrying out the method.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The production or finishing of filter-tipped cigarettes takes place in the area of a filter attachment machine. The latter comprises a number of cylinders with troughs arranged on the circumference. The abovementioned process steps for the production of the filter-tipped cigarettes are performed in the area of these troughed cylinders.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to improve the production of filter-tipped cigarettes in the area of the filter attachment machine by simplifying the design of the said machine and by increasing output.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to achieve this object, the method according to the invention is characterized by the following features:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">a) the tobacco rods or the part-rods are fed to a main cylinder and transported by the latter,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">b) the part-rods are moved to a distance apart from one another by axial displacement during transportation on the main cylinder,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">c) filter pieces are fed to the main cylinder by a filter cylinder disposed adjacently to the main cylinder and are inserted into a gap formed between the part-rods,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0010">d) the (two) mutually assigned part-rods, each with one filter piece, are removed from the main cylinder and transported outside the region thereof, during which they are joined together and connected to one another by means of wrapping paper, and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0011">e) cigarette units thus formed are returned to the main cylinder and, during further transportation on the main cylinder, are severed centrally in the region of the filter pieces to form filter-tipped cigarettes.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0012">In accordance with this method according to the invention, the central main cylinder is the conveyor member for the parts of the filter-tipped cigarettes until the completion thereof, with the proviso that the joining of the tobacco rods to, in each case, one (double-length) filter piece takes place outside the area of the main cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0013">The apparatus according to the invention for the production of filter-tipped cigarettes comprises, in the area of the main cylinder, supports for a number of troughs, specifically segments or sliding segments. These can be moved with the troughs and the tobacco rods or filter-tipped cigarettes disposed therein in a direction parallel to the axis, in particular moved apart, in order to move parts of the filter-tipped cigarettes or pairs of filter-tipped cigarettes to a distance apart from one another. Therefore, according to the invention, every two coinciding sliding segments are assigned to one another in the axial direction of the main drum and can be moved (simultaneously) in one or other direction parallel to the axis. The entire circumference, or a shell, of the main cylinder consists of such sliding segments, in each case having a number of troughs to receive the parts of the filter-tipped cigarettes.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0014">An important special feature resides in measures for the simple adjustment of the apparatus, specifically of the main cylinder in particular, for the production of filter-tipped cigarettes of different dimensions, especially with filters or filter pieces of different lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0015">Adjustment to such changes of format takes place, according to the invention, by a simple adjustment of members or the insertion of spacers, stops or the like, which‚Äîindependently of predetermined amplitudes of movement of the sliding segments‚Äîdetermine the gap to be created between two mutually assigned tobacco rods in accordance with the length of the filter piece to be inserted.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">The apparatus diagrammatically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> forms part of a cigarette production machine. The central element is a main cylinder <b>10</b>. Assigned to this are a plurality of secondary cylinders, which lead, in a direction parallel to the axis, to the circumference of the main cylinder <b>10</b>. They are a feed cylinder <b>11</b>, a filter cylinder <b>12</b>, a return cylinder <b>13</b> and a removal cylinder <b>14</b>. The individual production phases are shown symbolically and assigned to the appropriate areas of the main cylinder <b>10</b> and/or other conveying members.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">According to the illustration, tobacco rods <b>15</b> cut from a tobacco tow are passed to the main cylinder <b>10</b> by the feed cylinder <b>11</b>. In the present example of embodiment, the tobacco rods <b>15</b> have already been severed centrally in a previous working stroke, two part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> of the same length being formed. These are initially transported in troughs <b>18</b> of the feed cylinder <b>11</b> and then received by troughs of the main cylinder <b>10</b>, specifically segment troughs <b>19</b>, <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">During the transportation of the tobacco rods <b>15</b> by the main cylinder <b>10</b> to the filter cylinder <b>12</b>, the part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> are moved apart in the axial direction, forming a gap between the two part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). A (double-length) filter piece <b>21</b> is inserted into this gap. This is prepared separately and fed in by the filter cylinder <b>12</b>, which is likewise equipped with troughs <b>18</b>, to the circumference of the main cylinder <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0029">A special feature of the apparatus resides in the fact that it is only in the region where the main cylinder <b>10</b> and filter cylinder <b>12</b> are adjacent that the filter pieces <b>21</b> enter the segment troughs <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> of the main cylinder <b>10</b>. Immediately thereafter, the filter cylinder <b>12</b> again picks up each pair of mutually assigned part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, together with a filter piece <b>21</b>, from the main cylinder <b>10</b>, and transports these parts until they are delivered to a conveyor (not shown in detail). In the region of the latter, the part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> are initially brought into contact with the assigned filter piece <b>21</b>. Thereafter, during transportation outside the main cylinder <b>10</b>, the connection between these elements is formed, this being done by a wrapping paper <b>22</b>, which is laid around the parts to be connected to one another. The cigarette units <b>23</b> thus formed are conveyed back by the return cylinder into the main cylinder <b>10</b> and laid down in the segment troughs <b>19</b>, <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0030">During the transportation of the cigarette units <b>23</b> on the main cylinder <b>10</b>, which now follows, a severing cut is made centrally in the region of the filter pieces <b>21</b>, this being done by a severing blade <b>24</b> assigned to the main cylinder <b>10</b>. As a result, (finished) filter-tipped cigarettes <b>25</b> are formed, with filters <b>26</b> facing one another. The filter-tipped cigarettes <b>25</b> are transported onwards‚Äîthe distance between them being increased‚Äîby the main cylinder <b>10</b> to the removal cylinder <b>14</b>, which takes over and removes the filter-tipped cigarettes <b>25</b> in pairs. The emptied segment troughs <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> are now free to receive the tobacco rods <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0031">The main cylinder <b>10</b> is configured in a special manner, specifically with supports for the troughs, these being sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, disposed on the outer circumference, movable parallel to the axis and assigned to one another in pairs. The sliding segments are displaceably mounted on support bars <b>29</b> and are controlled, in particular, by cams disposed within the main cylinder <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0032">A circumferential segment ring <b>30</b> is attached as an immovable member between the mutually assigned sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>. The support bars <b>29</b> are connected to the segment ring <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0033">The sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> comprise a number of segment troughs <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> disposed side by side at a short distance apart from one another and oriented in the same direction. The segment troughs <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> contain drilled holes <b>31</b>, which are connected to a vacuum source, so that a vacuum prevails in the troughs or segment troughs <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> to secure the tobacco rods <b>15</b> and cigarette units <b>23</b> or filter-tipped cigarettes <b>25</b>. The segment troughs <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> are continued by annular troughs <b>32</b> in the segment ring <b>30</b>. When sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> lie against the segment ring <b>30</b>, continuous troughs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, bottom) are formed, for example to receive tobacco rods <b>15</b> or part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>. The annular troughs <b>32</b> are also provided with drilled holes <b>33</b> which are connected to a vacuum source and‚Äîindependently of the drilled holes <b>31</b>‚Äîcan be subjected to the action of suction air.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0034">The filter pieces <b>21</b> are laid against the circumference of the main cylinder <b>10</b> in the region of the segment ring <b>30</b> and are fixed. The severing cut is additionally made in the region of the segment ring <b>30</b> by the severing blade <b>24</b>. For this purpose, the segment ring <b>30</b> has a central groove <b>34</b> into which the severing blade <b>24</b> enters when performing the severing cut.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0035">The sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> permit the displacement (by groups) of elements for the production of the filter-tipped cigarettes <b>25</b>, specifically, first the movement apart of the part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and then the movement apart of the filter-tipped cigarettes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The distance of the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> from one another determines the gap between the part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> and the filter-tipped cigarettes <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0036">A special feature resides in the fact that, during the transportation of the part-rods <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> with filter piece <b>21</b> and of the formed cigarette units <b>23</b> outside the area of the main cylinder <b>10</b>, specifically above the latter, the moved-apart sliding segments <b>27</b> are moved back again to a lesser distance apart from one another or until they rest upon the segment ring <b>30</b>, in other words in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, top. In this position, the finished cigarette units <b>23</b> can again be laid on the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0037">A special feature is the adaptability of the apparatus to different dimensions of the filter pieces <b>21</b> or filters <b>26</b>, or of the part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, without any retooling of the main cylinder or of a transmission. In the example of embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the procedure followed is that the parts resting in the segment troughs <b>19</b>, <b>20</b>, especially part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, are moved against stops which determine the relative position in accordance with the respective dimensions of the processed elements. The sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> are set by gearing to a format-independent amplitude of movement. This corresponds to a maximum dimension of filter-tipped cigarettes <b>25</b>. The parts resting in the segment troughs <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> are stopped by adjustable spacers at the correct position for the format, irrespective of the movement of the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0038">The spacers in this example of embodiment are (cylindrical) spacer bolts <b>35</b>, which enter from both sides into the troughs, specifically segment troughs <b>19</b>, <b>20</b>, of the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>. The spacer bolts <b>35</b>, of equal length and disposed on both sides of the main cylinder <b>10</b>, lie with their axes aligned with the axes of the segment troughs <b>19</b> and, on movement of the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> outwards, enter into these segment troughs <b>19</b>. End surfaces of the part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> run against the ends of the spacer bolts <b>35</b> and are held in the desired relative position when the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> continue moving (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, top). This position of the part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> produces a gap formed between them in accordance with the length of the filter piece <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0039">A format change is performed without replacement of the spacer bolts <b>35</b> themselves but by changing the relative position thereof in the direction parallel to the axis. For this purpose, the spacer bolts <b>35</b> are connected to support rings <b>36</b> on both sides of the main cylinder <b>10</b>. These, in turn, are displaceably attached to outer fixed rings <b>37</b> as part of a support frame of the main cylinder <b>10</b>. The support rings <b>36</b> can be adjusted. As a result of the insertion of a spacer <b>38</b> between support ring <b>36</b> and fixed ring <b>37</b>, an axial displacement of the spacer bolts <b>35</b> takes place. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, right, shows a position with shorter part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> or shorter filter pieces <b>21</b>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, left, permits the longer embodiment, specifically larger gaps between the part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0040">The spacer bolts <b>35</b> cause interference in the region in which filter-tipped cigarettes <b>25</b> are being conveyed in the segment troughs <b>19</b>, <b>20</b>, because the filter-tipped cigarettes <b>25</b> have to be moved to a relatively long distance apart from one another (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, bottom). For this purpose, the segment troughs <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> of the main cylinder <b>10</b> are disposed at a short, minimal distance from one another, which corresponds to half the distance between the troughs <b>18</b> of the feed cylinder <b>11</b>, filter cylinder <b>12</b>, return cylinder <b>13</b> and removal cylinder <b>14</b>. The relative position of the conveying members is selected to be such that the tobacco rods <b>15</b> or part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> are laid in first segment troughs <b>19</b>. Spacer bolts <b>35</b> disposed at the appropriate distance apart from one another are assigned to these first segment troughs <b>19</b>. The second segment troughs <b>20</b> remain free in this region of the main cylinder <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). When the cigarette units <b>23</b> are returned to the main cylinder by the return cylinder <b>13</b>, the relative position of the troughs <b>18</b> on the return cylinder <b>13</b> ensures that the cigarette units <b>23</b> are laid in the (second) segment troughs <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). These lie in the region between the spacer bolts <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0041">The operations described are also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. It can be seen that, in each case, only every second (segment) trough of the main cylinder <b>10</b> is charged by the feed cylinder <b>11</b> and the return cylinder <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0042">The spacer bolts <b>35</b> expediently have a particular cross section, which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The spacer bolts <b>35</b> of round cross section have a larger cross section than corresponds to the diameter of the segment troughs <b>19</b>, <b>20</b>, to provide better support for the part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>. The lower cross-sectional region, which enters into the troughs, is provided with a semi-circular cut-out <b>39</b>, so that the spacer bolts <b>35</b> extend within the troughs at a distance apart from the circular-surface-shaped bases of the troughs.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0043">A special alternative for easier adaptability of the apparatus to different cigarette formats is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b</i>. The aim here is to change the relative position of the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> in their starting position, with the proviso that, with unchanged amplitudes of movement, different end positions of the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> are obtained, with adaptation to the current cigarette format. The illustration in the drawing has been selected so that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>, etc., each show comparative views of a sliding segment <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> for cigarettes of different lengths in various positions, whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>, etc. show diagrammatically the position on the main cylinder <b>10</b> corresponding to the selected position of the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, in other words the current associated phase of production. The thick line here indicates the conveying path of the elements of the filter-tipped cigarettes <b>25</b> or of the cigarettes themselves. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a </i>show phases in the region between the feed cylinder <b>11</b> and the filter cylinder <b>12</b>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>a </i>to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a </i>refer to the production section following the return cylinder <b>13</b> as far as the provision of the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> in the region of the feed cylinder <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0044">The sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> can be controlled in respect of their movement by a control curve or control groove <b>40</b>. A sensor member, specifically a roller <b>41</b>, connected to the sliding segment <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> enters into the control groove <b>40</b>, drawn in a simplified style as a continuous track. The roller <b>41</b> is connected to the sliding segment <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> via a push-and-pull member, specifically via a bar <b>42</b>. The sliding segment <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> is adjustable relative to the bar <b>42</b>, for the purpose of creating a different starting position. To this end, as is shown diagrammatically, a head <b>43</b> connected to the bar <b>42</b> in a recess <b>44</b> of the sliding segment <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> is adjustable, specifically against the loading of a spring, specifically a compression spring <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">In the production of cigarettes of normal length, or with the conventional length of the filter piece <b>21</b>, the compression spring <b>45</b> is relaxed. The head <b>43</b> lies against an end wall of the recess <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>, etc., bottom in each case). The sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, in the production of a cigarette of this type, lie against the fixed segment ring <b>30</b> in the starting position.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">The upper illustration in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>, etc. shows an alternative for the processing of shorter filter pieces <b>21</b>, in other words an alternative in which a smaller gap is created between the part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>. This is achieved in that, in the starting position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>, top), the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> are already displaced towards the end position. This is brought about by the insertion of a spacer <b>46</b> between the sliding segment <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> on the one hand and the segment ring <b>30</b> on the other. The effect of this is that the sliding segment <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, in the starting position, is at a distance apart from the segment ring <b>30</b>, in other words it has already completed a first section of its movement towards the lateral end position. In this case, the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> are also displaced relative to the bar <b>42</b> of uniform length, this occurring with compression of the compression spring <b>45</b>. The tobacco rods <b>15</b> or part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> are‚Äîirrespective of the length of the filter piece <b>21</b>‚Äîalways laid in the same position, specifically centrally relative to the segment ring <b>30</b>. In the course of the subsequent movement apart of the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, the movement operation for the lower example in each of the drawings, in other words without a spacer <b>46</b>, begins immediately because the movement of the bar <b>42</b> is transmitted directly to the sliding segment <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>. When the spacer <b>46</b> is used, the free space within the recess <b>44</b> is first overcome during the movement of the bar <b>42</b>, until the head <b>43</b> rests on the end wall of the recess <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>, top). At this point, in this embodiment also, the displacement of the sliding segment <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> parallel to the axis begins, this movement leading to the end position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>. This corresponds to the position of the part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> for the insertion of the filter piece <b>21</b>. As is apparent, a shorter distance is created in the upper illustration than in the lower embodiment without a spacer <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047">The movements following the return of the cigarette units <b>23</b> to the main cylinder <b>10</b> take place in a similar manner. The upper illustration in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>a</i>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>a </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a </i>shows the embodiment with a spacer <b>46</b>, in other words with a shorter filter piece <b>21</b> or shorter filter <b>26</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>a</i>, specifically in the region where the cigarette units <b>23</b> finished elsewhere are received, the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> are located in the same position, this being caused by an appropriate configuration of the control groove <b>40</b>. After the severing cut in the region of the filter piece <b>21</b>, the filter-tipped cigarettes <b>25</b> formed are moved apart as far as the end position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>a</i>. In this case, the filter-tipped cigarettes <b>25</b> are at the same distance apart from one another‚Äîirrespective of the length of the filter <b>26</b>. After the filter-tipped cigarettes <b>25</b> have been taken over by the removal cylinder <b>14</b>, the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> are moved back into the starting position to take over tobacco rods <b>15</b> or part-rods <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a</i>. The sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> provided with the spacer <b>46</b> are in this case moved by the bar <b>42</b> only until the spacer <b>46</b> comes to rest on the segment ring <b>30</b>. The further displacement of the bar <b>42</b> is absorbed by the compression spring <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a</i>, top).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048">In this solution for adaptation to different dimensions of cigarettes or filter pieces <b>21</b>, the main cylinder <b>10</b> and the sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> are configured with the same trough division as the assigned cylinders, in other words the feed cylinder <b>11</b>, the filter cylinder <b>12</b>, etc. The sliding segments <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> merely exhibit segment troughs <b>19</b> at the same distance apart as the troughs <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).</p>
