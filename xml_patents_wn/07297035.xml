<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to transom-mounted outboard motors for small marine watercraft and more particularly to air-cooled engines having belt driven propeller shafts for shallow draft watercraft.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">GENERAL BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Small marine craft operating primarily in shallow water are often referred to as mud boats. Such boats are usually shallow draft flat bottom boats powered by in-board air cooled engines with outboard drives adapted to pass through the hull or transom for coupling to the engine, as disclosed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 941,827, 3,752,111 and 4,726,796.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some cases small air cooled engines have been adapted for fixed attachment to a boat's transom for pivotal steering in the horizontal plane, with an extended drive shaft extending rearwardly to just below the water line at an angle of approximately 30 degrees as illustrated by Foreman in U.S. Pat. No. 6,302,750.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other patents, such as Carter, et al. in U.S. Des. 259,488 illustrate the use of an air cooled engine pivotally mountable to the boat's transom with the same elongated drive shaft extending to just below the waterline perhaps at a somewhat greater angle, depending on the height of the transom. In most cases the drives are designed not to extend below the bottom of the hull.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Lais et al. and others disclose the use of electric motors in combination with a belt drive to maneuver small craft as is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,336,119 and 1,953,599. Obviously, such drives are not intended for high speed or for extended powering through mud or vegetation in shallow water.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The use of air cooled or water cooled marine engines coupled by belt to a transom mounted drive unit are well known within the art as being a most efficient means for driving a propeller shaft thereby reducing friction and improving mechanical advantage over right angle gear drives. Therefore, the use of a belt drive in combination with an air cooled engines as disclosed by Pignata in U.S. Pat. No. 5,435,763 seems to be an obvious choice. However, Pignata utilizes a unique internal propeller arrangement and with a through the transom coupling for an inboard air-cooled engine with pivotal kick-up capability or over the top of the transom arrangement. However, Pignata fails to fully disclose how either such arrangement may be steered effectively. While the Pignata apparatus may be useful in open water, it is far from obvious that it could be adapted for use in shallow water marsh with heavy mud and vegetation. The internal propeller housing must be located below the boat hull for water to be drawn effectively through the internal propeller blades. Therefore, if the propeller housing were above the bottom of the boat's hull, water flow would be blocked, Shallow draft boats are known to create a depression at speed for some distance directly behind the transom. It is therefore essential that the propeller shaft extend below the boat hull or beyond the water depression to make sufficient contact with the water to provide thrust and prevent cavitations.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Mud boats rely a great deal on propeller contact with the mud and the propeller's ability to cut the vegetation to help drive the boat. Hence the concept of having an elongated drive shaft extending at a shallow angle from above a boat's transom to just below the water surface has long been the excepted practice for mud boats. However, the use of a fixed inboard engine with a through transom coupling limits the apparatus to a particular boat and therefore may not be removed and mounted on another boat without extensive modifications. The use of a removable over the transom mounted air cooled engine with extended drive shaft is awkward and often limited to a relatively low horsepower engines. There is obviously a need to provide a relatively high horsepower air cooled engines adapted to an efficient belt drive for mounting to small, flat bottom boats in much the same manner as water cooled outboard engines. Such a driver must also be equipped with a foot that does not extend below the bottom of the boat but extends a sufficient distance behind the boat to insure the proper angle of attack when the propeller is in contact with mud and vegetation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The use of a wide variety of commercially available air-cooled engines with 50 horsepower or more presents a wide range of problems that must be addressed and that are not encountered by conventionally manufactured outboard engine manufactures. By not manufacturing the engine, the drive must be adaptable to multiple engine configurations and drive train configurations. The weight of the engines must be considered and balanced in regard to the drive. Unique pivotal adjustments are necessary to insure safety and proper angles of attack at various speeds. The use of transmissions and clutches must also be considered in an attempt to reduce weight and cost. Conventional drives are inadequate due the constant inter-reaction with debris and mud including stumps and rocks. Therefore, consideration must be given to special propellers and their couplings when used as solids conveying means. Contact with underwater objects is a serious safety problem with mud boat drives since the engine can kick up or sideways causing serious harm to the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It should be understood that a distinction should be made between air cooled engines utilizing a fully enclosed, self contained, circulating water system and water cooled marine engines that utilize the water in which they are submersed, for cooling. Some air cooled marine outboard engines have also been developed. However, for the purpose of this application air cooled engines used as an outboard drive are considered to be both air and self-contained water-cooled engines generally used for inboard drive engines or utility applications other than marine.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A relatively high horsepower air-cooled engine in one embodiment of this invention is adapted to an efficient belt drive assembly capable of being transom mounted to small flat bottom boats in much the same manner as conventional outboard engines. The drive is equipped with a lower drive shaft that does not extend below the bottom of the boat but extends a sufficient distance behind the boat to insure contact with the water for conventional propulsion. A unique pivotal arrangement allows the engine and drive assembly to be positioned for proper angle of attack when the propeller is in contact with mud and vegetation below the bottom of the boat. This arrangement allows for a much shorter turning radius than can be achieved by the related prior art transom mounted mud motor systems. The engine mount includes incremental tilt positioning capability and a pivotal horizontal steering handle. The propeller is capable of providing propulsion when in contact with solids such as mud and vegetation, and provides relatively fast hull speed in deep water. A clutch is provided to disengage the engine from the drive and an electric drive motor is provided in contact with the belt drive for turning the drive in a reverse direction.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The preferred embodiment <b>10</b> of the portable outboard drive assembly <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> utilizes a mounting bracket assembly comprising a conventional mounting bracket <b>14</b> for attaching the outboard drive assembly <b>12</b> to a boat's hull at transom <b>16</b>. The drive assembly <b>12</b> consisting principally of any number of commercially available air-cooled or self-contained water cooled utility engine assemblies <b>18</b> adaptively mounted to the frame assembly <b>20</b> at engine mounting plate <b>19</b>. The engines are connected by way of clutch and or transmission assemblies located within the transmission housing <b>22</b>, to a timing belt and gear drive assembly, also referred to herein as the upper drive assembly and lower driven assembly, located within the elongated vertical housing <b>24</b>, to which is connected the output drive shaft assembly located within the shaft housing <b>26</b> as previously discussed in at least our prior application Ser. No. 10/662,487, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Shaft housing <b>26</b> extends in excess of 18 inches beyond vertical housing <b>24</b>. The upper drive assembly and the lower driven assembly further include respective timing pulleys operatively connected to a timing belt unobstructed or acted upon by other bodies, the pulleys and belt together forming a timing belt drive gear, <b>104</b>. In this case, the frame assembly <b>20</b> and vertical housing <b>24</b> are adaptively mounted in a pivotal and rotative manner to the pintle assembly <b>28</b>. This allows the entire drive assembly <b>12</b> to be pivotal about the pin assembly <b>30</b> (also referenced herein as the “first pivoting assembly”) located at the base of the pintle assembly <b>28</b> further disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. This pivoting motion also allows the angle “Φ” of the drive assembly <b>12</b> to be increased relative to the pintle assembly <b>28</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, thus placing the propeller <b>32</b> below hull level <b>34</b>, while still allowing the drive assembly <b>12</b> to be rotated about the central axis <b>36</b> of the pintle assemble <b>28</b>. In addition the pintle assembly <b>28</b> can still be pivoted upwards positioning the propeller clear of the water <b>38</b> or at selected positions established by the pull pin <b>39</b> relative to the transom <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the lower pintle pin assembly <b>30</b> utilizes a pivot block <b>40</b> secured to the pintle assembly <b>28</b>, in a rotative manner about the rod <b>42</b> and is pivotally attached to the vertical housing <b>24</b> by a pair of clevis pad eyes <b>44</b> and a pivoting pin <b>46</b> passing through the pad eyes <b>44</b> and the block <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref><i>a </i>an upper pintle block <b>48</b> is secured to the pintle assembly <b>28</b> in a rotative manner about and by the rod <b>42</b>. The upper block <b>48</b> further includes the spreader plate <b>50</b> secured within the frame <b>20</b> by a pin <b>52</b> extending through slots <b>54</b> on each side of the frame <b>20</b> thus allowing the frame <b>20</b> to be pivotal relative to the pintle assembly <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> the pintle assembly <b>28</b> (also referenced herein as the “pivotal assembly”) further includes a second pivoting assembly formed by the pintle sleeve assembly <b>51</b> that is pivotally connected to the transom bracket <b>14</b> and rotational about pintle pivot pin <b>55</b> secured by a fastener such as a nut <b>57</b>. Further, the spreader plate <b>50</b> is pivotally secured to the pintle block <b>69</b> by a set of studs <b>59</b> when used with the manual positioner assembly <b>70</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. However, an upper pintle block <b>48</b> is used in combination with rod clevis <b>67</b> pin <b>73</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a </i>when used with the linear actuator assembly <b>58</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Generally, over the transom mud boat drive units are positioned by utilizing the extended handle <b>56</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. However, for safety and convenience the ability to pivot the handle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a distinct advantage. However, to achieve this an alternative method must be provided for pivotally positioning the drive assembly <b>12</b> in the vertical plane while using the handle for positioning in the horizontal plane. Two possible methods are illustrated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The first being a linear actuator assembly <b>58</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b>. The actuator assembly <b>58</b> is essentially comprised of an electric motor <b>60</b> a gear reducer <b>62</b> and a linear positioner <b>64</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and better seen in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In this arrangement, the base <b>66</b> of the actuator assembly <b>58</b> is fixed to the frame <b>20</b> while the rod <b>68</b> and its rod eye <b>67</b> member of the linear positioner <b>64</b> is pivotally attached to the pin <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the linear actuator assembly <b>58</b>, when extended positions the drive shaft housing <b>26</b> in a neutral plane whereby the shaft housing is virtually perpendicular to the transom <b>16</b>. Retraction of the positioner <b>64</b> pivots the shaft housing in a negative direction thus forcing the drive shaft <b>26</b> and propeller <b>32</b> below the bottom hull level <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The second positioner being a manual operated locking assembly <b>70</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Looking first at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> we see that the manually operated locking assembly <b>70</b> is simply a lever or handle passing through the frame assembly <b>20</b>, with a ball <b>72</b> at one end and rotatably mounted at the opposite end <b>74</b> to the spreader bar pin <b>52</b> passing though the frame <b>20</b> and spreader plate <b>50</b> in a relatively loose manner. A spring <b>76</b> provides tension on the handle assembly <b>70</b> to insure indentation locking between the series of notches <b>78</b> adjacent the ball <b>72</b> and an edge of the frame <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Looking back at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> we see that laterally moving the handle assembly <b>70</b> away from the spring <b>76</b> releases the frame <b>20</b> by moving the notches <b>78</b> in the handle away from the frame <b>20</b>. Therefore; by manually lifting the throttle handle <b>56</b> while holding the positioning handle <b>70</b> the drive assembly <b>12</b> can be easily tilted to a new position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> the overall length of the drive assembly <b>12</b> is considerably shorter than that of other drives used for this purpose and has a much smaller turning radius than that used by other mud boat drives.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is the dual pivoting provided by a first pivoting assembly at point <b>63</b> and the second pivoting assembly at point <b>61</b> as again shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> that provides the mounting bracket <b>14</b> with dual articulation of the drive <b>12</b> and thus allows the propeller <b>32</b> to be positioned in both a positive and negative draft angle by positioning the elongated drive housing either positively or negatively beyond vertical relative to the mounting bracket in the vertical plane.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The pivotal handle <b>56</b> provides steering and throttle control for the engine assembly <b>18</b> and further utilizes a unique locking mechanism <b>80</b> that allows the handle to be locked in the down position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and be tilted upwards as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Generally, the propeller <b>32</b> is secured to the drive shaft assembly <b>12</b> as shown and discussed previously. However, in some cases it has been found that allowing the propeller to slip or shear a pin in the conventional manner to prevent damage to the propeller and or damage to the drive shaft is not acceptable when the propeller is required to engage solid materials such as mud and grass. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> a more solid connection is recommended. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> the shaft <b>81</b> may be modified as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> by utilizing a hexagonal shape <b>82</b> corresponding to a hexagonal hub located within the propeller <b>32</b>. This prevents any possibility of shearing as a result of an encounter with immovable objects. However, the lower rutter fin <b>84</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> tends to keep such encounters to a minimum.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Another important aspect of the air-cooled engine outboard drive assembly <b>12</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. It has been found that in some cases it is advantageous not to use a transmission and simply utilize the high speed of the engine in a 1:1 ratio. However, this precludes the ability to reverse the drive. To still provide reverse capability, a clutch <b>100</b> is installed in the driveline between the engine output shaft <b>102</b> and the timing belt drive gear <b>104</b>. A D.C. voltage drive motor <b>106</b> is then mounted externally to the drive belt housing <b>24</b> with a gear <b>108</b> meshing with the belt drive gear <b>104</b>. This arrangement allows the belt drive gear <b>104</b> to be put into a neutral state when the clutch <b>100</b> is in engaged thus allowing the drive motor <b>106</b> to turn the belt drive in either direction as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Because many varying and different embodiments may be made within the scope of the inventive concept herein taught, and because many modifications may be made in the embodiments herein detailed in accordance with the descriptive requirement of the law, it is to be understood that the details herein are to be interpreted as illustrative and not in any limiting sense.</p>
