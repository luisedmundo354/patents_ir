<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to an accessory for attaching and detaching materials from a rod without requiring removal of the rod or adding additional hardware, such as hooks or the like, to the fabric.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,186,232, issued on Feb. 16, 1993 (which is fully incorporated herein by reference), discloses and claims an accessory product for easily mounting and detaching a material from a rod without removing the rod. The accessory product is intended for use with hanging or otherwise suspended materials, such as window treatments (window curtains, drapes, etc.), shower curtains, windscreens, towels, and so forth. Such suspended materials (referred to herein as “hanging materials” for brevity) are well known in the art, and are often mounted onto rods.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one system of the prior art, separate devices, such as hooks or clips, are utilized to connect portions of the curtain to the rod. In an alternative system of the prior art, the curtain or drape is mounted by threading a rod through the reinforced holes in that curtain.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As an advance over the prior art products, the '232 patent discloses an accessory invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which allows a curtain or so forth to be attached to a mounting rod without the need for hanging support hooks, clips, and so forth, while also avoiding the need to remove the rod from its supports. The accessory is useful in a large variety of applications, including shower curtains and other household and commercial products. It involves a series of reinforced openings with slits provided between alternating paired sets of holes, thereby allowing the hanging material to be attached over the rod without the need for threading or hooks. Further advances and improvements to the inventions disclosed in the '232 patent are provided herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with the invention, a hanging material such as a curtain (e.g. a window curtain or a shower curtain) or other product is provided with a slit therein for attachment of the hanging material to a fixed rod without removing the rod. In a preferred embodiment, the material has a fastener therein, as well, the slit extending through the fastener. In a further preferred embodiment, the hanging material includes at least one external slit, i.e. a slit, at any angle, which intersects an edge of the hanging material. In a further preferred embodiment, the external slit is one (at any angle) which extends through the inside circumference or inner edge of a fastener at one end and the outer edge of the hanging material at the other end.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention can be used for window treatments, shower curtains, drapery, portieres, room dividers, blinds, accessory tapes, and windscreens, or other hanging items. The fastener, which can be made of a rigid, or semi-rigid material (i.e. a material with some flexibility), is preferably integrated into the hanging material and facilitates the attachment of the material to the rod without the need to remove the rod from its supports. The slit is of any shape or size desired. Further objects and features of the invention will be apparent in conjunction with the drawings and detailed disclosure provided herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONS AND THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus is provided which allows a curtain or so forth to be attached to a mounting rod without the need for using additional support hooks, clips, or like, and while also avoiding the need to remove the rod from its supports.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, openings are provided each having a slit provided therein. In accordance with the invention, the slit can be of any shape or size desired, whether straight, curved, or so forth. Likewise it can be of any width desired, whether a uniform width, or a width which changes over the length of the slit, e.g. in an hourglass shape, as with slit <b>390</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each opening is reinforced with a fastener such as a ring <b>10</b>. Ring <b>10</b> can be made of homo polypropylene, ABS, or other suitable materials. These materials are strong enough to support the various fabrics commonly used for curtains, drapes, and so forth. In addition, they also have excellent memory so that, after being flexed to fit over the rod, the ring automatically springs back to its original position.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As disclosed in the '232 patent, pairs of rings can be provided having a horizontal slit connecting each pair. In a further embodiment of the invention, the hanging product includes at least one external slit therein. By external slit, the present application refers to a slit which passes through the material of the hanging product (and through a ring as well if one is provided) to ultimately exit outside the suspended material <b>20</b>. Examples of external slits are horizontal external slit <b>12</b> and vertical external slit <b>17</b>. Various other examples of external slits are provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The external slit can be in any orientation and, when used in conjunction with a ring, can extend through any position on the ring, whether the “12 o'clock” position, or to 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, or so forth. Rings with external slits can be provided to the hanging product in addition to the horizontally slit rings of the '232 patent, as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, the hanging product can be provided with externally slit rings only.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the embodiment shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the ring <b>10</b> is located within the suspended material <b>20</b> and external slit <b>17</b> extends from the ring and through the suspended material <b>20</b>, exiting at the suspended material <b>20</b>'s edge. In other words, a space of suspended material <b>20</b> exists between the ring <b>10</b> and the outside of the suspended material <b>20</b>, and the external slit extends through that space. Ring <b>10</b>, as with the other rings or fasteners of the present invention can be attached to the hanging product via any desired secure means. For example, the rings can be attached by staking, by sealing, by sewing, by welding, or by using any of the methods of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/150,876, filed Aug. 26, 1999, whose contents are fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment of the invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a closed ring <b>10</b> is provided. The term closed ring refers to the fact that the external slit is normally “closed”—i.e. the two radial edges which form the slit <b>17</b> are pressed together. In this embodiment, the ring has some degree of flexibility, and must be flexed for the slit to open, i.e. for the edges of the slit to move some distance apart. Flexing the ring increases the width of the gap to insert the ring over the rod. The slit extends through the ring until the edge of the hanging product (whether that edge of the hanging product is beyond the edge of the ring or coincides with it as shown in various embodiments below).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an alternate or additional embodiment of the invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an open ring <b>30</b> is provided in the material <b>32</b> for attachment of the hanging product to the rod or bar <b>34</b>. In accordance with this embodiment, ring <b>30</b> is an open ring which is provided with rounded edges <b>36</b>. A space is provided between the edges of the open ring, forming a mouth or gap <b>38</b> which acts as the external slit. Preferably, the gap is approximately 1/16″ to ⅛″ in diameter, although larger or smaller gaps can be used, depending on the application, rod size, and shape. Further preferably, the upper edge of ring <b>30</b> is tangent to the upper edge <b>39</b> of suspended material <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this embodiment, rounded edges <b>36</b> and mouth <b>38</b> form an external slit design which is easier for a person to attach to rod <b>34</b>. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is to be contrasted with the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a closed ring is provided having a radial slit therethrough. The ring is closed in that the slit <b>17</b> consists of a right radial edge and a left radial edge of the ring, those right and left radial edges being pressed against each other. In contrast, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> provides an open ring structure in which a gap exists between the left radial edge <b>36</b><i>a </i>of the ring and the right radial edge <b>36</b><i>b </i>of the ring, radial edges <b>36</b><i>a </i>and <b>36</b><i>b </i>being the edges extending from the outer circumference or outer edge <b>26</b> to the inner circumference or inner edge <b>28</b> of the fastener or ring.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, it is preferred that the radial edges of the open ring be rounded as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Open mouth <b>38</b> and rounded edges <b>36</b> facilitate the attachment of the ring to the rod from below, and further facilitate the attachment of the ring with one hand. These features are of general advantage to all users, and are of particular advantage to those who may be shorter such as children and the handicapped, or who have trouble opening the ring due to problems such as arthritis.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as attached to rod <b>34</b>. In addition to providing ease of attachment, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also provides ease of detachment. Furthermore, as a safety function, if the suspended material is pulled strongly enough from the bottom, the ring and suspended material will easily detach from the rod before pulling the rod out of the wall due to the presence of the wide mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an alternate embodiment of the invention, ring <b>50</b> is elongated in shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>. In the preferred embodiment, the elongated shape is an oval. The elongated shape of the ring facilitates attachment of the ring to a square or rectangular rod. As a result, the embodiment can be utilized with drapes, window treatments, blinds, and so forth. Ring <b>50</b> can include an open mouth <b>58</b>, as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or, alternatively, it can have a closed mouth, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-27</figref>. The ring can also have the upper edge of ring <b>50</b> tangent to upper edge <b>59</b> of the suspended material. As an alternative to the use of an oval, which is preferred, the elongated ring can be any non-circular shape, including, for example, a rectangle or quadrilateral. One such shape is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>). Moreover, the external and/or internal edges of the ring need not be rounded although they are preferably so.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The ring <b>50</b> can be elongated vertically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>), or can be elongated horizontally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>). Use of the horizontally elongated ring <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) allows the curtain <b>72</b> to spread more in a lateral direction (i.e. from left to right) along the curtain rod. The same curtain will spread out or widen more along a rod <b>74</b> using the horizontally elongated ring of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) than it would using a rounded ring such as the ring <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Thus, using the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) and <b>4</b>(<i>c</i>), less curtain material is needed to cover the width of a given window, or to extend along the width of a given shower, or so forth. The width of curtain material necessary is less than with the hooks of the prior art and is also less than with the external slit embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This embodiment is also useful in conjunction with pleated curtains (including shower curtains), blinds, portierres, room dividers, window treatments, drapery, curtains sharper folds, and the like, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An illustration of a comparison of the unmodified invention of the '232 patent to the external slit inventions of the present application is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a front view of the invention of the '232 patent, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> being a top view thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a front view of the external slit inventions herein, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> being a top view thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in the figures, in some instances the external slit devices may be used to provide certain patterns of flow of a curtain (e.g. the way it folds, hangs, etc). Depending on the desired results, they may be used in conjunction with the rings of the '232 device or by themselves. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and in the top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, using the devices of the '232 patent, the left (and right) edge of the curtain <b>82</b> will normally point outward (away from a shower or window) when placed on a rod <b>84</b>. If the end of the '232 curtain were placed on rod <b>84</b> to point inward (toward a shower or window, as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> with respect to the external slit embodiment) the horizontal slit between the rings would be forced out toward the viewer. This is unusable, however, since it would make the horizontal slit visible which is aesthetically undesirable. In the normal design of the '232 patent, the horizontal slit is only placed between every second pair of rings rather than between every pair, causing the horizontal slits to all face toward the wall and not toward the viewer. Yet, a consequence of this is that the leftmost and rightmost ends of the curtain are both concave toward the wall, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In many applications (such as with window curtains, for example) it is normally preferable to have the curtain concave toward the viewer, i.e. the edge pointed away from the viewer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. This effect is produced by the external slit embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</figref>. When the curtain is concave in this fashion, a more aesthetic appearance is produced for the curtain. Indeed, this is the industry standard for curtains. In addition, light is more effectively blocked from the window behind the curtain since the curtain cups against the wall, and likewise water is contained more effectively in the shower, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The external slit inventions of the present application can also be used to facilitate the placement of multiple layers of curtains on a rod. In many applications, such hotels, motels, or so forth, a fabric curtain <b>100</b> is placed on a rod <b>104</b> with a second curtain or liner <b>120</b> placed behind it. A decorative fabric shower curtain, for example, is often provided with a plastic liner behind it, the plastic liner protecting the fabric from the water of the shower. In accordance with the external slit inventions of the present application, each layer of curtain can be removed independently from the rod <b>104</b> without the need to remove any other layer, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">If the liner is designed according to the inventions of the '232 patent, for example, to replace the plastic liner, the fabric curtain must first be removed from the rod, then the old liner must be removed from the rod, then the new liner is placed on the rod, and then the fabric curtain is replaced on the rod. With a liner made according to the external slit inventions herein, however, the old liner can be directly removed from the rod and a replacement liner easily placed onto the rod, without the need to remove the fabric curtain, even if the fabric curtain is made according to the '232 patent.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The present inventions also eliminate the problem of possible drooping shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In some instances, e.g. with a heavy or a sheer fabric <b>110</b>, or when there is a large spacing between the rings or fasteners the horizontal slit of the '232 inventions may droop, causing an aesthetically unpleasing effect. With the external slit embodiments disclosed herein, however, such droop is obviated.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, the present inventions allow the width and the spacing of the flow of the curtain to be adjusted more readily. Using an approach purely like the '232 patent requires an even number of rings. The use of one or more external slits (in conjunction with the '232 patent design or using only external slits), on the other hand, allows an odd number of rings which is sometimes necessary due to spacing considerations between the rings (e.g. for flow of the curtain) and due to considerations governing the necessary width of the curtain or other hanging product.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment of the present inventions, ring <b>130</b> is fully within the suspended material <b>132</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in this embodiment ring <b>130</b> is below or touching hem <b>137</b> of suspended material <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an alternate embodiment, ring <b>140</b> overlaps with hem <b>147</b> of the curtain or suspended material <b>142</b>. Preferably, the top of ring <b>140</b> is also tangent to top edge <b>149</b> of the curtain. The cutting of a series of external slits <b>133</b> across the length of the hem <b>137</b> of the curtain can often result in a hem which will droop or hang downward. Accordingly, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the ring <b>140</b> acts to reinforce the hem, suspending the hem upward and preventing drooping. Preferably, the ring is an open ring with rounded edges, as discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Likewise, an open ring with rounded edges (or one of the other embodiments of the present invention), or a ring with a locking device (e.g. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-27</figref>) can also be substituted for the closed ring shown in the other figures of the present application. Eventhough a simple slit in a closed ring is often provided for simplicity of illustration, the present inventions are not limited to such a closed ring.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In a further alternate embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, ring <b>180</b> overlaps with the edge of the curtain <b>182</b>, such that ring extends beyond hem <b>187</b>. This embodiment can be used, for example, to lengthen the curtain. The embodiment can be used with a externally slit ring <b>180</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, or with a horizontally slit ring <b>190</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In yet a further embodiment, a tab <b>175</b> can be placed at the bottom of a ring <b>170</b> (either horizontally slit as shown, or a externally slit ring). Tab <b>175</b> is used to attach the ring to a curtain <b>172</b>, e.g. at the hem <b>177</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Any desired fabric material can be used in accordance with the present invention. For example, the fabric material can be vinyl, cotton, polyester, polyester/cotton or any other natural or synthetic fabric, including woven or non-woven fabrics, and can be rigid, semi-rigid, paper, plastic, wood, metal, or the like. In one embodiment of the invention, two half rings are placed together to encapsulate the fabric material therein. In an alternate embodiment, a single ring is integrated into the fabric material.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a further embodiment, the ring-like shape is cut directly into the material, without attaching a ring or fastener as an intermediate attachment to the hanging material. Two such embodiments are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> (left and right radial edges of slit separate) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> (left and right radial edges of slit touching), although any of the slit designs of the present application can be used. Other examples of preferred embodiments are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-32</figref>. The hanging product <b>160</b> is preferably made of a relatively rigid or semi-rigid material such as a thick vinyl, either throughout the product, or at least in the area of the ring. For example, the design can be used as part of a set of blinds or so forth. The external slit <b>153</b> can be a simple closed slit, if desired, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, it can be a more rounded design such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 14</figref>. An open slit (i.e. one with a gap between the left and right radial edges) with rounded edges is preferred. However, closed slits with rounded radial edges can be provided in this embodiment or any other embodiment of the application, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-33</figref>. Such closed slits with rounded radial edges are ones in which the left and right radial edges are rounded, but are also touching when the slit is not being flexed. Such closed slits with rounded radial edges provided in rings attached to the hanging product as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A projection, extension or finger can also be provided to the ring as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18</figref>, <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>. As illustrated in the figures, in further embodiments of the invention, a ring <b>200</b>, <b>210</b> or <b>220</b> is provided with a projecting edge, flange, extension, or finger <b>206</b>, <b>216</b> or <b>226</b>. Extensions <b>206</b>, <b>216</b> or <b>226</b> are projections off of the ring (preferably off of the ring's outer circumference), which extend beyond the ring away from the hanging product (e.g. toward the ceiling). The extensions are each located adjacent to and to the side of the slit <b>204</b>. Preferably two extensions are provided, one on each side of the slit. In the preferred embodiment, the slit preferably exits at the top of the product (i.e. at the 12:00 position), and as a result, the extensions are likewise preferably provided on top of the product, on both sides of the ring. Alternatively, however, the slit in any of the embodiments of the present invention can exit at any side or edge of the product (at any location on the “clock face”), with one or two extensions being preferably provided on the side or sides of the slit, whichever side or edge of the product is chosen.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">These extensions serve numerous functions. For example, they make it easier to open up the ring when flexing the ring. Extension <b>206</b> or <b>216</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, for example, are provided to overlap hems <b>207</b> and <b>217</b>, respectively, supporting the hems and preventing the drooping of the hem discussed above. Fingers <b>206</b> and <b>216</b> also cover the slit vertical edge of the hem, preventing it from fraying. Finger <b>226</b>, on the other hand, is provided above the hem <b>227</b>, with the ring <b>220</b> overlapping the hem to support it. In this embodiment, a portion of the ring—the finger only—projects above the upper edge of the curtain, similar in some ways to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In a further additional design, the fingers can be spread and opposed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 20</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, for example, fingers <b>226</b> can be provided as opposed “thumbs”. In other words, inner edges <b>224</b><i>a </i>and <b>224</b><i>b </i>are at an angle to each other greater than 0 (zero) degrees but less than 180 degrees. This is in contrast to the inner edges <b>214</b><i>a </i>and <b>214</b><i>b </i>of the fingers of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, which are parallel to each other. These spread fingers facilitate attachment of the rings <b>200</b> and <b>220</b> to a rod. They make it easier to slide the ring into the rod until the ring is pushed over the rod. They also make it easier to spread the ring open by hand to insert it over the rod, and to spread the ring open to remove it from the rod. They facilitate attachment whether a simple external slit through the ring is used (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref>), or alternatively in conjunction with open rings with rounded edges (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As an alternative to a straight external slit, a curved external slit <b>232</b> can be provided. Further preferably, the slit can be curved and offset, as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In one embodiment, curved slit <b>232</b> has an upper vertical component <b>232</b><i>a</i>, an approximately horizontal component <b>232</b><i>b</i>, and a radial component <b>232</b><i>c</i>. Radial component <b>232</b><i>c </i>of slit <b>232</b> exits the inner circumference of the ring at a location which is offset to the side, rather than exiting the ring at the top of the inner circumference of ring <b>220</b> (i.e. rather than exiting directly below vertical component <b>232</b><i>a</i>). In this embodiment, fingers <b>224</b><i>a </i>and <b>224</b><i>b </i>are pulled to the left and right, respectively to open up the ring <b>220</b> and insert the ring over a rod. Curved slit <b>232</b>, which intersects the inner circumference of the ring at an offset position rather than at the top of the ring, provides an advantage to the user in that the slit <b>232</b> will not sit directly on top of the rod while the curtain is in use. This eliminates the problem of the slit riding on the rod when the curtain is pulled open or closed. Instead, a smooth surface of the ring rides on the rod, easing movement of the curtain.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It will be likewise understood, that some or all of the features of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> can be provided to any given product. For example, the curved slit can be provided with or without offset features, whether offset intersection points, or a bottom offset from the 12:00 position. Likewise, the various features of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, whether a curved slit and/or an offset and/or the fingers, can also be provided directly to the hanging product (without using a ring) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, the curved slit can be provided to exit the edge of the product at any exit point other than the top of the ring, with an offset between the intersection point of the curved slit with the inner circumference/edge of the product and the exit point of the product. In other words, by offset intersection points, the slit's endpoints are spaced from each other at their intersection points such that the two intersection points are not at the same location were they placed on a standard clock. For example, if the intersection of the curved slit with the exit point from the product were at the 12:00 position (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>), the intersection of the curved slit at the inner edge would be at a point other than the 12:00 position (approximately 1:00 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). Or, likewise, if the intersection of the curved slit with the exit point from the product were at the 2:60 position instead, the intersection of the curved slit at the inner edge would be at a point other than the 2:00 position.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a further embodiment, the ring <b>230</b> can be provided with a flat upper edge <b>235</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Upper edge <b>235</b> overlaps with hem <b>237</b>. Upper edge <b>235</b>, therefore, provides yet further support for the hem over an extended length of fabric. Using the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, upper edge <b>235</b> provides support over a length equal to approximately the outer diameter of the ring <b>230</b> for each ring. This upper edge can be the entire upper edge of the ring. Or, it can be used a portion of the upper edge, e.g. in conjunction with an extension off the ring, as shown, for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Instead of a vertical external slit <b>233</b><i>a</i>, a further offset slit <b>233</b><i>b </i>can be provided to any of the embodiments of the invention, as shown, for example, by the dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Offset slit <b>233</b><i>b </i>is a slit which intersects the inner circle <b>231</b> in a secant-like or tangent-like fashion. Offset slit <b>233</b><i>b </i>is off center, such that the line it makes (if extended) would not intersect the center of inner circle <b>231</b>. Or, viewing the circumference of the inner circle, the intersection point of the slit with the inner circumference or edge of the product is offset from the 12:00 position on that inner circle. This offset slit allows the ring to glide more smoothly along the rod since the slit does not sit directly on the rod's top. In this further preferred embodiment, regardless of what position is chosen for the exit of the slit from the ring or product, the intersection of the slit at the inner edge is preferably at a point offset from the 12:00 position when the product is hanging, so that the slit does not ride on the rod as previously discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In further embodiments of the invention, a ring is provided which can be selectively opened or sealed, i.e. “locked” as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-25</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a front view of ring <b>240</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a rear view of ring <b>240</b>. As shown therein, the cut <b>243</b> in the top ring shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is spaced from the corresponding cut <b>244</b> in the bottom ring shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. In other words, in a preferred embodiment, the cut does not extend through both rings in the same position—as a result, the top and bottom rings have an overlap in the area between the cut in the top and bottom ring as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>. This overlap configuration can be used with any of the embodiments of the present invention. In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-25</figref>, it is used with a locking pin to secure the two rings. As shown in the figures, ring <b>240</b> includes a pin <b>246</b> which is located in this overlap area extends through a opening or channel <b>242</b>. In the open position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the pin <b>246</b> is separated from channel <b>242</b> forming a gap for placing the ring on a rod. In the closed position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, pin <b>246</b> inserts snugly into channel <b>242</b> to seal the ring.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In further embodiments of the invention, a ring <b>250</b> is provided, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. Ring <b>250</b> includes an internal sliding member <b>254</b> which can be pushed or pulled using knob <b>256</b>. Sliding member <b>254</b> slides into and out of internal channel <b>258</b> to close and open gap <b>252</b>. In an alternative embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, a pivoting member <b>264</b> is provided, having a pin <b>265</b> which inserts into an opening <b>266</b>. Pivoting member <b>264</b> can be rotated to open or close gap <b>262</b>. In general, the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22-27</figref> are useful for providing a very secure ring which cannot accidentally be pulled off of a rod. They also increases the smoothness of the sliding of the rings along the rod.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In a further embodiment of the invention, a tape or strip may be provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. Strip <b>306</b> can be used to convert an existing curtain or other hanging product <b>302</b> into one of the present invention, or can be used to provide a hanging product in which the specific types of fasteners or provided on top can be interchanged. Strip <b>306</b> includes attachment devices <b>308</b> which attach to the top of the hanging product <b>302</b>. The attachment device can be reversibly detachable, e.g. via snaps, a button and hole type design, a zipper, or a hook, or can be more permanent, e.g. via sewing, welding, adhesive, or so forth. Any other attachment methods for attaching the strip to the hanging product can be used as well. In one embodiment, an existing hanging product with holes <b>310</b> can easily be converted to one of the present invention by attaching the strip <b>306</b> to the hanging product using the holes <b>310</b>. As with the other hanging products of the present invention, the hanging product <b>302</b> can be woven, non-woven, rigid, semi-rigid, or so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further in accordance with the invention, any of the embodiments of the present application can be placed in sequence from right to left, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. This allows a person to cover a long window, shower or so forth, by using two or more curtains when the item to be covered is longer than the width of a single curtain. In addition, overlaps can be used, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. When the curtains are overlapped, the edge of one curtain <b>320</b> extends beyond the edge of the other curtain <b>330</b>, minimizing or eliminating the appearance of any gap between the curtains.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the slit <b>344</b> can include a segment or slit <b>344</b><i>a </i>which extends through the hanging product <b>350</b>, and a segment or slit <b>344</b><i>b </i>which extends through the ring <b>340</b>. As previously discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the slit <b>344</b> need not be in a straight line. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, slit <b>344</b><i>a </i>is at an angle to slit <b>344</b><i>b</i>, the angle being other than 180 degrees. If desired, the slits <b>344</b><i>a </i>and <b>344</b><i>b </i>can combine to form a curved slit, or can be two straight segments at any angle to each other, the latter being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31(</figref><i>a</i>), in a further preferred embodiment the hanging product includes an inner cut-out area <b>380</b>, also shown as <b>151</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The hanging product includes a slit <b>370</b> which extends from the edge of the hanging product to the inner cut-out area <b>380</b>. Slit <b>370</b> includes a left radial edge <b>375</b><i>a </i>and a right radial edge <b>375</b><i>b</i>. Preferably, the slit is an offset slit. Further preferably, the radius of the left radial edge <b>375</b><i>a </i>is different than the radius of the right radial edge <b>375</b><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31(</figref><i>a</i>) can therefore be contrasted with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> which shows an embodiment in which the left and right radial edges <b>388</b><i>a </i>and <b>388</b><i>b </i>are of equal radii, and wherein the slit is not offset but central, along the radius of the circle. It is also preferred that the left radial edge and right radial edge contact each other, as shown in both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>33</b>, although a gap can alternately be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A hanging product can also have a ring designed in this fashion, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31(</figref><i>b</i>). Ring <b>400</b> is provided as part of hanging product <b>401</b>. Ring <b>400</b> includes a slit <b>412</b>. Slit <b>412</b> (and likewise ring <b>400</b>) has a left radial edge <b>402</b><i>a </i>and a right radial edge <b>402</b><i>b</i>, wherein left radial edge <b>402</b><i>a </i>and right radial edge <b>402</b><i>b </i>have different radii. The ring <b>400</b> includes an edge <b>404</b> which is flat along at least a portion of the upper edge of the ring and preferably overlaps hem <b>406</b>.
