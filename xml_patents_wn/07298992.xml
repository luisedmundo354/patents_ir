<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image forming device such as a laser printer, and particularly to a process cartridge provided in the image forming device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Laser printers and other image forming devices equipped with a detachably mounted process cartridge are well known in the art. The process cartridge includes a developing roller for carrying a toner; a photosensitive drum disposed in confrontation with the developing roller, on the surface of which electrostatic latent images are formed; and a transfer roller disposed in opposition to the photosensitive drum, to which a transfer bias is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the toner carried on the developing roller comes into opposition with and contacts the photosensitive drum, the latent images on the drum are developed into a toner image that is carried on the surface of the photosensitive drum. Subsequently, by applying a transfer bias to the transfer roller, the toner image is transferred onto paper as the paper passes between the photosensitive drum and the transfer roller.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this type of laser printer, toner remaining on the surface of the photosensitive drum after the toner image has been transferred to the paper by the transfer roller is recovered by the developing roller in what is known as a cleanerless system. In the cleanerless system, a paper dust collecting brush is disposed downstream of the transfer roller with respect to the rotational direction of the photosensitive drum for recovering paper dust deposited from paper onto the surface of the photosensitive drum.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One such paper dust collecting brush has been proposed in Japanese patent-application publication (kokai) No. HEI-9-244503. The brush includes a planar part having an implantation surface with a flat rectangular shape; a brush material of a predetermined height that is thickly implanted in the implantation surface; protruding parts disposed on one of the longer side edges on the implantation surface, rising nearly perpendicular to the implantation surface up to a predetermined position lower than the height of the brush material and then folding back and downward from this predetermined position; and a mounting plate part extending from the lower end of the protruding parts in a direction intersecting the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the paper dust collecting brush disclosed in Japanese patent-application publication No. HEI-9-244503 is mounted such that the mounting plate part extending from one side of the planar part in which the brush material is implanted is inserted into a brush retaining part provided on a frame of the image forming device. Hence, the mounting plate part must be large due to the arrangement of the components, thereby increasing the overall size of the paper dust collecting brush, leading to such problems as an increase in the device size and an inconvenience in replacing the paper dust collecting brush.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, when the mounting plate part is inserted into the brush retaining part, the planar part is supported on only one side. Hence, it is not possible to achieve precise positioning of the brush, making it difficult to position the brush material appropriately with respect to the photosensitive member.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide a compact process cartridge that can accurately dispose the brush material in relation to an image bearing member. It is another object of the present invention to provide an image forming device equipped with the process cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to attain the above and other objects, the present invention provides a process cartridge. The process cartridge includes an image bearing member, a brush, and a supporting portion. The image bearing member has a surface that extends in a longitudinal direction for bearing a developer image on the surface. The brush removes foreign matter deposited on the surface of the image bearing member. The brush includes a base member having an elongated plate shape that extends in the longitudinal direction, the base member having a front surface that extends in the longitudinal direction and confronts the image bearing member, a brush member including bristles provided on the front surface of the base member, the bristles extending in another direction substantially perpendicular to the front surface, and mounting portions formed at both latitudinal ends of the base member, the both latitudinal ends being both ends in a latitudinal direction perpendicular both to the longitudinal direction and to the another direction.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A process cartridge and an image forming device according to embodiments of the present invention will be described while referring to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A process cartridge and laser printer according to a first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the laser printer <b>1</b> includes a main casing <b>2</b>, a feeder unit <b>4</b>, and an image forming unit <b>5</b>. The feeder unit <b>4</b> and the image forming unit <b>5</b> are housed in the main casing <b>2</b>. The feeder unit <b>4</b> supplies sheets <b>3</b> to the image forming unit <b>5</b>. The image forming unit <b>5</b> forms desired images on the supplied sheets <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The feeder unit <b>4</b> is located within the lower section of the main casing <b>2</b> and includes a sheet supply tray <b>6</b>, a sheet pressing plate <b>7</b>, a sheet supply roller <b>8</b>, a sheet supply pad <b>9</b>, paper dust removing rollers <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, and a pair of registration rollers <b>12</b>. The sheet supply tray <b>6</b> is detachably mounted with respect to the main casing <b>2</b>. The sheet pressing plate <b>7</b> is pivotally movably provided within the sheet supply tray <b>6</b>. The sheet supply roller <b>8</b> and the sheet supply pad <b>9</b> are provided above one end of the sheet supply tray <b>6</b>. The paper dust removing rollers <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> are disposed downstream from the sheet supply roller <b>8</b> with respect to the direction in which the sheets <b>3</b> are transported. The registration rollers <b>12</b> are provided downstream from the paper dust removing rollers <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> in the sheet transport direction of the sheets <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The sheet pressing plate <b>7</b> is capable of supporting a stack of sheets <b>3</b>. The sheet pressing plate <b>7</b> is pivotably supported at its end furthest from the supply roller <b>8</b> so that the end of the sheet pressing plate <b>7</b> that is nearest the supply roller <b>8</b> can move vertically. Although not shown in the drawings, a spring for urging the sheet pressing plate <b>7</b> upward is provided to the rear surface of the sheet pressing plate <b>7</b>. Therefore, the sheet pressing plate <b>7</b> pivots downward in accordance with increase in the amount of sheets <b>3</b> stacked on the sheet pressing plate <b>7</b>. At this time, the sheet pressing plate <b>7</b> pivots around the end of the sheet pressing plate <b>7</b> farthest from the sheet supply roller <b>8</b>, downward against the urging force of the spring. The sheet supply roller <b>8</b> and the sheet supply pad <b>9</b> are disposed in confrontation with each other. A spring <b>13</b> is provided beneath the sheet supply pad <b>9</b> for pressing the sheet supply pad <b>9</b> toward the sheet supply roller <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Urging force of the spring under the sheet pressing plate <b>7</b> presses the uppermost sheet <b>3</b> on the sheet pressing plate <b>7</b> toward the supply roller <b>8</b> so that rotation of the supply roller <b>8</b> moves the uppermost sheet <b>3</b> between the supply roller <b>8</b> and the separation pad <b>13</b>. In this way, one sheet <b>3</b> at a time is separated from the stack and supplied to the paper dust removing rollers <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The paper dust removing rollers <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> remove paper dust from the supplied sheets <b>3</b> and further convey the same to the registration rollers <b>12</b>. The pair of registration rollers <b>12</b> performs a desired registration operation on the supplied sheets <b>3</b>. Then the sheets <b>3</b> are transported to an image formation position. In the image formation position a photosensitive drum <b>27</b> and a transfer roller <b>30</b> contact each other. In other words, the image formation position is a transfer position where the visible toner image is transferred from a surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> to a sheet <b>3</b> as the sheet <b>3</b> passes between the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> and the transfer roller <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The feeder unit <b>4</b> further includes a multipurpose tray <b>14</b>, a multipurpose sheet supply roller <b>15</b>, and a multipurpose sheet supply pad <b>25</b>. The multipurpose sheet supply roller <b>15</b> and the multipurpose sheet supply pad <b>25</b> are disposed in confrontation with each other and are for supplying sheets <b>3</b> that are stacked on the multipurpose tray <b>14</b>. A spring <b>26</b> provided beneath the multipurpose sheet supply pad <b>25</b> presses the multipurpose sheet supply pad <b>25</b> up toward the multipurpose sheet supply roller <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Rotation of the multipurpose sheet supply roller <b>15</b> moves sheets <b>3</b> one at a time from the stack on the multipurpose tray <b>14</b> to a position between the multipurpose sheet supply pad <b>25</b> and the multipurpose sheet supply roller <b>15</b> so that the sheets <b>3</b> on the multipurpose tray <b>14</b> can be supplied one at a time to the image formation position.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The image forming section <b>5</b> includes a scanner section <b>16</b>, a process cartridge <b>17</b>, and a fixing section <b>18</b>. The scanner section <b>16</b> is provided at the upper section of the casing <b>2</b> and is provided with a laser emitting section (not shown), a rotatingly driven polygon mirror <b>19</b>, lenses <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, and reflection mirrors <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>. The laser emitting section emits a laser beam based on desired image data. As indicated by single-dot chain line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the laser beam passes through or is reflected by the mirror <b>19</b>, the lens <b>20</b>, the reflection mirrors <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>, the lens <b>21</b>, and the reflection mirror <b>24</b> in this order so as to irradiate, in a high speed scanning operation, the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> of the process cartridge <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The process cartridge <b>17</b> is disposed below the scanner section <b>16</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the process cartridge <b>17</b> includes a frame <b>51</b> and a development cartridge <b>28</b>. The frame <b>51</b> is detachably mounted on the main casing <b>2</b> and houses the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>, a scorotron charge unit <b>29</b>, a transfer roller <b>30</b>, and a brush unit <b>52</b>. In other words, the process cartridge <b>17</b> is detachably mounted on the laser printer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The frame <b>51</b> includes a lower frame <b>511</b> and an upper frame <b>512</b> formed separately from the lower frame <b>511</b> and assembled onto the lower frame <b>511</b> from above.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The development cartridge <b>28</b> is detachable from the frame <b>51</b> and provided with a developing roller <b>31</b>, a layer thickness regulating blade <b>32</b>, a supply roller <b>33</b> and a toner hopper <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The toner hopper <b>34</b> is filled with positively charging, non-magnetic, single-component toner. In the present embodiment, polymerization toner is used as the toner. Polymerization toner has substantially spherical particles and so has an excellent fluidity characteristic. To produce polymerization toner, a polymerizing monomer is subjected to well-known copolymerizing processes, such as suspension polymerization. Examples of a polymerizing monomer include a styrene type monomer or an acrylic type monomer. An example of a styrene type monomer is styrene. Examples of acrylic type monomers are acrylic acid, alkyl (C1-C4) acrylate, and alkyl (C1-C4) metaacrylate. Because the polymerization toner has such an excellent fluidity characteristic, image development is reliably performed so that high-quality images can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Materials such as wax and a coloring agent are distributed in the toner. The coloring agent can be carbon black, for example. In addition, external additive, such as silica, are added in the toner to further improve the fluidity characteristic. The toner has a particle diameter of about 6-10 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The rotation shaft <b>35</b> is disposed in the center of the toner hopper <b>34</b>. An agitator <b>36</b> and a cleaner <b>39</b> are supported on the rotation shaft <b>35</b>. The agitator <b>36</b> agitates the toner in the toner hopper <b>34</b> and discharges the toner through the toner supply opening <b>37</b> that is opened through the side wall of the toner hopper <b>34</b>. Windows <b>38</b> are formed in the end walls that define the lengthwise ends of the toner hopper <b>34</b>. The windows <b>38</b> are used to detect the amount of toner remaining in the toner hopper <b>34</b>. The cleaner <b>39</b> cleans the windows <b>38</b> as the agitator <b>36</b> rotates.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The supply roller <b>33</b> is located on the side of the toner supply opening <b>37</b>. The developing roller <b>31</b> is located confronting the supply roller <b>33</b>. The supply roller <b>33</b> and the developing roller <b>31</b> are rotatable in the counterclockwise direction. The supply roller <b>33</b> and the developing roller <b>31</b> are disposed in abutment contact with each other so that both are compressed to a certain extent.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The supply roller <b>33</b> includes a metal roller shaft covered with a roller formed from an electrically conductive sponge material.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The developer roller <b>31</b> includes a metal roller shaft and a roller portion covered thereon. The roller portion is made from a elastic member formed from a conductive rubber material. In more specific terms, the roller portion of the developing roller <b>31</b> is made from conductive silicone rubber or urethane rubber including, for example, carbon particles. The surface of the roller portion is covered with a coating layer of silicone rubber or urethane rubber that contains fluorine. The developing roller <b>31</b> is applied with a developing bias.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The layer thickness regulating blade <b>32</b> is disposed near the developing roller <b>31</b>. The layer thickness regulating blade <b>32</b> includes a blade made from a metal leaf spring, and has a pressing member <b>40</b>, that is provided on a free end of the blade. The pressing member <b>40</b> has a semi-circular shape when viewed in cross section. The pressing member <b>40</b> is formed from silicone rubber with electrically insulating properties. The layer thickness regulating blade <b>32</b> is supported by the developing cartridge <b>28</b> at a location near the developing roller <b>31</b>. The resilient force of the blade presses the pressing member <b>40</b> against the surface of the developing roller <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Then rotation of the supply roller <b>33</b> supplies the developing roller <b>31</b> with the toner that has been discharged through the toner supply opening <b>37</b>. At this time, the toner is triboelectrically charged to a positive charge between the supply roller <b>33</b> and the developing roller <b>31</b>. Then, as the developing roller <b>31</b> rotates, the toner supplied onto the developing roller <b>31</b> moves between the developing roller <b>31</b> and the pressing member <b>40</b> of the layer thickness regulating blade <b>32</b>. This reduces thickness of the toner on the surface of the developing roller <b>31</b> down to a thin layer of uniform thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The photosensitive drum <b>27</b> is disposed to the side of and in confrontation with the developing roller <b>31</b>. The photosensitive drum <b>27</b> is supported on the lower frame <b>511</b> and is rotatable in the clockwise direction (direction shown by the arrow). The photosensitive drum <b>27</b> includes a drum-shaped member and a surface layer. The surface layer is formed on the drum-shaped member from a photosensitive layer that is made from polycarbonate.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The Scorotron charge unit <b>29</b> is supported on the upper frame <b>512</b> at a position above the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> but separated a predetermined distance therefrom so as not to contact the same. The Scorotron charge unit <b>29</b> is also positioned upstream of the developing roller <b>31</b> and downstream of the transfer roller <b>30</b> described later with respect to the rotating direction of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>. The Scorotron charge unit <b>29</b> is a positive charging Scorotron charger having a charging wire formed of tungsten or the like from which a corona discharge is generated for applying a uniform charge of positive polarity across the entire surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As will be described later, the brush unit <b>52</b> is supported between the lower frame <b>511</b> and upper frame <b>512</b> in opposition to the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>. The brush unit <b>52</b> is positioned to the side of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> (the side opposite the developing roller <b>31</b>) and is upstream of the Scorotron charge unit <b>29</b> and downstream of the transfer roller <b>30</b> with respect to the rotating direction of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The brush unit <b>52</b> includes a brush <b>54</b> and a brush holder <b>55</b> for supporting the brush <b>54</b>. The brush <b>54</b> is provided with a brush member <b>53</b> formed of multiple bristles whose tips contact the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>. In a cleaning operation, a power source (not shown) disposed in the main casing <b>2</b> applies a cleaning bias to the brush member <b>53</b> via an electrode <b>56</b> described later (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The transfer roller <b>30</b> is disposed below the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> and in opposition thereto and is upstream of the brush unit <b>52</b> and downstream of the developing roller <b>31</b> in the rotating direction of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>. The transfer roller <b>30</b> is supported on the lower frame <b>511</b> so as to be capable of rotating in the direction of the arrow (counterclockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The scorotoron charge unit <b>29</b> forms a blanket of positive charge on the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> as the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> rotates. Then, the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> is exposed to high speed scan of the laser beam from the scanner section <b>16</b>. The electric potential of the positively charged surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> drops at positions exposed to the laser beam. As a result, an electrostatic latent image is formed on the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> based on desired image data used to drive the laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Next, an inverse developing process is performed. That is, as the developing roller <b>31</b> rotates, the positively-charged toner borne on the surface of the developing roller <b>31</b> is brought into contact with the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>. At this time, the toner on the developing roller <b>31</b> is supplied to lower-potential areas of the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>. As a result, the toner is selectively borne on the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> so that the electrostatic latent image is developed into a visible toner image.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Thereafter, the visible toner image borne on the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> is transferred to a sheet <b>3</b> according to the transfer bias applied to the transfer roller <b>30</b> as the sheet <b>3</b> passes between the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> and the transfer roller <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the laser printer <b>1</b>, residual toner which is left on the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> after a transfer to the sheet <b>3</b> is recovered by the developing roller <b>31</b>. That is, the residual toner is recovered using a so-called cleanerless method. By recovering the residual toner using the cleanerless method, a toner cleaning device and a used-toner reservoir become unnecessary, which simplifies the construction of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Paper dust can become deposited on the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> during the transfer operation when the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> contacts the paper <b>3</b>. As the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> continues to rotate after transferring an image, the brush member <b>53</b> contacting the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> removes the deposited paper dust therefrom. At the same time, a cleaning bias is applied to the brush member <b>53</b> to electrically attract the paper dust.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the fixing section <b>18</b> is disposed downstream from the process cartridge <b>17</b> and includes a heat roller <b>41</b>, a pressing roller <b>42</b>, and transport rollers <b>43</b>. The pressing roller <b>42</b> presses against the heat roller <b>41</b>. The transport rollers <b>43</b> are provided downstream from the heat roller <b>41</b> and the pressing roller <b>42</b>. The heat roller <b>41</b> includes a metal tube and a halogen lamp disposed therein. The halogen lamp heats up the metal tube so that toner that has been transferred onto sheet <b>3</b> in the process cartridge <b>17</b> is thermally fixed onto the sheet <b>3</b> as the sheet <b>3</b> passes between the heat roller <b>41</b> and the pressing roller <b>42</b>. Afterward, the sheet <b>3</b> is transported to a sheet-discharge path <b>44</b> by the transport rollers <b>43</b> and discharged onto a sheet-discharge tray <b>46</b> by sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The laser printer <b>1</b> is further provided with an inverting transport unit <b>47</b> for inverting sheets <b>3</b> that have been printed on once and for returning the sheets <b>3</b> to the image forming unit <b>5</b> so that images can be formed on both sides of the sheets <b>3</b>. The inverting transport unit <b>47</b> includes the sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b>, an inversion transport path <b>48</b>, a flapper <b>49</b>, and a plurality of inversion transport rollers <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b> are a pair of rollers that can be rotated selectively forward or in reverse. The sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b> are rotated forward to discharge sheets <b>3</b> onto the sheet-discharge tray <b>46</b> and rotated in reverse when sheets are to be inverted.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The inversion transport rollers <b>50</b> are disposed below the image forming unit <b>5</b>. The inversion transport path <b>48</b> extends vertically between the sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b> and the inversion transport rollers <b>50</b>. The upstream end of the inversion transport path <b>48</b> is located near the sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b> and the downstream end is located near the inversion transport rollers <b>50</b> so that sheets <b>3</b> can be transported downward from the sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b> to the inversion transport rollers <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The flapper <b>49</b> is swingably disposed at the junction between the sheet-discharge path <b>44</b> and the inversion transport path <b>48</b>. By activating or deactivating a solenoid (not shown), the flapper <b>49</b> can be selectively swung between the orientation shown in broken line and the orientation shown by solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The orientation shown in solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is for transporting sheets <b>3</b> that have one side printed to the sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b>. The orientation shown in broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is for transporting sheets from the sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b> into the inversion transport path <b>48</b>, rather than back into the sheet-discharge path <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The inversion transport rollers <b>50</b> are aligned horizontally at positions above the sheet supply tray <b>6</b>. The pair of inversion transport rollers <b>50</b> that is farthest upstream is disposed near the rear end of the inversion transport path <b>48</b>. The pair of inversion transport rollers <b>50</b> that is located farthest downstream is disposed below the registration rollers <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The inverting transport unit <b>47</b> operates in the following manner when a sheet <b>3</b> is to be formed with images on both sides. A sheet <b>3</b> that has been formed on one side with an image is transported by the transport rollers <b>43</b> from the sheet-discharge path <b>44</b> to the sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b>. The sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b> rotate forward with the sheet <b>3</b> pinched therebetween until almost all of the sheet <b>3</b> is transported out from the laser printer <b>1</b> and over the sheet-discharge tray <b>46</b>. The forward rotation of the sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b> is stopped once the rear-side end of the sheet <b>3</b> is located between the sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b>. Then, the sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b> are driven to rotate in reverse while at the same time the flapper <b>49</b> is switched to change transport direction of the sheet <b>3</b> toward the inversion transport path <b>48</b>. As a result, the sheet <b>3</b> is transported into the inversion transport path <b>48</b>. The flapper <b>49</b> reverts to its initial position once transport of the sheet <b>3</b> to the inversion transport path <b>48</b> is completed. That is, the flapper <b>49</b> switches back to the position for transporting sheets from the transport rollers <b>43</b> to the sheet-discharge rollers <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Next, the inverted sheet <b>3</b> is transported through the inversion transport path <b>48</b> to the inversion transport rollers <b>50</b> and then upward from the inversion transport rollers <b>50</b> to the registration rollers <b>12</b>. The registration rollers <b>12</b> align the front edge of the sheet <b>3</b>. Afterward, the sheet <b>3</b> is transported toward the image formation position. At this time, the upper and lower surfaces of the sheet <b>3</b> are reversed from the first time that an image has been formed on the sheet <b>3</b> so that an image can be formed on the other side as well. In this way, images are formed on both sides of the sheet <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the laser printer <b>1</b> having this construction, the brush unit <b>52</b> of the process cartridge <b>17</b> has the brush <b>54</b> for removing paper dust from the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>, and the brush holder <b>55</b> for supporting the brush <b>54</b> against the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>, as described above. Next, this brush unit <b>52</b> provided with the brush <b>54</b> and brush holder <b>55</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the brush <b>54</b> includes a base member <b>57</b>, and the brush member <b>53</b> provided on the surface of this base member <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The base member <b>57</b> is formed of a conductive synthetic resin and is shaped substantially like a long slender rectangle. More specifically, the base member <b>57</b> has an elongated plate shape that extends in the longitudinal direction. The base member <b>57</b> has: a front surface <b>57</b>F that extends in the longitudinal direction and confronts the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>; a rear surface <b>57</b>R opposite to the front surface <b>57</b>F; longitudinal end surfaces <b>57</b>A at both ends in the longitudinal direction; and latitudinal end surfaces <b>57</b>B at both ends in the latitudinal direction. The multiple bristles are provided on the front surface <b>57</b>F of the base member <b>57</b> and extend in a direction substantially perpendicular to the front surface <b>57</b>F.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The brush member <b>53</b> is formed of numerous conductive bristles implanted in the front surface <b>57</b>F of the base member <b>57</b>. The brush member <b>53</b> is disposed along the length of the base member <b>57</b> separated a predetermined distance in the latitudinal (width) direction from both edges in the latitudinal (width) direction, which is substantially orthogonal to the longitudinal (length) direction of the base member <b>57</b> (hereinafter also referred to as latitudinal direction and longitudinal direction, respectively). Accordingly, margins extending longitudinally are formed on the latitudinal edges of the base member <b>57</b>. These margins are mounting portions <b>58</b> for supporting the brush <b>54</b> on the brush holder <b>55</b>. Hence, the two mounting portions <b>58</b> are formed longitudinally on the front surface <b>57</b>F of the base member <b>57</b> at the latitudinal edges, while the brush member <b>53</b> is formed longitudinally between the two mounting portions <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the brush holder <b>55</b> is configured of a recessed portion <b>101</b> formed in the lower frame <b>511</b> as a first holding portion, and a plurality of ribs <b>102</b> provided on the upper frame <b>512</b> as a second holding portion.</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">More specifically, the frame end <b>103</b> is integrally configured of a tongue part <b>104</b> formed in a substantially long rectangular shape extending parallel to the axis of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> and protruding near the surface of the same; and a base part <b>116</b> provided along the entire length of the tongue part <b>104</b> on the base edge thereof. Here, the base edge of the tongue part <b>104</b> is the side edge furthest from the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>. Here, the side of the brush unit <b>52</b> furthest from the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> will be referred to as the rear side and the side nearest the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> the front side. The base part <b>116</b> is integrally formed of a first slanted part <b>105</b> and a second slanted part <b>106</b> extending along the entire length of the base part <b>116</b> and slanting upward to form a V shape in the cross-section. The recessed portion <b>101</b> is formed in the gap between the first slanted part <b>105</b> and second slanted part <b>106</b>. The recessed portion <b>101</b> receives the mounting portion <b>58</b> provided on the bottom side of the base member <b>57</b>, fitting over and gripping this mounting portion <b>58</b> along the entire length of the base member <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The second slanted part <b>106</b> provided on the front side is formed lower than the first slanted part <b>105</b> so as not to contact the brush member <b>53</b> when the mounting portion <b>58</b> of the base member <b>57</b> is received in the recessed portion <b>101</b>.</p>

Next, the upper frame <b>512</b> is assembled on the lower frame <b>511</b>, causing the contact parts <b>109</b> to contact the other mounting portion <b>58</b> of the base member <b>57</b> almost simultaneously and press the mounting portion <b>58</b> toward the lower frame <b>511</b>. As a result, the base member <b>57</b> is interposed between the recessed portion <b>101</b> and the ribs <b>102</b>, and the brush <b>54</b> is supported on the brush holder <b>55</b>, which is configured of the recessed portion <b>101</b> and ribs <b>102</b>. Further, since the protruding wall <b>170</b> of the frame end <b>103</b> fits into the step part <b>169</b> of the upper frame <b>512</b> at this time, the lower frame <b>511</b> is reliably positioned with respect to the upper frame <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">When the brush <b>54</b> is supported in the brush holder <b>55</b>, the mounting portions <b>58</b> provided on both latitudinal sides of the base member <b>57</b> are held by the recessed portion <b>101</b> and the ribs <b>102</b>. Accordingly, an accurate positioning of the brush <b>54</b> can be achieved without increasing the size of the base member <b>57</b>, thereby disposing the brush <b>54</b> suitably in relation to the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> to facilitate the brush <b>54</b> in efficiently recovering paper dust and the like deposited on the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>. Further, by forming a smaller brush <b>54</b>, it is possible to form a more compact device and to reduce such inconveniences as replacement operations for the brush <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Further, by fitting one of the mounting portions <b>58</b> in the recessed portion <b>101</b>, this mounting portion <b>58</b> can be reliably held by the recessed portion <b>101</b>. The other mounting portion <b>58</b> can be reliably held by pressure from the ribs <b>102</b>. Hence, the brush <b>54</b> can be reliably supported through a simple construction of the recessed portion <b>101</b> and ribs <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Further, when the brush <b>54</b> is supported on the brush holder <b>55</b> in this way, one of the mounting portions <b>58</b> is simultaneously held in the recessed portion <b>101</b> across the entire length of the brush <b>54</b>, while the other mounting portion <b>58</b> can be held simultaneously by the ribs <b>102</b> across the entire length. Accordingly, the brush <b>54</b> can easily be supported on the brush holder <b>55</b>, facilitating replacement operations for the brush <b>54</b> and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Moreover, the brush <b>54</b> can be reliably supported on the brush holder <b>55</b> through the simple operation of assembling the frame <b>51</b>, entailing mounting the upper frame <b>512</b> on the lower frame <b>511</b>, thereby facilitating replacement operations for the brush <b>54</b> and the like and further reducing inconveniences.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Since the laser printer <b>1</b> of the present embodiment is provided with the process cartridge <b>17</b> that is capable of reducing the size of the device and lightening the user's load in replacement operations for the brush <b>54</b> and the like, the present embodiment can produce a more compact device and facilitate maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Next, a brush holder <b>55</b> according to a second embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a side cross-sectional view showing the brush holder <b>55</b> according to the second embodiment, wherein like parts and components are designated by the same reference numerals to avoid duplicating description.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the brush holder <b>55</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the base part <b>116</b> of the lower frame <b>511</b> is not provided with the second slanted part <b>106</b>. Accordingly, the recessed portion <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is not formed in the lower frame <b>511</b>, and the base part <b>116</b> serves as the first holding portion for holding one of the mounting portions <b>58</b> of the base member <b>57</b>. The brush <b>54</b> is supported as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">First, one of the mounting portions <b>5</b>B of the base member <b>57</b> is placed in contact with the top surface of the base part <b>116</b>. Next, while this mounting portion <b>58</b> is in contact with the top surface of the base part <b>116</b>, the upper frame <b>512</b> is assembled on the lower frame <b>511</b>, causing the contact parts <b>109</b> formed in the ribs <b>102</b> to contact the other mounting portion <b>58</b> of the base member <b>57</b> almost simultaneously so that the ribs <b>102</b> press the other mounting portion <b>58</b> toward the lower frame <b>511</b>. Accordingly, the base member <b>57</b> is interposed between the base part <b>116</b> and the ribs <b>102</b>; the free end of the brush member <b>53</b> contacts the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>; and the brush <b>54</b> is supported from three directions by the base part <b>116</b>, ribs <b>102</b>, and photosensitive drum <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Even when supported from three directions in this way, the brush <b>54</b> can be supported in a stable state by the base part <b>116</b>, ribs <b>102</b>, and photosensitive drum <b>27</b> and can therefore achieve the same effects as the brush holder <b>55</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Moreover, by eliminating the second slanted part <b>106</b>, it is possible to achieve reliable support of the brush <b>54</b> through an even simpler construction.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Next, a brush holder <b>55</b> according to a third embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9(</figref><i>b</i>), wherein like parts and components are designated by the same reference numerals to avoid duplicating description.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The brush holder <b>55</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> is integrally formed with the frame end <b>103</b> of the lower frame <b>511</b> and includes a support plate <b>117</b>, three front surface confronting plates <b>118</b>, and three pawls <b>119</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the ribs <b>102</b> are not formed on the upper frame <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The support plate <b>117</b> is substantially rectangular in shape and elongated in the longitudinal direction of the tongue part <b>104</b>. An upper step part <b>120</b> is formed a level higher than the tongue part <b>104</b>. The support plate <b>117</b> is provided along the length of the upper step part <b>120</b> protruding upward therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The three front surface confronting plates <b>118</b> are disposed along the base end of the tongue part <b>104</b>, protruding upward and separated at predetermined intervals from each other in the longitudinal direction of the tongue part <b>104</b>. The centrally disposed front surface confronting plate <b>118</b> is shorter in the longitudinal direction than the front surface confronting plates <b>118</b> disposed on either side. Further, each of the front surface confronting plates <b>118</b> protrudes higher than the upper step part <b>120</b> and is separated from the support plate <b>117</b> at a predetermined distance. With this construction, a recessed part <b>166</b> is formed between the support plate <b>117</b> and the front surface confronting plates <b>118</b> for fitting over one of the mounting portions <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The three pawls <b>119</b> are provided on the top edge of the support plate <b>117</b> at predetermined intervals in the longitudinal direction of the support plate <b>117</b> and at positions corresponding to the three front surface confronting plates <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Each of the pawls <b>119</b> has a cross-section forming three sides of a box and integrally configured of a support part <b>121</b> extending upward from the top edge of the support plate <b>117</b>; a connecting part <b>122</b> extending forward from the top edge of the support part <b>121</b>; and a pawl part <b>123</b> disposed on the front edge of the connecting part <b>122</b> and confronting the top edge of the front surface confronting plate <b>118</b>. A predetermined gap is formed between the bottom edge of the pawl part <b>123</b> and the top edge of the front surface confronting plate <b>118</b>. Further, each pawl <b>119</b> is elastic or resilient and can deform to expand the gap between the bottom edge of the pawl part <b>123</b> and the top edge of the front surface confronting plate <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The tip of the pawl part <b>123</b> tapers to form a substantially triangular cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">With the brush holder <b>55</b> having this construction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>a</i>), one of the mounting portions <b>58</b> on the base member <b>57</b> is fitted into the recessed part <b>166</b> (between the support plate <b>117</b> and front surface confronting plates <b>118</b>) so that the base member <b>57</b> contacts the pawl part <b>123</b> of the pawl <b>119</b>. By pressing the base member <b>57</b> on the side nearest the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> against the pawl part <b>123</b> rearward toward the support plate <b>117</b> (a direction A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8)</figref>, the pawl <b>119</b> elastically deforms so that the other mounting portion <b>58</b> on the base member <b>57</b> is guided along the tip of the pawl part <b>123</b> and received between the support part <b>121</b> and pawl part <b>123</b> of the pawl <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>b</i>), when the other mounting portion <b>58</b> is received between the support part <b>121</b> and pawl part <b>123</b>, the pawl <b>119</b> is restored to its original form and thus retains the mounting portion <b>58</b> in an engaged state in the pawl <b>119</b>. Accordingly, the other mounting portion <b>58</b> is held by the three pawls <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In this way, the first mounting portion <b>58</b> can be held reliably by the recessed part <b>166</b>, while the other mounting portion <b>58</b> can be held by the three pawls <b>119</b>.

<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Moreover, when the first mounting portion <b>58</b> is engaged in the recessed part <b>166</b>, the brush <b>54</b> can be mounted in the brush holder <b>55</b> through a simple operation of pressing the base member <b>57</b> on the side facing the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> toward the pawls <b>119</b> to fit the other mounting portion <b>58</b> in the pawls <b>119</b>. Hence, the operation of mounting the brush <b>54</b> in the brush holder <b>55</b> can be simplified through a simple construction of the recessed part <b>166</b> and the three pawls <b>119</b>. Hence, the present embodiment can further facilitate replacement operations for the brush <b>54</b> and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Further, the brush holder <b>55</b> is integrally provided with the lower frame <b>511</b> that supports the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>, and the brush <b>54</b> is supported on the brush holder <b>55</b>. Hence, this construction reduces the number of required parts and can more accurately dispose the brush <b>54</b> in relation to the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>. As a result, the brush <b>54</b> can more efficiently recover paper dust and the like that has been deposited on the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">While the brush holder <b>55</b> in the present embodiment includes three front surface confronting plates <b>118</b> and three pawls <b>119</b>, the number of these components is not limited to three.

<p id="p-0231" num="0230">The upstream end of the support plate <b>59</b> is formed continuously with the two side walls <b>60</b> disposed on the latitudinal sides so that this end cannot bend substantively in the thickness direction of the support plate <b>59</b> (front-to-rear direction). In other words, the upstream end of the support plate <b>59</b>, on which the stopper <b>62</b> is provided, has rigidity that substantially prevents bending in the thickness direction of the support plate <b>59</b>.</p>

Accordingly, the brush material <b>53</b> is elastically urged toward the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> from the rear surface <b>57</b>R of the base member <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the electrode <b>56</b> is provided in the brush holder <b>55</b>.

<p id="p-0237" num="0236">The engaging parts <b>68</b> are formed one on either latitudinal edge of the electrode <b>56</b> in the middle of the electrode <b>56</b> with respect to the longitudinal direction and are aligned with one another in the latitudinal direction.</p>

<p id="p-0239" num="0238">The terminal part <b>70</b> is formed on the end of the electrode <b>56</b> opposite the contact part <b>69</b> and is bent substantially at a right angle to the rear surface <b>59</b>R of the support plate <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the electrode <b>56</b> is inserted through the electrode insertion area <b>92</b> and mounted in the brush holder <b>55</b> by engaging the engaging parts <b>68</b> with the contact walls <b>61</b> so that the contact part <b>69</b> is disposed on the front surface <b>59</b>F of the support plate <b>59</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0242" num="0241">With this brush unit <b>52</b>, the brush <b>54</b> is mounted in the brush holder <b>55</b> in the following way.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, first, the downstream end <b>57</b>A of the brush <b>54</b> is aligned with the upstream end of the brush holder <b>55</b>, and the brush <b>54</b> is inserted through the upstream end of the brush holder <b>55</b> so that the mounting portions <b>58</b> of the base member <b>57</b> are interposed between the pawls <b>63</b> and the support plate <b>59</b>. Next, the brush <b>54</b> is slid into the brush holder <b>55</b> in the insertion direction until the downstream end <b>57</b>A of the base member <b>57</b> contacts the contact walls <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">When the downstream end <b>57</b>A of the base member <b>57</b> has contacted the contact walls <b>61</b>, the upstream end of the base member <b>57</b> is engaged with the stopper <b>62</b>. In this way, the brush <b>54</b> is mounted in the brush holder <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">With this brush unit <b>52</b>, when the brush <b>54</b> is slid into the brush holder <b>55</b> in the insertion direction, that is, the longitudinal direction of the base member <b>57</b>, the brush holder <b>55</b> receives the brush <b>54</b> and the brush <b>54</b> becomes mounted in the brush holder <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">When the brush <b>54</b> is mounted in the brush holder <b>55</b>, the pawls <b>63</b> apply pressure to and hold the mounting portions <b>58</b> provided on the latitudinal ends <b>57</b>B of the base member <b>57</b>. Since the pawls <b>63</b> hold the mounting portions <b>58</b> without increasing the size of the base member <b>57</b>, the brush <b>54</b> can be securely mounted in the brush holder <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">As a result, the brush <b>54</b> can be formed in a compact size, reducing the overall size of the device, and the time and effort to replace the brush <b>54</b> can be reduced. Further, since the pawls <b>63</b> hold the mounting portions <b>58</b> on both latitudinal ends <b>573</b> of the base member <b>57</b>, the base member <b>57</b> can be accurately positioned, thereby positioning the brush <b>54</b> appropriately with respect to the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Further, since the brush holder <b>55</b> is formed integrally with the frame <b>510</b>, it is possible to reduce the number of required parts in this brush unit <b>52</b> and eliminate the inconvenience of attaching the brush holder <b>55</b> to the frame <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">The pawls <b>63</b> provided in the brush unit <b>52</b> can reliably support the base member <b>57</b> by pressing against the surface of the mounting portions <b>58</b>. Accordingly, through a simple construction the base member <b>57</b> can be reliably supported while minimizing resistance on the base member <b>57</b> in the insertion direction. This construction also minimizes resistance on the base member <b>57</b> in the direction that the base member <b>57</b> is slidingly removed.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">When mounting the brush <b>54</b> on the brush holder <b>55</b> in this brush unit <b>52</b>, the base member <b>57</b> is slid over the support plate <b>59</b> in the insertion direction until the longitudinal end surface <b>57</b>A of the base member <b>57</b> contacts the contact wall <b>61</b>, thereby restricting movement of the base member <b>57</b> in the insertion direction and ensuring that the base member <b>57</b> is mounted in the correct position. In other words, the base member <b>57</b> is mounted in the correct position when slid in the insertion direction until the longitudinal end surface <b>57</b>A of the base member <b>57</b> contacts the contact wall <b>61</b>. As a result, the mounting operation for the brush <b>54</b> can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Once the brush <b>54</b> is supported in the brush holder <b>55</b>, movement of the brush <b>54</b> is restricted even if an attempt is made to pull the brush <b>54</b> out in a withdrawal direction because the stopper <b>62</b> protruding from the surface of the support plate <b>59</b> at the end opposite the contact walls <b>61</b> contacts the other longitudinal end surface <b>57</b>A of the base member <b>57</b>. Hence, once the brush <b>54</b> is supported in the brush holder <b>55</b>, the brush <b>54</b> cannot be removed from the brush holder <b>55</b> by moving the brush <b>54</b> in the withdrawal direction. Accordingly, a simple construction can reliably prevent the brush <b>54</b> from being removed from the brush holder <b>55</b>, enabling the brush holder <b>55</b> to reliably support the brush <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">Further, since the stopper <b>62</b> is integrally formed with the end of the support plate <b>59</b> that cannot bend substantively in the thickness direction, the present embodiment facilitates formation of the stopper <b>62</b> that can reliably prevent the brush <b>54</b> from being removed.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">To remove the brush <b>54</b> from the brush holder <b>55</b>, the end of the base member <b>57</b> near the stopper <b>62</b> must be raised slightly off the front surface <b>59</b>F of the support plate <b>59</b> to disengage this end of the base member <b>57</b> from the stopper <b>62</b>. Subsequently, the base member <b>57</b> may be pulled in the withdrawal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Further, since the elastic piece <b>66</b> of the elastic pieces <b>64</b> is elastically deformed, the contact part <b>67</b> on the elastic piece <b>66</b> contacts the rear surface <b>57</b>R of the base member <b>57</b> and elastically urges the mounting portions <b>58</b> toward the pawls <b>63</b>. Therefore, the brush material <b>53</b> can be reliably positioned on the support plate <b>59</b> and placed in contact with the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b>, enabling the brush material <b>53</b> to remove paper dust from the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Further, when the electrode <b>56</b> is provided in the brush holder <b>55</b>, and the brush <b>54</b> is supported on the brush holder <b>55</b>, the electrode <b>56</b> can apply a cleaning bias to the brush material <b>53</b> via the base member <b>57</b>. Accordingly, a cleaning bias can be applied to the brush material <b>53</b> through a simple construction that does not require a separate connection between the electrode <b>56</b> and the brush material <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">Moreover, since the contact part <b>69</b> of the electrode <b>56</b> is positioned on the surface of the support plate <b>59</b>, the contact part <b>69</b> contacts the rear surface <b>57</b>R of the base member <b>57</b> when the brush <b>54</b> is supported in the brush holder <b>55</b>. Hence, a cleaning bias can be applied to the brush material <b>53</b> easily and reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">By providing the laser printer <b>201</b> with the process cartridge <b>217</b> of the present embodiment that is capable of being made more compact and reducing the inconvenience in such operations as replacing the brush <b>54</b>, a more compact laser printer <b>201</b> can be manufactured that facilitates maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Next, a brush holder <b>55</b> according to a twelfth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, wherein like parts and components are designated with the same reference numerals to avoid duplicating description. In the eleventh embodiment described above, the brush holder <b>55</b> is formed integrally with the frame <b>510</b>.

<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Since the brush holder <b>55</b> is formed separately from and later attached to the frame <b>510</b>, the brush holder <b>55</b> can be removed from the frame <b>510</b> when replacing the brush <b>54</b>, thereby facilitating replacement operations for the brush <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a front view showing a brush holder <b>55</b> according to a thirteenth embodiment of the present invention, wherein like parts and components are designated with the same reference numerals to avoid duplicating description.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">In the brush holder <b>55</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the pawls <b>63</b> include pawls <b>63</b>A confronting the upper mounting portion <b>58</b> and pawls <b>63</b>B confronting the lower mounting portion <b>58</b> that alternate in a staggered formation so as not to face one another across the support plate <b>59</b> (or the brush material <b>53</b> when the brush <b>54</b> is mounted). In other words, no two pawls <b>63</b> are disposed at the same position in the insertion direction.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">By staggering the pawls <b>63</b> on either side of the support plate <b>59</b> in this way, the base member <b>57</b> can slide more smoothly when inserted into the brush holder <b>55</b>. Therefore, this configuration ensures that the base member <b>57</b> can be smoothly mounted in and removed from the brush holder <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>c</i>), each pawl <b>63</b> has a sloped surface <b>71</b> that slopes from a front surface <b>63</b>F of the pawl <b>63</b> to a rear surface <b>63</b>R in the insertion direction for guiding the brush <b>54</b> in the insertion direction. The rear surface <b>63</b>R of the pawl <b>63</b> confronts the front surface <b>57</b>F of the base member <b>57</b>, when the base member <b>57</b> is mounted in the brush holder <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">With the pawls <b>63</b> having this construction, the base member <b>57</b> can be smoothly guided in the insertion direction when inserting the base member <b>57</b> into the brush holder <b>55</b>, even when the longitudinal end surface <b>57</b>A of the base member <b>57</b> contacts the sloped surface <b>71</b> of the pawl <b>63</b>. This construction ensures that the base member <b>57</b> can be smoothly mounted in and removed from the brush holder <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">Further, a resilient part <b>72</b> having a substantially rectangular shape that extends in the longitudinal direction of the support plate <b>59</b> is formed in the latitudinal (widthwise) center region of the support plate <b>59</b> on the stopper <b>62</b> end by cutting out portions of the support plate <b>59</b> adjacent to the side wall <b>60</b> on this end, which portions are elongated in the longitudinal direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>a</i>), the stopper <b>62</b> is integrally formed on the free end of the resilient part <b>72</b> and protrudes from the front surface of the resilient part <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">The stopper <b>62</b> is in a restricting position RP when the resilient part <b>72</b> is not bent for preventing removal of the brush <b>54</b> and is withdrawn from the restricting position RP when the resilient part <b>72</b> is bent toward the rear surface <b>59</b>R of the support plate <b>59</b>, as indicated by the dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>a</i>). At this time, the stopper <b>62</b> is in a withdrawal position WP for allowing removal of the brush <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">With this construction, the stopper <b>62</b> is easy to form and can be moved from the restricting position RP to the withdrawal position WP by bending the resilient part <b>72</b> in the thickness direction. Hence, while the stopper <b>62</b> is normally in the restricting position RP and can reliably prevent removal of the brush <b>54</b> from the brush holder <b>55</b>, the brush <b>54</b> can easily be removed from the brush holder <b>55</b> by bending the resilient part <b>72</b> and moving the stopper <b>62</b> to the withdrawal position WP when replacing the brush <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">Further, in the brush holder <b>55</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, a plurality of compressed springs <b>74</b> are provided in place of the elastic pieces <b>64</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>b</i>). One end of each compressed spring <b>74</b> is fixed to the frame <b>510</b>, while the other end passes through the opening <b>75</b> in the support plate <b>59</b> and presses against the rear surface <b>57</b>R of the base member <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">In addition, the cleaning bias applying power source <b>76</b> disposed in the main casing <b>2</b> is connected to one end of each compressed spring <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">By inserting the compressed springs <b>74</b> through the openings <b>75</b> in place of the elastic pieces <b>64</b>, the compressed springs <b>74</b> are arranged on the rear surface of the mounting portions <b>5</b>B at positions corresponding to each pawl <b>63</b> when the brush <b>54</b> is mounted in the brush holder <b>55</b>. Hence, the mounting portions <b>58</b> are firmly pushed against the pawls <b>63</b>, enabling the brush holder <b>55</b> to reliably hold the brush <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">By connecting the cleaning bias applying power source <b>76</b> to one end of each compressed spring <b>74</b>, the compressed spring <b>74</b> also functions as the electrode <b>56</b>, thereby eliminating the need to provide the electrode <b>56</b> in the brush holder <b>55</b>. As a result, it is possible to reliably place the brush material <b>53</b> in contact with the surface <b>27</b>S of the photosensitive drum <b>27</b> and to apply a cleaning bias, while reducing the number of required parts.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> shows a portion of a brush holder <b>55</b> according to a fourteenth embodiment of the present invention, wherein like parts and components are designated with the same reference numerals to avoid duplicating description. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, a side wall <b>73</b> of the frame <b>510</b> may also serve as a restricting wall in place of the stopper <b>62</b> of the thirteenth embodiment. In other words, the stopper <b>62</b> is not formed on the end of the brush holder <b>55</b>. When the brush holder <b>55</b> is mounted on the mounting base <b>65</b> of the frame <b>510</b>, the side wall <b>73</b> of the frame <b>510</b> contacts and closes the end of the brush holder <b>55</b>, thereby restricting movement of the brush <b>54</b> in the withdrawal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">With this construction, the function of the stopper <b>62</b> in the thirteenth embodiment is performed by the side wall <b>73</b>, which is separate from the brush holder <b>55</b>. The side wall <b>73</b> is fitted against the end of the brush holder <b>55</b> when the brush holder <b>55</b> is mounted on the frame <b>510</b>. Therefore, movement of the brush <b>54</b> in the withdrawal direction can be restricted without needing to provide the stopper <b>62</b> on the brush holder <b>55</b>, thereby simplifying formation of the brush holder <b>55</b>.</p>
