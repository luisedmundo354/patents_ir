<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention was made with government support under Grant No. 5T32 CA09 206-27 awarded by the National Institute of Health. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.</p>
<?GOVINT description="Government Interest" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to radiation therapy equipment for the treatment of tumors or the like and specifically to an improved method of characterizing the radiation beam of such systems and confirming the dose received by the patient using a portal image of radiation exiting the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Medical equipment for radiation therapy treats tumorous tissue with high energy radiation. The dose and the placement of the dose must be accurately controlled to insure both that the tumor receives sufficient radiation to be destroyed, and that damage to the surrounding and adjacent non-tumorous tissue is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Internal-source radiation therapy places capsules of radioactive material inside the patient in proximity to the tumorous tissue. Dose and placement are accurately controlled by the physical positioning of the isotope. However, internal-source radiation therapy has the disadvantages of any surgically invasive procedure, including discomfort to the patient and risk of infection.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">External-source radiation therapy uses a radiation source that is external to the patient, typically either a radioisotope, such as <sup>60</sup>Co, or a high energy x-ray source, such as a linear accelerator. The external source produces a collimated beam directed into the patient to the tumor site. External-source radiation therapy avoids some of the problems of internal-source radiation therapy, but it undesirably and necessarily irradiates a significant volume of non-tumorous or healthy tissue in the path of the radiation beam along with the tumorous tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The adverse effect of irradiating of healthy tissue may be reduced, while maintaining a given dose of radiation in the tumorous tissue, by projecting the external radiation beam into the patient at a variety of “gantry” angles with the beams converging on the tumor site. The particular volume elements of healthy tissue, along the path of the radiation beam thus change as the gantry rotates around the subject, reducing the total dose to each such element of healthy tissue during the entire treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The irradiation of healthy tissue also may be reduced by tightly collimating the radiation beam to the general cross section of the tumor taken perpendicular to the axis of the radiation beam. Numerous systems exist for producing such a circumferential collimation, some of which use multiple sliding shutters which, piecewise, may generate a radio-opaque mask of arbitrary outline.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The radiation beam may also be controlled by insertion of wedges or blocks into the beam to reduce the intensity or fluence of the beam by means of attenuation in some areas. U.S. Pat. No. 5,317,616 issued May 31, 1994, incorporated by reference and assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, describes a shutter system that provides an alternative to wedges for reducing fluence or intensity portions of the radiation beam by temporally changing the radiation beam with collimator leaves.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to confirm the positioning of the collimation blades and blocks used in a particular radiation therapy session, a “portal image” may be obtained in which treatment radiation exiting from the patient is recorded on x-ray film or the like. A visual examination of this image provides a radiograph that gives a gross indication that the “geometry” of the radiation beam is correct.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) are becoming standard features on medical linear accelerators for radiotherapy. These devices enable one to form an anatomical x-ray image of a patient using the high energy treatment beam (average photon energy approximately 2 MeV). Image quality, however, is significantly worse than that routinely achieved in low energy diagnostic x-ray imaging devices for two main reasons, both related to energies of the photons in the beam.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">First, most of the contrast in a low energy diagnostic x-ray image comes from the photoelectric effect. Photoelectric absorption of the x-ray photons is proportional to the cube of the atomic number of the absorber. This is why bone (Z=12.5) and soft tissue (Z=7.4) are easily differentiated in a diagnostic x-ray image [(12.5/7.4)^3=5]. Photons with energies above approximately 50 keV interact primarily via Compton scattering, which is independent of atomic number. The rate of Compton interaction of high energy x-rays is simply proportional to electron density. Bone (approx. 5E29 electrons/cc) and soft tissue (approx. 3E29 electrons/cc) are therefore discernable in high energy x-ray images, but contrast is much poorer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The second problem with high energy x-ray imaging is the nature of Compton interactions versus photoelectric interactions. In a low energy photon interacting via the photoelectric effect the photon is completely absorbed by an electron and does not reach the detector. High energy photons undergoing Compton interactions are not absorbed, however, but instead, they are scattered through some angle. These scattered photons reach the detector and contribute to an image ‘fog’ that further obscures the (already marginal) image detail.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The treatment beams from medical linear accelerators are not monoenergetic, but instead contain an entire spectrum of photon energies ranging from zero up to the nominal energy of the beam (e.g. 6 MeV). Therefore there is, in principle, a good quality image formed by low energy photons in the beam, but it is entirely obscured by the low contrast and scatter contributed by the much more prevalent high energy photons.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is an improvement to radiation therapy systems which enables higher quality portal images to be produced from the treatment beam and during the treatment process. The invention includes a chopper which is constructed to modulate the intensity of the low energy components of the treatment beam while leaving the higher energy components therein substantially unmodulated. A detector receives the treatment beam after it passes through the subject being treated and produces corresponding signals. The modulated signal components therein are separated and used to produce images during the treatment process.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An object of the invention is to remove from the portal images the high energy components of the image signal and the components related to Compton scatter. This is achieved by modulating the desired low energy components of the treatment beam and retaining the resulting modulated signal components in the video signals to produce the displayed images.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a radiation therapy system <b>10</b>, suitable for use in the present invention, includes a radiation source <b>12</b> producing a radiation beam <b>14</b> directed across a patient support table <b>16</b> that may hold a patient (not shown) or a calibration phantom <b>32</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The radiation beam <b>14</b> may be a megavoltage x-ray beam (e.g., 6-10 megavolts) or other photon source suitable for radiation therapy. The radiation beam <b>14</b>, as shown, is collimated to a fan shape; however, the invention is equally applicable to “cone beams” of radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">After passing through the patient support table <b>16</b> and either the patient or a calibration phantom <b>32</b>, the beam <b>14</b> is received by an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) <b>18</b> having a detector surface <b>19</b> corresponding to the cross-sectional area of the beam <b>14</b>. EPID <b>18</b> produces electronic signals providing measurements of the dose of the radiation received at regularly spaced positions, or pixel locations over the detector surface <b>19</b>. Thus, the portal imaging device <b>18</b> generally provides the data of a projection image through the patient or phantom <b>32</b> along an axis of the radiation beam <b>14</b> at an arbitrary angle.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The EPID <b>18</b> is a flat panel Silicon, or Si detector. It includes a detector surface <b>19</b> formed of a phosphor layer that emits light when struck by x-rays. A two-dimensional array of Si photodiodes are disposed beneath the phosphor layer and each is connected to a thin film transistor. Each photodiode and thin film transistor form a pixel in the EPID <b>18</b> that accumulates charge in proportion to the x-rays striking the phosphor layer above it. The accumulated charges are read out of the detector elements one column at a time, amplified and converted to corresponding 16-bit digital values. As will be described further below, each column of digital pixel values in the EPID <b>18</b> are read out in sequence by a frame grabber and used to produce a portal image of the subject being treated. It should be apparent that other detector technologies such as CCD and MOSFET may be used in this application.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The EPID <b>18</b> and radiation source <b>12</b> are mounted in opposition about the patient support table <b>16</b> on a rotating gantry <b>26</b>. The patient support table <b>16</b> may be tipped so that, together with rotation of the gantry <b>26</b>, the beam <b>14</b> may be directed at the patient or phantom <b>32</b> from a variety of angles as is understood in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The signals from the EPID <b>18</b> are transmitted to a computer <b>20</b> where it is converted into a matrix of digital values; the values indicate the dose of radiation at each point of the detector surface <b>19</b>. Computer <b>20</b> includes a display terminal <b>22</b> for displaying images and text and a keyboard <b>24</b> for user entry of data.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the beam <b>14</b> of radiation diverges from a focal point <b>28</b> within the radiation source <b>12</b> and is directed generally along a radiation axis <b>30</b> toward a phantom <b>32</b> (or patient not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) resting on top of the support table <b>16</b>. Ideally, the beam <b>14</b>, as emitted from the radiation source <b>12</b> with coarse collimation (not shown) has an essentially uniform beam fluence profile <b>34</b> referring to its intensity throughout its cross-sectional area, measured in a plane perpendicular to the axis <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In practice, the beam fluence profile <b>34</b> will deviate from perfect uniformity, even after the interposition of a flattening filter and other adjustment of the radiation source <b>12</b> known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For this reason, as will be described below, it is typical to make measurements of phantoms <b>32</b> in the beam <b>14</b> to account for any non-uniformity.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Beam <b>14</b> is next collimated by collimator blocks <b>36</b> which determine the outline of the beam that will ultimately be received by the patient or phantom <b>32</b>. Collimator blocks <b>36</b> are radio-opaque and may be used, for example, to match the beam width to the outline of a tumor.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The collimated radiation beam <b>14</b> is next received by wedges <b>38</b> which serve to reduce the intensity of certain rays within the radiation beam <b>14</b> as is well understood in the art. The wedges <b>38</b> are placed so as to better control the desired dose to particular areas of the patient during radiation treatment and to compensate for varying thicknesses of the intervening tissue of the patient. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, wedges <b>38</b> decrease the intensity of the edge rays of the beam <b>14</b> that pass through portions of the phantom <b>32</b> where the phantom is substantially thinner as might be desired to reduce dose to these areas in a human patient.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">After the radiation of the beam <b>14</b> exits the phantom <b>32</b>, it may be recorded as a portal image <b>40</b>, the portal image <b>40</b> being the measure of the dose of the beam <b>14</b> throughout its cross-sectional area in a plane perpendicular to the axis <b>30</b> after exiting the patient or phantom <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the computer workstation <b>20</b> includes a processor <b>21</b> which executes program instructions stored in a memory <b>25</b> that forms part of a storage system <b>23</b>. The processor <b>21</b> is a commercially available device designed to operate with one of the Microsoft Corporation Windows operating systems. It includes internal memory and I/O control to facilitate system integration and integral memory management circuitry for handing all external memory <b>25</b>. The processor <b>21</b> also includes a PCI bus driver which provides a direct interface with a 32-bit PCI bus <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The PCI bus <b>27</b> is an industry standard bus that transfers 32-bits of data between the processor <b>21</b> and a number of peripheral controller cards. These include a PCI EIDE controller <b>52</b> which provides a high-speed transfer of data to and from a CD ROM drive <b>54</b> and a disc drive <b>39</b>. A graphics controller <b>56</b> couples the PCI bus <b>27</b> to the CRT monitor <b>22</b> through a standard VGA connection <b>58</b>, and a keyboard and mouse controller <b>60</b> receives data that is manually input through a keyboard and mouse <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The PCI bus <b>27</b> also connects to a communications controller <b>62</b>. The controller <b>62</b> connects to an intranet that links the workstation <b>20</b> to other institution systems such as imaging systems, PAC systems and treatment systems.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The PCI bus <b>27</b> is also coupled to the radiation source <b>12</b> through an x-ray control <b>70</b>. The x-ray control <b>70</b> enables the source <b>12</b> to be controlled by commands received from the PCI bus <b>27</b>. The source <b>12</b> is thus under the control of software executed by the processor <b>21</b> during a treatment procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The read out of the charge accumulation in the EPID <b>18</b> is also under software control. A frame grabber <b>72</b> connects to the PCI bus <b>21</b> and issues read out commands to the EPID <b>18</b> over control line <b>74</b>. Each column of the two-dimensional array of pixel charge data is read out over bus <b>76</b> and stored in the frame grabber <b>72</b>. The two-dimensional charge image that results when all the columns have been read are then transferred to memory <b>25</b> for further processing as will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An important aspect of the present invention is the modulation of the x-ray beam <b>14</b> produced by the source <b>12</b>. Referring particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, this is accomplished by mounting a chopper wheel <b>80</b> adjacent the source <b>12</b> and positioning it to intercept the x-ray beam. The chopper wheel <b>80</b> is rotated about an axis <b>82</b> that is parallel to the x-ray beam axis <b>30</b> and alternate thick and thin segments of the wheel <b>80</b> are rotated into the beam <b>14</b> to alternately block and pass low energy photons.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The chopper wheel <b>80</b> is rotated by a motor <b>82</b>. The motor <b>82</b> is in turn driven by a motor control <b>84</b> that interfaces to the PCI bus <b>27</b>. The rotation of the chopper wheel <b>80</b> and its alignment (attenuation or no attenuation) in the beam <b>14</b> is, therefore, under software control.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The chopper wheel <b>80</b> is constructed to alternately block and pass the lower energy x-rays while imposing minimal attenuation of the high energy x-rays.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The concept is to modulate the low energy x-rays that will be used to produce the portal image while having a minimum impact on the remainder of the treatment x-rays. There are many materials that will accomplish this, but in the preferred embodiment a 0.75 mm thick aluminum foil is used for the beam blocking wheel segments and a 0.20 mm thick molybdenum foil is used for the beam passing wheel segments. This choice enables the thickness to be minimized with two materials having very similar x-ray absorption cross-sections (z). The high energy material (molybdenum) determines the high energy cutoff of the ‘energy window’ selected for modulation by the chopper wheel <b>80</b>. Molybdenum is chosen because its Z (<b>42</b>) is fairly high, it is inexpensive, stable, and readily available. Higher Z materials (lead, tungsten, etc.) are less ideal because they have x-ray absorption lines within the desirable ‘energy window’ which serve to reduce the amount of modulation that can be achieved. After the high Z material is chosen, the thickness is chosen such that the majority of photons with energies within the desirable low energy window are blocked while the majority of photons with energies above the desirable window are passed (preferably greater than 99% transmission at 2 MeV). As a result, the low energy photons will be heavily modulated while the high energy photons are modulated only slightly. The slight modulation that does affect the high energy photons can be reduced by the addition of the low Z material. A thickness of low Z material is selected to provide very nearly the same transmission of high energy photons (&gt;99%) as the chosen high Z material—this is the region where (Z-independent) Compton interactions predominate—while simultaneously providing high transmission of the photons with energies within the lower energy window—the region where (Z-dependent) photoelectric interactions predominate. Because the transmission curves for different materials are shaped slightly differently, it is desirable to keep the thickness to a minimum in order to make the cancellation of the modulation on the high energy photons more complete across a wide range of energies.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With the preferred chopper wheel construction the high energy x-ray photons are not significantly attenuated by either the beam pass or the beam block segments. In the range of 1 MeV to 6 MeV an attenuation of &lt;1% is expected from the blocking and the passing chopper wheel segments. On the other hand, x-rays in the lower energy range around 50 keV are attenuated 75% by the beam blocking segment and only 7% by the beam passing chopper wheel segments. Little modulation of the high energy x-rays results and the signals acquired by the EPID <b>18</b> which are attributable to high energy x-rays are not significantly affected. On the other hand, the low energy x-rays that are suitable for diagnostic imaging are modulated and the amplitude of the signals acquired by the EPID <b>18</b> which are attributable to low energy x-ray photons vary over time in a pattern that corresponds to the modulation frequency. In the preferred embodiment the EPID <b>18</b> produces 30 images per second and the chopper wheel <b>80</b> is rotated at a speed which modulates the low energy x-rays at 15 Hz. The x-ray beam <b>14</b> is thus sampled by the EPID <b>18</b> at twice the frequency of the modulation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The image frames that are received through the frame grabber <b>72</b> at a rate of 30 per second are stored in memory <b>25</b> and processed to separate all the components therein which are modulated at 15 Hz. Thus, the unmodulated high energy x-ray beam components and the components produced by compton scatter are removed. The separated components produce a much higher quality portal image and may be stored for later use, sent to another cite through the communications controller <b>62</b> or displayed on screen <b>22</b> in near real time as the treatment procedure is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The separating of the modulated 15 Hz components can be done in many different ways. For example, a “lock-in circuit” may be constructed as part of the EPID <b>18</b> or the frame grabber <b>72</b> to demodulate the sequence of image frames as they are received. Such a demodulator is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, where the input signal V<sub>in</sub>(t) may be an analog signal produced by one pixel in the EPID <b>18</b> before it is digitized therein, or it may be the stream of digitized signals from the EPID pixel. In either case, the input signal V<sub>in</sub>(t) is multiplied at <b>200</b> by a reference signal V<sub>ref</sub>(t), which is the beam modulation frequency, and the result is low pass filtered at <b>202</b>. The analog version of this demodulator is constructed as part of the EPID <b>18</b>, whereas the digital version is constructed as part of the frame grabber <b>72</b>. The reference signal V<sub>ref</sub>(t) may be produced by the motor control <b>84</b>, but preferably is produced by a sensor (not shown) that detects the orientation of the chopper wheel <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the preferred embodiment this separating function is accomplished under software control using a boxcar averaging with baseline subtraction. This is done by subtracting the signal magnitude at corresponding pixels in successive pairs of acquired image frames. That is, the digitized detector signals at corresponding pixels in successive image frames are subtracted from one another to produce a difference image frame. The resulting difference image frames are produced at a rate of 15 image frames per second and these depict the intensity of the detected low energy x-rays. The ill affects caused by the detected high energy x-rays and detected Compton scatter are not seen.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">During a treatment procedure the x-ray source <b>12</b> is turned on and the gantry <b>26</b> is rotated to treat the tumor in a patient placed on the table <b>16</b>. Simultaneously, low energy image frames are produced in near real time and displayed on the screen <b>22</b> at 15 frames per second. These images enable the physician to more accurately monitor the treatment process.</p>
