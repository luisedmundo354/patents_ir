<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Various embodiments may relate generally to measuring accuracy, and particular embodiments may relate to methods and systems for measuring accuracy of gas meters and volume correctors.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Fluids, such as natural gas, may be transported, distributed, and sold to end-users through distribution systems. For example, a gas-fired furnace of an apartment complex may receive natural gas through a gas line. The gas consumption by end users varies over time. For residential users, for example, demand may typically decrease during summer, and increase through the winter.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To measure the amount of gas consumed by a user, a gas meter may be installed on the gas line. One type of gas meter is a rotary gas meter. Gas flowing through the meter to the end-user appliance causes an impeller to rotate. Each rotation of the impeller corresponds to a certain amount of gas passing through the meter, the precise amount being dependent on factors such as the line pressure, flow rate, temperature, etc. As such, rotation of the impeller may be monitored to determine the amount of gas that is passing through the meter and being consumed by the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Gas is typically sold by price per volume, e.g., dollars per 1000 cubic feet. Accurate gas billing, as well as other functions, may depend largely on accurate gas metering. To refine their accuracy, some meters have volume correctors to adjust the output of the gas meter to produce a more accurate measurement. Much like a gear, a volume corrector may adjust the output of a meter by, for example, a fixed ratio, such as 1003:1000. As another example, a volume corrector may adjust a gas meter output by +/−0.07%, depending on the particular meter and its installation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Where volume correctors are used, functions such as billing may rely on the combined accuracy of both the meter and the volume corrector. The accuracy of a gas meter alone can be checked using a transfer prover. The accuracy of a volume corrector can be separately checked by a dedicated measuring device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Systems and associated apparatus, methods, and computer program products, relate to measuring the combined accuracy of a gas meter and a volume corrector as a system. The measurement is performed with a transfer prover, and may be performed automatically on either integrated or non-integrated volume correctors and meters. In one embodiment, a test interface provides a convenient connection with controllable data switches for routing information between the meter/volume corrector, the transfer prover, and a processing device. Software running on the processing device can automatically configure the parameters for performing a combined accuracy test by downloading parameters from the meter/corrector and transfer prover via the test interface. Upon user selection of the test type, and optionally flow rates, for running the test, the software may configure data switches on the test interface to automatically perform the selected combined accuracy test.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some embodiments may provide one or more advantages. For example, accuracy testing of the combined meter and volume corrector can lead to a single, accurate test of the entire metering system. Automated parameter determination for a selected test type may reduce labor, requirements for specialized user training, and avoid manual computation errors. Some embodiments may be configured to perform a test that minimizes test time substantially, in some cases from one or two hours down to between about 30 to 60 seconds. As such, some embodiments may yield time savings, including reduced off-line time for meter testing, and/or labor and opportunity cost savings, while decreasing opportunities for test configuration errors and improving accuracy for the combined meter and volume corrector measurement system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows an exemplary test setup <b>100</b> for determining the accuracy of an integrated gas meter and corrector in a laboratory environment. The setup <b>100</b> includes an integrated gas meter and corrector <b>102</b> configured for testing to determine if the integrated meter/corrector <b>102</b>, combined as a whole, accurately measures the volume of a gas that is passed through a line <b>104</b>. In the test setup <b>100</b>, a gas, such as air, flows through the line <b>104</b>. A transfer prover <b>106</b> drives the test air flow along the line <b>104</b> using a blower. The transfer prover <b>106</b> also provides a reference volume measurement that may be compared to the measurement from the meter/corrector <b>102</b> to determine the accuracy of the meter/corrector <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this example, some or all of the steps of the test may be performed under the control and/or monitoring of a computer device <b>108</b>, such a portable (e.g., handheld, laptop, etc . . . ) computer in some embodiments. The computer device <b>108</b> is in communication with a test interface <b>110</b>. The test interface <b>110</b> routes control and data signals between the computer device <b>108</b> and the meter/corrector <b>102</b>. In addition, the test interface <b>110</b> routes data signals from the meter/corrector <b>102</b> to the transfer prover <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this example, the meter/corrector <b>102</b> includes a volume sensor <b>112</b>, a temperature sensor <b>114</b>, a pressure sensor <b>116</b>, and communication interfaces <b>118</b>A-B. In some implementations, the meter/corrector <b>102</b> includes a processing unit <b>120</b>. The meter/corrector <b>102</b> measures the volume of air flowing through the line <b>104</b> using the volume sensor <b>112</b>. The flow of air may cause an impeller (not shown) within the meter/corrector <b>102</b> to turn. Each turn of the impeller causes the meter/corrector <b>102</b> to generate a number of output pulses. The meter/corrector sends the output pulse information over the output pulse communication interface <b>118</b>B. In some implementations, the meter/corrector <b>102</b> may also send the output pulses over the serial communication and control interface <b>118</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The meter/corrector <b>102</b> has, in addition to the volume sensing functionality, correction functionality to correct the volume measurement based on the temperature and/or pressure within the line <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the temperature sensor <b>114</b> and/or the pressure sensor <b>116</b> may measure the temperature and pressure, respectively, within the line <b>104</b>. In other implementations, sensors for temperature and/or pressure may be configured to sense temperature external to the gas line <b>104</b>. For example, a temperature sensor may be placed in a temperature bath to simulate a temperature condition at the bath temperature. The meter/corrector <b>102</b> may use the temperature and/or pressure measurements to adjust the number of output pulses according to correction algorithms. The corrected output pulses may then be sent over the COM interfaces <b>118</b>A-B. In this example, the correction operation may be performed by the processing unit <b>120</b>. The processing unit <b>120</b> may include digital and/or analog circuitry, and may include programmable devices containing executable instructions (i.e. software). The meter/corrector <b>102</b> may be configured to output several different formats over the COM interfaces <b>118</b>A-B, such as, corrected pulses, uncorrected pulses, corrected pulses in proving mode, and uncorrected pulses in proving mode. The meter/corrector <b>102</b> may also output high frequency pulses over the COM interface <b>118</b>A. These formats will be described in further detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The transfer prover <b>106</b> includes a blower <b>122</b>, a volume sensor <b>124</b>, a temperature sensor <b>126</b>, and COM interfaces <b>128</b>A-B. The volume sensor <b>124</b> may include one or more meters that may be referred to as master meters. In some implementations, the transfer prover <b>106</b> may also include a processing unit <b>130</b> and/or a pressure sensor <b>132</b>. The transfer prover <b>106</b> provides the test air flow using the blower <b>122</b>. The transfer prover <b>106</b> measures the reference volume by monitoring the volume sensor <b>124</b>. The transfer prover <b>106</b> may correct the reference volume measurement based on measurements from the temperature sensor <b>126</b> and/or the pressure sensor <b>132</b>. In some examples, the pressure and/or temperature may be sensed external to the transfer prover. The transfer prover <b>106</b> may receive output pulses from the meter/corrector <b>102</b> via the COM interface <b>128</b>A, which is connected to the test interface <b>110</b>. The transfer prover <b>106</b> may process, store, transmit, or compare the output pulses. When the number of output pulses from the meter/corrector <b>102</b> matches the test flow volume, the transfer prover <b>106</b> may send the results of the test, such as the reference volume measurement and an error between the reference volume and the test volume, to the computer device <b>108</b> via the COM interface <b>128</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Some transfer provers may include two or more volume sensors (i.e., volume meters or “master meters”). Different sized volume meters, for example, may provide for accurate measurements over different ranges of flow rates. In this example, the transfer prover <b>106</b> includes two volume meters, a meter A and a meter B, which may have different flow rate capacities. Combined accuracy testing of meter/correctors may involve selecting the appropriate sized volume meter A,B based on the flow rate used for the accuracy test.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Using the test interface <b>110</b>, software running on the computer device <b>108</b> may control the flow of communication to and from the computer device <b>108</b> and the meter/corrector <b>102</b>. The software may also control the flow of output pulse signals from the meter/corrector <b>102</b> to the transfer prover <b>106</b>, using the test interface <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, software running on the computer device <b>108</b> may calculate the required number of test output pulses to be received from the meter/corrector <b>102</b> and the equivalent test volume. After temperature and pressure conditions within the line <b>104</b> substantially stabilize, the transfer prover <b>106</b> may start measuring the reference volume according to the output pulses received from the meter/corrector <b>102</b>. The transfer prover <b>106</b> counts the output pulses. When it receives the required number of test output pulses, the transfer prover <b>106</b> may determine the reference volume measured by the volume sensor <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, the computer device <b>108</b> may receive configuration parameters from the transfer prover <b>106</b>, such as the size of the selected master meter A, B within the transfer prover <b>106</b>, and pressure and/or temperature values in various places in the transfer prover <b>106</b>, via a data link <b>134</b>. The computer device <b>108</b> may send a control signal via link <b>136</b> to the test interface <b>110</b> instructing the test interface <b>110</b> to route communications between the computer device <b>108</b> and the COM interface <b>118</b>A of the meter/corrector <b>102</b>. The test interface <b>110</b> may operate one or more switches (e.g. multiplexers) to route the communications. The computer device <b>108</b> may receive configuration parameters from the meter/corrector <b>102</b>, via the link <b>136</b> and a link <b>138</b>. The parameters from the meter/corrector <b>102</b> may include information, such as a size of the meter, a type of the meter, a current configured test type, an indication of whether temperature correction will occur, an indication of whether pressure correction will occur, a current temperature measurement, and/or a current pressure measurement, for example. The computer device <b>108</b> may use parameters loaded from the transfer prover <b>106</b>, the meter/corrector <b>102</b>, and parameters specified by a user to validate and/or prepare to perform an accuracy test of the meter/corrector <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples, the computer device <b>108</b> may notify the user if the parameters for the test are invalid. For example, some types of output pulses may have a fixed pulse width, which may be expressed as a length of time (e.g. 100 milliseconds). As the rate of flow increases through the line <b>104</b>, the time between pulses may decrease. If the time between the start of each pulse is substantially equal to or less than the width of a pulse, then the pulses may overlap and become indistinguishable from one another. Accordingly, software running within the computer device <b>108</b> may check for the likelihood of this to occur in order to determine whether, for example, a selected test flow rate is valid. In some embodiments, the check may be determined based, at least in part, on parameters, such as the pulse output limits of the volume sensor <b>112</b> and the volume sensor <b>124</b>. If the selected flow rate is high enough that the pulses from either of the volume sensors <b>112</b> and <b>124</b> will overlap, then the test parameters may be deemed invalid and the user may be notified.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">After determining that the test parameters are valid, the computer device <b>108</b> may initiate the gas meter and volume corrector accuracy test. In one implementation of the gas meter and volume corrector accuracy test, the computer device <b>108</b> sends a control signal to the test interface <b>110</b> to instruct the test interface <b>110</b> to route a particular output pulse type from the meter/corrector <b>102</b> to the transfer prover <b>106</b> via the link <b>136</b>. The test interface <b>110</b> may receive output pulse information from the meter/corrector <b>102</b> via the link <b>138</b> and/or a link <b>140</b>. The test interface <b>110</b> may pass the pulse information to the transfer prover <b>106</b> via link <b>142</b> and COM interface <b>128</b>A. The computer device <b>108</b> may initiate the gas meter and volume corrector accuracy test by sending information representing a calculated number of test pulses to the transfer prover <b>106</b>, and signaling the transfer prover <b>106</b> to start the blower <b>122</b>. The transfer prover <b>106</b> may then measure reference pulses using the volume sensor <b>124</b> until the transfer prover <b>106</b> receives the calculated number of test pulses from the meter/corrector <b>102</b> through the test interface <b>110</b>. The calculated number of test pulses indicates that the meter/corrector <b>102</b> has measured the desired test volume. The transfer prover <b>106</b> sends the measured reference volume to the computer device <b>108</b>, as indicated by the data link <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">An error may be calculated between the test volume measured by the meter/corrector <b>102</b> and the reference volume measured by the transfer prover <b>106</b>. A test may be repeated and the results averaged to obtain a reliable test result. The test may be repeated one or more times at one or more flow rates to determine whether the meter/corrector <b>102</b> is accurate over a range of operating conditions, for example. In addition, one or more types of tests may be performed. For example, if the uncorrected pulses of the volume sensor <b>112</b> differ from the uncorrected pulses from the volume sensor <b>124</b>, over some threshold, then an error may be found in the volume metering element of the meter/corrector <b>102</b>. For another example, if the uncorrected pulses match and the corrected pulses differ, then the error may be due to the temperature and pressure correction elements of the meter/corrector <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows the exemplary test setup <b>100</b> for determining the accuracy of an integrated gas meter and corrector in a field environment. In this example, the line <b>104</b> may be designed to transport gas, for example, from an upstream portion <b>144</b> to a downstream portion <b>146</b>. Generally, the purpose of the meter/corrector <b>102</b> is to measure the volume of gas flowing through the line <b>104</b>. When the meter/corrector <b>102</b> is tested in the field environment, in line valves <b>148</b> and <b>150</b> may be closed to isolate the meter/corrector <b>102</b> from the rest of the line <b>104</b>. Bypass valves <b>152</b> and <b>154</b> may be opened to connect the transfer prover <b>106</b> to the meter/corrector <b>102</b> and to provide for airflow during the test. During the test, the blower <b>122</b> causes air to flow from the bypass valve <b>152</b>, through the meter/corrector <b>102</b>, the bypass valve <b>156</b>, and the transfer prover <b>106</b>. In the implementation shown here, the bypass line at <b>156</b>, <b>158</b> are open to atmospheric pressure. In some implementations, portions of the bypassed line may be closed or restricted to generate line pressures substantially above ambient air pressure. The operations for testing the meter/corrector <b>102</b> may be the same as those described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B-1C</figref> illustrate integrated volume correctors and meters. In a typical integrated meter, pulses may be generated based directly on the rotation of the impeller in the meter, e.g., one pulse per revolution. Such high frequency (HF) pulses may provide a high resolution. Another type of meter is a standard or non-integrated volume corrector and meter. In some embodiments of non-integrated systems, the pulse output from the volume sensor may be conditioned to generate a signal to the volume corrector at a rate corresponding to volume of gas through the meter. For example, a standard meter may send a pulse to a separate volume corrector once for every 10 cubic feet of gas that flows through the meter.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows another exemplary setup <b>100</b> for determining the accuracy of a standard (i.e., non-integrated) gas meter and corrector in a field environment. Here, the gas meter <b>102</b>A and the corrector <b>102</b>B are separate. The volume sensor <b>112</b> in the gas meter <b>102</b>A sends its output signal, which may be a pulse, to a signal conditioning device <b>160</b>. The signal conditioning device <b>160</b> prepares the pulses for transmission to the corrector <b>102</b>B via the link <b>162</b>. The corrector <b>102</b>B may modify the pulses based on the temperature and pressure, and may output the modified pulses through the COM interfaces <b>118</b>A and/or <b>118</b>B. In the test setup <b>100</b> with the standard gas meter and corrector, the high frequency (HF) output from the corrector <b>102</b>B may or may not be available. The high frequency output of the corrector <b>102</b>B requires that the corrector <b>102</b>B have access to the impeller within the volume sensor <b>112</b>. The corrector <b>102</b>B may output corrected pulses, uncorrected pulses, corrected pulses in proving mode, or uncorrected pulses in proving mode. The operations for testing the gas meter <b>102</b>A and corrector <b>102</b>B may be the same as those described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The test setup <b>100</b> may determine if an error produced by the test is due to the gas meter <b>102</b>A or the corrector <b>102</b>B. In addition, the setup <b>100</b> shown allows for the determination of an error introduced by the interface between the gas meter <b>102</b>A and the corrector <b>102</b>B via the link <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an exemplary implementation of the test interface <b>110</b>. The test interface <b>110</b> may route communication between the meter/corrector <b>102</b> and the computer device <b>108</b>. The meter/corrector <b>102</b> may be an integrated gas meter and corrector or a standard gas meter and corrector. The meter/corrector <b>102</b> includes the gas meter <b>102</b>A and the corrector <b>102</b>B. The test interface <b>110</b> may also route pulse outputs from the meter/corrector <b>102</b> to the transfer prover <b>106</b>. To accomplish the routing, the test interface <b>110</b> includes switches that may be controlled by software running on the computer device <b>108</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The test interface <b>110</b> of this example includes an interface <b>202</b>A to the computer device <b>108</b>, an interface <b>202</b>B to the transfer prover <b>106</b>, an interface <b>202</b>C to the pulse output of the meter/corrector <b>102</b>, and an interface <b>202</b>D to the communications interface of the meter/corrector <b>102</b>. The interfaces <b>202</b>A-D may be wireless, such as infrared (IR) and radio frequency (RF), wired, such as fiber optic cable or electrical cable, or a combination of wireless and wired connections. In some embodiments, one or more of the interfaces <b>202</b>A-D may use custom or standard protocols, such as Bluetooth, RS-232, Universal Serial Bus (USB), and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), for example. The test interface <b>110</b> includes switches <b>204</b>A-C that route communication between the interfaces <b>202</b>A-D.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Before performing a gas meter and volume corrector accuracy test, the test interface <b>110</b> may be used to perform test preparation operations. For example, during the test preparation operations, the switch <b>204</b>C may connect the computer device <b>108</b> to the communications interface of the meter/corrector <b>102</b>. This allows the meter/corrector <b>102</b> to send its configuration parameters (A) to the computer device <b>108</b> via data paths <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>. This also allows the computer device <b>108</b> to transmit signals (B) to control the meter/corrector <b>102</b>, such as by selecting a pulse type for the meter/corrector <b>102</b> to output during the test. During the test execution, the switches <b>204</b>A-C may be set to direct a particular output pulse type to the transfer prover <b>106</b>. For example, the test interface <b>110</b> may direct corrected and/or uncorrected pulses (E) from the interface <b>202</b>C to the transfer prover <b>106</b> via data paths <b>210</b> and <b>212</b>. The test interface <b>110</b> may direct corrected and/or uncorrected pulses in proving mode (D) to the transfer prover <b>106</b>. Here, there are two possible sources of corrected and uncorrected pulses in proving mode (D). The corrected and uncorrected pulses in proving mode (D) may be routed from the interface <b>202</b>D and through the switches <b>204</b>C, <b>204</b>B, and <b>204</b>A via data paths <b>206</b>, <b>214</b>, and <b>212</b>, or from interface <b>202</b>C through the switches <b>204</b>B and <b>204</b>A via data paths <b>210</b> and <b>212</b>. The test interface <b>110</b> may route high frequency pulses (C) to the transfer prover <b>106</b> via data paths <b>206</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>212</b>, through the switches <b>204</b>C and <b>204</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In general, the volume sensor <b>112</b> may, with some conditioning, produce an uncorrected pulse output. Each pulse may correspond to some volume that has flowed through the meter.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Another output pulse format available from the corrector is the high frequency pulse output. In integrated meter and corrector systems, the corrector may bypass the uncorrected pulse output from the meter and directly detect rotation of an impeller within the meter to form the high frequency output. The direct detection may be measured in smaller increments of impeller rotation than the uncorrected pulses, producing a higher frequency of pulses. High frequency pulses may undergo processing (not shown) to scale the number of pulses to an equivalent of the corrected and uncorrected pulses. The high frequency pulse output may provide higher precision than the uncorrected and corrected pulse outputs.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">If a meter/corrector fails an accuracy test based on the high frequency output format, then one possible cause of the failure may be found in the meter. If a meter/corrector passes an accuracy test based on the high frequency pulse output format, but the same system fails an accuracy test based on the uncorrected pulse output, then one possible cause of the failure may be found in an interface between the meter and the corrector. If a meter/corrector passes an accuracy test based on the uncorrected pulse output format, but the same system fails an accuracy test based on the corrected pulse output format, then one possible cause of the failure may be found in the corrector. In another example, more than one test type may fail, which may indicate that more than one component of the meter/corrector <b>102</b> has failed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Visual indicators <b>218</b> on the test interface <b>110</b> may display information about, for example, which of the output pulse formats is currently selected, uncorrected, corrected, or high frequency.

In one embodiment, the maximum flow rate information may be determined from information received via the test interface <b>110</b> and/or stored (i.e. look-up table) information about the meter, for example. At step <b>510</b>, if the selected test uses live pressure correction, then, at step <b>511</b>, the computer device <b>108</b> receives reference pressure information. At step <b>512</b>, if the selected test uses live temperature correction, then at step <b>513</b>, the computer device <b>108</b> receives reference temperature information. In various embodiments, the temperature and/or pressure information may be received by polling electronic temperature and/or pressure transducers, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The computer device <b>108</b> loads, at step <b>514</b>, parameters from the transfer prover <b>106</b>. At step <b>516</b>, the computer device <b>108</b> calculates the number of pulses per test <b>426</b>C and the test volume <b>426</b>B for the selected test configuration based on the loaded parameters and the received information.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">If, at step <b>518</b>, the parameters are not valid to perform the test, then a message is sent to notify the user of the error in step <b>519</b>, and the step <b>502</b> is repeated. If the parameters are valid to perform the test, then the computer device <b>108</b> receives, at step <b>520</b>, a test activation signal. In some embodiments this signal may be generated automatically or in response to selection of the Start button <b>428</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At step <b>522</b>, the computer device <b>108</b> selects a flow rate from among the flow rates selected at step <b>502</b>. At step <b>524</b>, the computer device <b>108</b> activates the transfer prover <b>106</b>, which may prompt the transfer prover <b>106</b> to start the blower <b>122</b>. The computer device <b>108</b> sends, at step <b>526</b>, to the test interface <b>110</b> a control signal to configure the switches <b>204</b>A-C to route the output pulse type selected at step <b>502</b>. At step <b>528</b>, the computer device <b>108</b> sends the calculated number of test pulses to the transfer prover <b>106</b>. After the transfer prover <b>106</b> receives the calculated number of test pulses from the meter/corrector <b>102</b>, the computer device <b>108</b> receives the reference volume measured by the transfer prover <b>106</b> at step <b>530</b>. The computer device <b>108</b> calculates, at step <b>532</b>, the error between the reference volume measured by the transfer prover <b>106</b> and the test volume measured by the meter/corrector <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The computer device <b>108</b> determines, at step <b>534</b>, whether to repeat the test again. In some embodiments, each test may be repeated a predetermined number of times, or until a statistically meaningful result is achieved, for example. If the test does need to repeat, then the step <b>524</b> is performed. If the test does not need to repeat, then, at step <b>536</b>, the computer device <b>108</b> determines whether there exists another flow rate from the flow rates selected at the step <b>502</b> that has not been tested. If there is another flow rate, then the step <b>522</b> is preformed. If there are not more flow rates, then the computer device <b>108</b> sends the test results for display at step <b>538</b>, an example of which was described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows exemplary equations <b>600</b> for calculating, as described in step <b>516</b> above, a number of test pulses and a test volume using different test types. In this example, the number of pulses per test (PPT) <b>426</b>C is calculated using the minimum test time, the test flow rate <b>426</b>A, a pulse output value, and a correction factor. The correction factor is calculated using commonly known equations that incorporate the temperature, pressure, and supercompressibility of the material flowing through the line <b>104</b>. The pulse output value is the volume of material that corresponds to one output pulse. The pulse output value converts pulse outputs to a volume measurement. The test volume <b>426</b>B is calculated using the PPT <b>426</b>C, the pulse output value, and the correction factor. For tests with no correction, the correction factor has a value of one. For the tests with correction, the correction factor will be a positive number.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows exemplary equations <b>650</b> for validating, as described in step <b>518</b> above, the pulse output and the drive rate using the different test types. According to this example, if the pulse output value is greater than the product of the test flow rate <b>426</b>A, the correction factor, and the pulse width, then the meter/corrector <b>102</b> is capable of producing pulses fast enough to measure the test volume <b>426</b>B. If the drive rate is greater than the product of the test flow rate <b>426</b>A, the correction factor, and the pulse width, then the transfer prover <b>106</b> is capable of producing the test flow rate <b>426</b>A. The correction factor, pulse output value, and pulse width vary depending on conditions, such as the temperature, the pressure, the supercompressibility, and the test type.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the pulse rates and pulse widths may be assessed to ensure that the pulses will have sufficient separation to not overlap subsequent pulses. This type of check may be performed at step <b>518</b> of the method in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Although some embodiments of method have been described, other embodiments may perform the same or substantially similar steps in a different sequence, or a modified arrangement to achieve similar functions, which include automatically measuring the combined accuracy of a gas flow meter and a volume corrector using a transfer prover.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Although an exemplary system has been described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, other implementations may be deployed in other processing applications, such as desktop and networked environments.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, implementations may include one or more wireless data links, such as between the test interface <b>110</b> and any of the computer device <b>108</b>, the meter/corrector <b>102</b>, and/or the transfer prover <b>106</b>. Implementations may also include wireless data links between the computer device <b>108</b> and the meter/corrector <b>102</b>, between the computer device and the transfer prover <b>106</b>, and/or between the meter/corrector <b>102</b> and the transfer prover. In one implementation, the computer device <b>108</b> may have a data link with the meter/corrector <b>102</b> and with the transfer prover <b>106</b>. During a test, the computer device <b>108</b> may relay information between the meter/corrector <b>102</b> and the transfer prover <b>106</b>, for example.</p>
