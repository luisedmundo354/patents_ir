<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A remote controller apparatus has a controller body, which is provided with annularly disposed display devices displaying as images operating buttons for the purpose of executing functions of a remotely controlled apparatus, and which is further provided with a display device at the center of the annularly disposed display devices. Operating switches are provided below each of the display devices, a transparent shuttle ring is disposed over the annularly disposed display devices, and a transparent center button is provided over the display device at the center. The shuttle ring is caused to rotate, and if necessary operating buttons displayed by each of the display devices are switched to other operating buttons. By doing this, it is possible to assign images of various operating buttons for executing functions of a remotely controlled apparatus to the display devices of the remote controller apparatus, which display this operating buttons, and also possible for a user to operate operating buttons without being aware of which operating buttons correspond to which operations. Additionally, the need to assign more than one operation to one button is eliminated, and it is possible to avoid an excessive increase in the number of operating buttons.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to Japanese Patent Application No. 2001-370262 filed on Dec. 4, 2001, based on which this application claims priority under the Paris Convention and the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a controller apparatus, an electrical apparatus, a remote control system, an image display method, and a computer readable recording medium onto which an image display program to be executed by a computer is recorded, for remotely controlling a piece of equipment such as a DVD player, a video recorder, or a TV tuner or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A remote controller apparatus for remotely controlling apparatuses such as a television receiver and a video recorder, or a game controller for operating a video game machine is designed as a one-way communication apparatus having a variety of operating buttons suited to these apparatuses or a game controller.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These operating buttons are usually uniquely linked to specific operations of the apparatus being controlled. For example, in the case of a playback button, only a playback function would be assigned to the button. There are other cases in which a plurality of functions (operations) is assigned to one operating button. For example, depending upon the application program for a game or the like, there are cases in which key assignments can be freely changed, thereby enabling one operating button to have a number of operations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, if characters or symbols for only one operation are marked on an operating button, it is necessary for a user to constantly be aware of what operation is assigned to each operating button, thereby leading to considerable confusion on the part of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another approach is that of reducing the number of operations assigned to one operating button and increasing the number of operating buttons. The resulting increase in the number of operating buttons, however, makes operation not easier, but actually more difficult.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Embodiments of the present invention are described in detail below, with reference made to relevant accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An embodiment of the present invention is applied to a remote controller apparatus that remotely controls various electrical apparatuses, such as TV tuners for broadcast satellite (BS) or communication satellite (CS), video tape recorders that record data onto a magnetic tape or a hard disk, CD players, DVD players, video game machines, or mobile telephone terminals connectable to the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The present invention can, as a single remote controller apparatus, control either one piece of hardware, which is a set of such devices as a TV tuner, a video tape recorder, a CD player, a DVD player, a video game machine, or other apparatuses that can be connected to a household network or to the Internet, and can further control such apparatuses individually.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Configuration of the Remote Control Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an oblique view showing an example of operating an apparatus by a remote controller apparatus according to the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an oblique view showing the remote controller apparatus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view showing the remote controller apparatus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an exploded oblique view of the remote controller apparatus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a drawing showing placement numbers of each display device provided in the remote control apparatus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an oblique view showing an example of holding in one hand and operating the remote controller apparatus, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram showing the general configuration of the remote control apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, is a remote controller apparatus for the purpose of remotely controlling an apparatus <b>2</b>, which is, for example, a DVD player or the like, and is a compact controller that can be held within and operated by a single hand <b>3</b>. This remote controller apparatus <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, has a controller body <b>4</b>, a plurality of display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>mounted to a controller body <b>4</b>, various operating switches <b>6</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>q</i>, disposed below the various display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>, and which serve as input determining elements, an annular transparent shuttle ring <b>7</b> disposed so as to be rotatable above the display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>, which are annularly disposed at a prescribed distance therebetween, and a transparent center button <b>8</b> disposed above the display device <b>5</b><i>a</i>, substantially in the center of the annularly disposed display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The controller body <b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, is shape similar to that of an egg cut vertically, and has a circular mounting depression for mounting the operating switches <b>6</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>q</i>, the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>, the shuttle ring <b>7</b>, and the center button <b>8</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, this mounting depression <b>9</b> is provided with a transmitting/receiving section <b>10</b>, which performs exchange of signals with the apparatus <b>2</b>, a memory <b>11</b>, which stores image data for displaying operating buttons suitable for the apparatus <b>2</b> on the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>, a CPU <b>12</b>, which serves as a controller to control the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>, the transmitting/receiving section <b>10</b>, and the memory <b>11</b> and the like, and a power supply (not shown in the drawing).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is preferable that the controller body <b>4</b> be made of a soft, resilient material, so that it feels soft to the touch when held. It will be understood that the controller body <b>4</b> can alternatively be formed of a hard plastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition to the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>being annularly disposed at a prescribed spacing therebetween, there is one thereof that is disposed at the center part of the ring. For example, <b>16</b> display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>are annularly disposed and one display device <b>5</b><i>a </i>is disposed in the center of the ring. These display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>are all independently driven by the CPU <b>12</b>. Liquid crystal display devices or the like are used as the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, display numbers are assigned to the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>, these corresponding to the positions thereof. The center display device <b>5</b><i>a </i>has the display number <b>00</b> assigned thereto, and the display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>have the numbers <b>01</b>, <b>02</b>, <b>03</b>, . . . , and <b>16</b> assigned to them, starting from the uppermost position (the “12 o'clock” position) of the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">On the display device <b>5</b><i>a </i>disposed at the center, a graphic or characters for selection of the type of the apparatus <b>2</b> or selection of the apparatus <b>2</b> is displayed. Examples are display of the characters DVD, BS TV, and VIDEO, respectively, for a DVD player, a BS TV tuner, and a video tape recorder, and the display of an image of a mobile phone for the case of a mobile phone terminal apparatus that is connectable to the Internet. Characters such as “SOURCE SELECT” are displayed to indicate selection of the apparatus <b>2</b>. It will be understood that these are merely examples, and that in addition to graphics and characters indicating the type of the apparatus <b>2</b> or the selection of the apparatus <b>2</b>, it is possible to display graphics or characters indicating the operating mode of the apparatus <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Graphics or characters indicating the operating mode, for example, of the apparatus <b>2</b> are displayed at the annularly disposed display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>. One example is that in which, for the case of a BS TV tuner, the display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>display numbers <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, . . . , and <b>12</b> to indicate channels. Another example is one in which, for a DVD player, the display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>display graphics indicating such operations as fast-forward, rewind, stop, and pause or the like. The display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>can also display graphics or characters to indicate the type of the apparatus <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The operating switches <b>6</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>q</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, are respectively disposed below the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>. These operating switches <b>6</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>q </i>are switched on and off when the shuttle ring <b>7</b> or the center button <b>8</b>, to be described below, is pressed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The shuttle ring <b>7</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is a transparent ring disposed above the annularly disposed display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>. The shuttle ring <b>7</b>, as shown by the arrow I in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, can be rotated freely relative to the controller body <b>4</b>. Because the shuttle ring <b>7</b> is transparent, it is possible to view therethrough graphics and characters or the like displayed by the display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>disposed therebelow. If the shuttle ring <b>7</b> is rotated to the left or to the right, switching is made, for example, to a mode that selects an apparatus <b>2</b> such as a video tape recorder, a CD player, or a DVD player or the like, whereupon graphics or characters corresponding to that mode are displayed by the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this manner, by disposing the display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>below the transparent shuttle ring <b>7</b>, even in the case, for example, in which the shuttle ring <b>7</b> is rotated to the right, as shown by the arrow II in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, there is no change in the positions of the operating buttons (graphic displays serving as operating buttons) displayed by the display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>disposed therebelow. If the display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>are located on the surface of the shuttle ring <b>7</b>, however, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, rotation of the shuttle ring <b>7</b> causes a change in the orientation of the operating buttons, making operating difficult. Although in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the operating buttons displayed by the display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>are always displayed by the same display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, it is alternatively possible to cause the display positions of the operating button to rotate in accordance with rotation of the shuttle ring <b>7</b>, in which case because the orientation of the operating buttons remains the same, there is no hindrance to operation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The shuttle ring <b>7</b> is configured so as to stop at positions in accordance with intervals between the positions at which the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>are disposed, and provide a tactile detent click at these positions. It will be understood that the shuttle ring <b>7</b> can alternatively be configured so as to rotate smoothly with no such detents.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When the shuttle ring <b>7</b> is caused to rotate, a rotational movement amount detector <b>66</b> provided on the controller body <b>4</b> detects the rotation of the shuttle ring <b>7</b>, and switches the content displayed by the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>in accordance with the amount of rotation of the shuttle ring <b>7</b>. When the rotational movement amount detector <b>66</b> detects rotation of the shuttle ring <b>7</b>, part of the content displayed by the annularly disposed display devices <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>is switched so as to be displayed by the center display device <b>5</b><i>a</i>, responsive to the rotation of the shuttle ring <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Although the shuttle ring <b>7</b> can be made of a hard, transparent plastic material, it can also be formed as a soft, resilient, transparent resin member, in which case it is particularly easy to press the operating switches <b>6</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>q</i>, to be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The center button <b>8</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, is a transparent disc-shaped button, disposed above the display device <b>5</b><i>a</i>, which is disposed at the center. The center button <b>8</b> is provided facing a center hole <b>13</b> of the shuttle ring <b>7</b> and, in contrast to the shuttle ring <b>7</b>, is mounted to the controller body <b>4</b> so as to not be rotatable. This center button <b>8</b>, similar to the shuttle ring <b>7</b>, is formed as a hard, transparent plastic or resilient, transparent resin member. If the center button <b>8</b> is formed as a soft resin member, it is easy to press the center button <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The transmitting/receiving section <b>10</b> can perform uni-directional or bi-directional communication so as exchange signals between the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> and the apparatus <b>2</b>. For example, in the case in which uni-directional communication is done from the controller body <b>4</b> to the apparatus <b>2</b>, remote control signals output by pressing the operating buttons displayed by the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>are sent to the apparatus <b>2</b> from the transmitting/receiving section <b>10</b> of the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b>. In the case of bi-directional communication, image display position data (key assignment data) having display image numbers (display numbers) for establishing which graphics are to be assigned to each of the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>, and image data stored in a memory <b>53</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the apparatus <b>2</b> are sent to the transmitting/receiving section <b>10</b> of the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> from the apparatus <b>2</b>, and remote control signals output by pressing the operating buttons displayed by the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>are sent to the apparatus <b>2</b> from the transmitting/receiving section <b>10</b> of the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b>. This function setting data (image data and position specifying information for displaying the image data by the display devices) sent and received between the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> and the apparatus <b>2</b> will be described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The memory <b>11</b> stores graphics and characters indicating the type of apparatus <b>2</b>, or image data for graphics or characters in accordance with the apparatus <b>2</b>. Image data and characters stored in the memory <b>11</b> will be described by examples below.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> configured as described above, the content displayed by the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>disposed below the shuttle ring <b>7</b> and below the center button <b>8</b> changes in accordance with the apparatus <b>2</b> being controlled. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the case of a BS television tuner, the characters “ENTER BS TV” is displayed at the center button <b>8</b>, and up, down, left, and right direction buttons <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, and <b>17</b> are displayed on the shuttle ring <b>7</b>. In the case of a DVD tuner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the characters “DVD” and a playback button <b>18</b> are displayed at the center button <b>8</b>, and on the shuttle ring <b>7</b>, starting from the topmost position and proceeding in the clockwise direction, a pause button <b>19</b>, a post-capture button <b>20</b>, a fast forward button <b>21</b>, a slow playback button <b>22</b>, a stop button <b>23</b>, a slow rewind/playback button <b>24</b>, a rewind button <b>25</b>, and a pre-capture button <b>26</b> are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the case of a TV tuner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the characters “ENTER TV” are displayed at the center button <b>8</b>, and on the shuttle ring <b>7</b>, starting from the topmost position and proceeding in the clockwise direction, the characters “VOLUME” and a plus button <b>27</b> for increasing the volume, the characters “CHANNEL” and a plus button <b>28</b> for increasing the channel number, the characters “VOLUME” and a minus button <b>29</b> for decreasing the volume, and the characters “CHANNEL” and a minus button <b>30</b> for decreasing the channel number are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In another case of a BS television tuner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the characters “ENTER BS TV” are displayed at the center button <b>8</b>, and on the shuttle ring <b>7</b>, starting from the topmost position and proceeding in the clockwise direction, a channel <b>12</b> button <b>31</b>, a channel <b>1</b> button <b>32</b>, a channel <b>2</b> button <b>33</b>, a channel <b>3</b> button <b>34</b>, a channel <b>4</b> button <b>35</b>, a channel <b>5</b> button <b>36</b>, a channel <b>6</b> button <b>37</b>, a channel <b>7</b> button <b>38</b>, a channel <b>8</b> button <b>39</b>, a channel <b>9</b> button <b>40</b>, a channel <b>10</b> button <b>41</b>, and a channel <b>11</b> button <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the case of a mobile telephone terminal apparatus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a mobile telephone button <b>14</b> with the design of a mobile telephone terminal apparatus is displayed at the center button <b>8</b>, and on the shuttle ring <b>7</b>, starting from the topmost position and proceeding in the clockwise direction, a top operating button <b>44</b>, a right operating button <b>45</b>, a bottom operating button <b>46</b>, and a left operating button <b>47</b> are displayed.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Configuration of the Controlled Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a conceptual block diagram of a DVD, which is an example of the apparatus <b>2</b>. The DVD player has a servo circuit <b>48</b> with a tracking servo and a focus servo and the like, a signal processing circuit <b>49</b> for processing video signals and audio signals, a display drive circuit <b>51</b> for displaying various information on a liquid-crystal display <b>50</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), various operating switches <b>52</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a memory <b>53</b>, a transmitting/receiving section <b>54</b>, and a CPU <b>55</b>, which controls these elements.</p>

At the display device <b>5</b><i>a </i>having the display number <b>00</b>, the DVD playback operating button having the image display number <b>037</b> is displayed, at the display device <b>5</b><i>b </i>having the display number <b>01</b>, a pause button having the image display number <b>030</b> is displayed, at the display device <b>5</b><i>c </i>having the display number <b>02</b> nothing is displayed in accordance with the image display number <b>000</b>, at the display device <b>5</b><i>d </i>having the display number <b>03</b> a next capture button having the image display number <b>034</b> is displayed, at the display device <b>5</b><i>e </i>having the display number <b>04</b> nothing is displayed in accordance with the image display number <b>000</b>, at the display device <b>5</b><i>f </i>having the display number <b>05</b> a fast-forward button having the image display number <b>036</b> is displayed, at the display device <b>5</b><i>g </i>having the display number <b>06</b> nothing is displayed in accordance with the image display number <b>000</b>, at the display device <b>5</b><i>h </i>having the display number <b>07</b> a slow playback button having the image display number <b>032</b> is displayed, and at the display device <b>5</b><i>i </i>having the display number <b>08</b> nothing is displayed in accordance with the image display number <b>000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Similarly, at the display device <b>5</b><i>j </i>having the display number <b>09</b> a stop button having the image display number <b>029</b> is displayed, at the display device <b>5</b><i>k </i>having the display number <b>10</b> nothing is displayed in accordance with the image display number <b>000</b>, at the display device <b>51</b> having the display number <b>11</b> a slow rewind/playback button having the image display number <b>031</b> is displayed, at the display device <b>5</b><i>m </i>having the display number <b>12</b> nothing is displayed in accordance with the image display number <b>000</b>, at the display device <b>5</b><i>n </i>having the display number <b>13</b> a rewind button having the image display number <b>035</b> is displayed, at the display device <b>5</b><i>o </i>having the display number <b>14</b> nothing is displayed in accordance with the image display number <b>000</b>, at the display device <b>5</b><i>p </i>having the display number <b>15</b> a pre-capture button having the image display number <b>033</b> is displayed, and at the display device <b>5</b><i>q </i>having the display number <b>16</b> nothing is displayed in accordance with the image display number <b>000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In this manner, in the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> according to the above-described embodiment of the present invention, image display position data formed by a listing of image display number to which are assigned images for display by the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>are received from the apparatus <b>2</b> and, based on the received data list, image data in accordance to the data list is read from the memory <b>11</b> of the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b>, and displayed as operating buttons on the shuttle ring <b>7</b> and the center button <b>8</b> by each of the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>, thereby enabling all of the operating buttons of the apparatus <b>2</b> to be displayed on the shuttle ring <b>7</b> and the center button <b>8</b>, eliminating the need for the user to be concerned about what operating button corresponds to which operation.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Furthermore, using the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> because only the operating buttons for the particular apparatus <b>2</b> being controlled are displayed on the shuttle ring <b>7</b> and center button <b>8</b>, it is not necessary to assign a plurality of operations to one button to accommodate each type of apparatus <b>2</b>, thereby avoiding an increase in the number of operating buttons and enabling efficient operation with a small number of operating buttons.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Using the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> according to this embodiment of the present invention, because bi-directional communication is performed with the apparatus <b>2</b>, it is possible to change the content displayed by the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>responsive to various characteristics of one and the same source apparatus, for example, in the two cases of recording and playback using a video tape recorder.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Although the foregoing embodiment is described for the case in which the controlled apparatus is a DVD player, it will be understood that it similarly possible in the case in which the apparatus <b>2</b> controlled by the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> is an apparatus such as a TV tuner, a video tape recorder, CD player, or an apparatus connected to a home network or the Internet, to display only the operating buttons for that particular apparatus <b>2</b> on the shuttle ring <b>7</b> and center button <b>8</b>, thereby preventing misoperation.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It will be further understood that the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> of the above-noted embodiment not only displays on the shuttle ring <b>7</b> and the center button <b>8</b> operating buttons for a video game machine or apparatus connected to a network, but can also display on the shuttle ring <b>7</b> and the center button <b>8</b> operating buttons for the purpose of operating an application program executed by the video game machine or network-connected apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Another Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the embodiment described above, image display position data and image data for operating buttons is sent from the apparatus <b>2</b> in response to a request from the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b>. In addition to this data, it is possible to make an embodiment of the present invention in which audio data is also transmitted to the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b>. If audio data is transmitted to the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b>, it is possible for example to have a user recognize when he or she has selected a particular button by means of a sound, thereby providing a further improvement in added value.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In this embodiment of the present invention, force feedback data which imparts vibration to the hand holding the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> can be used as data for a function setting sent to the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b>. If this is done, it is necessary to provide in the controller body <b>4</b> a responding means such as a vibrating mechanism or the like, which receives the force feedback data and imparts a vibration to the controller body <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">If this configuration is adopted, for example, if an operating button is pressed a vibrating mechanism provided in the controller body <b>4</b> operates, the controller body <b>4</b> vibrates, this vibration informing the user operating the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> that the input of the operating button has been made.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this embodiment, bi-directional communication is possible between the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> and the apparatus <b>2</b>, but it is also possible in the case of uni-directional communication from the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> to the apparatus <b>2</b>. In the case of uni-directional communication, in contrast to the case of bi-directional communication, it is not necessary to send from the apparatus <b>2</b> the image display position data (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) making assignments of which images are to be displayed by which display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q. </i></p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">That is, using the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> with uni-directional communication, when the apparatus <b>2</b> is selected, image data for the operating buttons of the apparatus <b>2</b> or for various operating buttons displayed by an application program executed by the apparatus <b>2</b>, and image display position data specifying at which positions on the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>the image data is to be displayed are read from the memory <b>11</b> provided in the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b>, and the read-out image data is displayed by the respective display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>according to the image display position data. The images read from the memory <b>11</b> are priorly and uniquely assigned by the image display position data to positions among the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q. </i></p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">While in the above-described embodiment the image data for operating button of all apparatuses <b>2</b> controlled by the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> (data shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) is stored in the memory <b>11</b> of the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b>, it is alternately possible to store this image data in the apparatus <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows a list of image display position data for the purpose of assigning each of the image data to each of the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>, according to which list the characters “DVD” and a right-pointing triangle meaning playback are assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>a </i>having the display number <b>00</b>, a double vertical-line symbol meaning pause is assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>b </i>having the display number <b>01</b>, no display is assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>c </i>having the display number <b>02</b>, a single vertical line and two right-pointing triangles meaning pre-capture are assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>d </i>having the display number <b>03</b>, no display is assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>e </i>having the display number <b>04</b>, two right-pointing triangles meaning fast-forward are assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>f </i>having the display number <b>05</b>, no display is assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>g </i>having the display number <b>06</b>, a right-pointing triangle with a vertical slit meaning slow playback is assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>h </i>having the display number <b>07</b>, and no display is assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>i </i>having the display number <b>08</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Similarly a square meaning stop is assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>j </i>having the display number <b>09</b>, no display is assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>k </i>having the display number <b>10</b>, a left-pointing triangle with a vertical slit meaning slow rewind is assigned to the display device <b>51</b> having the display number <b>11</b>, no display is assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>m </i>having the display number <b>12</b>, two left-pointing triangles meaning rewind are assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>n </i>having the display number <b>13</b>, no display is assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>o </i>having the display number <b>14</b>, a single vertical line and two left-pointing triangles means post-capture are assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>p </i>having the display number <b>15</b>, and no display is assigned to the display device <b>5</b><i>q </i>having the display number <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In this manner, by imparting the image display position data for the purpose of assigning each of the image data to each of the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>to the apparatus <b>2</b>, it is possible to freely customize the assignments of operating buttons in accordance with each of the apparatuses <b>2</b>. That is, for a video tape recorder of a given manufacturer that has a double-speed playback function not found on the recorders of another manufacturer, it is possible to assign the associated double-speed playback button to an operating button as a direct button, and to cause the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>to display an image representing the double-speed playback button. In short, even in the case of an apparatus <b>2</b> having a special function, it is possible to assign to the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> an operating button that controls the special function.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">It is alternatively possible, rather than imparting the image display position data for assigning each of the image data to each of the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, to connect the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> and the apparatus <b>2</b> to the Internet <b>60</b>, for example, and to store the image display position data in an storage apparatus <b>62</b> of a server <b>61</b> connected to Internet <b>60</b> beforehand, and to download the image display position data to the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> and the apparatus <b>2</b> via the Internet <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Thus, by downloading the image display position data via the Internet, compared to the case in which the image display position data is given to the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> and the apparatus <b>2</b>, it is possible not only to display images for more types of apparatuses, but also to facilitate switching of the images. It is further possible to download only the image data for operating buttons and the like to the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> and the apparatus <b>2</b> via the Internet <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">While the above example is that of downloading via the Internet <b>60</b>, it will be understood that the downloading of image data and image display position data to the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> and the apparatus <b>2</b> can also be done via a different type of network, such as a home network.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Additionally, although the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> in the above-noted embodiments has a controller body <b>4</b> having a shape similar to that of an egg cut vertically, the present invention is not restricted to this shape, and can take on a various other forms. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, it is possible to have a remote controller apparatus <b>64</b> with a controller body <b>63</b>, which has been formed by vertically extending a circular shape, with the shuttle ring <b>7</b> and center button <b>8</b> provided in the region of one end thereof. The remote controller apparatus <b>64</b> can be held in and operated by one hand, and can also be placed on the top of a desk or table and operated. A transmitting/receiving section <b>65</b> is provided at an end of the vertically elongated controller body <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Although the remote controller apparatus <b>1</b> of the above-noted embodiments has operating switches <b>6</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>q </i>disposed below the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q</i>, it is alternatively possible to have the display devices <b>5</b><i>a </i>to <b>5</b><i>q </i>and the operating switches <b>6</b><i>a </i>to <b>6</b><i>q </i>disposed separately. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, it is possible to have the display devices <b>5</b><i>b</i>, <b>5</b><i>f</i>, <b>5</b><i>j</i>, and <b>5</b><i>n </i>disposed to the outside of the shuttle ring <b>7</b>.</p>
