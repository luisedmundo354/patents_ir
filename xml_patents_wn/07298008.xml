<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of integrated circuits; more specifically, it relates to an electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection device for use in integrated circuits fabricated on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates and a method of fabricating the ESD protection device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In order to meet increasing performance targets, advanced complimentary metal-oxide-silicon (CMOS) technologies are being scaled down in size to the point that sensitivity to ESD is becoming a significant reliability problem. The use of silicon control rectifiers (SCRs) to protect CMOS technologies built with bulk silicon substrates is known in the industry. However, current SCR-based ESD protection devices suffer from high junction capacitance and current crowding making them unsuitable for CMOS technologies built with SOI substrates. Therefore, there is an ongoing need for an SCR device for electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection in integrated circuits fabricated on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A first aspect of the present invention is a silicon control rectifier, comprising: silicon body formed in a silicon layer in direct physical contact with a buried oxide layer of a silicon-on-insulator substrate, a top surface of the silicon layer defining a horizontal plane; and an anode of the silicon control rectifier formed in a first region of the silicon body and a cathode of the silicon control rectifier formed in an opposite second region of the silicon body, wherein a path of current flow between the anode and the cathode is only in a single horizontal direction parallel to the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A second aspect of the present invention is a silicon control rectifier, comprising: a silicon layer in direct physical contact with a buried oxide layer of a silicon-on-insulator substrate, a top surface of the silicon layer defining a horizontal plane; a first doped region in the silicon layer, the first doped region having a first net peak doping concentration, a second doped region having a second net peak doping concentration and a third doped region having a third net peak doping concentration, the second and third net peak doping concentrations being a same doping concentration, the first doped region between and abutting the second and third doped regions, the second and third doped regions not abutting; a fourth doped region in the silicon layer in the silicon layer, the fourth doped region having a fourth net peak doping concentration in the silicon layer, the fourth doped region abutting only the second doped region; a fifth doped region in the silicon layer, the fifth doped region having a fifth net peak doping concentration in the silicon layer, the fifth doped region abutting only the third doped region; wherein a path of current flow from the fourth doped region, through the second doped region, the first doped region and the third doped region to the fifth doped region, is in a single horizontal direction parallel to the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A third aspect of the present invention is a method of fabricating a silicon control rectifier, comprising: forming a blanket doped region having a net peak doping concentration in a silicon layer in direct physical contact with a buried oxide layer of a silicon-on-insulator substrate, a top surface of the silicon layer defining a horizontal plane; forming a first doped region in the silicon layer, the first doped region having a first net peak doping concentration, the first doped region dividing the blanket doped region into a second doped region having a second net peak doping concentration and a third doped region having a third net peak doping concentration, the second and third net peak doping concentrations being a same doping concentration, the first doped region between and abutting the second and third doped regions, the second and third doped regions not abutting; forming a fourth doped region in the silicon layer, the fourth doped region having a fourth net peak doping concentration in the silicon layer, the fourth doped region abutting only the second doped region; forming a fifth doped region in the silicon layer, the fifth doped region having a fifth net peak doping concentration in the silicon layer, the fifth doped region abutting only the third doped region; wherein a path of current flow from the fourth doped region, through the second doped region, the first doped region and the third doped region to the fifth doped region, is in a single horizontal direction parallel to the horizontal plane.</p>

Current path <b>205</b> is a single straight line current path in a first horizontal direction defined by line <b>7</b>B-<b>7</b>B and all planes parallel to a plane defined by the top surface of silicon layer <b>115</b>. Current flow in SCR <b>185</b> is only in a single horizontal direction as opposed to prior art SCR devices where the current must turn about 90° from emitter <b>1</b> to the base/collectors and another 90° from the base/collectors to emitter <b>2</b>. Thus, in the prior art devices, charge dissipation current is flowing in two different horizontal directions. The change in horizontal direction of current flow in prior art SCRs cause current crowding, limiting the amount of charge that can be dissipated.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The speed of turn on of SCR <b>185</b> is controlled by distance L (in the first horizontal direction between PN junction <b>137</b> and PN junction <b>138</b>: the larger the value of L, the slower the turn on of SCR <b>185</b>; the smaller the value of L, the faster the turn on of SCR <b>185</b>. In one example L is between about 100 and 250 nm. W is the width (in the second horizontal direction) of N-well region <b>135</b> and along with the depth D (in a vertical direction) and the doping concentration of the N-well region controls the amount of current SCR <b>185</b> can carry.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a simulated lateral profile of an SCR ESD protection device according to the embodiments of the present invention. The term lateral direction refers to a direction parallel to the first horizontal direction (and not to the second horizontal direction) as described supra. A peak concentration is a maximum doping concentration in a given region. A net doping concentration is the difference between the doping concentrations of a first dopant type and a second and opposite dopant type, the concentration of the first dopant type being greater than the concentration of the second dopant type. Thus, a net peak doping concentration is the maximum difference between the doping concentration of a first dopant type less the doping concentration of a second dopant type, the concentration of the first dopant type being greater than the concentration of the second dopant type. The concentration of the second dopant type may be zero. The terms doped P-type or doped N-type should be understood to mean net doping. For example, a region having both N- and P-type dopants, with a higher concentration of N-type dopant than P-type dopant would be considered to be doped N-type and vice versa.</p>
