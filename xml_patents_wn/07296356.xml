<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to a portable power tool, particularly to an adjustable base therefore.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional portable saws typically include a planar base upon which the tool is supported during the cutting operation to provide a consistent angle of cut relative to a top surface of an associated workpiece. Many conventional prior art portable saws are provided with an adjustable base for permitting a user to select an angle of the base relative to the cutting plane of the portable saw to thereby provide a user selected cutting angle relative to the surface of the workpiece. This angular adjustment of the cutting plane relative to the workpiece is commonly referred to as the bevel angle and is measured as the offset from orthogonal to the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some conventional prior art portable saws with adjustable bases include a fastener, such as a threaded screw or bolt that must be loosened so that the base may be adjusted and tightened to secure the orientation of the base. However, the use of a fastener may require utilization of a separate tool which may be inconvenient to a user. Alternatively, prior art adjustable bases may include a threaded fastener with a knob formed thereon, yet compactness may limit the size of the knob thus limiting the torque that may be applied by the user which may result in a non-secure attachment of the base to the power tool.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the prior art has provided selective adjustment of the base to the portable saw by use of a threaded fastener that is tightened and loosened by utilization of an elongate lever extending from the fastener or a nut that is threadably engaged to the fastener. Due to the length of the lever, limited rotary displacement of the lever may be permitted because of compactness of the tool or size restraints. Accordingly, such prior art adjustable bases that utilize a threaded member typically permit less than a half turn of the lever thus limiting the range of torque provided to secure the base to the tool and/or limiting the amount of clearance provided to adjust the base relative to the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, the prior art teaches adjustable bases that utilize a toolless clamping mechanism with a lever mounted to a double threaded fastener with the threads in opposed directions, to provide twice the displacement per angular rotation in the limited range of manual rotation. The prior art also provides a threaded engagement that has an unlimited range of manual rotation, yet requiring additional effort by the user. Other prior art toolless adjustable bases have avoided the attachment by a threaded member altogether by utilizing an offset lobe clamp member. Some offset lobe clamp member designs may be inconvenient to the user, by requiring removal of a baseplate from the adjustable base before the lever can be fully rotated to the unlock position.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A goal of the present invention is to provide a toolless adjustable base for a portable saw that is convenient to a user by providing both sufficient clearance to adjust the base and sufficient torque to reattach the base relative to the tool while minimizing the effort and the range of motion required by the user.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An aspect of the invention is to provide an adjustable base for a portable saw having a housing, a handle affixed to the housing, a motor oriented in the housing, and a saw blade operably driven by the motor for performing a cutting operation. The adjustable base includes a longitudinal cylindrical shell secured to the housing. The shell has a longitudinal axis that is generally parallel with a cutting plane of the saw blade and the shell has a transverse slot formed therethrough. A baseplate is affixed to the shell for engaging a workpiece and supporting the saw thereon. A shaft is mounted to the housing for limited rotary and axial movement relative to the housing, and the shaft has a distal end extending from the housing, through the transverse slot and into an inner region of the shell. A collar is operably connected to the shaft and has a first cam surface cooperating with a corresponding second cam surface of the housing. Rotation of the collar in an unlocked direction extends the distal end of the shaft away from the housing, and rotation of the shaft in a locked direction retracts the distal end of the shaft towards the housing due to the cooperating cam surfaces. A longitudinal clamp member is received within the shell inner region and cooperates with the shaft distal end so that the shell inner region can pivot about the clamp member as the transverse slot provides clearance for the shaft. The shaft is threadably engaged to one of the collar, the housing or the clamp member so that rotation of the collar in the unlocked direction either extends the shaft further away from the housing or extends the clamp member along the shaft away from the housing for permitting the shell to be loosened for adjustment. Rotation of the collar in the locked direction either retracts the shaft towards the housing or retracts the clamp member along the shaft towards the housing for securing the shell relative to the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above aspects and other aspects, objects, features and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best mode for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a preferred embodiment portable power tool is illustrated in accordance with the present invention, commonly referred to as a reciprocating saw, particularly a jigsaw <b>20</b>. The jigsaw <b>20</b> includes a housing <b>22</b>, and a handle <b>24</b> affixed to the housing. Specifically, a D-handle is illustrated, however the invention contemplates any handle, such as a barrel handle that may be formed as part of the housing that encloses a motor and operating mechanism of the saw. A motor (not shown) is disposed in the housing <b>22</b> for providing rotary motion to an operating mechanism (not shown) that converts the rotary motion to reciprocal motion for driving a saw blade <b>26</b> in a reciprocating or orbital-reciprocating motion, which is well known in the art. A power source <b>28</b> is provided to the jigsaw <b>20</b> which is controlled by trigger switch <b>30</b> for selectively imparting the reciprocating motion to the saw blade <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The jigsaw <b>20</b> is a portable saw and is commonly used by placing the jigsaw <b>20</b> on a workpiece during the cutting operation. Accordingly, the jigsaw <b>20</b> includes a base, particularly an adjustable base <b>32</b> that is affixed to the housing <b>22</b> for guiding the jigsaw <b>20</b> along an underlying support surface, such as the workpiece or an associated guide, and the adjustable base <b>32</b> is utilized for supporting the jigsaw <b>20</b> during the cutting operation. The adjustable base <b>32</b> has a longitudinal axis <b>34</b> about which the adjustable base <b>32</b> can be pivoted relative to the housing <b>22</b>. The longitudinal axis <b>34</b> is generally parallel with a cutting plane defined by the saw blade <b>26</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the longitudinal axis <b>34</b> lies in the cutting plane defined by the saw blade <b>26</b>. The adjustable base <b>32</b> may be locked and unlocked for providing the adjustment of the base <b>32</b> relative to the housing <b>22</b>. This adjustment permits a user to select a desired angle of the cutting plane relative to a surface of a workpiece (not shown) to which the adjustable base <b>32</b> engages during the cutting operation. This angular adjustment of the cutting plane relative to the adjustable base <b>32</b> is commonly referred to as a bevel angle.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The preferred embodiment jigsaw <b>20</b> also includes a variable speed control selector <b>36</b> for adjusting the speed of the reciprocating action. The jigsaw <b>20</b> includes a lock-on button <b>38</b> for allowing continuous operation without requiring constant depression of the trigger switch <b>30</b>. A translucent chip shield <b>40</b> is provided that mounts to the adjustable base <b>32</b> and the housing <b>22</b>. The chip shield <b>40</b> allows a user to view the cutting operation, while concomitantly limiting chips from obscuring the path of the jigsaw <b>20</b>. The chip shield <b>40</b> is not adjustable and therefore may only be utilized for a bevel angle of zero degrees from vertical. The adjustable base <b>32</b> also includes a splinter guard <b>42</b> for minimizing splinters caused by the saw blade <b>26</b> during the cutting operation. A vacuum attachment <b>44</b> is illustrated mounted to a rearward region of the adjustable base <b>32</b>. The vacuum attachment <b>44</b> is provided to secure a vacuum hose to the rearward end thereof for providing a negative pressure for moving dust and chips from the area of the cutting operation through the adjustable base <b>32</b>. A toolless blade change mechanism <b>46</b> is provided mounted to the reciprocating mechanism of the jigsaw <b>20</b> for providing rapid change of saw blades <b>26</b> and for maximizing convenience provided to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The adjustable base <b>32</b> includes a lever <b>48</b> pivotally mounted to the housing <b>22</b> about an axis that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis <b>34</b> of the adjustable base <b>32</b>. The lever <b>48</b> operates a clamping mechanism <b>49</b> of the adjustable base <b>32</b> to lock the adjustable base <b>32</b> relative to the housing <b>22</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As the lever <b>48</b> is pivoted in the direction of the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lever <b>48</b> reaches an unlock position of the adjustable base <b>32</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The adjustable base <b>32</b> includes a base frame <b>50</b>. The base frame <b>50</b> includes a longitudinal shell <b>52</b> that has a generally arcuate cross section with an outer region <b>54</b> that is secured to the housing <b>22</b>. The longitudinal shell <b>52</b> is parallel with the longitudinal axis <b>34</b>. The longitudinal shell <b>52</b> includes a transverse slot <b>56</b> formed therethrough for receiving a portion of the clamping mechanism <b>49</b> therethrough and providing adjustability along the length of the transverse slot <b>56</b>. Accordingly, as the lever <b>48</b> is pivoted to the unlock orientation, the adjustable base <b>32</b> is permitted to pivot about the longitudinal axis <b>34</b> due to the clearance of the clamping mechanism <b>49</b> provided in the transverse slot <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the base frame <b>50</b> includes a baseplate <b>58</b> fastened to the base frame <b>50</b>. The baseplate <b>58</b> includes a generally planar contact surface that is spaced away from the housing <b>22</b> further than the base frame <b>50</b> and the associated fasteners are recessed within the baseplate <b>58</b> so that the baseplate <b>58</b> provides an area of contact against the workpiece for supporting the saw thereon and providing smooth sliding of the jigsaw <b>20</b> upon the associated support surface or workpiece. The baseplate <b>58</b> is formed of a high strength polymer material to avoid marring an associated surface of a workpiece. The baseplate <b>58</b> is removable from the base frame <b>50</b> so that the baseplate <b>58</b> may be replaced if damaged or wear is incurred.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the longitudinal shell <b>52</b> of the base frame <b>50</b> is illustrated enlarged with greater detail. The housing <b>22</b> is illustrated partially at a bevel angle offset from vertical. The longitudinal shell <b>52</b> includes a longitudinal slot <b>60</b> formed therein for permitting longitudinal adjustment of the adjustable base <b>32</b> relative to the housing <b>22</b> at the bevel angle of the saw that is zero degrees from vertical.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The longitudinal shell <b>52</b> includes a series of detents <b>62</b> formed therein. The detents correspond to fifteen degree increments of bevel angle adjustment relative to vertical. A series of indicia <b>64</b> illustrate the numerical value of these increments and are formed on a rear surface <b>66</b> of the base frame <b>50</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The detents <b>62</b> cooperate with a spring loaded tab (not shown) extending downwardly from the housing <b>22</b>. The detents <b>62</b> provide quick adjustment of the bevel angle for certain predefined increments relative to vertical. Of course, various angles within this range are permitted, however require use of a protractor to ensure accurate adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the preferred embodiment jigsaw <b>20</b> also includes an orbital adjustment knob <b>68</b> extending from the housing for permitting a user to adjust the orbital motion of the cutting blade <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the clamping mechanism <b>49</b> of the adjustable base <b>32</b> is illustrated in greater detail. In order to illustrate the clamping mechanism <b>49</b> of the adjustable base <b>32</b>, a lower-most portion <b>69</b> of the housing <b>22</b> is depicted partially and in cross section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. Additionally, the base frame <b>50</b> is illustrated partially by the longitudinal shell <b>52</b>. A stationary collar <b>70</b> is secured to the housing <b>22</b>. The stationary collar <b>70</b> includes a pair of lugs <b>72</b> mounted thereon for interlocking with the housing <b>22</b> and maintaining the orientation of the stationary collar <b>70</b> relative to the housing <b>22</b>. The lever <b>48</b> is mounted to a rotary collar <b>74</b> so that manual rotation imparted to the lever <b>48</b> imparts the rotation to the rotary collar <b>74</b>. The rotary collar <b>74</b> is mounted to a shaft <b>76</b> so that the rotary motion imparted to the lever <b>48</b> consequently rotates the collar <b>74</b> and the shaft <b>76</b>. The rotary collar <b>74</b> is mounted within the housing <b>22</b> between stationary collar <b>70</b> and a wall portion <b>78</b> of the housing portion <b>69</b>. Accordingly, the lever <b>48</b>, rotary collar <b>74</b> and shaft <b>76</b> are secured to the housing <b>22</b> between the stationary collar <b>70</b> and the wall portion <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The shaft <b>76</b> includes a distal threaded end <b>80</b> that extends through the transverse slot <b>56</b> of the longitudinal shell <b>52</b>. The preferred embodiment threaded end <b>80</b> has a diameter of 5 mm and a right handed pitch of 0.8 mm. The shaft threaded end <b>80</b> is threadably engaged to a longitudinal clamp member <b>82</b>. The longitudinal clamp member <b>82</b> is received within an inner region <b>84</b> of the longitudinal shell <b>52</b>. The clamp member <b>82</b> includes a longitudinal clamp block <b>86</b> that is sized to be received within the shell inner region <b>84</b>. Specifically, the clamp block has a width that is sized so that the shell inner region <b>84</b> can pivot about the clamp block <b>86</b>. The clamp block <b>86</b> includes lateral rounded edges <b>88</b> to provide an area of contact within the shell inner region <b>84</b>. The clamp block <b>86</b> has a longitudinal length that is sufficiently long relative to its width for minimizing rotation of the clamp block <b>86</b> and clamp member <b>82</b> within the shell inner region <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The clamp block <b>86</b> includes an aperture <b>90</b> formed therethrough so that the threaded end <b>80</b> of the shaft <b>76</b> may be received therein. The clamp member <b>82</b> includes a hexagonal nut <b>92</b> for threadably engaging the shaft threaded end <b>80</b>. The clamp block <b>86</b> includes a step <b>94</b> with a threaded aperture <b>96</b> formed therethrough. The threaded aperture <b>96</b> receives a screw <b>98</b>. The screw <b>98</b> mounts to the step <b>94</b> with a lock washer <b>100</b> and flat washer <b>102</b> secured therebetween. The nut <b>92</b> includes an annular flange <b>104</b> extending therefrom. The step <b>94</b> is sized to space the flat washer <b>102</b> above the flange <b>104</b>. The flat washer <b>102</b> has an external diameter sufficiently sized so that it engages one of the flat surfaces of the hexagonal nut <b>92</b>. The flat washer <b>102</b> is secured to the clamp block <b>86</b> by the fastener <b>98</b> and lock washer <b>100</b>, and maintains the nut <b>92</b> against the clamp block <b>86</b> by overlapping the flange <b>104</b>. The flat washer <b>102</b> also prevents the nut <b>92</b> from being rotated relative to the clamp block <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The rotary collar <b>74</b> includes a first cam surface <b>106</b> formed on an axial face thereof, facing the stationary collar <b>70</b>. The stationary collar <b>70</b> includes a second cam surface <b>108</b> formed on an axial face thereof corresponding to the first cam surface <b>106</b> and facing the first cam surface <b>106</b>. A spring washer <b>110</b> is oriented about the shaft <b>76</b> and engages the rotary collar <b>74</b> and the wall portion <b>78</b> for biasing the rotary collar <b>74</b> away from the wall portion <b>78</b> and into engagement with the stationary collar <b>70</b> to maintain engagement of the first and second cam surfaces <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. Further, the shaft <b>76</b> is journalled within the stationary collar <b>70</b> to provide bearing support to the shaft <b>76</b> and rotary collar <b>74</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the spring washer <b>110</b> is illustrated in cross section. The spring washer <b>110</b> has a generally frusto-conical cross section and may be compressed axially due to loads imparted on opposed axial surfaces thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the locking mechanism of the adjustable base is illustrated with the lever <b>48</b> in the locked orientation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and the lever <b>48</b> in the unlocked orientation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As the lever <b>48</b> is rotated from the locked position to the unlocked position in the direction of the rotary directional arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the engaged cam surfaces <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> cause the rotary collar <b>74</b> to shift generally away from the housing <b>22</b> in the direction that is indicated by the downward arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As the rotary collar <b>74</b> is rotated and shifted downwards, the spring washer <b>110</b> becomes compressed permitting the axial translation of the rotary collars <b>74</b>. As the rotary collar <b>74</b> is axially translated, the lever <b>48</b>, shaft <b>76</b> and clamp member <b>82</b> are all displaced the dimension between the high peak and low peak of the engaged cam surfaces. Additionally, due to the rotation of the shaft <b>76</b>, the clamp member <b>82</b> extends along the threaded end <b>80</b> of the shaft <b>76</b>, even further away from the housing <b>22</b>. Accordingly, mere rotation of the rotary collar <b>74</b> provides twice the mechanical advantage of displacement due to the displacement caused by the engaged cam surfaces <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and the threaded engagement of the shaft <b>76</b> and the clamp member <b>82</b>. This improved mechanical advantage is advantageous because it minimizes the amount of rotary displacement required to the lever <b>48</b> thereby enhancing the compactness of the portable jigsaw <b>20</b>. Further, the improved mechanical advantage requires the user to merely rotate the lever <b>48</b> a quarter turn (ninety degrees), rather than requiring the user to provide multiple or continuous rotations to the lever <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As the adjustable base <b>32</b> is returned to the locked orientation, the lever <b>48</b> is rotated in the lock direction as depicted by the rotary direction arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As the lever <b>48</b> and rotary collar <b>74</b> are rotated, the high peaks of the rotary collar cam surface <b>106</b> engage corresponding low peaks in the stationary collar cam surface <b>108</b>, thereby permitting the rotary collar <b>74</b> to be shifted in the upward direction, towards the housing <b>22</b> as depicted by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, by the spring washer <b>110</b>. Therefore, as the lever <b>48</b> is rotated in the lock direction, the lever <b>48</b>, rotary collar <b>74</b>, shaft <b>76</b> and clamp member <b>82</b> are all shifted upwards, towards the housing <b>22</b> as permitted by the engaged cam surfaces <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. Further, due to the threaded engagement of the shaft <b>76</b> and the clamp member <b>82</b>, the clamp member <b>82</b> is further translated along the shaft threaded end <b>80</b> towards the housing <b>22</b>. Due to the combined translation provided by the cam surfaces and the threadably engaged components, enough translation is provided to both loosen the threaded engagement and provide clearance for adjustment of the shell <b>52</b> about the clamp block <b>86</b>. Further, the combination of the cam surface engagement and threadable engagement provides enough translation that the clearance is overcome and the base shell <b>52</b> is clamped between the clamp block <b>86</b> and the housing <b>22</b>. Rather than just providing and eliminating clearance for the adjustment, the improved mechanical advantage provides enough translation so that the clamp block <b>86</b> and shell <b>52</b> experience a compressive load against the housing portion <b>69</b> thereby locking it relative to the housing portion <b>69</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The screw <b>98</b>, lock washer <b>100</b> and flat washer <b>102</b> maintain the orientation of the nut <b>92</b> relative to the clamp block <b>86</b>. However, the clamp block <b>86</b> may experience wear and fatigue over time, which may lessen the clamping effect and therefore may require adjustment of the nut <b>92</b>. Accordingly, the screw <b>98</b> may be loosened until the washer <b>102</b> no longer engages a side surface of the hexagonal nut <b>92</b>. Then, the nut <b>92</b> may be rotated to another flat side thereof, which are incrementally spaced radially at thirty degrees for a conventional hexagonal nut. After rotation of the nut <b>92</b> relative to the clamp block <b>86</b>, the screw <b>98</b> may be retightened relative to the clamp block <b>86</b> so that the flat washer <b>102</b> maintains the new orientation of the nut <b>92</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the baseplate <b>58</b> provides clearance for a screw driver to reach the screw <b>98</b>. The nut <b>92</b> may be rotated manually by reaching within the backside of the shell inner region <b>84</b>, or the baseplate <b>58</b> may be removed altogether to assist in this operation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To reduce the manufacturing costs of providing stationary and rotary collars <b>70</b>, <b>74</b>, the collars <b>70</b>, <b>74</b> are each formed from an investment casting process. Alternatively, the collars <b>70</b>, <b>74</b> may be formed from a powder metal compressing and sintering process, of the like. Further, the rotary collar <b>74</b> and lever <b>48</b> may be formed integrally by one of these manufacturing processes.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the housing <b>22</b> includes a first radial stop surface <b>112</b> for providing a limit to the range of rotation of the lever <b>48</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the housing <b>22</b> also includes a second radial stop surface <b>112</b> for providing a second limit to the range of rotation of the lever <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an alternative embodiment housing portion <b>114</b> is illustrated in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. Rather than requiring a biasing member such as the spring washer <b>110</b> of the prior embodiment, the housing portion <b>114</b> includes an inclined slot <b>116</b> formed therein for receiving the manual lever <b>48</b>. The inclined slot <b>116</b> terminates at the radial stop surface <b>112</b> so that as the lever <b>48</b> is rotated, the inclined slot <b>116</b> urges the lever <b>48</b> in a direction towards the stationary collar <b>70</b>. Accordingly, as the lever <b>48</b> is urged so are the rotary collar <b>74</b>, shaft <b>76</b> and clamp member <b>82</b> in a direction that maintains the engagement of the first cam surface <b>106</b> to the second cam surface <b>108</b>. Since the inclined slot extends radially inwards towards a central axis <b>118</b> of the shaft <b>76</b>, the inclined slot <b>116</b> forms a partial helix formed in the housing <b>114</b>. A projection <b>120</b> may be formed within the inclined slot <b>116</b> to maintain the lever <b>48</b> in the locked position, when it rests against the radial stop surface <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, an alternative embodiment clamping mechanism <b>122</b> is illustrated in accordance with the present invention. Same or similar elements retain same reference numerals wherein new elements are assigned new reference numerals. The clamping mechanism <b>122</b> includes a lower housing portion <b>124</b> with a shiftable collar <b>126</b> mounted therein. The shiftable collar <b>126</b> includes a pair of lugs <b>128</b> that cooperate with the housing <b>124</b> to prevent the shiftable collar <b>126</b> from rotating relative to the housing <b>124</b> while permitting the shiftable collar <b>126</b> to be shifted axially relative to the housing <b>124</b>. The clamping mechanism <b>122</b> is operated by a lever <b>48</b> extending from a rotary collar <b>74</b>. The rotary collar <b>74</b> includes a first cam surface <b>130</b> for engagement with a second cam surface <b>132</b> of the shiftable collar <b>126</b>. In comparison to the prior embodiment, one of the first and second cam surfaces <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> is shifted radially ninety degrees. Specifically, the first cam surface <b>130</b> is offset radially ninety degrees from the prior embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The clamping mechanism <b>122</b> includes a shaft <b>134</b> having a splined region <b>136</b> that is engaged within a corresponding splined region within the rotary collar <b>74</b> so that the shaft <b>134</b> is coupled for rotation with the rotary collar <b>74</b>, however the shaft <b>134</b> is free to translate axially relative to the rotary collar <b>74</b>. The shaft <b>134</b> includes a threaded distal end <b>80</b> threadably received within the nut <b>92</b> of the clamp member <b>82</b>. The shaft <b>134</b> also includes a hexagonal bolt head <b>138</b> formed thereon for retaining the shiftable collar <b>126</b> axially in the direction of the clamp member <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the clamping mechanism <b>122</b> is illustrated in the locked position. As the lever <b>48</b> is rotated away from the housing as illustrated by the rotary directional arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the lever <b>48</b>, rotary collar <b>74</b> and shaft <b>134</b> are rotated approximately ninety degrees. Due to this rotation, the high peaks of the first cam surface <b>130</b> are no longer aligned with the high peaks of the second cam surface <b>132</b> thereby permitting the shiftable collar <b>126</b> to translate downwards in the direction of the downward arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and consequently permitting the shaft <b>134</b> and clamp member <b>82</b> to shift downwards, thus unclamping the shell region <b>52</b> from between the clamp member <b>82</b> and the housing <b>124</b>. Additionally, due to this rotation, the clamp member <b>82</b> is advanced further away from the housing along the threaded end <b>80</b> of the shaft <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Once a desired bevel angle is selected, the shell region <b>52</b> of the base frame <b>50</b> is resecured to the housing <b>124</b> by rotating the lever <b>48</b> back to the lock position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Accordingly, the cooperating cam surfaces force the shiftable collar <b>126</b> upwards and towards the housing <b>22</b>. As the shiftable collar <b>126</b> is urged upward, the bolt head <b>138</b> of the shaft <b>134</b> is shifted upward, thus shifting the clamp member <b>82</b> towards the housing <b>22</b>. As the shaft <b>134</b> is rotated, the clamp member <b>82</b> extends axially along the threaded end <b>80</b> of the shaft <b>134</b>, thus clamping the shell region <b>52</b> between the clamp block <b>86</b> and the housing lower portion <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Since the cooperating cam surfaces <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> are engaged at a high peak to high peak orientation in the lock position, a biasing member is no longer needed and therefore, merely a flat washer <b>140</b> is provided between the rotary collar <b>74</b> and the wall portion <b>78</b> of the housing. However, this high peak to high peak engagement of the first cam surface <b>130</b> and the second cam surface <b>132</b> may not be desired because it merely provides a line contact between the rotary collar <b>74</b> and the shiftable collar <b>126</b> in the loaded position of the locking mechanism <b>122</b>. In contrast, the preferred embodiment locking mechanism provides an area contact in the locked position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and a line contact in the unlocked position is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Since it may be desired to provide an area of contact in the locked position, in order to stabilize the adjustable base and evenly distribute the compressive load, the area contact is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, another alternative embodiment clamping mechanism <b>142</b> is illustrated in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The clamping mechanism <b>142</b> is similar to the clamping mechanism <b>122</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, however the clamping mechanism <b>142</b> includes a shaft <b>144</b> that is threadably engaged into a shiftable collar <b>146</b> and includes a hexagonal bolt head <b>148</b> for retaining a clamp block <b>150</b> axially. As the lever <b>48</b> and rotary collar <b>74</b> are rotated in the direction of the rotary direction arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, to the unlocked position, the rotary collar <b>74</b> rotates the shaft <b>144</b> as well due to the spline region <b>136</b> of the shaft. As the first cam surface <b>130</b> is rotated to the unlocked direction, the shiftable collar <b>146</b> is permitted to translate axially downward as indicated by the downward arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Accordingly, the shaft <b>144</b> and bolt head <b>148</b> may be translated axially downward for providing clearance between the clamp block <b>50</b> and shell region <b>52</b> and the housing <b>124</b>. Further, as the shaft <b>144</b> is rotated relative to the shiftable collar <b>146</b>, the threaded engagement therebetween causes the shaft <b>144</b> to extend axially away from the housing <b>22</b> thereby providing further clearance for unclamping the shell region <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As the lever <b>48</b> is returned to the lock position, the rotary collar <b>74</b> shifts the shiftable collar <b>146</b> towards the housing <b>22</b>, thus shifting the shaft <b>144</b>, hexagonal bolt head <b>148</b> and clamp block <b>150</b> against the shell region <b>52</b> and towards the housing <b>124</b>. Further, due to the threaded end <b>80</b> of the shaft <b>144</b> being threadably engaged within the shiftable collar <b>146</b>, the shaft <b>144</b> is urged further towards the housing <b>124</b>, thus enhancing the clamping characteristics of the clamping mechanism <b>142</b>. The alternative embodiment clamping mechanism <b>142</b> is not preferred because it provides no method of adjusting the threaded engagement of the threaded end <b>80</b> of the shaft <b>144</b> relative to the component in which it is received, specifically the shiftable collar <b>146</b>. Unlike the prior embodiments, the clamping mechanism <b>142</b> does not provide adjustment to overcome wear or fatigue experienced by the clamp block <b>150</b> or the other associated clamping elements such as the shell region <b>52</b> or the housing <b>124</b>. Further, the alternative embodiment clamping mechanism <b>142</b> may be more difficult to assemble than the prior embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, another alternative embodiment clamping mechanism <b>152</b> is illustrated in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The clamping mechanism <b>152</b> includes a stationary collar <b>70</b> secured to the housing lower region <b>22</b>. The lever <b>48</b> is utilized for rotating the rotary collar <b>74</b>. A shaft <b>154</b> is journaled within the stationary collar <b>70</b> and includes an intermediate threaded region <b>156</b> that is threadably engaged within the rotary collar <b>74</b>. The shaft <b>154</b> further includes a hexagonal bolt head <b>158</b> formed at a distal end thereof for retaining the clamp member <b>82</b> axially. The clamp member <b>82</b> includes the screw <b>98</b>, lock washer <b>100</b> and flat washer <b>102</b> for mounting the lock washer <b>100</b> against a flat surface of the hexagonal bolt head <b>158</b> for preventing rotation of the shaft <b>154</b> relative to the clamp member <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The clamping mechanism <b>152</b> is unlocked by rotating the lever <b>48</b> and consequently the rotary collar <b>74</b> to the unlocked direction as depicted by the rotary direction arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Due to the engaged cam surfaces <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> of the rotary collar <b>74</b> and stationary collar <b>70</b>, the rotary collar <b>74</b> is urged downwards as depicted by the downward extending arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, thus compressing the spring washer <b>110</b>. As the rotary collar <b>74</b> is shifted downwards, the shaft <b>154</b> is shifted downwards thereby permitting the clamp member <b>82</b> to be translated axially from the housing <b>22</b> for unclamping the shell member <b>52</b> disposed between the clamp member <b>82</b> and the housing. Further, due to the threaded engagement of the shaft <b>154</b> and the rotary collar <b>74</b>, the shaft <b>154</b> is further extended axially away from the housing relative to the rotary collar <b>74</b> thereby enhancing the mechanical advantage of the quarter turn of the lever <b>48</b> and rotary collar <b>74</b>. As the lever <b>48</b> is returned to the locked position, the spring washer <b>110</b> urges the rotary collar <b>74</b> towards the housing and into full engagement of the rotary collar cam surface <b>106</b> with the second cam surface <b>108</b> of the stationary collar <b>70</b>. Accordingly, the shaft <b>154</b> and clamp member <b>182</b> are shifted towards the housing as well. Further, due to the threaded engagement of the shaft <b>154</b> and the rotary collar <b>74</b>, the shaft <b>154</b> is further translated axially toward the housing <b>22</b>, thus enhancing the clamping engagement of the shell region <b>52</b> between the clamp member <b>82</b> and the housing portion <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Accordingly, the teachings of the present invention provide an improved mechanical advantage to a user for adjusting a base of a portable saw relative to the cutting plane for providing various bevel angles, while minimizing the efforts required by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">While embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it is not intended that these embodiments illustrate and describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather, the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation, and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
