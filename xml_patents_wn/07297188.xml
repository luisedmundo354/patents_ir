<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/882,484, filed Jun. 15, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,866,705, issued Mar. 15, 2005.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to floor maintenance equipment and, more particularly, to a floor screening attachment and a dust collection system for a floor finishing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a result of traffic induced wear, wood floors must be periodically refinished. Before the new finish is applied, the existing finish is sanded lightly or screened to promote adhesion of the new and old finishes. Screening is typically performed with a rotary floor machine of the type used for buffing, scrubbing, polishing, and a number of other floor maintenance operations. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, typically, a floor machine <b>10</b> comprises a chassis <b>12</b> with an attached operator control handle <b>14</b>. To facilitate moving the machine <b>10</b>, a pair of wheels <b>16</b> is attached to the chassis <b>12</b> supporting the floor machine <b>10</b> when it is tipped in the direction of the handle <b>14</b>. A large diameter circular pad driver <b>18</b>, located under the chassis <b>12</b>, is connected to and rotated by a drive shaft <b>24</b> that is powered by a motor <b>20</b> and gear train <b>22</b> mounted in the chassis <b>12</b>. The pad <b>26</b> that performs the polishing, buffing, or other floor care operation is trapped between the pad driver and the floor. Friction between the pad driver <b>26</b> and the pad causes the pad to rotate with the pad driver <b>18</b>. For floor screening, the “pad” or screen <b>26</b> comprises an abrasive coated open mesh cloth having the appearance of window screen. Typically, the pad driver <b>18</b> used with a screen <b>26</b> is faced with felt to provide a resilient backing for the screen <b>26</b>. Slippage between the felt face of the pad driver <b>18</b> and the screen <b>26</b> erode the abrasive coating of the screen <b>26</b>. The life of the abrasive on the side of the screen in contact with the pad driver <b>18</b> may be reduced by up to 50%. Since both sides of the screen <b>26</b> may be used to abrade the floor, slippage between the screen and pad driver results in a substantial increase in the cost of abrasives required to perform a screening operation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A second problem inherent in floor screening is the production of a large quantity of fine sanding dust. The dust can be controlled and collected with a wet screening process where water is spread on the floor prior to screening. The dust produced by screening mixes with the water to form a slurry that is removed from the floor by mopping. However, the slurry is difficult clean and its presence on the floor surface obscures the surface making it difficult to judge the progress and quality of the screening operation. For these reasons, floors may be screened while dry. However, the dry screening dust easily becomes airborne and must be cleaned from any horizontal or inclined surface in the vicinity of the screening project. Further, the fine airborne finish particles produced by screening may present a health hazard.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To reduce the airborne dust produced by screening, specialized floor machines with dust collection systems have been devised. Typically, the dust collection system comprises an industrial vacuum cleaner connected to a shroud enclosing the top and the perimeter of the pad driver of the special machine. A special floor machine with a dust collection system may be justifiable for floor refinishing contractors, but many facilities have floor machines that are not equipped for dust collection and a special machine is not justifiable for periodic floor refinishing projects. Further, the quantity and fine nature of the dust produced by screening limits the effectiveness of the typical dust collection system. First, the felt pad driver used for screening comprises random fibers and has limited porosity. Air passages in the felt will quickly plug when air laden with screening dust is drawn through the felt. Since air cannot be drawn through the pad driver without frequent cleaning, the dust becomes trapped in the mesh of the screen and dust collection is only effective when the dust leaks from the edges of the screen disk. In addition, industrial vacuum cleaners rely on a dry filter element that traps particles on the surface of the element when air is drawn through pores of the filter medium. The fine dust produced by screening rapidly plugs the pores of the filter medium and the filter element must be frequently changed or cleaned if the vacuum cleaner is to continue to function.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">James et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,093, disclose an ultra-filtration vacuum system that includes multiple liquid and dry filtering stages. Contaminated air drawn into the cannister of the vacuum is directed into a cyclonic air stream that separates large particles and debris from the air. The separated material collects in a first liquid filter medium in the bottom of the cannister. After cyclonic cleaning, the air passes through a labyrinth filter and is injected below the surface a second liquid filter medium. The air forms bubbles that rise to the surface of the liquid where many of the bubbles collapse. The air and liquid are then dispersed in a dispersion chamber. Particles entrained in the air are wetted by the liquid and a combination of cyclonic action and baffles in the dispersion chamber separate the mixture of liquid and wetted particles which flows back into the second liquid filter medium. Particulates remaining entrained in the air are filtered by a final dry filter element. While the vacuum system throughly filters the air, it is complex and not well suited to handling large quantities of fine dust produced by floor screening. Cyclonic cleaning relies on centrifugal force to separate heavy particles and debris from the air stream but is of limited usefulness for removing the fine, light weight particles produced by floor screening. When used for floor screening, the intermediate labyrinth filter would be exposed to essentially unfiltered air and subject to rapid plugging by the screening dust. Injecting contaminated air into a liquid filter media is an effective method of filtering out fine particles, but the volume of liquid in the second liquid filter stage is limited by the necessary equipment and the presence of the first stage filter in the cannister and would rapidly reach its capacity of particulate matter when exposed to the volume of dust. produced by screening.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">If the finish is severely worn, floor screening may not be sufficient to prepare the floor for refinishing. In this case, as with newly installed floors, sanding the wood of the floor may be necessary to prepare the surface for the application of the finish. Floor sanding is performed with large belt or drum sanders. Like floor screening, floor sanding creates substantial quantities of dust. As is the case with floor screening, the large quantity of dust will rapidly plug a dry filter of a dust collection system. In addition, the presence of wood in the sanding dust causes foaming in a liquid filter medium severely limiting its effectiveness. Anti-foaming chemicals can reduce the foaming, but the chemicals are only partially effective. Further, adding chemicals to the liquid filter medium significantly increases the cost of floor finishing because the large quantity of dust requires the liquid medium and the anti-foaming chemicals be frequently replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is desired, therefore, is an apparatus for converting a standard floor machine to a floor screening machine and an effective, large capacity dust collection system suitable for floor screening and sanding operations.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the floor screening system <b>40</b> of the present invention generally comprises a floor machine <b>42</b>, a floor screening attachment <b>44</b>, and a dust collection vacuum system <b>46</b> connected to the floor screening attachment <b>44</b> by a hose <b>48</b>. The floor machine <b>42</b> comprises a chassis <b>50</b> enclosing a motor <b>52</b> and a gear train <b>54</b>. The chassis <b>50</b> also provides a connection point for a handle <b>56</b> for operator control of the floor machine <b>42</b>. Typically, floor machines are equipped with a pair of wheels <b>58</b> attached to the chassis <b>50</b> and arranged to engage the floor when the floor machine <b>42</b> is tipped toward the handle <b>56</b>. The wheels <b>58</b> provide a convenient support for the floor machine when moving between work areas. The floor screening attachment <b>44</b> is fitted with wheels <b>60</b> mounted for rotation and attached to the shroud <b>72</b>. Since the screening attachment <b>44</b> elevates the chassis <b>50</b>, the wheels of the floor machine <b>58</b> may not be useful for moving the floor machine when the screening attachment is in place. The wheels <b>60</b> can be used for moving the floor machine <b>42</b> when it is equipped with the screening attachment <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, the floor screening attachment <b>44</b> comprises generally a pad driver <b>70</b> and a shroud <b>72</b> mounted for rotation independent of the pad driver. The pad driver <b>70</b> includes a pad driver shaft <b>74</b> having a first end providing an interface to the powered drive shaft <b>62</b> projecting from the gear box of the floor machine <b>42</b>. The interface between the pad driver shaft <b>74</b> and the drive shaft <b>62</b> of the floor machine is dictated by the design of the floor machine but, by way of example only, may be provided by intermeshing projections as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A circular sanding block <b>76</b> is affixed to the second end of the pad driver shaft <b>74</b>. The sanding block comprises a backing plate <b>78</b> and a facing <b>80</b>. The backing plate <b>78</b> is a disk that supports the facing <b>80</b> and controls distortion of the facing which could cause unevenness of the screened surface. A bearing and seal <b>82</b> is affixed to the upper surface of the backing plate <b>78</b> and engages complementary bearing and sealing rings <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> attached to the shroud <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The shroud <b>72</b> of the screening attachment <b>44</b> includes a connector <b>88</b> for a hose <b>48</b> to the dust collection vacuum system <b>46</b>. The bearing and sealing ring <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>, and <b>86</b>, in conjunction with the shroud <b>72</b>, form a plenum <b>75</b> around the periphery of the backing plate <b>78</b> in communication with the connector <b>88</b>. The pressure differential created in the plenum <b>75</b> by the vacuum source draws air through an approximately annular aperture between the shroud <b>72</b> and the backing plate <b>76</b> to move air entrained dust particles to the hose connection outlet <b>88</b>. The shroud <b>72</b> may be extended by a skirt <b>73</b>, such as a brush type screen or flexible element, to aid in confining dust expelled from the perimeter of the screen <b>90</b>. Preferably the skirt <b>73</b> comprises a flexible, non-porous material such as rubber or plastic that stops short of the floor to permit air to flow into the plenum <b>75</b>. However, the skirt <b>73</b> may comprise a brush or other porous material to permit air to flow into the plenum <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The screen <b>90</b> typically comprises an open mesh cloth coated with silicon carbide or another abrasive. When the sanding block <b>76</b> is rotated, friction between the facing <b>80</b> and the screen <b>90</b> causes the screen to rotate. To reduce slippage between the screen <b>90</b> and the facing <b>80</b> and resulting erosion of the abrasive from the screen <b>90</b> the present inventors concluded that facing should utilize a material having a high coefficient of friction with the mesh material. Further, the inventors concluded that when air is drawn through the prior art felt sanding block facing the passages in the felt quickly plug with dust limiting the effectiveness of the dust collection system. As a result, dust becomes trapped between the mesh of the screen and the felt facing. Since the vacuum system cannot draw air and dust through the plugged felt, the dust collection system is limited to collecting dust that migrates to the edge of the screen disk. The facing <b>80</b> of the sanding block <b>76</b> of the present invention comprises a plurality of spaced apart raised surfaces <b>92</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the spaced apart, raised surfaces <b>92</b> are separated by surfaces <b>94</b> having a portion in relief of the raised surfaces <b>92</b> to create a pattern of channels through which air and entrained dust particles can migrate to reach the perimeter of disk for collection by the vacuum system. Rubber compounds, synthetic rubbers, plastics, and similar materials provide high friction between the screen <b>90</b> and the facing to reduce slippage and erosion of the abrasive, resilience to protect the sanded surface, and are moldable to form the plurality of spaced apart raised surfaces <b>92</b> useful in promoting air flow and dust collection.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an alternative construction for the floor screening attachment <b>44</b> of the present invention. The floor screen <b>202</b> is supported by a sanding block <b>201</b> (illustrated by a bracket) comprising a wooden backing plate <b>204</b> and a facing <b>80</b> as described above. To improve conformance of the screen <b>202</b> with the floor surface, a compliant pad <b>206</b> may be placed between the facing <b>80</b> and the wooden backing plate <b>204</b>. The sanding block is driven by a shaft <b>208</b> affixed to a flange <b>210</b> that is attached to the wooden backing plate with screws <b>212</b>. The opposite end of the shaft <b>208</b> is affixed to a second flange <b>214</b> that is attached to riser <b>216</b> and a clutch plate <b>218</b> by screws <b>220</b>. The drive shaft <b>62</b> of a floor machine <b>42</b> engages the clutch plate <b>218</b> to drive the sanding block <b>201</b>. A shroud <b>222</b> with a skirt <b>224</b> forms a plenum <b>226</b> about the exposed periphery of the sanding block <b>201</b>. A vacuum source (not illustrated) attached to the shroud draws air contaminated with dust from the plenum <b>226</b>. A pair of bearings having flanged outer cases <b>228</b> and <b>230</b> attached to the shroud <b>222</b> with screws <b>232</b>, permit the shaft <b>208</b> to rotate independent of the shroud <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the vacuum system <b>46</b> of the present invention is connected to the screening attachment <b>44</b> by a hose <b>48</b>. The vacuum system <b>46</b> comprises generally a motor enclosure <b>100</b> and a container or cannister <b>102</b>. A vacuum source <b>104</b> (typically a motor and a fan) creates a pressure differential between the inlet <b>106</b> to the cannister and an air outlet <b>107</b>. A volume of liquid <b>108</b> (typically water) fills the cannister to a liquid level <b>110</b>. The inlet <b>106</b> for contaminated air drawn from the screening attachment is submerged in the liquid <b>108</b>. As the contaminated air <b>112</b> (indicated by an arrow) emerges from the submerged inlet <b>106</b> particles entrained in the air are wetted by and trapped in the liquid <b>108</b>. However, the surface tension of the liquid <b>108</b> also results in bubbles <b>114</b> and particles in the air trapped within the bubbles may not be wetted by the liquid. The bubbles <b>114</b> rise to the surface <b>110</b> of the liquid <b>108</b>. Particles within bubbles collapsing on the surface <b>110</b> of the liquid are wetted and trapped in the liquid <b>108</b>. Air and liquid are drawn up through a mixer <b>116</b> which further mixes the liquid and air further wetting entrained particles. The mixer <b>116</b> comprises a larger diameter tube concentric with the tube <b>118</b> leading from the hose to the inlet <b>106</b>. The mixture of air, liquid, and particles exits the mixing chamber <b>116</b> and enters a separator <b>118</b>. The separator <b>118</b> comprises a hollow toroid of generally circular cross-section surrounding the tube <b>118</b> leading to the inlet <b>106</b>. As the mixture of air and liquid is deflected by the curved walls of the separator and forced to change direction <b>120</b> (indicated by an arrow) additional bubbles are collapsed by the walls and additional particles are wetted by the liquid. As the moving mixture is further forced around the curved interior of the separator <b>118</b>, the heavier liquid and wetted particles are forced to the walls of the separator by centrifugal force. A slurry of liquid and wetted particles exits the mixing and separation chamber <b>118</b> at an exit aperture <b>122</b> and drops under the influence of gravity into the volume of liquid <b>108</b> in the bottom of the cannister <b>102</b>. Filtered air <b>124</b> exiting the separator chamber <b>118</b> is drawn to the outlet <b>107</b> by the pressure differential produced by the vacuum source <b>104</b>. Before exiting the cannister <b>102</b>, the air may also be filtered by a secondary dry filter <b>126</b> positioned in the air flow path. The large volume of liquid <b>108</b> in the cannister <b>102</b> provides substantial capacity to absorb dust produced by the screening operation permitting the work to continue without the need to change or clean filters. Liquid filtration avoids filter clogging encountered with industrial vacuums during screening.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The vacuum system <b>46</b> provides substantial capacity for capturing dust produced by floor screening operations and can be used for other floor finishing operations, such as sanding. The wood of a new floor must be sanded to prepare the surface for finishing. Likewise, if an existing finish is severely worn sanding may be necessary to restore the surface for refinishing. Sanding can be performed with floor screening machines, drum sanders and belt sanders and produces as great or greater quantities of dust than floor screening. Further, the wood in the sawdust produced by floor sanding aggravates foaming of a liquid dust filter medium substantially reducing the effectiveness of liquid in trapping dust. Anti-foaming chemicals can be added to the liquid to:reduce the foaming but the chemicals are only partially effective. In addition, the absorption of large quantities of dust requires frequent disposal of the liquid medium and the anti-foaming chemicals substantially increasing the cost of sanding. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, to increase the dust containment capacity of the system and reduce problems created by foaming of a liquid dust filter medium during sanding operations, the floor finishing system of the present invention may include a dust removal unit <b>240</b> to remove a substantial portion of the dust from the air stream before reaching the vacuum <b>46</b>. The components of the system having counterparts illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and performing the same functions are assigned like numerals. The vacuum <b>46</b> draws dust laden air from the screening attachment <b>44</b> through the hose <b>242</b> into the dust removal unit <b>240</b>. A hose <b>244</b> connects the dust removal unit <b>240</b> to the vacuum <b>46</b>. A belt or drum sander may be used instead of a floor machine for sanding operations. Sanders and other floor finishing machines may include a fan to draw air from the vicinity of the working portion of the sanding or tool and expel it through the hose <b>242</b> to the dust removal unit <b>240</b> eliminating the need for the separate vacuum source <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the dust removal unit <b>240</b> comprises generally a dust collection tank <b>250</b> sealed with a lid <b>252</b>. Sawdust laden air is drawn from the vicinity of the sanding element or tool of a floor screening machine, sander, or other floor finishing tool through the hose <b>242</b> to an inlet tube <b>254</b> of the dust removal unit <b>240</b>. Air contaminated with dust flows through the hose <b>242</b> into the dust removal unit <b>240</b> as a result of an air pressure differential between the inlet tube <b>254</b> and an outlet tube <b>256</b>. The air pressure differential can be created by an air moving device, such as a vacuum source <b>46</b> connected to the outlet tube <b>256</b> by a hose <b>244</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> or by a fan at the floor finishing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Air including suspended dust entering the dust removal unit <b>240</b> is directed toward the underside of the top surface of the lid <b>252</b> into a first passage <b>258</b>. The first passage <b>258</b> is bounded by the underside of the lid <b>252</b> and an upper surface of a secondary chamber structure <b>260</b> suspended generally centrally in the lid <b>252</b> by attachment to the inlet <b>254</b> and outlet <b>256</b> tubes. The secondary chamber structure <b>260</b> is generally a hollow cylinder with a closed upper end. The velocity of the air is substantially reduced when the air flow is redirected by the surface of the lid <b>252</b> and diffused in the first passage <b>258</b> which has a cross-section substantially larger than the inlet tube <b>254</b>. As a result of the pressure differential between the inlet tube <b>254</b> and outlet tube <b>256</b> air flows to a second passage <b>264</b> in fluid communication with the first passage <b>258</b>. The second passage <b>264</b> has a cross-section greater the first passage <b>258</b> causing the dust laden air to further decelerate. As the velocity of the air decreases in the second passage <b>264</b> the dust particles can no longer be supported by the air and fall to the bottom of the tank under the influence of gravity. The air exiting the second passage <b>264</b> is further decelerated as its direction is changed to enter a third passage <b>266</b> defined by the interior surfaces of the secondary chamber structure <b>260</b>. The further reduction in velocity releases substantially all of the dust remaining suspended in the air. The air exits the third passage <b>266</b> through the outlet tube <b>256</b>.</p>
