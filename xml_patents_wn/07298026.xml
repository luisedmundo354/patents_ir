<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to integrated circuits, and more particularly to small footprint packages for large dies and methods for the fabrication thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Reducing the size of electronic devices while increasing performance and speed is a continuing objective in the electronics industry. Electronic system manufacturers continue to demand components with higher performance and reliability along with reduced physical sizes and manufacturing costs. To accomplish this, increased miniaturization of integrated circuit (“IC”) packages is becoming increasingly essential. In response, modern requirements for IC packaging are increasingly oriented toward smaller and thinner packages having ever higher numbers of input/output (“I/O”) terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">IC packages for complex electronic systems typically incorporate one or more interconnected IC chips or dies, which are usually made from a semiconductor material such as silicon (“Si”) or gallium arsenide (“GaAs”). A variety of semiconductor devices may be formed in various layers on the dies using photolithographic techniques. After manufacture, the dies are typically incorporated into packages that are then mounted on printed circuit boards.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Die packages typically have numerous external pins that are mechanically attached to conductor patterns on the printed circuit boards by soldering or other known techniques. Typically, the packages in which these dies are mounted include a substrate or other die-mounting device. One example of such a substrate is a leadframe. High-performance leadframes may encompass multi-layer structures including power, ground, and signal layers on separate planes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">IC dies may be attached to a leadframe by an adhesive, or by other commonly employed techniques such as soldering. A number of power, ground, and/or signal leads are then attached to power, ground, and/or signal sites on the die.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Once a die is attached mechanically and electrically to the leadframe, the leadframe may be enclosed or encapsulated in a protective enclosure such as plastic, or a multi-part housing made of plastic, ceramic, or metal. The enclosure helps to protect the leadframe and the attached die from physical, electrical, moisture, and/or chemical damage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The leadframe and attached die may then be mounted, for example, on a circuit board or circuit card, typically with other leadframes or devices, for incorporation into any of a wide variety of end products.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Typical known leadframes that include a number of layers on different planes are complex and expensive to produce. Multiple planes have nevertheless been incorporated into the design of many leadframes in order to accommodate the high density of leads needed for the highly complex dies typically used today.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another solution for providing a high density of leads is a multiple-row leadframe in which independent inner and outer rows of leads are provided in a common plane. One such configuration, for example, provides a dual-row pattern in which an inner row of leads is surrounded by an outer row, either in staggered or in-line configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">“Leadless” packages are becoming increasingly important as component and circuit designs become ever smaller and smaller. In such leadless packages, the internal leads of the leadframe terminate as contacts on the exterior surface of the package rather than as external wires or leads extending outwardly from the package surface. In this manner, some of the contacts, for example those coming from the internal inner row leads, can be located on the package surface inwardly and away from the package edge. This positions the inner row contacts away from other contacts that are on the package edge (such as, for example, contacts from the outer row leads). More contacts can thus be accommodated without requiring a larger and longer package edge, since not all the contacts are crowded together at the package edge.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One such leadless package is a quad flat no lead (“QFN”) package. QFN packages with higher numbers of input and output (“I/O”) connections in the same or smaller body sizes are increasingly important for successful and competitive end-product designs. One key factor that is helping to achieve the higher number of I/Os in compact end-product designs is a dual-row QFN package internal lead arrangement. These designs have inner row leads and outer row leads (either staggered or in-line), usually in the same plane.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Unfortunately, increased miniaturization creates conflicts where older-generation IC dies of larger proportions need to be converted in order to fit into smaller IC package configurations (e.g., into QFN packages). (“Large die”, in this case, thus refers to a die that is large enough to overlap the leads of the leadframe.) Often, the larger sizes of these older-generation dies simply cannot be reduced enough to accommodate this conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One solution for accommodating larger dies has been to mount them on newer, smaller-sized leadframes with a non-conductive adhesive film layer positioned between each die and its leadframe. The non-conductive film insulates the large die from the inner leads of the small leadframe where the die overlaps the inner leads of the leadframe.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A difficulty with this solution is that the film and the film adhesive insulate the die both electrically and thermally from the die paddle on the leadframe. Ordinarily, a die is bonded onto the die paddle of a leadframe by use of a die-bonding material such as a gold-silicon (“Au—Si”) eutectic, solder, resin paste, or the like. The die paddle then ordinarily performs several functions: it physically supports the die, and it provides both an electrical ground and a thermal sink for the die. In fact, in many package designs the leadframe die paddle is exposed on the package exterior to enhance the thermal dissipation capability for the die. But when such an adhesive film configuration is used for adapting small packages for use with such large dies, the ground pad and the thermal dissipation functions of the die paddle are effectively defeated.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Miniaturization causes other problems as well. For example, as the leadframe elements become smaller and smaller in such designs, they also unfortunately become thinner and less robust, which makes them increasingly susceptible to displacement, such as bending or tilting, while they are being encapsulated. The inner leads, in particular, which are weaker than the outer leads, are increasingly likely to be displaced in this manner by the molding compound as the compound flows over and through the leadframe during the molding process. This displacement moves and lifts the leads from their proper positions and allows the molding compound to seep under the leads, causing mold flash underneath the pad terminals. This in turn causes the leads to be partially or completely covered with the molding compound at the package surface, which results in a defective package.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, a need remains for leadframe designs, configurations, and manufacturing methods that will provide die paddle electrical ground and thermal sink for large dies, and will maintain the leadframe leads in their proper positions during the flow of the molding compound in the package molding process. In view of the ever-decreasing sizes of leadframes, the ever-increasing numbers of leads on such leadframes, and the persistent need to reduce costs and increase efficiencies, it is increasingly critical that answers be found to these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention provides a method for fabricating a large die package. A leadframe having leads and a paddle is provided. An interposer is attached onto the leadframe with the interposer extending over at least a portion of the paddle and at least a portion of the leads of the leadframe. The interposer is insulated from the leads. A die is attached to the interposer.</p>

The advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description when taken with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The inner leads <b>102</b> terminate in lead tips <b>114</b>, and the outer leads <b>104</b> terminate in lead tips <b>116</b>. Tie bars <b>118</b> connect the paddle <b>106</b> to the outer portions of the leadframe matrix <b>100</b>, such as, for example, to the outer leads <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, therein is shown a cross-sectional view of the leadframe matrix <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) taken on line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, therein is shown a portion of a leadframe <b>300</b>, similar to the inner portions of the leadframe matrix <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), at an early stage in the fabrication of an IC package. The leadframe <b>300</b> includes a paddle <b>302</b> and inner leads <b>304</b> that terminate at lead tips <b>306</b> adjacent the paddle <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, therein is shown the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> following attachment of an interposer <b>400</b> onto the leadframe <b>300</b>. The interposer <b>400</b>, which in this embodiment is composed of several layers, is electrically insulative, has lateral dimensions slightly larger than a die (such as the die <b>602</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that is to be mounted thereon, and is considerably more robust than a mere layer of adhesive film. The interposer <b>400</b> in this embodiment is also larger than the paddle <b>302</b> and extends over the lead tips <b>306</b>. The several layers of the interposer <b>400</b> include an adhesive layer <b>402</b> on the top thereof, an intermediate layer <b>404</b> immediately beneath the adhesive layer <b>402</b>, and an adhesive layer <b>406</b> on the bottom thereof. The adhesive layer <b>406</b> is an electrically insulating layer that is between, and attaches, the intermediate layer <b>404</b> to the leadframe <b>300</b> and to the lead tips <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The adhesive layers <b>402</b> and <b>406</b> may be, for example, any suitable adhesive ordinarily known and employed for securing dies and/or films to leadframes. The intermediate layer <b>404</b>, which is more robust than a layer of adhesive film, may be, for example, a polyimide, a ceramic, or a metallic material according to the characteristics and functionalities desired in the finished IC package, as discussed more particularly hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The interposer <b>400</b> also includes several through-holes <b>408</b> that pass therethrough from the top to the bottom thereof, thereby penetrating all three of the layers <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, and <b>406</b>. In one embodiment, the interposer <b>400</b> is pre-punched with the through-holes <b>408</b>. The shapes of the through-holes <b>408</b> can be any appropriate shapes (e.g., circular, oval, square, rectangular, star, hexagon, octagon, and so forth) according to the needs at hand. Similarly, the patterns of the through-holes <b>408</b> can be any appropriate patterns (e.g., parallel rows, staggered rows, circles, concentric circles, ovals, embedded and/or overlapping polygons, and so forth) according to the needs at hand.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, therein is shown the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> following the attachment of an epoxy <b>502</b> to the top of the interposer <b>400</b> and to the top of the paddle <b>302</b> in the areas thereof exposed by the through-holes <b>408</b>. The epoxy <b>502</b> may be any known, suitable epoxy ordinarily employed, for example, for securing IC dies onto leadframe paddles.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, therein is shown the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> following attachment of a die <b>602</b> onto the epoxy <b>502</b> above the interposer <b>400</b>. The die <b>602</b> is an IC that is larger than the paddle <b>302</b>. In fact, the die <b>602</b> extends laterally somewhat over the lead tips <b>306</b> of the inner leads <b>304</b>. (“Large die”, in this case, thus refers to a die that is large enough to overlap the leads of the leadframe.) However, the interposer <b>400</b> separates the die <b>602</b> from the inner leads <b>304</b>, thereby electrically insulating the die <b>602</b> therefrom. By virtue of the through-holes <b>408</b>, however, the paddle <b>302</b> is able to afford thermal dissipation for the die <b>602</b> by employing an epoxy <b>502</b> that is thermally conductive, thereby conducting heat away from the die <b>602</b> to the paddle <b>302</b> through the through-holes <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The material and dimensions of the intermediate layer <b>404</b> are selected to provide the necessary and desirable supporting strength between the die <b>602</b> and the paddle <b>302</b>, notwithstanding the presence of the through-holes <b>408</b>. Further, the material of which the intermediate layer <b>404</b> is composed may be selected to further facilitate such heat transfer (for example, by choosing a metallic material).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, therein is shown the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> following wire bonding of the die <b>602</b> to the leadframe <b>300</b>, and in particular, to the inner leads <b>304</b>, by means of wires <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, therein is shown the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> located between an upper mold section <b>802</b> and a lower mold section <b>804</b> prior to injection of a mold compound for encapsulating the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> into a finished package.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, therein is shown a package <b>900</b> which is the finished package formed of the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> after encapsulation in a molding compound <b>902</b> in accordance with the molding step illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The package <b>900</b> thus successfully packages a die, such as the die <b>602</b>, that is a large die relative to the leadframe <b>300</b> on which it is supported. (“Large die”, in this case, refers to a die that is large enough to overlap the leads of the leadframe.) It has been discovered, according to the present invention, that an interposer, such as the interposer <b>400</b>, makes it possible to accommodate a large die, such as the die <b>602</b>, on a smaller leadframe, such as the leadframe <b>300</b>. The invention thus enables older, “legacy” dies of larger sizes to be successfully supported on, and to interface with, newer, smaller leadframe and package profiles without loss or sacrifice of thermal dissipation and electrical functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, therein is shown a package <b>1000</b> similar to the package <b>900</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), but incorporating another embodiment of the present invention. In the package <b>1000</b>, an interposer <b>1002</b> is composed of an electrically insulating adhesive layer <b>1004</b> and a metal layer <b>1006</b>. The interposer <b>1002</b> has lateral dimensions slightly larger than the die <b>602</b> that is mounted thereon. The interposer <b>1002</b> is also larger than the paddle <b>302</b> and extends over the lead tips <b>306</b>. The electrically insulating adhesive layer <b>1004</b> is situated between and attaches the leadframe <b>300</b> and the metal layer <b>1006</b>, including adhering the metal layer <b>1006</b> to the lead tips <b>306</b> while electrically insulating the interposer <b>1002</b> therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The metal layer <b>1006</b>, which is more robust than a layer of adhesive film, is a finished bondable metal layer of, for example, gold (“Au”), silver (“Ag”), palladium (“Pd”), and so forth as appropriate to the particular configuration at hand. As in the embodiment shown in the package <b>900</b>, the interposer <b>1002</b> is thus positioned on the leadframe <b>300</b> between the leadframe <b>300</b> and the die <b>602</b>, which is attached to the interposer <b>1002</b> by the epoxy <b>502</b>. The metal layer <b>1006</b> of the interposer <b>1002</b> substantially enhances the heat transfer capability of the interposer <b>1002</b>, thereby significantly improving the thermal dissipation of the package <b>1000</b> for conducting heat from the die <b>602</b> out of the package <b>1000</b> through the paddle <b>302</b> of the leadframe <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A significant advantage of the package <b>1000</b> is that the metal layer <b>1006</b> of the interposer <b>1002</b> can provide a ground bond and/or die backside ground in the package <b>1000</b>. Thus, since the electrically insulating adhesive layer <b>1004</b> is an insulating layer, the metal layer <b>1006</b> can be connected to a ground potential source (not shown). Ground bond wires <b>1008</b> can then be connected directly from the die <b>602</b> to the grounded metal layer <b>1006</b>. Similarly, the epoxy <b>502</b> may be an electrically conductive epoxy, thereby providing a die backside ground for the die <b>602</b>, notwithstanding that the die <b>602</b> is separated and electrically insulated from the paddle <b>302</b> by the electrically insulating adhesive layer <b>1004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, therein is shown a package <b>1100</b> having an interposer <b>1102</b> secured on top of the leadframe <b>300</b> by an electrically insulating adhesive layer <b>1104</b> therebetween. The interposer <b>1102</b> has lateral dimensions slightly larger than the die <b>602</b> that is mounted thereon and extends over the lead tips <b>306</b>. The interposer <b>1102</b>, which is more robust than a layer of adhesive film, may be a perforated layer of a polyimide, a ceramic, or a metal, as appropriate to the needs at hand. The electrically insulating adhesive layer <b>1104</b> also attaches the interposer <b>1102</b> to the lead tips <b>306</b> while electrically insulating the interposer <b>1102</b> therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">One or more through-holes <b>1106</b> pass through the interposer <b>1102</b> and the electrically insulating adhesive layer <b>1104</b> therebeneath, allowing the epoxy <b>502</b> to directly contact the paddle <b>302</b>. Since the epoxy <b>502</b> is also in contact with and adhered to the bottom of the die <b>602</b>, the epoxy <b>502</b> is able to provide thermal and electrical conductivity directly to the paddle <b>302</b>, depending upon the physical characteristics of the epoxy <b>502</b> that has been selected. That is, in one embodiment, the epoxy <b>502</b> will be both thermally and electrically conductive; and in another embodiment, for example, the epoxy <b>502</b> will be thermally conductive but electrically insulating.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, therein is shown a package <b>1200</b> having an interposer <b>1202</b> located between a lower electrically insulating adhesive layer <b>1204</b> and an upper adhesive layer <b>1206</b> formed on the interposer <b>1202</b>. The lower electrically insulating adhesive layer <b>1204</b> attaches the interposer <b>1202</b> to the paddle <b>302</b>, while the upper adhesive layer <b>1206</b> attaches the die <b>602</b> to the interposer <b>1202</b>. The interposer <b>1202</b> has lateral dimensions slightly larger than the die <b>602</b> that is mounted thereon and extends over the lead tips <b>306</b>. The interposer <b>1202</b>, which is more robust than a layer of adhesive film, may be, for example, a layer of polyimide, ceramic, or metal, according the needs at hand. The lower electrically insulating adhesive layer <b>1204</b> also adheres the interposer <b>1202</b> to the lead tips <b>306</b> while electrically insulating the interposer <b>1202</b> therefrom. Advantageously, the interposer <b>1202</b> thus provides a consistent plane for a large die, such as the die <b>602</b>, preventing die tilting. The interposer <b>1202</b> also ensures that the lead tips <b>306</b> are not bent upward, and provides one step film attaching. Electrical ground connections can be done on the tie bars (or fused leads) <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, therein is shown a package <b>1300</b> having an interposer <b>1302</b> attached by an electrically insulating adhesive layer <b>1304</b> to the paddle <b>302</b>. The interposer <b>1302</b>, which is more robust than a layer of adhesive film, has lateral dimensions slightly larger than the die <b>602</b> that is mounted thereon, and extends over the lead tips <b>306</b>. The electrically insulating adhesive layer <b>1304</b> also adheres the interposer <b>1302</b> to the lead tips <b>306</b>. Unlike the interposer <b>1002</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), however, the interposer <b>1302</b>, which is a layer of polyimide, ceramic, or metal, is not grounded, and therefore does not provide for wire ground bonds or die backside grounding. Rather, the embodiment of the invention shown in the package <b>1300</b> provides functionality similar to the embodiment shown in the package <b>1200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>), except that the epoxy <b>502</b> secures the die <b>602</b> to the interposer <b>1302</b>, rather than being secured by an upper adhesive layer such as the upper adhesive layer <b>1206</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). Advantageously, the interposer <b>1302</b> thus provides for no film sagging between the lead tips <b>306</b> and the paddle <b>302</b>. The interposer <b>1302</b> also ensures that the lead tips <b>306</b> are not bent upward, and affords better thermal conductivity by providing for electrical ground connection on the tie bars <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref>, <b>15</b>, and <b>16</b>, therein are shown, respectively, the packages <b>1000</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), <b>1100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), and <b>1200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) during molding thereof in the upper mold section <b>802</b> and the lower mold section <b>804</b>. The overhangs of the respective interposers <b>1002</b>, <b>1102</b>, and <b>1202</b> are adhered to the lead tips <b>306</b> of the inner leads <b>304</b> by their respective electrically insulating adhesive layers, <b>1004</b>, <b>1104</b>, and <b>1204</b>. In addition, the weights of the interposers <b>1002</b>, <b>1102</b>, and <b>1202</b>, respectively, and of the dies <b>602</b> thereon, reinforced by adhesion to the paddle <b>302</b>, combine to create a downward force on the lead tips <b>306</b>, as indicated by the respective arrows <b>1402</b>, <b>1502</b>, and <b>1602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The adhesion of the overhangs and the downward forces combine to hold the inner leads <b>304</b> and the lead tips <b>306</b> in their correct positions during molding of the packages <b>1000</b>, <b>1100</b>, and <b>1200</b>, and particularly, during the flow of the molding compound <b>902</b> into the cavity in the upper and lower mold sections <b>802</b> and <b>804</b>. Thus, the support of the respective electrically insulating adhesive layers, <b>1004</b>, <b>1104</b>, and <b>1204</b>, of the interposers, <b>1002</b>, <b>1102</b>, and <b>1202</b>, and of the dies <b>602</b>, together, prevent the inner leads <b>304</b> from being moved by turbulent flow of the molding compound <b>902</b> during molding of the packages <b>1000</b>, <b>1100</b>, and <b>1200</b>. The inner leads <b>304</b> are thus not displaced from their proper positions, and accordingly, the molding compound <b>902</b> does not seep under the inner leads <b>304</b> to cause mold flash underneath the pad terminals. Accordingly, the present invention further facilitates successful miniaturization of such increasingly complex IC packages.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">It has thus been discovered, and will now be clear to one of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the above disclosure, that interposers according to the present invention may include integral adhesive layers on both sides, one side, or neither side, depending upon the particular configurations chosen for a particular application at hand. Adhesive can thus be provided as an integral part of the interposer, or adhesive can be provided separately, as may be considered appropriate and desirable for the particular configuration and assembly processes at hand.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, therein is shown a flow chart of a method <b>1700</b> for fabricating a large die package in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The method <b>1700</b> includes providing a leadframe having leads and a paddle in a block <b>1702</b>; attaching an interposer onto the leadframe with the interposer extending over at least a portion of the paddle and at least a portion of the leads of the leadframe, with the interposer insulated from the leads, in a block <b>1704</b>; and attaching a die to the interposer in a block <b>1706</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It has been discovered that the present invention thus has numerous advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A principle advantage is that the present invention provides a highly efficient, effective, and economical solution for small packages that incorporate large dies.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Another advantage is that the present invention provides such solutions for small packages that incorporate large dies that also require a ground pad while overhanging the leadframe leads.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Another advantage is that the invention can be applied not only to QFN packages, but to a wide range of package configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Yet another advantage is that thermal dissipation can be enhanced for large die packages that use an adhesive film between the leadframe paddle and the die.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Still another advantage is that the present invention prevents mold compound flash that might otherwise cover and insulate leads of the leadframe, particularly inner leads of dual row leadframes.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Yet another important advantage of the present invention is that it valuably supports and services the historical trend of reducing costs, simplifying systems, and increasing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">These and other valuable aspects of the present invention consequently further the state of the technology to at least the next level.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Thus, it has been discovered that the large die package method and apparatus of the present invention furnish important and heretofore unknown and unavailable solutions, capabilities, and functional advantages for high performance, large die, miniaturized IC circuit packaging configurations. The resulting processes and configurations are straightforward, cost-effective, uncomplicated, highly versatile and effective, can be implemented by adapting known technologies, and are thus readily suited for efficiently and economically manufacturing large die IC packaged devices.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">While the invention has been described in conjunction with a specific best mode, it is to be understood that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the aforegoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations which fall within the scope of the included claims. All matters hithertofore set forth herein or shown in the accompanying drawings are to be interpreted in an illustrative and non-limiting sense.</p>
