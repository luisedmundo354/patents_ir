<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A drive apparatus for a piezoelectric actuator prevents locking drive frequency in a state of resonance due to harmonics. There is no need to provide external components to filter, and circuitry can easily be reduced in size. The drive apparatus has a phase difference-DC conversion circuit to detect vibrating state of the vibrating body, a comparison circuit, a harmonics detection circuit to detect that the vibrating body is resonating due to harmonics and outputting a harmonics detection signal, an integration circuit to control the frequency of the drive signal supplied to the piezoelectric element of the vibrating body, a variable frequency oscillation circuit, and a drive circuit.

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a drive apparatus for a piezoelectric actuator that includes a vibrating body having a piezoelectric element, a drive method for a piezoelectric actuator, an electronic device, a control program for a drive apparatus for a piezoelectric actuator, and a recording medium.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Piezoelectric elements have an excellent conversion ratio of electrical energy to mechanical energy, and excellent responsiveness. Various piezoelectric actuators that utilize the piezoelectric effects of piezoelectric elements have therefore been recently under development.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">These piezoelectric actuators have as their primary constituent element a vibrating body having a piezoelectric element, wherein the vibrating body is composed of, for example, a plate-shaped reinforcing plate having a protrusion that is in contact with a driven body at one end, piezoelectric elements affixed to both surfaces of the reinforcing plate, drive electrodes provided on the surfaces of these piezoelectric elements, and detection electrodes that are electrically insulated from the drive electrodes. A drive apparatus for a piezoelectric actuator is also known whereby a prescribed alternating current is applied to the drive electrodes of the vibrating body, the vibrating body is excited by longitudinal vibration that causes it to expand and contract in the longitudinal direction, and flexural vibration is induced whereby the vibrating body oscillates in the direction orthogonal to the direction of the longitudinal vibration (see Prior Art 1, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the drive control performed by this type of drive apparatus, a piezoelectric actuator rotates so that the protrusion of the vibrating body traces an elliptical orbit, and drives the driven body that is in contact with the protrusion. An alternating current voltage having the optimum oscillation frequency according to design must be applied to the vibrating body of the piezoelectric actuator, and the prescribed longitudinal vibration and flexural vibration must be generated therein in order for the driven body to be driven at high efficiency. However, due to the individual differences in the piezoelectric actuators, their temperature characteristics, load characteristics, and the like, it is difficult to continually apply the optimum drive frequency for which the apparatus is designed. Feedback control is therefore implemented in this drive apparatus whereby a detection signal from the detection electrodes provided to the piezoelectric elements is detected, and the drive frequency of the alternating current voltage applied to the drive electrodes is adjusted based on the detection signal.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Specifically, drive apparatuses are known that utilize the fact that the phase difference between the phase of the alternating current voltage applied to the drive electrodes and the phase of the detection signal detected from the detection electrodes, or the phase difference among the detection signals detected from a plurality of detection electrodes, is dependent upon the drive frequency of the alternating current voltage applied to the drive electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The drive apparatus of this piezoelectric actuator includes a waveform shaping circuit, a phase difference-DC conversion circuit, a comparison circuit, an integration circuit, a variable frequency oscillating circuit, and a drive circuit, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The waveforms of a drive signal SDR outputted from the drive circuit and a detection signal SD<b>1</b> detected from a detection electrode of the piezoelectric actuator are shaped by the waveform shaping circuit, the phase difference in these signals is detected by the phase difference-DC conversion circuit, the detected phase difference is compared with a target phase difference by the comparison circuit, and the comparison information is integrated by the integration circuit and outputted to the variable frequency oscillating circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The variable frequency oscillating circuit oscillates at a frequency corresponding to the comparison information from the integration circuit and outputs a frequency signal to the drive circuit, and a drive signal corresponding to the frequency is outputted from the drive circuit to a vibrating body.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, in the drive apparatus of the piezoelectric actuator, the drive frequency of the alternating current voltage applied to the drive electrode is adjusted so that the phase difference detected by the phase difference-DC conversion circuit nears a preset reference phase difference. As a result of implementing such feedback control, an alternating current voltage having the optimum drive frequency can be applied to the vibrating body of the piezoelectric actuator, the piezoelectric actuator can be excited at prescribed longitudinal and flexural vibrations, and the driven body can be driven with high efficiency.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">Problems that the Invention is to Solve</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition to the drive frequency (resonance point) f<b>1</b> at which the piezoelectric actuator is most effectively driven in terms of design, as shown by the impedance characteristics in relation to the drive frequency in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the piezoelectric actuator has sometimes exhibited a resonance point f<b>2</b>, depending on its shape and other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When a rectangular wave that allows the drive circuit to be simplified and the actuator to be driven at low voltage is used as the drive signal, the actuator may resonate due to a harmonic component that is three times the frequency of the rectangular wave, when the drive frequency of the piezoelectric actuator is an odd-number fraction (⅓, for example) of f<b>2</b>. The relationship between the drive waveform and the detection waveform at that time is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for example. Specifically, the vibrating body <b>910</b> mechanically vibrates due to the threefold harmonic component even when the drive frequency is ⅓ of f<b>2</b> (f<b>2</b>/3), and a detection waveform with three times the frequency is therefore outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For this reason, there are drawbacks in that the phase difference detection circuit for controlling the frequency malfunctions, the system locks on a frequency (for example, f<b>2</b>/3) that is different than the original optimum drive frequency (a state in which the frequency is repeatedly increased and decreased in an alternating fashion), and the piezoelectric actuator does not operate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to resolve such problems, it is possible to consider a method in which a filter is inserted into the drive circuit or the detection circuit, but there are drawbacks in such cases in that the number of analog elements and other external components increases, the circuits increase in size, and costs are higher. There are also problems when the detection signal is filtered in that the power for driving the filter is attenuated.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An object of the present invention is to provide a drive apparatus for a piezoelectric actuator, a drive method for a piezoelectric actuator, an electronic device, a control program for a drive apparatus for a piezoelectric actuator, and a recording medium, wherein when the drive frequency of the piezoelectric actuator is controlled, the drive frequency can be prevented from being locked in a state of resonance due to harmonics, external components and the like are not required, and the circuits can easily be made smaller</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Means of Solving the Problems</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention is a drive apparatus for a piezoelectric actuator wherein a drive signal is supplied to a piezoelectric element, and the piezoelectric actuator has a vibrating body vibrated by applying a drive signal having a specific frequency to the piezoelectric element, and a contact section that is provided to the vibrating body and that is in contact with the drive object; the drive apparatus for a piezoelectric actuator having a vibrating state detection device for detecting the vibrating state of the vibrating body, a harmonics detection device for detecting that the vibrating body is resonating due to the harmonics of the drive signal and outputting a harmonics detection signal, and a frequency control device for controlling the frequency of the drive signal supplied to the piezoelectric element; wherein the frequency control device controls the frequency of the drive signal supplied to the piezoelectric element on the basis of the detection signal outputted from the vibrating state detection device when a harmonics signal is not outputted, and continues to vary the frequency of the drive signal without controlling the frequency of the drive signal on the basis of the detection signal outputted from the vibrating state detection device while the harmonics detection signal is being outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the present invention, since a harmonics detection device is provided for outputting a harmonics detection signal when the vibrating body is resonating due to the harmonics of the drive signal, and the frequency of the drive signal continues to be varied irrespective of the results of the vibrating state detection device while the harmonics detection signal is being outputted, the frequency of the drive signal can be reliably isolated from the frequency of resonance due to the harmonics. Therefore, when the frequency of the drive signal is controlled by the frequency control device, it is not locked at the frequency of resonance due to the harmonics, and it is possible to reliably prevent the problem in which the piezoelectric actuator is not driven.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Also, since the harmonics detection device is provided and controlled, the need for filter coils and other such external components can be eliminated, and the circuits can be made smaller and can be easily integrated.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, providing a filter to the input of the detection signal affects the detection characteristics, but there is no need to provide a filter in the present invention and the effects on the detection characteristics can therefore be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Also, when a filter is provided to the output of the drive signal, the output is attenuated and the drive efficiency decreases, but since a filter does not need to be provided to the output of the drive signal in the present invention, and output attenuation can be prevented and the drive efficiency can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the present invention, the vibrating state detection device preferably detects at least one characteristics value from among the phase difference characteristics, the amplitude characteristics, and the electric current characteristics of the detection signal of the piezoelectric actuator, and outputs a first detection signal if the characteristics value is equal to or greater than a preset target value, or outputs a second signal if the characteristics value is less than a preset target value; the frequency control device is set to be capable of varying the frequency of the drive signal within a specific range, and varies the frequency from one of either the maximum frequency or the minimum frequency of the range in a first direction towards the other; the frequency is varied while the direction in which the frequency is varied is maintained in the first direction when a harmonics detection signal is not outputted and one of the first detection signal or the second detection signal is outputted; the frequency is varied while the direction in which the frequency is varied is changed to the second direction opposite the first direction when the a harmonics detection signal is not outputted and the other of the first detection signal or the second detection signal is outputted; and the frequency is varied while the direction in which the frequency is varied is maintained in the first direction when the harmonics detection signal is outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the present invention, the frequency of the drive signal is swept (varied) within a specific range, and the piezoelectric actuator can therefore be reliably driven even when the resonance frequency of the piezoelectric actuator fluctuates due to the surrounding temperature, the load, and other effects.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Also, the frequency control device can be easily controlled because the direction in which the frequency is varied needs only to be switched based on the detection results of the vibrating state detection device or the harmonics detection device.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the present invention, it is preferable that the harmonics detection device outputs a harmonics detection signal when the detection signal both rises and falls within half a cycle of the drive signal.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Normally, the detection signal has a specific phase difference with the drive signal and has substantially the same frequency. Therefore, the detection signal either only rises or only falls within half a cycle of the drive signal.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Accordingly, in a state of resonance due to harmonics, the detection signal has a higher frequency (three times the frequency, for example) than the drive signal due to harmonic components, and the detection signal both rises and falls within half a cycle of the drive signal. Therefore, a state of resonance due to harmonics can be easily detected by using the harmonics detection device for detecting such a state of resonance.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the present invention, the harmonics detection device may be designed to output a harmonics detection signal when the detection signal rises or falls a plurality of times within half a cycle of the drive signal.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a state of resonance due to harmonics, the detection signal has a higher frequency (three times the frequency, for example) than the drive signal due to harmonic components, and the detection signal therefore rises a plurality of times and also falls a plurality of times within half a cycle of the drive signal. Therefore, a state of resonance due to harmonics can be easily detected by using the harmonics detection device for detecting such a state.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Also, a harmonics detection device that detects whether the detection signal rises or falls a plurality of times within half a cycle of the drive signal can have simpler circuitry and can reduce the possibility that the fundamental wave of the detection signal will be erroneously detected as harmonics when the phase difference between the drive signal and the detection signal is small in comparison with a harmonics detection device that detects whether the detection signal both rises and falls.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Conversely, a harmonics detection device that detects whether the detection signal both rises and falls within half a cycle of the drive signal can reduce the possibility that the harmonics of the detection signal will be erroneously detected as a fundamental wave when the phase difference between the drive signal and the detection signal is small in comparison with a harmonics detection device that detects whether the detection signal rises or falls a plurality of times.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the present invention, the harmonics detection device may be designed to output a harmonics detection signal when the detection signal rises or falls n+1 number of times or more within n cycles of the drive signal.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, with the harmonics detection device of the present invention, a harmonics detection signal is outputted when the detection signal rises or falls 4 (n+1) or more times within 3 (n) cycles of the drive signal when n=3, wherein n is an integer of 1 or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As previously described, normally the drive signal and the detection signal have the same frequency, and the detection signal therefore either rises or falls n times within n cycles of the drive signal. Therefore, if this number is n+1 or greater, it is possible to determine that a state of resonance due to harmonics has occurred, and the state of resonance due to harmonics can be easily detected by using the harmonics detection device for detecting such a state.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Also, since a state of resonance due to harmonics is detected by the number of times the detection signal rises or otherwise varies within n cycles, the possibility that the harmonics will be erroneously detected as a fundamental wave can be reduced in comparison with the case in which they are determined within half a cycle of the drive signal, even when the components of the fundamental wave in the detected waveform are large and zero crossings due to harmonics are not likely to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the present invention, the harmonics detection device may be designed to output a harmonics detection signal when the frequency of the drive signal and the frequency of the detection signal do not match.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Matching between the frequencies of the drive signal and the detection signal is not limited to when the signals are completely identical, but also includes cases in which the signals have a slight difference and can be considered to be a match. Specifically, the harmonics detection device of the present invention may be designed to output a harmonics detection signal if the difference between the frequencies of the drive signal and the detection signal is within a specific range.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As previously described, the drive signal and the detection signal ordinarily have the same frequency, and therefore if the frequencies of the signals do not match, it is possible to determine that a state of resonance due to harmonics has occurred, and the state of resonance due to harmonics can be easily detected by using the harmonics detection device for detecting such a state.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Also, the harmonics detection device of the present invention does not need to make any determinations within half a cycle of the drive signal, and therefore the possibility that the harmonics will be erroneously detected as a fundamental wave can be reduced even when the fundamental wave in the detected waveform has large components and zero crossings due to harmonics are not likely to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the present invention, the harmonics detection device may be designed to output a harmonics detection signal when the frequency of the detection signal is greater than the frequency of the drive signal.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As previously described, the drive signal and the detection signal ordinarily have the same frequency, and the frequency of the detection signal increases when there is a state of resonance due to harmonics. Therefore, when the frequency of the detection signal is greater than the frequency of the drive signal, it is possible to determine that a state of resonance due to harmonics has occurred, and the state of resonance due to harmonics can be easily detected by using the harmonics detection device for detecting such a state.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Also, the harmonics detection device of the present invention is not required to make any determinations within half a cycle of the drive signal, and therefore the possibility that the harmonics will be erroneously detected as a fundamental wave can be reduced even when the fundamental wave in the detected waveform has large components and zero crossings due to harmonics are not likely to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The frequency control device preferably has a frequency-change-rate change device for varying the rate of change in drive frequency, which is the amount of change in drive frequency per unit time, and the frequency-change-rate change device increases the rate of change in frequency to be greater when a harmonics detection signal is outputted in comparison with the case in which a harmonics detection signal is not outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, the frequency-change-rate change device is set to be capable of varying the rate of change in drive frequency between two speeds: a low speed and a high speed. The device may be set to a high speed when a harmonics detection signal is outputted, and may be set to a low speed when a harmonics detection signal is not outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to such a configuration, since the rate of change in frequency is increased by the frequency-change-rate change device while the harmonics detection signal is being outputted, it is possible to quickly pass through frequency regions in which the rate at which the drive frequency changes increases and a state of resonance due to harmonics occurs, and the control time until the drive frequency is locked at the target frequency can be shortened by a corresponding amount of time.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this case, an amplitude detection device is preferably provided for detecting when the amplitude of the detection signal is equal to or greater than a specific value and outputting an amplitude detection signal, and the frequency-change-rate change device reduces the rate of change in frequency when a harmonics detection signal is not outputted, to be less when an amplitude detection signal is outputted than when a harmonics detection signal is outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">If the frequency-change-rate change device is set to be capable of varying the rate of change in drive frequency between two speeds: a low speed and a high speed, the device may be set to a high speed when a harmonics detection signal is outputted and set to a low speed in other cases.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Also, in the case that the frequency-change-rate change device is set to be capable of varying the rate of change in drive frequency between three speeds: a low speed, a medium speed, and a high speed, the device may be set to a high speed when a harmonics detection signal is outputted, to a medium speed when a harmonics detection and an amplitude detection signal are not outputted, and to a low speed when a harmonics detection signal is not outputted and an amplitude detection signal is outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to such a configuration, the rate of change in frequency is reduced by the frequency-change-rate change device when a harmonics detection signal is not outputted and an amplitude detection signal is outputted, and the speed at which the drive frequency changes can thereby be reduced. Therefore, in order to increase the speed at which the drive frequency changes, the drive frequency can be reliably locked at a specific frequency without passing by the target drive frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The drive method for a piezoelectric actuator of the present invention is a drive method for a piezoelectric actuator wherein a drive signal is supplied to a piezoelectric element, and the piezoelectric actuator has a vibrating body vibrated by applying a drive signal having a specific frequency to the piezoelectric element, and a contact section that is provided to the vibrating body and that is in contact with the drive object; the drive method for a piezoelectric actuator having a vibrating state detection step for detecting the vibrating state of the vibrating body, a harmonics detection step for detecting that the vibrating body is resonating due to the harmonics of the drive signal and outputting a harmonics detection signal, and a frequency control step for controlling the frequency of the drive signal supplied to the piezoelectric element; wherein the frequency control step controls the frequency of the drive signal supplied to the piezoelectric element on the basis of the detection signal outputted in the vibrating state detection step when a harmonics detection signal is not outputted, and continues to vary the frequency of the drive signal without controlling the frequency of the drive signal on the basis of the detection signal outputted in the vibrating state detection step while the harmonics detection signal is being outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Since a vibrating state detection step, a harmonics detections step, and a frequency control step are provided in accordance with such a drive method for a piezoelectric actuator, the same operational effects as in the drive apparatus for a piezoelectric actuator previously described can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The electronic device of the present invention has a piezoelectric actuator having a vibrating body vibrated by applying a drive signal having a specific frequency to a piezoelectric element and a contact section that is provided to the vibrating body and that is in contact with the drive object, and the drive apparatus previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With an electronic device with such a configuration, the drive frequency can be prevented from being locked in a state of resonance due to harmonics, and stable and reliable driving can therefore be achieved particularly in a wristwatch or other small electronic devices suitable for portability. In addition, since rectangular waves can be used as the drive signal, it is possible to simplify the drive circuits and to drive at a low voltage, and the present invention is suitable particularly for wristwatches and other small electronic devices that require energy conservation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The control program for a drive apparatus for a piezoelectric actuator of the present invention is a control program for a drive apparatus for a piezoelectric actuator wherein a drive signal is supplied to a piezoelectric element, and the piezoelectric actuator has a vibrating body vibrated by applying a drive signal having a specific frequency to the piezoelectric element, and a contact section that is provided to the vibrating body and that is in contact with the drive object; wherein a computer incorporated into the drive apparatus is made to function as a vibrating state detection device for detecting the vibrating state of the vibrating body, a harmonics detection device for detecting that the vibrating body is resonating due to the harmonics of the drive signal and outputting a harmonics detection signal, and a frequency control device for controlling the frequency of the drive signal supplied to the piezoelectric element by controlling the frequency of the drive signal supplied to the piezoelectric element on the basis of the detection signal outputted from the vibrating state detection device when a harmonics detection signal is not outputted, and continuing to vary the frequency of the drive signal without controlling the frequency of the drive signal on the basis of the detection signal outputted from the vibrating state detection device while the harmonics detection signal is being outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Also, the recording medium of the present invention is a recording medium capable of being read by a computer in which this program is stored.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the present invention, the drive frequency can be prevented from being locked in a state of resonance due to harmonics in the same manner as described above by making the computer incorporated into the drive apparatus to function as the above-described devices.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">If the devices are configured as a computer, control that is appropriate for the object to be driven can be easily performed because the conditions can be easily altered merely by modifying the program.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Effects of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to the present invention, when the drive frequency of the piezoelectric actuator is controlled, the drive frequency can be prevented from being locked in a state of resonance due to harmonics, there is no need to provide external components and the like, and the circuitry can be easily reduced in size.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to the diagrams.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">First, an electronic timepiece having a date display mechanism driven by a piezoelectric actuator will be exemplified as an embodiment of an electronic device.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">[1. Overall Configuration]</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view showing a date display mechanism <b>90</b> (driven body) of an electronic timepiece <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the main components of the date display mechanism <b>90</b> is primarily composed of a piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b>, a rotor <b>92</b> as the drive object rotatably driven (driven body <b>701</b>) by the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b>, a deceleration gear train that decelerates and transmits the rotation of the rotor <b>92</b>, and a date wheel <b>93</b> rotated by the drive force transmitted via the deceleration gear train. The deceleration gear train has a date turning intermediate wheel <b>94</b> and a date turning wheel <b>95</b>. The piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b>, the rotor <b>92</b>, the date turning intermediate wheel <b>94</b>, and the date turning wheel <b>95</b> are supported by a bottom plate <b>9</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A disc-shaped dial (time indicating part <b>703</b>) is provided at the top of the date display mechanism <b>90</b>, and part of the outer peripheral surface of the dial is provided with a window for displaying the date, and is designed so that the date on the date wheel <b>93</b> is visible through the window. Also, a pointer movement gear train (not shown) connected to the stepping motor for driving the pointers and a secondary battery <b>9</b>B as a power source are provided to the bottom (reverse side) of the bottom plate <b>9</b>A. The secondary battery <b>9</b>B supplies power to the circuits of the stepping motor, the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b>, and a voltage application apparatus (not shown). The structure may also be such that a power generator that generates power by utilizing solar (solar light) power or the rotation of an oscillating weight is connected to the secondary battery <b>9</b>B, and the power generated by this power generator <b>702</b> is charged to the secondary battery <b>9</b>B. Also, the power source is not limited to a secondary battery <b>9</b>B that is charged by a power generator, and may be a common primary battery (a lithium ion battery, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The date turning intermediate wheel <b>94</b> is composed of a large wheel <b>941</b> and a small wheel <b>942</b>. The small wheel <b>942</b> has a cylindrical shape with a diameter that is slightly less than that of the large wheel <b>941</b>, and a notch <b>943</b> with a substantially square shape is formed in the outer peripheral surface thereof. The small wheel <b>942</b> is fixed in place so as to concentric with respect to the large wheel <b>941</b>. A gear <b>921</b> at the top of the rotor <b>92</b> meshes with the large wheel <b>941</b>. Therefore, the date turning intermediate wheel <b>94</b> composed of the large wheel <b>941</b> and small wheel <b>942</b> rotates in conjunction with the rotation of the rotor <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A plate spring <b>944</b> is provided to the bottom plate <b>9</b>A on the side of the date turning intermediate wheel <b>94</b>, the proximal end of the plate spring <b>944</b> is fixed to the bottom plate <b>9</b>A, and the distal end is bent into a substantially V shape. The distal end of the plate spring <b>944</b> is disposed so as to be capable of entering and exiting the notch <b>943</b> of the date turning intermediate wheel <b>94</b>. A contact element <b>945</b> is disposed at a position adjacent to the plate spring <b>944</b>, and this contact element <b>945</b> is designed to come into contact with the plate spring <b>944</b> when the date turning intermediate wheel <b>94</b> rotates and the distal end of the plate spring <b>944</b> enters the notch <b>943</b>. A specific voltage is applied to the plate spring <b>944</b>, and when the plate spring <b>944</b> comes into contact with the contact element <b>945</b>, this voltage is applied to the contact element <b>945</b> as well. Therefore, the state in which the date wheel is turned can be determined by determining the voltage of the contact element <b>945</b>, and the amount by which the date wheel <b>93</b> rotates in one day can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Determining the amount by which the date wheel <b>93</b> rotates is not limited to the use of the plate spring <b>944</b> or the contact element <b>945</b>, and it is possible to use devices in which the rotating state of the rotor <b>92</b> or the date turning intermediate wheel <b>94</b> is determined and a specific pulse signal is outputted. Specifically, it is possible to use a conventional photoreflector, photointerrupter, MR sensor, or other such rotation encoder or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The date wheel <b>93</b> has a ring shape, and an internal gear <b>931</b> is formed on the inner peripheral surface thereof. The date turning wheel <b>95</b> has a gear with five teeth and meshes with the internal gear <b>931</b> of the date wheel <b>93</b>. Also, a shaft <b>951</b> is provided in the center of the date turning wheel <b>95</b>, and this shaft <b>951</b> is inserted into a through-hole <b>9</b>C formed in the bottom plate <b>9</b>A. The through-hole <b>9</b>C is formed extending along the peripheral direction of the date wheel <b>93</b>. The date turning wheel <b>95</b> and the shaft <b>951</b> are urged upward and to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by a plate spring <b>952</b> fixed on the bottom plate <b>9</b>A. The urging action of the plate spring <b>952</b> also prevents the date wheel <b>93</b> from sliding.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an enlarged view of the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> and the rotor <b>92</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> has a substantially rectangular reinforcing plate <b>911</b>, and a piezoelectric element <b>912</b> bonded to both sides of the reinforcing plate <b>911</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Arm sections <b>913</b> that protrude from both sides are formed substantially in the center of the reinforcing plate <b>911</b> in the longitudinal direction thereof, and one of these arm sections <b>913</b> is fixed in place on the bottom plate <b>9</b>A by screws or the like. The other arm section <b>913</b> is not fixed to the bottom plate <b>9</b>A, but remains in a free state and constitutes a weight that provides oscillation balance when the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> oscillates.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Substantially hemispherical convexities <b>914</b> that protrude along the longitudinal direction of the reinforcing plate <b>911</b> are formed at both ends of the diagonal of the reinforcing plate <b>911</b>. One of these convexities <b>914</b> comes in contact with the side of the rotor <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The piezoelectric element <b>912</b> is formed into a substantially rectangular shape, and is bonded to the substantially rectangular sections on both sides of the reinforcing plate <b>911</b>. Electrodes are formed from a plating layer on both sides of the piezoelectric element <b>912</b>. A substantially rectangular determination electrode <b>912</b>B is formed in the surface of the piezoelectric element <b>912</b> by insulating the plating layer with a groove. This determination electrode <b>912</b>B is formed nearer to the rotor <b>92</b> than to the longitudinal center of the piezoelectric element <b>912</b>, and nearer to the convexities <b>914</b> than to the transverse center of the piezoelectric element <b>912</b>. The area other than the determination electrode <b>912</b>B constitutes a drive electrode <b>912</b>A. The surface area of the determination electrode <b>912</b>B is set to 1/30th or more and 1/7th or less of the surface area of the drive electrode <b>912</b>A, and is more preferably set to 1/15th or more and 1/10th or less.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">When a voltage with a specific frequency is applied to the drive electrode <b>912</b>A of the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b>, oscillation is created in a longitudinal primary oscillation mode in which the piezoelectric element <b>912</b> is elongated along the longitudinal direction. At this time, since the convexities <b>914</b> are provided to both ends of the diagonal of the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b>, the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> as a whole is unbalanced in weight in relation to the middle line in the longitudinal direction. As a result of this unbalance, oscillation is created in a curved secondary oscillation mode in which the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> curves in a direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal direction. Therefore, the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> creates oscillation that combines the longitudinal primary oscillation mode and the curved secondary oscillation mode, and the convexities <b>914</b> vibrate so as to form a substantially elliptical arc. At this time, since the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> is fixed to only one of the arm sections <b>913</b> and the convexities <b>914</b> are provided at the ends of the diagonal and bear the reactive force from the rotor <b>92</b>, the node of oscillation in the longitudinal primary oscillation mode and the node of oscillation in the curved secondary oscillation mode are out of alignment with the center of the piezoelectric element <b>912</b>. In other words, the determination electrode <b>912</b>B is formed at a position in the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> that includes the node of oscillation in the longitudinal primary oscillation mode and the node of oscillation in the curved secondary oscillation mode. Therefore, in the present embodiment, the vibrating body <b>910</b> is composed of the reinforcing plate <b>911</b> and the piezoelectric element <b>912</b>, and the contact section is composed of the convexities <b>914</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The drive electrode <b>912</b>A, the determination electrode <b>912</b>B, and the reinforcing plate <b>911</b> are all connected to the drive apparatus (voltage application apparatus) (not shown) by a lead wire or the like. The specific configuration of the drive apparatus is described later.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">A plate spring <b>922</b> is mounted on the rotor <b>92</b>, and the rotor <b>92</b> is urged towards the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b>. An appropriate frictional force is thereby created between the convexities <b>914</b> and the side of the rotor <b>92</b>, resulting in satisfactory efficiency in transmitting the drive force of the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In such a timepiece <b>1</b>, the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> creates oscillation combining the longitudinal primary oscillation mode and the curved secondary oscillation mode when a drive signal with a specific frequency is applied due to the fact that the drive apparatus controls the drive signal for the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b>. The convexities <b>914</b> oscillate so as to form a substantially elliptical arc in which these oscillation modes are combined, and the rotor <b>92</b> is pressed in a portion of this oscillation arc to thereby rotatably drive the rotor <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The rotational movement of the rotor <b>92</b> is transmitted to the date turning intermediate wheel <b>94</b>, and when the teeth of the date turning wheel <b>95</b> mesh with the notch <b>943</b>, the date turning wheel <b>95</b> is rotated by the date turning intermediate wheel <b>94</b>, and the date wheel <b>93</b> is rotated.

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Next the drive method for the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">When the drive apparatus <b>50</b> initiates drive control for the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b>, the frequency of the drive signal is set to the upper limit (fmax) of a preset frequency range of the drive signal and is inputted from the drive circuit <b>57</b> to the piezoelectric element <b>912</b> (step <b>1</b>; “step” is hereinafter abbreviated as “S”).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The frequency range (fmax to fmin) of the drive signal is set as follows, as indicated in the graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> showing the relationship between drive frequency and the impedance of the vibrating body <b>910</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As used herein, f<b>1</b> is an effective resonance point for driving the vibrating body <b>910</b>, and f<b>2</b> is an ineffective resonance point for driving that occurs due to the effects of the shape and the like of the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b>. The relationship between the two is f<b>1</b>&lt;f<b>2</b>/3.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In this case, the following relationships hold: f<b>2</b>/3&lt;fmax&lt;f<b>2</b>, and fmin&lt;f<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">When input of the drive signal is initiated, the drive apparatus <b>50</b> inputs a drive signal and a detection signal to the harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b> via a waveform shaping circuit <b>51</b>, and determines whether harmonics have been detected, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> (S<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">If harmonics are not detected in S<b>1</b>, the drive signal and the detection signal are signals with the same frequency that have a certain phase difference, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">If the phase difference between the drive signal and the detection signal is equal to or greater than the target value, then a corresponding signal is outputted from the comparison circuit <b>54</b>, and the oscillation frequency (drive frequency) of the drive signal outputted from the drive circuit <b>57</b> is increased via the integration circuit <b>55</b> and the variable frequency oscillation circuit <b>56</b> (S<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">On the other hand, if the phase difference between the drive signal and the detection signal is less than the target value, then a corresponding signal is outputted from the comparison circuit <b>54</b>, and the oscillation frequency (drive frequency) of the drive signal outputted from the drive circuit <b>57</b> is reduced via the integration circuit <b>55</b> and the variable frequency oscillation circuit <b>56</b> (S<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As a result of the control described above, normally the drive frequency decreases sequentially from fmax, the detected phase difference reaches the target value near f<b>1</b>, the drive frequency is locked, or, in other words, a state is reached in which the frequency repeatedly decreases and increases in an alternating fashion, and the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> is driven in a normal manner.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">[5. Operation of the Harmonics Detection Circuit]</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In the process of controlling the drive frequency, if the drive frequency reaches ⅓ of f<b>2</b> (=f<b>2</b>/3), the vibrating body <b>910</b> sometimes causes resonance as a result of the three-dimensional components of the drive signal. If such resonance occurs as a result of the three-dimensional components (harmonics) of the drive signal, the detected waveform is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In the present embodiment, this state of resonance due to harmonics is detected by the harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b>. The harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b> detects the state of resonance due to harmonics on the basis of whether the detection signal either only rises or only falls once within half a cycle of the drive signal as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, or whether the detection signal both rises and falls within half a cycle of the drive signal as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Specifically, in the harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b>, the drive signal outputted from the waveform shaping circuit <b>51</b> is inputted to the input terminal IN<b>1</b>, and the detection signal outputted from the waveform shaping circuit <b>51</b> is inputted to the input terminal IN<b>2</b>. The input terminal IN<b>1</b> is inputted to reset inputs R of the bistable trigger circuits <b>521</b> and <b>522</b> via three NOT gates <b>525</b> connected in series. Therefore, when the drive signal is at an L level, an H level signal is inputted to the reset inputs R of the bistable trigger circuits <b>521</b> and <b>522</b>, and the reset is released.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">An H level signal is usually inputted to the data inputs D of the bistable trigger circuits <b>521</b> and <b>522</b>. Also, a detection signal inputted to the input terminal IN<b>2</b> is inputted in an unchanged state to the clock input C of the bistable trigger circuit <b>521</b>, and the detection signal is then inverted and inputted to the clock input C of the bistable trigger circuit <b>522</b> via the NOT gate <b>526</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Therefore, when the drive signal (IN<b>1</b>) is at an L level, or more specifically, when the bistable trigger circuits <b>521</b> and <b>522</b> are released from a reset state, the output Q<b>1</b> of the bistable trigger circuit <b>521</b> changes from an L level to an H level when the detection signal (IN<b>2</b>) changes from an L level to an H level, as shown in the timing chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. When the bistable trigger circuits <b>521</b> and <b>522</b> are released from a reset state, the output Q<b>2</b> of the bistable trigger circuit <b>522</b> changes from an L level to an H level when the detection signal changes from an H level to an L level.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The outputs Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>, having reached an H level, then change from an H level to an L level when the drive signal (IN<b>1</b>) changes to an H level and the bistable trigger circuits <b>521</b> and <b>522</b> are reset.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The AND gate <b>524</b> herein outputs an H level signal only when both the outputs Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are at an H level.

<p id="p-0125" num="0124">When the output D<b>3</b> of the AND gate <b>524</b> is at an H level, the output Q of the bistable trigger circuit <b>523</b> changes from an L to H level when the drive signal rises.

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The output Q of the bistable trigger circuit <b>523</b> is switched to an L level if the drive signal rises when the output D<b>3</b> of the AND gate <b>524</b> is at an L level.

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Therefore, it is possible to detect whether the vibrating body <b>910</b> is in a state of resonance due to harmonics on the basis of the harmonics detection signal OUT of the harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">When a state of resonance due to harmonics is detected in S<b>2</b> (when the harmonics detection signal is at an H level), the integration circuit <b>55</b> of the drive apparatus <b>50</b> reduces the oscillation frequency irrespective of the comparison results of the comparison circuit <b>54</b> (S<b>5</b>), as shown in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As a result of this control, the drive frequency passes through f<b>2</b>/3 and nears f<b>1</b>, and therefore, the state of resonance due to harmonics is then released, the detected phase difference reaches the target value when the drive frequency is near f<b>1</b>, the drive frequency is locked, and normal driving is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">When the drive frequency reaches the lower limit (fmin) without being locked near f<b>1</b>, it is again returned to the upper limit (fmax) and control may be continued.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">[6. Effects of the Embodiments]</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">According to the present embodiment, the following operational effects can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">(1) The drive apparatus <b>50</b> of the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> of the present embodiment includes a harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b>, and when a state of resonance due to harmonics is detected, the drive frequency is not controlled based on the phase difference between the drive signal and the detection signal, but since the drive frequency is continually varied (decreased), the drive frequency can be reliably prevented from locking in a state of resonance due to harmonics and the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> from failing to drive.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Therefore, the drive frequency can be controlled to reach a specific target phase difference, and the driving of the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> can be efficiently controlled in a normal manner, even when a state of resonance due to harmonics has occurred when a rectangular drive signal is used.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">(2) The drive apparatus <b>50</b> can be configured merely by adding the harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b> configured from logical circuits to the conventional configuration, and the circuitry can therefore be reduced in size, the circuits can be easily integrated, and costs can be reduced in comparison with the case in which drive coils and other such external components are provided to prevent the drive frequency from locking in a state of resonance due to harmonics. Therefore, the present invention is particularly suitable for being incorporated into wristwatches and other such small electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">(3) The harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b> can detect a state of resonance due to harmonics by separating and inputting the signals outputted from the waveform shaping circuit <b>51</b>. Therefore, there is no need to provide a filter to the input of the detection signal, and the detection characteristics can be reliably detected to achieve high precision control without affecting the characteristics. Also, since there is no need to provide a filter to the output of the drive signal, the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> can be efficiently driven without attenuating the output.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">(4) Since an electronic timepiece is configured with a piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b> having a vibrating body with a piezoelectric element <b>912</b> and convexities <b>914</b> that are provided to the vibrating body and that come in contact with the driven object, a drive apparatus <b>50</b> with the configuration previously described, and a date display mechanism <b>90</b> driven by the piezoelectric actuator <b>91</b>, it is possible to provide an electronic timepiece with low power consumption that can reliably drive the driven object.</p>

Therefore, the drive frequency continues to decrease at a high speed (high clock) and is not locked even if the drive frequency reaches f<b>2</b>/3, and when the drive frequency nears f<b>1</b> and the amplitude of the detection signal is equal to or greater than a specific value, the drive frequency either increases or decreases at a low speed, and the drive frequency is locked and normal driving is executed when the phase difference between the drive signal and the detection signal reaches the target value.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">According to the second embodiment, the same operating effects as in the first embodiment can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">(2-1) Furthermore, since a frequency-change-rate change device composed of the amplitude detection circuit <b>58</b> and the clock control circuit <b>59</b> is provided and a selection is made between a high clock signal and a low clock signal, and the speed at which the drive frequency changes can therefore be increased to a high speed when a state of resonance due to harmonics is detected or when the amplitude is less than the specific value, or, in other words, when the drive frequency is not at a frequency at which the frequency of the current drive signal reaches the target value. Therefore, the frequency can be changed at a high speed to a drive frequency at which normal driving is performed, and the time needed to make the transition to a locked state of the drive frequency can be shortened.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Third Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Next, the third embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In the third embodiment, the configuration of the harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b> of the first and second embodiments is varied, and the configurations of all other elements are the same as in the previous embodiments and descriptions thereof are therefore omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The harmonics detection circuit <b>150</b> of the third embodiment includes a counter <b>151</b>, bistable trigger circuits <b>152</b> and <b>153</b>, and NOT gates <b>154</b> and <b>155</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The harmonics detection circuit <b>150</b> is configured such that when the detection signal inputted to the input terminal IN<b>2</b> rises (changes from an L level to an H level) a plurality of times during half a cycle of the drive signal inputted to the input terminal IN <b>1</b>, or, specifically, while the drive signal is at an L level, the output OUT is at an H level, and at all other times, the output is at an L level.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">As shown in the flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the counter <b>151</b> is released from reset when the drive signal inputted to the input terminal IN<b>1</b> is at an L level, and the output Q<b>1</b> is changed from an L level to and H level if the detection signal inputted to the input terminal IN<b>2</b> rises during this resetting. At this time, the clock input of the bistable trigger circuit <b>152</b> is changed from an H level to an L level, and the output Q<b>2</b> therefore remains at an L level and does not change.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Also, the counter <b>151</b> and the bistable trigger circuit <b>152</b> are both reset when the drive signal inputted to the IN<b>1</b> reaches an H level, and the output Q<b>1</b> is therefore varied to an L level, and the output Q<b>2</b> remains at an L level.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In a state of resonance due to harmonics, the detection signal rises (or falls) a plurality of times within half a cycle of the drive signal. If the detection signal rises twice when the counter <b>151</b> is released from reset (within half a cycle of the drive signal), the output Q<b>1</b> is varied from an L level to an H level with the first rising, and is varied from an H level to an L level with the second rising. The clock input of the bistable trigger circuit <b>152</b> is varied from an L level to an H level in accordance with the timing of the second rising, and the output Q<b>2</b> therefore reaches the data input D, or, in other words, an H level.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">At this point, the output Q of the bistable trigger circuit <b>153</b> is changed from an L to an H level similar to the bistable trigger circuit <b>523</b> in the previous embodiments. Therefore, if the output Q of the bistable trigger circuit <b>153</b> is the harmonics detection signal OUT of the harmonics detection circuit <b>150</b>, then the harmonics detection signal is an H level signal in accordance with the second rising when the detection signal rises twice within half a cycle of the drive signal.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Consequently, a state of resonance due to harmonics can be detected by the harmonics detection circuit <b>150</b> of the present embodiment, similar to the harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b> of the first and second embodiments, and the same drive frequency control as in the first and second embodiments can be achieved when the harmonics detection circuit <b>150</b> is used in place of the harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b> of the first and second embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Therefore, the same operational effects as in the first and second embodiments can be achieved in the third embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The harmonics detection circuit <b>150</b> of the present embodiment has additional effects in that the circuits can be somewhat simpler than the harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b>, and when the phase difference between the drive signal and the detection signal is small, the possibility that the basic waves of the detection signal will be erroneously detected as harmonics is less than with the harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b> of the previous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">However, the harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b> has merits in that when the phase difference between the drive signal and the detection signal is small, the possibility that the harmonics of the detection signal will be erroneously detected as basic waves is less than with the harmonics detection circuit <b>150</b> of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Fourth Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Next, the fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In the fourth embodiment, the configuration of the harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b> of the first and second embodiments is varied, and all other configurations are similar to those in the previous embodiments and descriptions thereof are therefore omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In this example in which n=3, the harmonics detection circuit <b>250</b> of the fourth embodiment includes a ⅓ counter <b>251</b> as a 1/n counter, a ½ counter <b>252</b>, a ¼ counter <b>253</b> as a 1/(n+1) counter, bistable trigger circuits <b>254</b> and <b>255</b>, and NOT gates <b>256</b> and <b>257</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">The harmonics detection circuit <b>250</b> is configured such that the output OUT is an H level signal, and at all other times the output is an L level signal, when the detection signal inputted to the input terminal IN<b>2</b> rises or falls n+1 or more times (four or more times, for example), within n cycles (three cycles, for example) of the drive signal inputted to the input terminal IN<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">As shown in the timing chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the ⅓ counter <b>251</b> divides the drive signal inputted to the IN<b>1</b> into one cycle in three cycles thereof. Specifically, the input of the IN<b>1</b> is divided into ½ to obtain Q<b>11</b>, and the output Q<b>11</b> is used to output Q<b>12</b> which is divided into ⅓.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">The ½ counter <b>252</b> divides the drive signal into one cycle in two cycles of the output waveform of Q<b>12</b> and outputs a signal Q<b>13</b>. As a result, half a cycle of the output Q<b>13</b> is equivalent to three cycles of the drive signal (IN<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The output Q<b>13</b> is inputted to reset terminals of the ¼ counter <b>253</b> and the bistable trigger circuit <b>254</b> via three NOT gates <b>256</b>. As a result, the ¼ counter <b>253</b> and the bistable trigger circuit <b>254</b> are released from reset while Q<b>13</b> is at an L level.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The ¼ counter <b>253</b> divides the detection signal inputted to the IN<b>2</b> into one cycle within four of its own cycles. Specifically, the detection signal is first divided into ½ into Q<b>21</b>, and this output Q<b>21</b> is used to output Q<b>22</b> which is divided into ¼.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">The output Q<b>22</b> of the ¼ counter <b>253</b> is inverted by the NOT gate <b>257</b> and is inputted to the clock terminal of the bistable trigger circuit <b>254</b>. In the bistable trigger circuit <b>254</b>, since an H level signal is inputted to the data input D, an H level signal is outputted from the output Q<b>31</b> when the clock input changes from an L level to an H level when released from reset.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The reason that the output Q<b>22</b> changes from an H level to an L level when reset is released is that there are cases in which there is a state of resonance due to harmonics and the detection signal rises four times within half a cycle of Q <b>13</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In other words, the output Q<b>31</b> changes to an H level when the detection signal rises four (=n+1) times within three (=n) cycles of the drive signal.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In the bistable trigger circuit <b>255</b>, the output Q varies to an H level if the clock input, or Q<b>13</b>, has varied from an L level to an H level when the data input, or Q<b>31</b>, is at an H level. Therefore, if this output Q a harmonics detection signal OUT, an H level signal can be outputted and a state of resonance due to harmonics can be detected when the detection signal rises n+1 times within n cycles of the drive signal.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">As a result, a state of resonance due to harmonics can be detected by the harmonics detection circuit <b>250</b> of the present embodiment, similar to the harmonics detection circuits <b>52</b> and <b>150</b> of the previous embodiments, and the same drive frequency control in the first and second embodiments can be achieved when the harmonics detection circuit <b>250</b> is used in place of the harmonics detection circuit <b>52</b> of the previous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Therefore, the same operational effects as in the first and second embodiments can be achieved in the fourth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Also, the harmonics detection circuit <b>250</b> of the present embodiment measures and determines the fluctuation of the detection signal (the number of times it rises and falls) within n cycles of the drive signal, which the harmonics detection circuits <b>52</b> and <b>150</b> determine within the time of half a cycle of the drive signal, and can make this determination on the basis of the fluctuation of the detection signal over a longer period of time. Therefore, the possibility that the harmonics will be erroneously detected as basic waves can be less than with the harmonics detection circuits <b>52</b> and <b>150</b> when the basic waves in the detected waveform have large components when resonated by harmonics, and zero crosses due to harmonics are not likely to occur. The present invention is not limited to the embodiments previously described, and the present invention includes all modifications, improvements, and the like within a range in which the objectives of the present invention can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Specifically, the harmonics detection device is not limited to the ones cited in the previous embodiments. A harmonics detection circuit <b>350</b>, such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, for example, may also be used as the harmonics detection device.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The harmonics detection circuit <b>350</b> includes counters <b>351</b> and <b>352</b> for increasing the counter value according to the rising or falling of the drive signal and detection signal, and a match detection circuit <b>353</b> for determining whether the counter values of the counters <b>351</b> and <b>352</b> match.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">As a result of such a harmonics detection circuit <b>350</b>, if the drive signal and the detection signal are signals of the same frequency having a specific phase difference, then the counter values of the counters <b>351</b> and <b>352</b> match, and if the detection signal is in a state of resonance due to harmonics and the signals have different frequencies, then the counter values of the counters <b>351</b> and <b>352</b> do not match. Therefore, if the harmonics detection signal OUT of the harmonics detection circuit <b>350</b> is at an H level when the counter values are determined by the match detection circuit <b>353</b> to not match, and the signal is at an L level when the counter values are determined to match, then a state of resonance due to harmonics can be detected and a harmonics detection signal can be outputted, similar to the harmonics detection circuits <b>52</b>, <b>150</b>, and <b>250</b> previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The counters <b>351</b> and <b>352</b> may be reset at intervals of a specific number of drive signal cycles (for example, every 1 to 10 cycles), and whether or not the frequencies of the signals match may be detected each time.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Also, when the frequencies of the signals are to be compared, the frequencies of the signals may be measured and the measured values may be compared without using the counters <b>351</b> and <b>352</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">A harmonics detection circuit <b>450</b> such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> may be used as the harmonics detection circuit. The harmonics detection circuit <b>450</b> includes counters <b>451</b> and <b>452</b> for increasing the counter values according to the rising and falling of the drive signal and the detection signal, and a comparison circuit <b>453</b> for determining whether the counter value of the counter <b>452</b> for counting the detection signal is greater than the counter value of the counter <b>451</b> for counting the drive signal.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">As a result of the harmonics detection circuit <b>450</b>, if the output from the comparison circuit <b>453</b>, or, in other words, the harmonics detection signal OUT of the harmonics detection circuit <b>450</b>, is at an H level when the frequency of the detection signal is greater than the frequency of the drive signal, and is at an L level at all other times, a state of resonance due to harmonics can be detected and a harmonics detection signal can be outputted, similar to with the harmonics detection circuits previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The counters <b>451</b> and <b>452</b> may be reset at intervals of specific cycles of the drive signal, and the frequencies of the signals may be compared each time. When the frequencies of the signals are compared, the frequencies of the signals may be measured and the measured values may be compared without using the counters <b>451</b> and <b>452</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Also, in the present invention, the vibrating state detection device for detecting the vibrating state of the vibrating body is not limited to one that detects the vibrating state by detecting the phase difference between the detection signal and the drive signal and comparing this phase difference with a target phase difference, as in the previous embodiments. For example, the vibrating state detection device may be one that is provided with two detection electrodes to the vibrating body and that detects on the basis of the phase difference between the detection signals, one that detects on the basis of the voltage value or the electric current value of the detection signal, or one that detects by comparing the voltage value or electric current value of the detection signal with the voltage value or electric current value of the drive signal. In other words, the vibrating state detection device may be one that detects the vibrating state of the vibrating body in order to control in the increase or decrease in the drive frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Also, the frequency-change-rate change device is not limited to one that detects the amplitude of the detection signal and varies the rate of change in frequency on the basis of the amplitude and of whether or not there is a state of resonance due to harmonics, as in the second embodiment. For example, the frequency-change-rate change device may be one that varies the rate of change in frequency on the basis of only whether or not there is a state of resonance due to harmonics.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">Furthermore, the frequency-change-rate change device may detect the phase difference or electric current values of the detection signal and drive signal in stead of detecting the amplitude of the detection signal, and may vary the rate of change in frequency on the basis of these detection results and of whether or not there is a state of resonance due to harmonics.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In other words, the frequency-change-rate change device may be one that detects if the frequency is near the target frequency at which the vibrating body <b>910</b> locks, and that can vary the rate of change in frequency to a low speed at such times and can vary the rate of change in frequency to a high speed at all other times.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Also, the frequency-change-rate change device is not limited to one that varies the rate of change in frequency between two levels of a high speed and a low speed, and may be configured to be capable of varying the rate of change among three or more levels according to the vibrating state of the vibrating body <b>910</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Furthermore, in the previous embodiments, the drive frequency was varied from fmax to fmin, but may conversely also be varied from fmin to fmax.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">In the third embodiment, it is determined whether a state of resonance due to harmonics was detected when the detection signal rises n+1 or more times within n cycles of the drive signal, but it may also be determined whether the state of resonance is detected when the detection signal falls n+1 times.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">In the second embodiment, it is determined whether a state of resonance due to harmonics was detected when the detection signal rises a plurality of times within half a cycle of the drive signal, but it may also be determined whether the state of resonance is detected when the detection signal falls a plurality of times.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Furthermore, in the first through third embodiments, the cycle of the drive signal or the rising and falling of the detection signal are detected using logical circuits, but the cycle and frequency and the like of the drive signal or detection signal may also be measured and detected based on this data.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Moreover, the drive apparatus of the present invention can be configured in a case <b>704</b> with a band <b>705</b> connected to the case <b>704</b>. Therefore, users can wear the drive apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Also, the devices and the like in the drive apparatus <b>50</b> may be configured from various logical elements and other such hardware, and may be configured such that the devices can be achieved by providing a computer with CPU a (central processing unit), memory (storage apparatus), and the like into a timepiece or a portable device, and incorporating a specific program or data (the data stored in the storage unit) into this computer.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The programs and data may be stored in advance in RAM, ROM, or other such memory incorporated into the timepiece or portable device. Also, for example, specific control programs or data may be installed in the timepiece or portable device via the Internet or another such communication device, or a CD-ROM, memory card, or other such storage medium. The devices may be realized by causing the CPU or the like to operate with a program stored in the memory. To install a specific program or the like in the timepiece or portable device, a memory card, CD-ROM, or the like may be directly inserted into the timepiece or portable device, or a device for reading these storage media may be connected to the timepiece or portable device by external mounting. Furthermore, a LAN cable, phone line, or the like may be connected to the timepiece or portable device to load and install a program or the like via wired communication, or the program may be loaded and installed via wireless communication.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">If a control program or the like provided by a storage medium, the Internet, or another such communication means is incorporated into the timepiece or portable device, the functions of the present invention can be performed merely by modifying the program, so the control program can be selected and incorporated during factory shipping or as target by the user. In this case, various timepieces and portable devices with different control systems can be manufactured merely by modifying the program, making it possible to share the components and to greatly reduce manufacturing costs when the products are modified.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Also, the present invention is not limited to being applied to the electronic timepiece described in the previous embodiments. Specifically, the drive method for a piezoelectric actuator according to the present invention or the electronic timepiece that employs the drive apparatus is not limited to a wristwatch, standing timepiece, wall timepiece, or other such electronic timepieces, and the present invention can be applied to various electronic devices and is particularly suitable for portable electronic devices for which compactness is a requirement. Examples of such electronic devices include phones, portable phones, personal computers, portable information terminals (PDA), cameras, and other devices with timepiece functions. The present invention can also be applied to film cameras, digital cameras, video cameras, portable phones with camera functions, and other such electronic devices that do not have a timepiece function. When the present invention is applied to electronic devices with a camera function, the drive device of the present invention can be used to drive a focusing mechanism, a zoom mechanism, a lens adjusting mechanism, or the like (driven body). Furthermore, the drive device of the present invention may also be used in a drive mechanism for a meter pointer in a measurement device, a drive mechanism in a mobile toy, a drive mechanism for a meter pointer in an instrument panel in an automobile or the like, a piezoelectric buzzer, a printer inkjet head, an ultrasonic motor, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Also, a piezoelectric actuator was used to drive the date display mechanism of the electronic timepiece <b>1</b> in the first embodiment, but the actuator not limited to this option alone and may also be used to drive time display hands (pointers) in the electronic timepiece <b>1</b>. Thus, replacing the stepping motor normally used to drive the pointers with a piezoelectric actuator allows the electronic timepiece <b>1</b> to be designed as a single thin layer and to be made highly antimagnetic because the piezoelectric actuator is less susceptible to magnetism than the stepping motor.</p>
