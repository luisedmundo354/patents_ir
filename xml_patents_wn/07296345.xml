<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to computer peripheral devices and, in particular, it concerns a pocket-size computer peripheral devices that are connected with host computer systems by way of plug connectors such as USB plug connectors.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the field of computers and computer peripheral devices, there is an ongoing trend towards miniaturization for convenience and portability. In certain cases, memory devices have been reduced to “pocket size”, meaning that they can literally be carried in a user's pocket in the same manner as a wallet or set of keys.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One family of memory devices that are of particular interest, and in which context the present invention will be described herein, are known as “USB memory devices”, which may include USB flash disks or USB flash drives. For example, one product includes a pen-type flash memory device having a USB connector plug that can be connected to a USB port of a standard computer. In such devices, the USB plug connector is protected by a removable cover when not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> are exploded perspective and perspective views, respectively, showing a conventional pen-type USB flash drive device <b>50</b> including a housing <b>51</b> that encloses a printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) <b>70</b> including a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>73</b>, one or more integrated circuit (IC) devices <b>74</b> mounted on PCB <b>73</b>, and a plug connector <b>75</b> mounted on a front end of PCB <b>73</b>. Housing <b>51</b> includes an upper housing portion <b>51</b>-A and lower housing portion <b>51</b>-B that are separately molded and then assembled using conventional methods such as ultrasonic joining and snap-couple connection. The joining process typically occurs at specific locations along the edges of the covers, and thus the joining is not continuous along the interface. A seam <b>54</b> is formed between upper housing portion <b>51</b>-A and lower housing portion <b>51</b>-B, and becomes the weakest point in the USB flash memory device due to mechanical movement at plug connector <b>75</b> during repeated inserting to and removing from an USB socket.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A problem with conventional pen-type peripheral devices that have a two-piece housing is that the two-piece housing must be assembled manually, which results in long production cycle time and high production costs. In addition, the two-piece housing may become partially separated, causing the plug connector to become loose and separated from the PCBA/housing. For example, seam <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) is prone to break at the joining locations due to repeated insertion of pen-type USB flash drive device <b>50</b> into and removal from a USB socket of a host system, thus separating the covers and resulting in failure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is needed is method for producing pen-type portable computer peripheral devices, such as USB memory devices, which overcomes the problems associated with conventional structures.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to a portable computer peripheral device including a molded housing, and a plug connector (e.g., a USB plug connector) extending from a front end of the molded housing. The present invention is particularly directed to a method for producing a memory device in which a lower housing portion is molded using a first molding apparatus, a printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) is mounted onto the lower housing portion such that a plug connector extends from a front end of the lower housing portion, and then the upper housing portion is molded onto exposed side edges of the lower housing portion and over the electrical components of the PCBA such that the upper housing portion becomes fused with the lower housing portion around the PCBA. By producing the molded housing in this manner, a portable memory device is provided in which the molded housing provides effective protection to the electronic components mounted on the PCBA, and also provides firm and secure support for the USB plug connector so the USB plug connector will not become loose and separated from the molded housing after extended usage. Further, the method reduces production costs by eliminating costly manual assembly work and additional joining processes, such as ultrasonic bonding or snap-coupling of two housing portions. Moreover, because molding process integrates upper and lower housing portions, the production method presented renders portable memory devices having an attractive appearance due to the elimination of a connection seam.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the method begins by manufacturing a PCBA and a plastic strip including several lower housing portions. The PCBA includes the plug connector, IC devices and other optional components mounted onto a PCB. The IC devices are operably connected to contact pins of the plug connector such that the IC devices are connected with a host system when the plug connector is plugged into a female socket of the host system. The plastic strip is formed in a first molding apparatus such that each adjacent pair of lower housing portions is linked by a plastic tether, which maintains a predetermined spacing between the lower housing portions. Each lower housing portion attached to the plastic strip includes a lower wall surrounded by peripheral edges (i.e., a front edge, a back edge, and side edges extending between the front and back edges). The plastic strip is then removed from the first molding apparatus and mounted onto the lower die of a second molding apparatus that has a cavity network formed such that each lower housing portion is precisely received in an associated cavity section, and adjacent cavity sections are linked by branch channels positioned to receive the plastic tethers. PCBAs are then mounted onto each of the lower housing portions such that each plug connector extends over a front edge of its associated lower housing portion and into an associated receptacle, and such that the side and back edges of the lower housing portion are exposed around the PCBA. The upper die of the second molding apparatus is then closed over the lower die, and molten thermoplastic is injected into the cavity network to form upper housing portions on each of the lower housing portions. Note that because the peripheral edges of the lower housing portion are exposed within each cavity section (i.e., with the exception of the front edge portion overlapped by the plug connector), the peripheral edges of the upper housing portions become fused to the peripheral edges of corresponding lower housing portions. As such, when the second molding apparatus is subsequently opened, a strip of completed memory devices linked by tethers is removed, each completed memory device including an integral (i.e., substantially inseparable) housing surrounding an associated PCBA, with its plug connector extending from a front of the integral housing. Finally, the strip is singulated by trimming the tethers to separate the individual memory devices.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, PCBAs are formed as above, but individual lower housing portions are produced in separate cavities of a first molding apparatus. The lower housing portions are then mounted individually into separate cavities of a second molding apparatus. PCBAs are then mounted onto each of the lower housing portions in the manner described above (i.e., with the plug connectors received in receptacles, and such that portions of the front edges adjacent to the plug connector, the side edges and the back edge of each lower housing portion are exposed around the PCBA). The upper die of the second molding apparatus is then closed over the lower die, and molten thermoplastic is injected into the individual cavities to form upper housing portions on each of the lower housing portions. Using this method, when the second molding apparatus is subsequently opened, individual memory devices are produced, thereby eliminating the singulation step required in the embodiment mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a specific embodiment of the present invention, the plug connector of each PCBA is a Universal Serial Bus (USB) plug connector. In another specific embodiment, the memory devices are formed in accordance with the established ExpressCard form factor.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another embodiment of the present invention, the side edges of the PCBA defines alignment notches, and the lower housing portion includes alignment protrusions arranged along its side edges. When the PCBA is mounted onto the lower housing portion, the alignment notches are mounted over corresponding alignment protrusions to precisely align and secure the PCB during the second molding process.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the lower housing portion includes an open end defined along its front edge such that the plug connector extends over the front edge. The upper housing portion is then molded over the side and back edges of lower housing portion such that a front section of the upper housing is formed on a portion of the plug connector, thus securing the plug connector to the molded housing.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to yet another embodiment, the lower housing portion is formed with several depressions/grooves that define relatively thin sections of the lower wall, with ribs/thick sections separating adjacent depressions/grooves. The depressions/grooves are positioned such that, when the PCBA is mounted onto the lower housing portion (i.e., before the second molding process), each depression/groove receives a corresponding IC structure, which further facilitates alignment and minimizes the overall height of the memory device. Further, the ribs/thick sections separating adjacent depressions/grooves provide structural rigidity and/or strength that increase the durability of the assembled memory device.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present invention is directed to pocket-sized, portable computer peripheral devices, and in particular to low-cost memory devices, that are connected by plug connectors (e.g., USB plug connectors) to host computer systems to perform various functions. While the present invention is depicted in particular as a USB memory device, it should be appreciated that the present invention is applicable to any and all pocket-sized computer peripheral device types that are readily transportable and which may be advantageously interconnected with various host computer systems by way of a plug connector. Examples of applications for such portable memory devices include, but are not limited to, flash memory devices and other data storage devices, communications devices, scanners and cameras. The term “host computer system” is used herein to refer to any electronic computer of any type or size including, but not limited to, desktop computers, notebook computers, palmtop computers and personal digital assistant (PDA) devices. Positional terms such as “front”, “back”, “upper”, and “lower” are used for descriptive purposes in the description below and in the claims, and are intended only to describe relative positions of the recited parts, and are not intended to be limited to positions based on a fixed external reference.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are an exploded perspective view and an assembled view, respectively, showing a memory device <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> that is produced in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Memory device <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> generally includes a molded housing <b>110</b> and a printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) <b>120</b> that is enclosed inside of molded housing <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, molded housing <b>110</b> includes a lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A and an upper housing portion <b>110</b>-B that is molded over lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A such that upper housing portion <b>110</b>-B is integrally connected (e.g., fused or otherwise permanently connected in the manner described below) to lower housing portion <b>110</b>-B along its peripheral edges. Lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A includes a lower wall <b>115</b> defining an optional lower (first) through-hole <b>118</b>-A, and upward-facing peripheral edges surrounding lower wall <b>115</b> that include lower side edges <b>117</b>-A<b>1</b> and <b>117</b>-A<b>2</b>, a front edge <b>111</b>-A defining a (first) front opening portion <b>112</b>-A, and a rear edge <b>113</b>-A. Lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A also includes one or more optional alignment structures (e.g., alignment posts <b>119</b> formed on lower wall <b>115</b> that are provided to facilitate alignment of PCBA <b>120</b>). Upper housing portion <b>110</b>-B includes an upper wall <b>116</b> defining an optional upper (second) through-hole <b>118</b>-B, and downward-facing peripheral edges surrounding upper wall <b>116</b> that include upper side edges <b>117</b>-B<b>1</b> and <b>117</b>-B<b>2</b>, a front edge <b>111</b>-B defining a (second) front opening portion <b>112</b>-B, and a rear edge <b>113</b>-B. As mentioned above and discussed in further detail below, both lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A and upper housing portion <b>110</b>-B are molded thermoplastic pieces, with the peripheral side edges of upper housing portion <b>110</b>-B being molded directly onto the peripheral side edges of lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A (with PCBA <b>120</b> mounted in a central region therebetween and plug connector <b>150</b> extending through front opening portions <b>112</b>-A and <b>112</b>-<i>b</i>). That is, during the upper housing portion molding process, the molten thermoplastic material forming the peripheral edges of upper housing portion <b>110</b>-B contacts, melts, and inter-diffuses with the thermoplastic material forming the peripheral edges of lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A. Accordingly, the peripheral edges of lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A are substantially integrally molded with the peripheral edges of upper housing portion <b>110</b>-B. In other words, in order to separate lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A and upper housing portion <b>110</b>-B in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a knife or other cutting instrument would be needed to slice housing <b>110</b> into the two parts. However, such an action will damage or even destroy the housing <b>110</b> and make it not useful anymore.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to the central portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, PCBA <b>120</b> includes a printed circuit board (PCB, also referred to as a “substrate”) <b>130</b>, at least one integrated circuit (IC) device (electronic device) <b>140</b>, and a plug connector <b>150</b> that are assembled as described below. PCB <b>130</b> is fabricated using standard PCB manufacturing techniques, and, according to an aspect of the present invention, is molded into housing <b>110</b> in the manner described below. PCB <b>130</b> has a front edge <b>131</b>, a back edge <b>133</b>, and opposing upper and lower surfaces <b>135</b> and <b>136</b> that define a width (i.e., extending between opposing side edges <b>137</b>A and <b>137</b>B) that is sized to fit within housing <b>110</b> (i.e., less than a width of lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A). At least one IC device <b>140</b> (e.g., a controller circuit and/or a memory circuit, or other electronic component) are mounted on or otherwise electrically connected to PCB <b>120</b> (e.g., on upper surface <b>135</b> and/or lower surface <b>136</b>) according to well-established techniques to form an electronic circuit. IC device <b>140</b> are operably coupled to connection pins formed on plug connector <b>150</b> by way of PCB <b>130</b> to perform predetermined computer peripheral functions, such as those mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Plug connector <b>150</b> is mounted onto front end <b>131</b> of PCB <b>130</b> and includes a front edge <b>151</b> defining a socket opening <b>152</b> that faces away from PCB <b>130</b>, and connection pins <b>153</b> formed on a substrate <b>154</b> and located inside socket opening <b>151</b> are generally aligned in the longitudinal direction defined by housing <b>110</b>. In the disclosed embodiment, plug connector <b>150</b> is a Universal Serial Bus (USB) plug connector that is electrically connected to IC device <b>140</b> through contacts and conductive traces (not shown) that are formed on PCB <b>130</b> using known techniques. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when memory device <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> is produced, plug connector <b>150</b> is rigidly supported by and extends from a front end of housing <b>110</b> for engagement into a socket of a host system in the manner described below. Note that the optional through-holes (e.g., upper through-hole <b>118</b>-B) may be utilized to expose an indicator light, such as a light emitting diode (LED) structure that is operably provided on the PCBA.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram depicting a simplified method for manufacturing portable memory devices, such as USB memory device <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), according to an embodiment of the present invention. This method is further illustrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(A) through 7</figref>, which illustrate simplified molding equipment and individual components of exemplary portable memory devices during various stages of production.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to the top left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a PCB is manufactured according to known PCB fabrication techniques (block <b>310</b>), and then a plug connector, IC devices and other components are mounted (e.g., soldered) onto the PCB to form a PCBA (block <b>315</b>). An exemplary PCBA <b>120</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and described above.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to the top right of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, concurrent with, before, or after the fabrication of the PCBA, a plastic strip including several lower housing portions linked by plastic tethers is fabricated using a first molding apparatus, for example, by well-known plastic injection molding techniques (block <b>320</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(A) and 5</figref> are cross-sectional side and top views, respectively, showing a simplified exemplary (first) molding apparatus <b>400</b> including a lower die <b>410</b> and an upper die <b>420</b> that are constructed using known techniques to provide a cavity network <b>430</b> including multiple cavity sections <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>, and <b>436</b> that communicate with adjacent cavity sections by way of branch channels <b>433</b> and <b>435</b>. For example, cavity section <b>432</b> communicates with adjacent cavity section <b>434</b> by way of branch channel <b>433</b>. As indicated in these figures, when thermoplastic material is injected into cavity network <b>430</b>, plastic material fills both the cavity sections and the branch channels, thereby forming a plastic strip <b>440</b> including several linked lower housing portions <b>110</b>-A<b>1</b> through <b>110</b>-A<b>3</b>, where each lower housing portion is connected to an adjacent lower housing portion by a plastic tether <b>445</b>-<b>1</b> or <b>445</b>-<b>2</b> that is formed in an associated branch channel during injection of the thermoplastic material. For example, lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A<b>1</b>, which is formed in cavity section <b>432</b>, is linked to lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A<b>2</b>, which is formed in cavity section <b>434</b>, by plastic tether <b>445</b>-<b>1</b>, which is formed in branch channel <b>433</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view showing exemplary plastic strip <b>440</b> in additional detail. Note that plastic tethers <b>445</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>445</b>-<b>2</b> may have any size and cross-section, so long as the resulting structure provides a suitable rigidity and durability. Further it is noted here that, although plastic strip <b>400</b> includes three lower housing portions <b>110</b>-A<b>1</b> through <b>110</b>-A<b>3</b> and two tethers, those skilled in the art will recognize that a plastic strip may be produced having any number of lower housing portions connected by any number of tethers. In addition, the single tether such as <b>445</b>-<b>1</b> between the lower housing portions <b>110</b>-A<b>1</b> and <b>110</b>-A<b>2</b> is merely meant to be exemplary, and should not be considered to be limiting. Further, the parallel arrangement of housing portions <b>110</b>-A<b>1</b> through <b>110</b>-A<b>3</b> is exemplary and not intended to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As indicated in the lower portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, upper die <b>420</b> and/or lower die <b>410</b> include an optional pin-like structure <b>419</b> that is positioned to produce lower through-holes <b>118</b>-A<b>1</b>, <b>118</b>-A<b>2</b> and <b>118</b>-A<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, after the first molding process is completed, the plastic strips (e.g., plastic strip <b>400</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is removed from the first molding apparatus, and is transported to a second molding apparatus, where it is inserted and aligned into a lower die thereof such that each linked lower housing portion of the plastic strip is positioned in an associated cavity formed in the lower die (block <b>330</b>). One PCBA is then mounted onto each of the linked lower housing portions (block <b>340</b>), the upper die of the second molding apparatus is secured to enclose the plastic strip and PCBAs (block <b>350</b>), and then molten thermoplastic material is injected into the second molding apparatus to form upper housing portions over each of the linked lower housing portions (block <b>360</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(B) through 4(D)</figref> are cross-sectional end views depicting the transfer of plastic strip <b>400</b> to a second molding apparatus <b>450</b>, and subsequent formation of upper housing portions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref> depicts the removal of plastic strip <b>400</b> from lower die <b>410</b> of first molding apparatus <b>400</b>, and inserting into a lower die <b>460</b> of second molding apparatus <b>450</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref> shows that plastic strip <b>400</b> is aligned within lower die <b>460</b> such that first lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A<b>1</b> is received in a first cavity section <b>462</b>, second lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A<b>2</b> is received in a second cavity section <b>464</b>, and third lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A<b>3</b> is received in a third cavity section <b>466</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(C)</figref> depicts second molding apparatus <b>450</b> after PCBAs <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-<b>3</b> have been respectively mounted onto linked lower housing portions <b>110</b>-A<b>1</b> through <b>110</b>-A<b>3</b>, and upper die <b>465</b> is secured onto lower die <b>460</b>. Similar to the first molding apparatus, second molding apparatus <b>450</b> defines a cavity network that includes cavity portions <b>472</b>, <b>474</b>, and <b>476</b>, which respectively includes a suitable open region over the associated lower housing portions and PCBAs. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(D)</figref>, when thermoplastic material is subsequently injected into cavity network <b>470</b>, the plastic material fills the open spaces to form a structure <b>480</b> including upper housing portions <b>110</b>-B<b>1</b> through <b>110</b>-B<b>3</b>, which are formed on lower housing portions <b>110</b>-A<b>1</b> through <b>110</b>-A<b>3</b> and PCBAs <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>120</b>-<b>3</b>, respectively, thereby forming linked memory devices <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>100</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to an aspect of the present invention, because the peripheral edges of lower housing portions <b>110</b>-A<b>1</b> through <b>110</b>-A<b>3</b> are exposed within cavity sections <b>472</b>, <b>474</b> and <b>476</b>, respectively, the peripheral edges of the upper housing portions <b>110</b>-B<b>1</b> through <b>110</b>-B<b>3</b> become fused to the peripheral edges of corresponding lower housing portions <b>110</b>-A<b>1</b> through <b>110</b>-A<b>3</b> to form integral housings that are both highly durable and aesthetically appealing. For example, as indicated at the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(C)</figref>, side edges <b>117</b>-A<b>1</b> and <b>117</b>-A<b>2</b> of lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A<b>1</b> are exposed inside cavity section <b>472</b> prior to the second molding process, and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(D)</figref> side edges <b>117</b>-B<b>1</b> and <b>117</b>-B<b>2</b> of upper housing portion <b>110</b>-B<b>1</b> are formed directly on side edges <b>117</b>-A<b>1</b> and <b>117</b>-A<b>2</b> of lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A<b>1</b>. The injected molten thermoplastic material associated with upper housing portion <b>110</b>-B<b>1</b> thus causes partial melting of the previously cooled thermoplastic material associated with lower housing portion <b>110</b>-A<b>1</b>, which results in inter-diffusion that produces a permanent and highly durable bond between the upper and lower housing portions.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(C)</figref>, note that plastic tethers <b>445</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>445</b>-<b>2</b> are respectively received in branch channels <b>473</b> and <b>475</b>. As indicated on the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(D)</figref> and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(E)</figref>, lower plastic strip <b>440</b>, upper plastic structure <b>480</b>, and the PCBAs secured therein form a device strip <b>490</b> that effectively includes three memory devices <b>100</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>100</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>100</b>-<b>3</b> linked by tether structures <b>445</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>445</b>-<b>2</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(E)</figref>, device strip <b>490</b> is thus removed from the second molding apparatus in one piece.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to another aspect of the present invention, second molding apparatus <b>450</b> clamps over the plug connectors of each PCBA to prevent molten thermoplastic material from entering or otherwise damaging the plug connectors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(A) through 7(D)</figref> illustrate this clamping process by showing second molding apparatus <b>450</b> from a top view during the second molding process. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref>, cavity sections <b>472</b>, <b>474</b>, and <b>476</b> of cavity network are linked by branch channels <b>473</b> and <b>475</b>, and also include plug receptacle regions <b>472</b>-P, <b>474</b>-P and <b>476</b>-P. Note that an entrance channel <b>478</b> is indicated at the lower portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref>, which functions as a passage for incoming injected thermoplastic according to known practices. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref>, when plastic strip <b>440</b> is inserted into lower die <b>460</b>, plastic strip <b>440</b> only fills a portion of cavity network <b>470</b> (i.e., in particular, no portion of plastic strip <b>440</b> enters plug receptacle regions <b>472</b>-P, <b>474</b>-P and <b>476</b>-P). Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(C)</figref>, when PCBAs <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-<b>3</b> are mounted onto linked lower housing portions <b>110</b>-A<b>1</b> through <b>110</b>-A<b>3</b>, plug connectors <b>150</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>150</b>-<b>3</b> are received within portions of plug receptacle regions <b>472</b>-P, <b>474</b>-P and <b>476</b>-P that are defined by lower die <b>460</b>. When upper die <b>465</b> is subsequently secured onto lower die <b>460</b>, a corresponding portion of plug receptacle regions <b>472</b>-P, <b>474</b>-P and <b>476</b>-P is clamped (i.e., tightly fitted) onto plug connectors <b>150</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>150</b>-<b>3</b>, respectively. That is, unlike the main portion of cavity sections <b>472</b>, <b>474</b>, and <b>476</b>, which provide space for the formation of upper housing portions <b>110</b>-B<b>1</b> through <b>110</b>-B<b>3</b> (e.g., as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(C)</figref>, plug receptacle regions <b>472</b>-P, <b>474</b>-P and <b>476</b>-P are formed such that the corresponding portions of upper die <b>465</b> and lower die <b>460</b> tightly pinch plug connectors <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-<b>3</b> to prevent molten thermoplastic material from entering these regions. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(D)</figref>, even though plastic material flows into entrance channel <b>478</b> to form a waste tab <b>485</b>-<b>3</b>, no portion of second plastic structure <b>480</b> is formed over plug connectors <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>120</b>-<b>3</b>. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when device strip <b>490</b> is removed from the second molding apparatus, it includes memory devices <b>100</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>100</b>-<b>3</b> in a substantially completed form (i.e., with plug connectors <b>150</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>150</b>-<b>3</b> extending from front walls <b>111</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>111</b>-<b>3</b>), but still linked by tether structures <b>445</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>445</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(C)</figref>, upper die <b>465</b> includes an optional pin-like structure <b>469</b> that is positioned to produce optional upper through-holes <b>118</b>-B<b>1</b>, <b>118</b>-B<b>2</b> and <b>118</b>-B<b>3</b>, which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to another aspect, front edge portions of each lower housing portion are exposed on both sides of each plug connector, as are side and back edges of the lower housing, thus allowing the upper housing portion to seal each PCBA inside in a manner that both protects the PCBAs, and provides a rigid support for the plug connector. For example, referring to the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(C)</figref>, front edge sections <b>111</b>-A<b>1</b> and <b>111</b>-A<b>2</b> are exposed on opposite sides of plug connector <b>150</b>-<b>1</b>, and side edges <b>117</b>-A<b>1</b>/<b>117</b>-A<b>2</b> and back edge <b>113</b>-A are also exposed. Accordingly, when the molten thermoplastic material is injected into cavity portion <b>472</b>, an upper housing is formed that both protectively seals PCBA <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> inside, and provides a rigid support structure along the side edges of plug connector <b>150</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, after the second molding process is completed, the second molding apparatus is opened, the device strip including multiple completed memory devices linked by tether structures is removed (block <b>370</b>).
