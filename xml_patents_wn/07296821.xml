<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An equalizer for a suspension system for a trailer is configured to absorb or dampen the harsh shocks or vibrations coming off of the leaf springs proximate to a center frame hangar, thus allowing for a “softer” ride. The equalizer utilizes two independent equalizer arm assemblies which are each rotatably secured within the equalizer. Each equalizer arm assembly is operatively associated with one of the front or rear leaf springs such that upon upward movement of either the front or rear leaf spring, the associated equalizer arm assembly is forced to rotate within the equalizer and to deform a shock absorber provided within the equalizer. The shock absorber, upon the deformation thereof, absorbs the harsh shocks or vibrations which would otherwise normally be transferred from the leaf springs, to the equalizer, and thus to the frame of the trailer.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention is generally directed to an equalizer for a suspension system used in vehicles or trailers having tandem axles generally between 2,000 pounds and 7,000 pounds with double eye springs, such as recreational vehicles, mobile homes and light trailers of all types.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A prior art suspension system <b>20</b> currently used on trailers incorporates an equalizer <b>22</b> such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The suspension system <b>20</b> is mounted on a frame <b>24</b> of the left side of the trailer and another, identical suspension system <b>20</b> is mounted on the frame <b>24</b> of the right side of the trailer. Only the suspension system <b>20</b> mounted on the frame <b>24</b> of the left side of the trailer is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The suspension system <b>20</b> includes the equalizer <b>22</b>, a front leaf spring <b>26</b>, a rear leaf spring <b>28</b>, a front shackle or link <b>30</b> and a rear shackle or link <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The equalizer <b>22</b> is generally triangular in shape, having a first end corner <b>34</b>, a second end corner <b>36</b> and a third end corner <b>38</b>. Other equalizers of the prior art may be curved rather than triangular in shape. The equalizer <b>22</b> is generally formed of cast iron and is rigid. The first end corner <b>34</b> of the equalizer <b>22</b> is attached to a center frame hangar <b>40</b>, which depends from the frame <b>24</b> of the trailer, at a point A. The second end corner <b>36</b> of the equalizer <b>22</b> is pivotally mounted to a first end <b>42</b> of the front shackle <b>30</b> at a point B. The third end corner <b>38</b> of the equalizer <b>22</b> is pivotally mounted to a first end <b>44</b> of the rear shackle <b>32</b> at a point C.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A second end <b>46</b> of the front shackle <b>30</b> is pivotally mounted to a rear end <b>48</b> of the front leaf spring <b>26</b> at a point D. A front end <b>50</b> of the front leaf spring <b>26</b> is attached to the frame <b>24</b> of the trailer at a point E.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A second end <b>52</b> of the rear shackle <b>32</b> is pivotally mounted to a front end <b>54</b> of the rear leaf spring <b>28</b> at a point F. A rear end <b>56</b> of the rear leaf spring <b>28</b> is attached to the frame <b>24</b> of the trailer at a point G.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A front axle <b>58</b> is positioned on the forward leaf spring <b>26</b> generally equidistantly between point D and point E. A rear axle <b>60</b> is positioned on the rear leaf spring <b>28</b> generally equidistantly between point F and point G.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To the extent possible, road shock and vibrations from tires of the trailer are transferred to the front and rear axles <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, and are absorbed by the front and rear leaf springs <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, respectively. Points A, E and G are the contact points through which the road shock is passed to the frame <b>24</b>. The equalizer <b>22</b> basically has only one purpose for being including in the suspension system <b>20</b>, which is to equalize the weight on both the front and rear axles <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> as the tires pass over uneven terrain. For example, an upward motion of the front leaf spring <b>26</b> results in a downward motion of the rear leaf spring <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The equalizer <b>22</b>, however, is not configured to dampen or absorb the harsh shocks or vibrations coming off the rear end <b>48</b> of the front leaf spring <b>26</b> and the front end <b>54</b> of the rear leaf spring <b>28</b> proximate to the center frame hangar <b>40</b>, which would thus allow for a “softer” ride. The equalizer <b>22</b> of the prior art has been in use without a single design change for at least the past forty (40) years.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, there is a need for an equalizer which overcomes the aforementioned disadvantages. The present invention provides such an equalizer. Features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon a reading of the attached specification, in combination with a study of the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Briefly, and in accordance with the foregoing, the invention provides an equalizer for a suspension system for a trailer or the like which is configured to equalize the weight on both the front and rear axles of a trailer as tires of the trailer pass over uneven terrain, but which also is configured to dampen or absorb the harsh shocks or vibrations coming off of the rear end of a front leaf spring and the front end of a rear leaf spring proximate to a center frame hangar, thus allowing for a “softer” ride. The equalizer utilizes two independent equalizer arm assemblies which are each rotatably secured within the equalizer. Each equalizer arm assembly is operatively associated with one of the front or rear leaf springs such that upon upward movement of either the front or rear leaf spring, the associated equalizer arm assembly is forced to rotate within the equalizer and to deform a shock absorber provided within the equalizer. The shock absorber, upon the deformation thereof, absorbs the harsh shocks or vibrations which would otherwise normally be transferred from the leaf springs, to the equalizer, and thus to the frame of the trailer.</p>

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Like the prior art suspension system <b>20</b> including the equalizer <b>22</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to the extent possible, road shock and vibrations from tires (not shown) of the trailer, utilizing the suspension system <b>102</b> including the equalizer <b>100</b> of the present invention, are transferred to the front and rear axles <b>418</b>, <b>420</b>, and are absorbed by the front and rear leaf springs <b>394</b>, <b>396</b>, respectively.

Upon deformnation, the second shock absorber <b>116</b><i>b </i>absorbs or dampens the harsh shocks or vibrations coming off the front end <b>414</b> of the rear leaf spring <b>396</b>, which would otherwise be transferred through the equalizer to the center frame hangar <b>372</b> and, thus, to the frame <b>374</b> of the trailer. Therefore, a “softer” ride is achieved by the suspension system <b>102</b> including the equalizer <b>100</b> of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The equalizer <b>100</b> and the suspension system <b>102</b> which includes the equalizer <b>100</b> is advantageous and beneficial for a “softer” ride in comparison to the prior art equalizer <b>22</b> and the prior art suspension system <b>100</b> which includes the prior art equalizer <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">While a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown and described, it is envisioned that those skilled in the art may devise various modifications without departing from the spirit and scope of the foregoing description and the appended claims.</p>
