<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to systems and methods for selecting from a plurality of channels transmitting media programs, and in particular to a system and method for adaptively generating an ordered schedule of channels based on viewer channel surfing habits.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Systems for transmitting media programs to viewer are well known in the art. Such systems include direct broadcast satellite systems, cable systems, and terrestrial broadcast systems. There is a trend in such systems to offer greater and greater numbers of channels, especially in subscriber based systems. Currently, many such systems include 200 or more channels. As the number of channels increase, users are confronted with the need to navigate through a large number of channels. Channel guides for television are often complicated and difficult to navigate. They also are generally not configured to assist the user in selecting channels by quickly scanning through the available channels in a more or less sequential order (e.g. channel surfing). Channel guides are also of limited use in car audio systems and hand held devices, since such guides generally rely on a significant amount of visual information that cannot be easily digested by the user. Selecting channels in such systems require a simple, easy to use user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">What is needed is a simple, easy to use user interface that allows the user to scan a large number of channels and more quickly find a media program of interest. The present invention satisfies that need.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To address the requirements described above, the present invention discloses a method and apparatus for computing a schedule of channels. The method comprises the steps of accepting a series of commands to tune a plurality of channels sequentially from an ordered schedule of channels; determining a duration of a time period between each of the series of commands; and prioritizing the schedule of channels according to the duration of the time period during which each channel is tuned. The apparatus comprises a user interface for accepting a series of commands to tune a plurality of channels sequentially from an ordered schedule of channels and a processor, communicatively coupled to a memory, the processor implementing a timer for determining a duration of a time period during which each channel is tuned and prioritizing the schedule of channels according to the duration of the time period during which each channel is tuned.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The foregoing offers an adaptive system that dynamically adjusts how channels are presented to the user based on the amount of time the user dwells on a single channel before moving onto the next selection. This method offers a simple way to learn user preferences, and adjusts to the current programming. The method is scaleable to systems with many channels of content, can work in conjunction with other systems such as nested channel lists, and can work with the simplest of user interfaces found in car audio systems or handheld wireless devices.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and which is shown, by way of illustration, several embodiments of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The advent of the remote control has made it much more common for viewers to change between several programs during commercial breaks. However, current systems do not allow a convenient method for a user to elect several favorite programs during a current session and change quickly between them. Some systems allow the user to delete channels that are never watched (such as foreign language channels) or customize channels lists (such as sports or news). Other systems offer a “favorites” list that presents the top ten channels based on total accumulated viewing time. Still other systems allow the user to reprogram buttons for one-touch access to programs, but these systems are usually limited to only one or two channels and they are cumbersome to use.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention learns which channels a user in most interested in watching for that viewing session and presents those channels to the user first when changing the channels with a simple two button (“+” and “−”) user interface. It does not require the user to reprogram play lists. Unlike other systems which are limited to one or two channels, the present invention accommodate any number of channels that a user wishes to select. It also can be reset (reordered so the channels are presented in sequential order) at a time associated with a change in a threshold number of media programs (e.g. such as at the top of the hour when new media programs selections are available).</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Media Reception and Presentation System</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram depicting one embodiment of a media program reception and presentation system <b>100</b>. The system <b>100</b> comprises a media program source <b>106</b>, a receiver <b>102</b>, and a media program presentation device <b>104</b>. The media program source <b>106</b> can include a cable transmission system <b>106</b>A, a terrestrial transmission system <b>106</b>B, a satellite transmission system <b>106</b>C, or other transmission system such as the Internet. The media presentation device <b>104</b> can include a video presentation device <b>104</b>A such as a television or monitor, an audio reproduction system <b>104</b>B, or both. The receiver <b>102</b> includes a tuner <b>124</b> for selecting a channel carrying a media program of interest on a signal from one or more of the media program sources <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The tuner <b>124</b> is communicatively coupled to one or more of the media program sources <b>106</b>. Where communicative coupling is established with a cable media provider <b>106</b>A, the connection is typically directly to the receiver <b>102</b>. Where the communicative coupling is established to a terrestrial transmission system <b>106</b>B, the coupling is established via a terrestrial antenna <b>108</b>. Where the communicative coupling is established to a satellite transmission system, the coupling is established via a satellite dish antenna <b>110</b> and associated hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The tuner <b>124</b> is also communicatively coupled and typically controlled by a processor <b>126</b>. Channels may be selected via a receiver user interface <b>130</b> having one or more receiver channel selection buttons <b>132</b>. In one embodiment, the channel selection buttons include an up channel button <b>132</b>A (+) and a down channel button <b>132</b>B (−). In one embodiment, selecting the up channel button <b>132</b>A commands the processor to tune the next succeeding channel in an ordered series of channels, and selecting the down channel button <b>132</b>B to select the previous channel in the ordered series of channels. The user interface <b>130</b> may also include other controls that allow the user to select channels directly as well.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the media reception and presentation system <b>100</b> also comprises one or more remote controls <b>112</b>. In such cases, the receiver <b>102</b> may include a remote control sensor <b>128</b> communicatively coupled to the processor <b>126</b>. The remote control sensor <b>128</b> receives commands and other information from the remote control <b>112</b> and provides the commands/information to the processor <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The remote control <b>112</b> includes a remote control transmitter <b>114</b> for transmitting messages (via wire, infrared, or radio frequency transmission). The transmitter <b>114</b> is communicatively coupled to a remote control processor <b>116</b> which generates messages for transmission by the transmitter <b>114</b> based on inputs from the remote control user interface <b>120</b>. In one embodiment, the remote control user interface <b>120</b> includes an up channel button <b>122</b>A and a down channel button <b>122</b>B, which provides analogous functionality as buttons <b>132</b>A and <b>132</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, one or more of the functions provided by the receiver <b>102</b>, the media presentation device <b>104</b>, or the remote control <b>112</b> may be provided by a computer or similar processor. Further, the input to such computer (to supply the media programs and associated commands) can be from a direct link to the media program source, through a dial-up service, or via the Internet. The receiver <b>102</b> could also be placed in a mobile environment such as a vehicle. Further, the media programs can include video information, audio information, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart presenting illustrative method steps that can be used to practice one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in block <b>202</b>, a series of commands to tune a plurality of channels sequentially from an ordered schedule or list of channels are accepted. The commands can be entered, for example via the receiver <b>102</b> user interface or the remote control user interface <b>120</b>. If the commands are entered via the remote control user interface <b>120</b>, the user input is provided to the processor <b>116</b>, a message is generated by the processor <b>116</b>, and an appropriate command signal is output by the remote control transmitter <b>114</b>. The command signal is received by the remote control sensor <b>128</b> and provided to the processor <b>126</b>, which commands the tuner <b>124</b> to tune to the channel selected by the user. Where the user input is provided by the receiver user interface <b>130</b>, the commands are provided directly to the processor <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in block <b>204</b>, a duration of time during which each successive channel is tuned is determined. This can be determined from the duration of the time period between channel commands, or the period of time that the channel is actually tuned. These tune durations are stored in a memory within the processor <b>126</b> or within a memory communicatively coupled thereto. In another embodiment, the time durations are stored in a memory in the remote control <b>112</b> (e.g. in the processor <b>116</b> or a memory communicatively coupled thereto).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in block <b>206</b>, a schedule of channels is prioritized according to the duration of the time period during which each channel is tuned.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Time durations and other information can be stored for a plurality of individual users as well. This permits media presentation system to provide a simplified user interface to more than one user. This is especially useful, as users may have widely different viewing habits. The receiver <b>102</b> or remote control <b>112</b> can identify the user from an explicit user input ID or from other user inputs. For example, the receiver <b>102</b> or remote control <b>112</b> can determine the identity of the user from the channels selected by the user, the pattern of selection, and/or the time the user views each channel.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the present invention excludes certain channels from consideration in determining the time duration of the channel (e.g. the time duration is always set to the minimum amount). This prevents selected channels from being prioritized, according to the user's wishes. For example, the user may wish to exclude channels having adult content from the foregoing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram showing an exemplary application of the present invention. At time A, the channel schedule <b>306</b> is set so that the channels are in sequential order (e.g. to the series {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}), and the user has selected channel 1. At time B, a channel change <b>304</b> is commanded (e.g., by depressing user input <b>122</b>A or <b>132</b>A). The tuner <b>124</b> is then tuned to the next succeeding channel in the current channel schedule (in this case, channel schedule <b>306</b>A), which is channel 2. The duration of the time period during which channel 1 was tuned <b>302</b>A is stored and used to compute a new channel schedule. Similar time periods (<b>302</b>B-<b>302</b>J) are computed as commands to tune the next succeeding channel (e.g. <b>304</b>C-<b>304</b>J) are processed and the tuner <b>124</b> is tuned to the appropriate channel. After all of the channels (in this case, channels 1-10) in the channel schedule <b>306</b> have been tuned, the channel schedule <b>306</b> is prioritized according to the time periods <b>302</b>A-<b>302</b>J. In the illustrated embodiment, this prioritization places the channels in order according to the length of the time periods <b>302</b>A-<b>302</b>J associated with each channel. The result is a reordered channel schedule <b>306</b>B. In the illustrated example, the channels are reordered so that the channel associated with the longest time period (e.g. channel 1) is presented first, the next longest time period (e.g. channel 8) is presented next, and so on. This results in the ordering of the channels in the channel schedule <b>306</b> as {1,8,3,2,4,5,6,7,9,10}.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">This process is repeated as the user again scans the channels again. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the user paused for the longest time period on channel 8, the second to the longest time period on channel 6, and the third longest time period on channel 1. Hence, the reordered channel schedule <b>306</b>C now places the channels in order with 8 appearing first, then channel 6, then channel 1.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the illustrated embodiment, the new schedule is determined after all of the channels in the channel schedule have been selected, but this need not be the case. New channel schedules <b>306</b> can be computed after each channel change, after a threshold number of channel changes, or after a specified or adaptive time period has elapsed. This can be implemented by weighting each of the time periods by a value inversely proportional with time, or by rolling off measured time periods in a first-in-first-out manner.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The channel sequences determined above (or at least the most recent channel selection) can be saved when the receiver <b>102</b> is deactivated, or can be reset, preferably at the user's selection. Further, provision can be made to allow the user to reset the channel schedule to the baseline sequence <b>306</b>A on command. In one embodiment of the invention, the channel schedule <b>306</b> can be reset to the baseline sequence (or any pre-set sequence) at a time associated with a change in a threshold number of media programs associated with the channels in the schedule of channels. For example, the channel schedule <b>306</b> can be reset to the baseline channel schedule <b>306</b>A or another preset schedule at the top of the hour when new programming selections are available.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart presenting more detail regarding how one embodiment of the present invention may be implemented. Block <b>402</b> resets all timers. Block <b>404</b> initializes the channel schedule queuing order to a baseline sequence order (e.g. baseline sequence <b>306</b>A or a pre-selected sequence). Block <b>406</b> increments to the next channel in the queue. This is typically in response to a user input to view the next channel in the current channel sequence. If a command to reset is input, block <b>408</b> returns processing to block <b>402</b>. If not processing proceeds to block <b>410</b>. Block <b>410</b> determines if a command to change the channel (+ or −) is input If not, a timer for the current channel is incremented (as shown in block <b>412</b>) and processing returns to block <b>408</b>. If a channel change command has been input block <b>414</b> determines whether the end of the queue (the current channel schedule <b>306</b>) has been reached. If not, the next channel in the queue is selected (as shown in block <b>416</b>) and processing returns to block <b>408</b>. Thereafter, a timer for the newly selected (current) channel is incremented as required. If the end of the queue is reached, processing is passed to block <b>418</b>, which reorders the queue (channel schedule <b>306</b>) based on the timer values.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The operations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be modified so that only the most recent viewing times are given more importance. This can be accomplished by weighting the timer values. Time duration values from the most recent scan is given a weight of one. Time duration values from previous scans are given lower weights depending on how quickly the user wants the system to provide less consideration to earlier choices. This weighting parameter can be set with a user dialog box or preset based on typical or measured viewing patterns. In this case, the time duration during which each particular channel is tuned (T<sub>Accumulated Channel N</sub>) can be computed as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>T</i><sub>Accumulated Channel N</sub><i>=T</i><sub>Accum</sub>(<i>t=t</i><sub>a </sub>to <i>t</i><sub>b</sub>)*<i>W</i><sub>1</sub><i>+T</i><sub>Accum</sub>(<i>t=t</i><sub>b </sub>to <i>t</i><sub>c</sub>)*<i>W</i><sub>2</sub>+  EQ(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
wherein
<br/>
N is the channel; T<sub>Accum </sub>(t=t<sub>a </sub>to t<sub>b</sub>) is the duration of time during which channel N was tuned during the time interval between and t<sub>a </sub>and t<sub>b</sub>; W<sub>1 </sub>is the weight applied to the duration of time during which channel N was tuned during the time interval from t<sub>a </sub>to t<sub>b</sub>, T<sub>Accum </sub>(t=t<sub>b </sub>to t<sub>c</sub>) is the duration of time during which channel N was tuned during the time interval between t<sub>b </sub>and t<sub>c</sub>; W<sub>2 </sub>is the weight applied to the duration of time during which channel N was tuned during the time interval between t<sub>b </sub>and t<sub>c</sub>, and so on. The time intervals t<sub>a </sub>to t<sub>b </sub>and t<sub>b </sub>and t<sub>c </sub>can be absolute time intervals (e.g. every 5 minutes), or can be a time interval determined according to user input events. For example, the first time interval from t<sub>a </sub>to t<sub>b </sub>can be the time between which the user has scanned through all of the channels in the channel schedule.
</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another embodiment of the present invention, the channels in the channel schedule <b>306</b> are segregated into a first (A) list of channels that the user wishes to return to and a second (B) list of channels that are not of interest to the user during the current viewing session. As in other embodiments, this embodiment of the invention is operable with a simple user interface using just an up channel command (+) and a down channel command (−).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram showing an illustrative example of how the first and the second channel lists are compiled. In the illustrated embodiment, separate pointers are maintained. The pointers determine the relationship between user up-channel (+) and down channel (−) commands and the channel that the tuner <b>124</b> is commanded to tune to. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a down-channel command (−) selects a channel from the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A according to a first pointer, and an up-channel command (+) selects a channel from the “B” channel schedule list <b>506</b>B according to a second pointer.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the illustrated example, at time “A” the receiver <b>102</b> either “wakes up” or is commanded to tune to channel 1. The user selects the up-channel control (+) on the channel change axis <b>504</b>, at time “B”, thus commanding the tuner <b>124</b> to tune channel 2. If channel 1 was a channel of interest (determined as such if the duration of the time period for which channel 1 was tuned exceeded a threshold time duration t<sub>thresh</sub>), channel 1 is added to the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Next, the user provides another up-channel command (+) at time “C”. Since the pointer for the next up channel input is channel 3, the receiver <b>102</b> is thus commanded to tune the receiver <b>102</b> to channel 3, and the pointer for the next up channel input is moved to the next channel (channel 4) in the “B” schedule list <b>506</b>B . In the illustrated embodiment, the time for which channel 2 was tuned (which can be determined by the time the channel was actually tuned, or determined as the difference between successive commands) is less than t<sub>thresh</sub>, and therefore channel 2 remains on the “B” schedule list <b>506</b>B and is not placed on the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The user provides another up-channel command (+) at time “D”. Since the pointer is directed at channel 4, the receiver <b>102</b> is thus commanded to tune the receiver <b>102</b> to channel 4, and the pointer for the next up channel input command is moved to the next channel (channel 5) in the “B” schedule list <b>506</b>B. In the illustrated embodiment, the time for which channel 3 was tuned is greater than t<sub>thresh</sub>, and therefore, channel 3 is placed in the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Similarly, as the user provides succeeding up-channel commands at times “D”, “E”, “F”, “G”, and “H”, each time pausing for less than t<sub>thresh</sub>, the up channel pointer is moved successively to each next channel, and the channel remains on the “B” schedule list <b>506</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At time “I”, the user provides another up-channel command (+). Since the duration for which channel 8 was tuned is greater than t<sub>thresh</sub>, channel 8 is added to the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A. The user then provides commands to tune channels 9 and 10, which remain on the “B” schedule list <b>506</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At time “K”, the user provides a down-channel command (−). Since the pointer for the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A is on channel 1, the receiver <b>102</b> is commanded to tune channel 1. Since channel 1 was tuned for greater than t<sub>thresh</sub>, it remains on the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A, and the pointer for the next down-channel input is moved to the next channel on the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A, which is channel 3.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Channel 3 remains tuned until time “M”, when the user provides another down-channel command. Since channel 3 was tuned for greater than t<sub>thresh</sub>, it remains on the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A. Further, the pointer for the next down-channel input is moved to the next channel on the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A, which is channel 8.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At time “N”, the user provides a down-channel command (−). Since the down-channel pointer is at channel 1, the receiver <b>102</b> is commanded to tune channel 1.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At time “0”, the user provides an up-channel command (+). Since the up-channel pointer is at channel 2, the receiver <b>102</b> is tuned to channel 2. In the illustrated embodiment, although channel 1 was tuned the second time for less than t<sub>thresh</sub>, channel 1 is not removed from the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">At times “P” and “Q”, the user provides an up-channel command (+), thereby commanding the receiver <b>102</b> to tune channels 4 and 5. Since channel 4 is tuned for less than t<sub>thresh</sub>, it remains on the “B” schedule list <b>506</b>B. However, the tuner remains tuned to channel 5 until time “R”. Thus, the tuner <b>124</b> is tuned to channel 5 for longer than t<sub>thresh</sub>, and channel 5 is added to the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref> are flow charts presenting illustrative operations that could be used to practice an alternative embodiment of the present invention. First, all timers are reset, pointers are initialized, and all channels are placed on the “B” schedule list <b>506</b>B. This is illustrated in block <b>602</b>. Block <b>604</b> tests to determine whether the user provided an up-channel command (+) or a down-channel command (−). If the user input is an up-channel command (+), processing is passed to block <b>606</b>, which selects the channel (channel N) from the current “B” schedule list <b>506</b>B pointer. Then, a timer which will determine the time period during which channel N is tuned is reset and started, as shown in block <b>608</b>. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, processing is passed to block <b>612</b> which determines whether a channel change input is received. If no channel change input command is received, the timer for the current channel (channel N) is incremented (as shown in block <b>614</b>), and processing is returned to block <b>612</b>. If a channel change input command is received, processing passes to block <b>616</b>, which moves the “B” schedule list <b>506</b>B to the next channel in the “B” schedule list <b>506</b>B. Processing is then passed to block <b>618</b>, which tests to determine whether the “dwell” threshold (t<sub>thresh</sub>) has been exceeded. If the dwell threshold has not been exceeded, processing returns to block <b>604</b>. If the dwell threshold has been exceeded, the currently tuned channel (channel N) is moved to the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A, as shown in block <b>620</b>. Processing is then passed to block <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">If the channel change input is a down-channel command, processing is passed from block <b>604</b> to block <b>610</b>. In block <b>610</b>, a channel is selected from the current “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A. Next, block <b>622</b> determines whether a channel change input command was received. If so, the “A” list pointer is moved to the next channel in the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A, as depicted in block <b>626</b>. If not, processing is passed to block <b>624</b>, which increments the timer for the current channel. After the timer is incremented, processing is then passed to block <b>622</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The foregoing discussion illustrated how the channels could be moved from the “B” schedule list <b>506</b>B to the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A according to user commands defining the duration of the time that the tuner <b>124</b> is tuned to each channel. It is noted, however, that the foregoing could be implemented by measuring the time duration between successive user commands. This allows the functionality to determine which channel appears next to be resident in the remote control instead of the receiver <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Although in the embodiment described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each qualifying channel is added to the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A as soon as it is determined that the channel was tuned for greater than t<sub>thresh</sub>, this need not be the case. Instead, channels can be added to the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A after all of the channels have been scanned (in the illustrated embodiment, channels 1-10), of when a threshold number of channels have been scanned. Further, in another embodiment of the present invention, the “A” schedule list can be updated continuously. Hence, as soon as it is determined that channel 1, for example, is tuned for a duration greater than t<sub>thresh</sub>, channel 1 can be added to the “A” schedule list, even before a command to tune to a different channel is received.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Channels can remain in the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A in the order in which they were added, or they may be reordered in order of how long each channel was tuned. Similarly, although channels which are tuned for less than t<sub>thresh</sub>, are not added to the “A” schedule list, those channels which remain on the “B” schedule list <b>506</b>B can also be ordered to place the channels which are viewed the longest first.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Selective Dwell Timer Reset</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described above, the present invention includes the ability to reset all of the timers at the beginning of a particular viewing session. The command to reset all timers can be invoked automatically (e.g. upon power up) or can be explicitly commanded. In one embodiment, the present invention also allows the user to selectively reset the timer for one or more selected channels. This feature is useful, for example, in situations where the user selects a particular channel and leaves the room. Since the selected channel could be tuned for an extensive period of time that is not related to the time the program is actually viewed by the user, the channel could be prioritized at or near the top of the channel order (or move to the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A), even though it is not necessarily a preferred channel. In this instance, the user can command the system to selectively reset the timer for this channel, preventing that channel from being prioritized relative to the other channels. This can be accomplished via an additional user interface (e.g. button) on the remote control <b>112</b> or the receiver <b>102</b>, or by selecting buttons in series or parallel combinations. For example, the foregoing can be implemented by selecting both the “+” button <b>122</b>A and the “−” button <b>122</b>B.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Nested Channel Lists</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Some program guides (such as those offered by DIRECTV) allow the user to maintain separate channel lists having a subset of all available channels. Such channel lists can be used, to group channels with similar content together (e.g. sports channels or children's channels). These channel lists may also include a list of channels that a particular user was interested in that did not include the full selection of available channels. The present invention can operate with these separate channel lists without beginning with the list of all available channels. This allows the user interested in a particular defined subset of programs (e.g. sports programming) on a separate channel list to begin with the identified subset of available channels and have that list dynamically prioritized based on the dwell time on each channel. Similarly, the user could start with the identified subset of available channels and the present invention will dynamically separate the channels into the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A and the “B” schedule list <b>506</b>B.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Other Lists</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">User dwell time is only one example measurement parameter based on user input that can be measured to prioritize channel selection or separate available channels into one or more lists (e.g. the “A” schedule list <b>506</b>A or the “B” schedule list <b>506</b>B). Other parameters can also be used. For example, a personal video recorder system (PVR) may include provision for the user to evaluate programs that the system has selected (e.g. like or dislike). The data collected from such user interaction can be used to pare down the complete list of channels by giving the user “keep” or “delete” options for each channel. This can be implemented with the buttons <b>122</b>A and <b>122</b>B or with additional user input devices.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one embodiment of the invention, user input is accepted from other systems, including interactive TV systems and used to prioritize channel selections and/or pare down channel lists. Data indicative of user interest in the media programs transmitted on one or more channels, for example, in the form of output from click stream monitoring programs (which monitor Internet useage) can also be used to prioritize the schedule channels or separate the channels into an “A” list <b>506</b>A or a “B” list <b>506</b>B. In a simple such implementation, the system counts the number of on-screen clicks for a given viewed channel and uses the screen click sum as an alternative to the dwell or viewing time of the channel. Also, the number of on-screen clicks for a particular channel can be combined with the dwell time (time that the channel is tuned) by weighting each click with a certain amount of time (e.g. one click being considered equivalent to an additional minute of dwell time). Further, the parameter of additional dwell time per click can be adjusted for typical TV useage patterns for or each user, or explicitly defined or adjusted by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In other embodiments, user input from other interactive television systems is used to track user preferences and to use these preferences to prioritize the presentation of channels to the user. For example, in one embodiment, the present invention accepts an Internet click stream (from an interactive television or a conventional computer) and records and categorizes uniform resource locators (URLs) to determine preferences. Such preferences can include content based preferences (e.g. sports programming), that are used to preferentially present channels with similar content to the user. For example, if the click stream indicated a preference for professional basketball, the channel selection algorithm accepts this information as well as electronic programming guide (EPG) information to determine which channels are displaying professional basketball during the user's viewing session and prioritize those channels as they are presented to the user.</p>
