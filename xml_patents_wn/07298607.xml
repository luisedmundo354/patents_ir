<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to information handling systems, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for reinforcing an information handling system chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option is an information handling system. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements may vary between different applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some information handling systems are housed in a chassis and may be mounted in racks for storage and/or use. As computing needs continue to grow, the information handling system components housed in the chassis increase in weight, size, and number, which leads to issues with respect to the chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As additional and heavier components are housed in the chassis, the component support surface may begin to sag or bow from the weight of the components, causing the component support surface to deflect from a planar orientation to a bowed orientation. It is desirable to minimize the amount of space taken up by a chassis in the rack in order to mount as many information handling systems in the rack as possible, and the deflection of the component support surface to the bowed orientation may cause the chassis to deflect into space in the rack that is meant to be used by other chassis. Furthermore, the deflection of the component support surface to the bowed orientation creates a perception of low quality due to the systems sagging or bowed appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, the deflection of the component support surface to the bowed orientation is dealt with by stiffening the component support surface by fabricating a thicker component support surface. This is undesirable due to the need to minimize the space taken up in the rack by the chassis and the additional costs incurred in fabricating the thicker component support surface.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a method and apparatus for reinforcing a chassis absent the disadvantages found in the prior methods discussed above.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one embodiment, a chassis reinforcing apparatus is provided which includes a chassis defining a component housing, and a chassis reinforcing member coupled to the chassis and comprising a bend which is directed towards the component housing.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, and <b>5</b><i>c</i>, a method <b>500</b> for reinforcing a chassis is illustrated. The method <b>500</b> begins at step <b>502</b> where a chassis is provided. The component support surface <b>300</b> is positioned in the component housing <b>206</b> on the chassis section <b>200</b> such that the front edge <b>302</b><i>a </i>of the component support surface <b>300</b> is adjacent the front edge <b>202</b><i>a </i>of the chassis reinforcing member <b>202</b> and the rear edge <b>302</b><i>b </i>on the component support surface <b>300</b> is adjacent the rear edge <b>202</b><i>b </i>on the chassis reinforcing member <b>202</b>. Positioning the component support surface <b>300</b> in the component housing <b>206</b> on the chassis section <b>200</b> provides a chassis <b>502</b><i>a</i>. In an embodiment, the chassis <b>502</b><i>a </i>may be the chassis <b>116</b>, described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, and <b>5</b><i>c</i>, the method <b>500</b> then proceeds to step <b>504</b> where the chassis <b>502</b><i>a </i>is reinforced. The component support surface <b>300</b> is coupled to the chassis reinforcing member <b>202</b> using methods known in the art such as, for example, rolling the edge of the coupling apertures <b>214</b> on the chassis reinforcing member <b>202</b> over the edge of the coupling apertures <b>308</b> on the component support surface <b>300</b>, positioning rivets through the coupling apertures <b>214</b> and <b>308</b> on the chassis reinforcing member <b>202</b> and the component support surface <b>300</b>, respectively, welding the component support surface <b>300</b> to the chassis reinforcing member <b>202</b>, combinations thereof, or a variety of other methods known in the art. In an embodiment, any apertures in the chassis <b>502</b><i>a </i>may be shielded to prevent electromagnetic interference to and from components in the chassis <b>502</b><i>a</i>. Furthermore, the side wall mounting section <b>304</b><i>b </i>on the component support surface <b>300</b> is coupled to the side wall <b>204</b><i>a </i>on the chassis section <b>200</b>. By coupling the component support surface <b>300</b> to the chassis section <b>200</b>, the chassis reinforcing member <b>202</b> is held in a substantially planar orientation by the component support surface <b>300</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>. As a result of holding the chassis reinforcing member <b>202</b> in a substantially planar orientation, the bend <b>210</b> in the chassis reinforcing member <b>202</b> is flattened out, which creates a reinforcing force F from the chassis reinforcing member <b>202</b> which is directed towards the component housing <b>206</b> and creates a stress in the component support surface <b>300</b> directed towards the component housing <b>206</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b. </i></p>

A disk drive component <b>506</b><i>d </i>is coupled to the chassis <b>502</b><i>a </i>by positioning it between the component mounting features <b>306</b><i>b </i>and <b>306</b><i>c</i>, and a plurality of other components <b>506</b><i>e </i>and <b>506</b><i>f </i>are coupled to the chassis <b>502</b><i>a </i>using methods known in the art.

The side walls <b>404</b><i>a </i>and <b>404</b><i>b </i>on the chassis cover <b>400</b> may then be coupled to the side walls <b>204</b><i>a </i>and <b>204</b><i>b</i>, respectively, on the chassis section <b>200</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>e</i>, using methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, <b>5</b><i>d</i>, <b>5</b><i>e</i>, and <b>5</b><i>f</i>, the method <b>500</b> proceeds to step <b>510</b> where the chassis <b>502</b><i>a </i>is mounted in a rack. A rack <b>510</b><i>a </i>including a plurality of spaced apart supports <b>510</b><i>aa </i>and <b>510</b><i>ab </i>is provided. The chassis <b>502</b><i>a </i>may then be mounted in the rack <b>510</b><i>a </i>by engaging the sides of the chassis section <b>200</b> which are adjacent each of the side walls <b>204</b><i>a </i>and <b>204</b><i>b </i>with the supports <b>510</b><i>aa </i>and <b>510</b><i>ab</i>, respectively.

While the component support surface <b>300</b> has been illustrated as a chassis floor, the chassis support surface <b>300</b> and chassis reinforcing member <b>202</b> may be located in different positions and orientation on the chassis <b>502</b><i>a </i>where additional support is needed.</p>
