<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to sputtering targets and their methods of manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A sputtering chamber is used to sputter deposit material onto a substrate to manufacture electronic circuits, such as for example, integrated circuit chips and displays. Typically, the sputtering chamber comprises an enclosure wall that encloses a process zone into which a process gas is introduced, a gas energizer to energize the process gas, and an exhaust port to exhaust and control the pressure of the process gas in the chamber. The chamber is used to sputter deposit a material from a sputtering target onto the substrate, such as a metal for example, aluminum, copper, tungsten or tantalum; or a metal compound such as tantalum nitride, tungsten nitride or titanium nitride. In the sputtering processes, the sputtering target is bombarded by energetic ions, such as a plasma, causing material to be knocked off the target and deposited as a film on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one version, a sputtering target may be formed by holding a sheet of spin-formed sputtering material against the surface of a target backing plate and diffusion-bonding the sputtering material to the backing plate by hot isostatic pressing. However, this method has several disadvantages. The sputtering material required to form the spin-formed sheet typically has to have a high level of purity, and consequently, is expensive. Target fabrication costs are driven even higher because both surfaces of the sheet of sputtering material are typically machined smooth to facilitate diffusion bonding to the underlying backing plate as well as to provide a smooth exposed sputtering surface. Targets formed by such a method can be undesirable because they can have a grain structure that is sheared by the forces generated in the spin-forming process, resulting in non-uniform grain sizes. Also, the targets can have undesirable pores and voids occurring in the bond between the backing plate and sputtering material. During processing, the non-uniform grain size and voids of the target can generate sputtered deposits that are non-uniform or uneven in thickness. The non-uniform and uneven deposition of the sputtered material can result in processed substrates having inferior quality, and can even damage structures formed on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is also difficult to form sputtering targets having convoluted or complex shapes using conventional processes. Targets having complex shapes are often used to provide enhanced sputtering coverage in magnetic fields, as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,274,008 to Gopalraja et al., “Integrated Process for Copper Via Filling,” commonly assigned to Applied Materials, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Such targets may comprise for example ridges, projections, rings, troughs, recesses and grooves. Conventional processes such as the spin forming process are not satisfactory in forming complex target shapes, because a significant amount of machining is required to cut out the desired convoluted shape from the spin formed layer. This machining is costly and wastes the expensive high purity sputtering material. Also, excessive machining can generate shearing forces on the surface of the target which plastically deform the grains on the target surface to produce an undesirable surface grain structure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, it is desirable to form sputtering targets having more uniform and consistent grain surface structure and with fewer voids. It is further desirable to form sputtering targets having complex or non-planar shapes reproducibly and with reduced costs.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An exemplary version of a chamber <b>106</b> capable of sputter depositing material on a substrate <b>104</b> is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>. The chamber <b>106</b> is representative of a self-ionized plasma chamber, such as an SIP+ type chamber, developed by Applied Materials, Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif. A typical chamber <b>106</b> comprises enclosure walls <b>118</b> that include sidewalls, <b>120</b>, a bottom wall <b>122</b> and a ceiling <b>124</b>. A substrate support <b>130</b> is provided to support a substrate <b>104</b> in the chamber <b>106</b>. The substrate support <b>130</b> may be electrically floating or may be biased by a pedestal power supply <b>210</b>, which may be for example an RF power supply <b>203</b>. The substrate <b>104</b> is introduced into the chamber <b>106</b> through a substrate loading inlet (not shown) in a sidewall <b>120</b> of the chamber <b>106</b> and placed on the support <b>130</b>. The support <b>130</b> can be lifted or lowered by support lift bellows (not shown) and a lift finger assembly (also not shown) can be used to lift and lower the substrate <b>104</b> onto the support <b>130</b> during transport of the substrate <b>104</b> into and out of the chamber <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A process gas, such as a sputtering gas, is introduced into the chamber <b>106</b> through a gas delivery system <b>150</b> that includes a process gas supply <b>152</b> comprising gas sources <b>154</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>that each feed a conduit <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>having a gas flow control valve <b>158</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, such as a mass flow controller, to pass a set flow rate of the gas therethrough. The conduits <b>156</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>feed the gases to a mixing manifold <b>160</b> in which the gases are mixed to from a desired process gas composition. The mixing manifold <b>160</b> feeds a gas distributor <b>162</b> having one or more gas outlets <b>164</b> in the chamber <b>106</b>. The gas outlets <b>164</b> may pass through the chamber sidewalls <b>120</b> to terminate about a periphery of the substrate support <b>130</b>. The process gas may comprise a non-reactive gas, such as argon or xenon, that energetically impinges upon and sputters material from a target <b>111</b>. The process gas may also comprise a reactive gas, such as one or more of an oxygen-containing gas and a nitrogen-containing gas, that are capable of reacting with the sputtered material to form a layer on the substrate <b>104</b>. Spent process gas and byproducts are exhausted from the chamber <b>106</b> through an exhaust system <b>168</b> which includes one or more exhaust ports <b>170</b> that receive spent process gas and pass the spent gas to an exhaust conduit <b>172</b> in which there is a throttle valve <b>174</b> to control the pressure of the gas in the chamber <b>106</b>. The exhaust conduit <b>172</b> feeds one or more exhaust pumps <b>176</b>. Typically, the pressure of the sputtering gas in the chamber <b>106</b> is set to sub-atmospheric levels.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The sputtering chamber <b>106</b> further comprises a sputtering target <b>111</b> facing a surface <b>105</b> of the substrate <b>104</b>. The target <b>111</b> can be a planar target (not shown) or a non-planar target (shown). The sputtering chamber <b>106</b> can also comprise a shield <b>128</b> to protect a wall <b>118</b> of the chamber <b>106</b> from sputtered material, and typically, to also serve as an anode with respect to the cathode target <b>111</b>. The shield <b>128</b> may be electrically floating or grounded. The target <b>111</b> is electrically isolated from the chamber <b>106</b> and is connected to a target power supply <b>200</b>, such as a pulsed DC power source, but which may also be other types of voltage sources. In one version, the target power supply <b>200</b>, target <b>111</b>, and shield <b>128</b> operate as a gas energizer <b>180</b> that is capable of energizing the sputtering gas to sputter material from the target <b>111</b>. The target power supply <b>200</b> applies a bias voltage to the target <b>111</b> relative to the shield <b>128</b>. The electric field generated in the chamber <b>106</b> from the voltage applied to the sputtering target <b>111</b> energizes the sputtering gas to form a plasma that energetically impinges upon and bombards the target <b>111</b> to sputter material off the target and onto the substrate <b>104</b>. A suitable pulsing frequency of a pulsed DC voltage for energizing the process gas may be, for example, at least about 50 kHz, and more preferably less than about 300 kHz, and most preferably about 100 kHz. A suitable DC voltage level to energize the process gas may be, for example, from about 200 to about 800 Volts.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The chamber <b>106</b> further comprises a magnetron <b>300</b> comprising a magnetic field generator <b>301</b> that generates a magnetic field near the target <b>111</b> of the chamber <b>106</b> to increase an ion density in a high-density plasma region <b>226</b> adjacent to the target <b>111</b> to improve the sputtering of the target material, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>. An improved magnetron <b>300</b> may be used to allow sustained self-sputtering of copper or sputtering of aluminum, titanium, or other metals—while minimizing the need for non-reactive gases for target bombardment purposes, as for example, described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,183,614 to Fu, entitled “Rotating Sputter Magnetron Assembly”; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,274,008 to Gopairala et al., entitled “Integrated Process for Copper Via Filling,” both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The magnetic field extends through the substantially non-magnetic target <b>111</b> into the sputtering chamber <b>106</b>. In one version, the improved magnetron <b>300</b> comprises a magnetic field generator <b>301</b> having magnets <b>307</b> that extend along one or more sidewalls of the target <b>111</b> and are connected by a magnetic yoke <b>310</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>. The magnets <b>307</b> may comprise one or more of an inner magnet and outer magnet that are connected together by a yoke <b>310</b> that is formed of a magnetically soft material. The magnetic field generator <b>301</b> comprising the magnets <b>307</b> provides an enhanced magnetic field <b>309</b> in the region <b>226</b> enclosed by the target sidewalls, thereby increasing the density of the plasma in the region <b>226</b>. In another version, the magnetron <b>300</b> comprises a motor <b>306</b> to rotate the magnetron <b>300</b> about a rotation axis <b>312</b> to provide an enhanced magnetic field, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>. The motor <b>306</b> is typically attached to the magnetic yoke <b>310</b> of the magnetron <b>300</b> by a shaft <b>308</b> that extends along the rotation axis <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The chamber <b>106</b> can be operated by a controller <b>311</b> comprising a computer that sends instructions via a hardware interface to operate the chamber components, including the substrate support <b>130</b> to raise and lower the substrate support <b>130</b>, the gas flow control valves <b>158</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, the gas energizer <b>180</b>, and the throttle valve <b>174</b>. The process conditions and parameters measured by the different detectors in the chamber <b>106</b>, or sent as feedback signals by control devices such as the gas flow control valves <b>158</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, pressure monitor (not shown), throttle valve <b>174</b>, and other such devices, are transmitted as electrical signals to the controller <b>311</b>. Although, the controller <b>311</b> is illustrated by way of an exemplary single controller device to simplify the description of present invention, it should be understood that the controller <b>311</b> may be a plurality of controller devices that may be connected to one another or a plurality of controller devices that may be connected to different components of the chamber <b>106</b>—thus, the present invention should not be limited to the illustrative and exemplary embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one version, a target <b>111</b> suitable for use in a sputtering chamber <b>106</b> comprises a complex shape, such as a shape comprising a non-planar surface <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>. The target <b>111</b> is typically circularly symmetric with respect to a main vertical axis of the chamber <b>106</b>, and may comprise ridges, projections, rings, troughs, recesses, grooves or other topological features that enhance processing of the substrates <b>104</b>. A target <b>111</b> having a complex shape has been discovered to provide improved sputtering properties, as described for example in aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,274,008. The target <b>111</b> having the complex shape provides improved process performance by accommodating magnets <b>307</b> in proximity to and surrounding high density plasma regions <b>226</b> adjacent to the target <b>111</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, or by otherwise providing for an enhanced magnetic field <b>309</b> that allows for a large thickness or volume of a sputtering plasma in high density plasma regions <b>226</b> adjacent to the target <b>111</b>. The target <b>111</b> having the complex shape may also serve to improve deposition uniformity by regulating the effective target area to which portions of the substrate are exposed. For example, a recessed portion of the target <b>111</b>, such as a trough <b>8</b>, may be effectively hidden from regions of the substrate <b>104</b> that are more distant from the recessed portion, such as an outer edge <b>103</b> of the substrate <b>104</b>, and thus deposition of material from the recessed portion onto the more distant regions of the substrate <b>104</b> may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The target <b>111</b> comprises an inverted annular trough <b>8</b> comprising cylindrical outer and inner sidewalls <b>4</b>,<b>6</b> and a top wall <b>5</b> that at least partially enclose a high density region <b>226</b>. The annular trough <b>8</b> encircles a central portion of the target <b>111</b> comprising a cylindrical well <b>7</b> that projects downwards towards the surface <b>105</b> of the substrate <b>104</b>. The cylindrical inner sidewall <b>6</b> defines the sides of the cylindrical well <b>7</b>, and the cylindrical well <b>7</b> is capped by a bottom wall <b>9</b> that faces the substrate <b>104</b>. The bottom wall <b>9</b> and top walls <b>5</b> can be substantially parallel to the surface <b>105</b> of the substrate <b>104</b>, and the inner and outer sidewalls <b>4</b>,<b>6</b> can be substantially perpendicular to the surface <b>105</b> of the substrate <b>104</b>. At least a portion of the surface <b>24</b> of the side, top and bottom walls <b>4</b>,<b>5</b>,<b>6</b>,<b>9</b>, comprises the sputtering material to be sputtered on the substrate <b>104</b>. The inverted annular trough <b>8</b> and cylindrical well <b>7</b> can accommodate magnets <b>307</b> positioned between the outer sidewall <b>4</b> of the trough and the sidewall <b>120</b> or ceiling <b>124</b> of the chamber enclosure <b>118</b> and even within the space enclosed between the bottom and sidewalls <b>9</b>, <b>6</b> of the cylindrical well <b>7</b> and ceiling <b>124</b> of the chamber enclosure <b>118</b>, thereby providing an enhanced magnetic field <b>309</b> in the regions <b>226</b> adjacent to the target <b>111</b>. The target <b>111</b> may further comprise a flange portion <b>13</b> that extends radially outward from the outer sidewall <b>4</b> to attach the target <b>111</b> to the chamber enclosure walls <b>118</b>, for example by vacuum sealing the flange portion <b>13</b> of the target <b>111</b> between the ceiling <b>124</b> and sidewalls <b>120</b> of the chamber <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The target <b>111</b> can be formed in an electroforming process in which sputtering material is electroplated to form a complex or non-planar shape. Electroforming provides a sputtering material having a high purity and good grain properties, such as a higher uniformity of grain size. Electroforming can also generate a unitary sputtering material structure having fewer pores or voids. The method is suitable for forming targets <b>111</b> having sputtering material comprising, for example, one or more of copper, aluminum, tantalum, titanium and tungsten. The method generally comprises forming a preform <b>14</b> having a surface <b>16</b> and electroplating a layer <b>12</b> of sputtering material onto the surface <b>16</b> of the perform to form the sputtering target <b>111</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>through <b>2</b><i>d </i>schematically illustrate stages in an embodiment of a target fabrication process.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The target preform <b>14</b> provides a support structure on which the layer <b>12</b> of sputtering material can be electroplated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>. The preform <b>14</b> can comprise the same or a different material than the sputtering material. In one version, the preform <b>14</b> comprises a material that is more easily shaped than the sputtering material, and may also be of lower purity or less expensive than the sputtering material. The preform <b>14</b> is desirably formed from a material that is readily electroplated by the sputtering material, such as for example, a conducting or semiconducting material that can serve as an anode in an electroplating process. A suitable preform <b>14</b> may comprise, for example a metal, such as at least one of aluminum, copper, steel and titanium. For example, the preform <b>14</b> may comprise an industrial grade copper alloy. In one method of forming the preform <b>14</b>, the metal material is heated to a molten state and poured into a mold having the desired preform shape. Cooling of the molten metal in the mold results in the preform <b>14</b> having the desired shape. The molded metal can also be machined or otherwise shaped to form features in the target preform <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The preform <b>14</b> can comprise a complex shape, such as a non-planar bottom surface <b>16</b>, that at least partially defines the shape of the layer <b>12</b> of sputtering material electroplated over the surface <b>16</b>. In the version shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, the preform <b>14</b> comprises an inverted annular trough <b>8</b> and central cylindrical well <b>7</b> having inner and outer cylindrical sidewalls <b>6</b>,<b>4</b> that are positioned to from a partially obtuse angle with the top wall <b>5</b> of the trough <b>8</b> such that the cylindrical sidewalls <b>6</b>,<b>4</b> form an angle with respect to one another of from about 5° to about 30°, thus forming a trough <b>8</b> having a width that narrows towards the top wall <b>5</b> of the trough <b>8</b>. The preform <b>14</b> having the complex shape serves as a support structure for the formation of the non-planar electroplated layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Sputtering material is electroplated onto the preform <b>14</b> to form the electroplated layer <b>12</b> via an electroplating process. In the electroplating process, one or more surfaces of the preform <b>14</b>, such as one or more of the top and bottom surfaces <b>25</b>,<b>16</b> is exposed to an electroplating bath solution <b>403</b> in an electroplating apparatus <b>405</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The electroplating solution comprises an aqueous solution having electrolytes comprising the sputtering material dissolved therein. For example, the electroplating solution may comprise one or more of a copper-containing solution, such as CuSO<sub>4</sub>, an aluminum-containing solution, such as AISO<sub>4</sub>, a tantalum-containing solution, a titanium-containing solution and a tungsten-containing solution. A bias voltage is applied to the surface <b>16</b> of the preform <b>14</b> via a voltage source <b>400</b> that is electrically connected to the surface <b>16</b> of the preform <b>14</b>. The voltage source <b>400</b> is also connected to an electrode <b>404</b> that is in electrical communication with the surface <b>16</b>, for example via the conducting electroplating solution <b>403</b>. The electrode <b>404</b>, may comprise an inert material or may be at least partially formed from a sputtering material, such as copper. The bias voltage from the voltage source induces the build up of a negative charge on the surface <b>16</b> of preform <b>14</b>. This negative charge reduces dissolved ions and electrolytes in solution containing the sputtering material to their elemental state at the surface <b>16</b> of the preform <b>14</b>, thereby forming the layer <b>12</b> of electroplated sputtering material on the surface <b>16</b>. In other words, the sputtering material is “plated out” on the surface <b>16</b> of the preform <b>14</b>. For example, copper ions from a copper sulfate electrolyte dissolved in solution are reduced to elemental copper at the surface <b>16</b> of the preform <b>14</b> upon application of the bias voltage, thereby “plating out” a layer <b>12</b> of copper on the surface <b>16</b> of the preform <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The shape of the electroplated layer <b>12</b> at least partially conforms to the shape of the underlying surface <b>16</b> of the preform <b>14</b>. For example, for a preform <b>14</b> having a non-planar surface <b>16</b>, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, the electroplated layer <b>12</b> formed on the surface <b>16</b> also comprises a non-planar surface <b>18</b>, and may comprise a complex shape comprising the inverted annular trough <b>8</b> and central cylindrical well <b>7</b>. Thus, the shape of the surface <b>16</b> of the preform <b>14</b> is at least partially transferred to the electroplated layer via the electroplating process. The electroplated layer may be grown on the surface <b>16</b> to a thickness of, for example, from about 0 μm to about 1 μm, such as about 0.5 μm. The thickness of the electroplated layer may even be at least about 0.5 μm, and even at least about 1 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The conditions maintained during the electroplating process, such as the concentration and composition of the electrolytes, the applied bias voltage, the pH of the bath solution and the temperature of the solution may be selected to provide an electroplated layer <b>12</b> having the desired composition and structure. Also, in addition or as an alternative to an aqueous (water-based) electroplating solution, the solution can comprise an organic solvent. In one version of a suitable electroforming process, sputtering material comprising elemental copper is formed on the non-planar surface <b>16</b> of the perform <b>14</b> by immersing the surface <b>16</b> in an aqueous solution comprising from about 150 to about 300 g/L CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O, and even from about 210 to about 214 g/L CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O. The solution further comprises from about 30 g/L to about 100 g/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and even from about 52 g/L to about 75 g/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The electrode <b>404</b> can be formed from wrought phosphorized copper or oxygen free copper (OFC). The temperature of the solution is maintained at from about 15° C. to about 45° C., and even from about 21° C. to about 32° C. A bias voltage is applied at a power level sufficient to provide a current density of from about 0.5 A/dm<sup>2 </sup>(amps per decimeter squared) to about 20 A/dm<sup>2</sup>, and even from about 1 A/dm<sup>2 </sup>to about 10 A/dm<sup>2</sup>. A batch electroforming process can be performed to simultaneously form the electroplated layer <b>12</b> on a number of performs <b>14</b>, such as from about 10 to 20 preforms <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one version, at least a portion of a surface of the preform <b>14</b> may be masked to inhibit the electroplating of the sputtering material onto the surface. Masking of the surface allows for selective plating of the sputtering. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>, a mask <b>17</b> may be provided to at least partially cover the top surface <b>25</b> of the preform <b>14</b> to allow electroplating of the sputtering materials substantially only on the bottom surface <b>16</b> of the preform <b>14</b>. In one version, the surface may be masked by applying a less conductive material, such as a polymer or other dielectric material, to the surface to be masked. The less conductive material inhibits the build-up of charge on the surface <b>25</b>, thereby inhibiting the reduction of sputtering materials in the solution onto the surface <b>25</b> of the preform <b>14</b>. Masking of one or more surface may be particularly desirable in cases where the preform <b>14</b> has a complex shape or non-planar shape in which exposure of the surface to be electroplated may also expose other surfaces of the preform <b>14</b>. The mask <b>17</b> can be subsequently removed after an electroplating step is performed</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Following electroplating of the sputtering material, the surface <b>18</b> of the electroplated layer <b>12</b> can be cleaned in a wet or dry cleaning process. The cleaning process removes particulates and other impurities from the surface <b>18</b> of the electroplated layer <b>12</b>. In one version, the surface <b>18</b> of the electroplated layer is cleaned in a wet cleaning process comprising an acid rinse. In the acid rinse, the surface <b>18</b> is immersed in an aqueous acidic solution such as HCl, to remove particulates from the surface <b>18</b> of the layer <b>12</b>. A de-ionized water rinse can also be performed to remove any particulates loosened from the substrate <b>104</b> during the acid rinse and neutralize any remaining acid. The surface of the electroplated layer <b>12</b> can also be cleaned by an ultrasonic rinse that dislodges any loose particulates from the surface of the layer via ultrasonic vibrations. The surface of the electroplated layer <b>12</b> can further be machined or otherwise polished before or after the cleaning steps to provide a smooth surface <b>18</b> for the sputtering process.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The electroplated layer <b>12</b> of sputtering material provides several advantages. Because the electroplated sputtering material is “grown” from the surface <b>16</b> of the preform <b>14</b>, the layer <b>12</b> of sputtering material has a high uniformity of sputtering material grain size. For example, a layer <b>12</b> having a uniform sputtering material grain size of from about 10 to about 100 μm can be achieved. This high grain size uniformity increases the uniformity of the layers of material sputtered onto the substrate <b>104</b>, and reduces the occurrence of undesirably large grains or “clumps” or sputtering material that could damage or contaminate the substrate <b>104</b>. The electroplated sputtering material grown on the surface <b>16</b> of the preform <b>14</b> forms a strong bond to the preform <b>14</b> and forms a continuous and unitary structure through out the layer <b>12</b>, thus reducing the incidence of pores and voids in the layer <b>12</b> and between the layer <b>12</b> and preform <b>14</b>. A further advantage is that machining of the top surface <b>25</b> of the preform <b>14</b> and bottom surface <b>16</b> of the electroplated layer <b>12</b> is not required to bond the electroplated layer <b>12</b> to the preform <b>14</b>. Yet another advantage of the method of fabricating the target <b>111</b> is that a target <b>111</b> having a complex shape may be manufactured substantially without extensive machining of a costly bulk sputtering material to form a target <b>111</b> having the desired shape, by “growing” the sputtering material on a surface <b>16</b> of a preform <b>14</b> comprising a complex shape that is at least partially transferred to the overlying conformal electroplated layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one version, at least a portion of the preform <b>14</b> is removed following formation of the electroplated layer <b>12</b>. The preform <b>14</b> is desirably at least partially removed to expose a portion of a top surface <b>22</b> of the electroplated layer <b>12</b>. In one version, the preform <b>14</b> is even substantially entirely removed from the electroplated layer <b>12</b> to expose substantially the entire top surface <b>22</b> of the electroplated layer <b>12</b>, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>. Desirably, the portion of the preform <b>14</b> is removed by a method that allows for removal of at least a portion of the preform <b>14</b> substantially without damaging the electroplated layer <b>12</b>. The preform <b>14</b> can be at least partially removed by, for example, machining away portions of the preform <b>14</b> from the electroplated layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A subsequent electroplating process can be performed to electroplate one or more additional layers <b>20</b><i>a,b </i>of sputtering material onto the original or first layer <b>12</b>, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>d</i>. The subsequent electroplating process allows for the formation of an electroplated target <b>111</b><i>a </i>comprising a desired thickness of sputtering material. The additional layers <b>20</b><i>a,b </i>of sputtering material are electroplated on at least one of the top surface <b>22</b> and the bottom surface <b>18</b> of the first electroplated layer <b>12</b>. The sputtering material can be electroplated on the top surface <b>22</b> of the first layer <b>12</b> and on portions of the bottom surface <b>18</b> of the first layer <b>12</b> that have been exposed by removal of the preform <b>14</b> from the layer <b>12</b>. In one version, a portion of the top or bottom surface can be masked to selectively electroplate material substantially on only one of the surfaces. In another version, both the top and bottom surfaces <b>22</b>,<b>18</b> of the first layer <b>12</b> are electroplated, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>d</i>. The subsequent electroplated layers <b>20</b><i>a,b </i>are “grown” out of the first electroplated layer <b>12</b> via the electroplating process, and thus the first electroplated layer <b>12</b> and subsequent electroplated layers <b>20</b><i>a,b </i>form a unitary and continuous structure that is absent a discrete and sharp crystalline boundary therebetween, as schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>d </i>with a dotted line. Accordingly, the electroplated layers <b>12</b>, <b>20</b><i>a,b </i>form a strongly bonded and continuous target structure <b>113</b> having enhanced properties, such as improved grain size uniformity and fewer pores or voids.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The subsequent layers <b>20</b><i>a,b </i>may be electroplated at varying rates along the surface of the first layer <b>12</b> having the non-planar surfaces <b>18</b>,<b>22</b> and complex shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>b </i>through <b>2</b><i>d</i>. The layers <b>20</b><i>a,b </i>are electroplated at a faster rate on the “open” regions of surfaces <b>18</b>,<b>22</b> of the non-planar layer <b>12</b>, such as on bottom surface <b>18</b> of the bottom wall <b>9</b> of the cylindrical well <b>7</b> and on the top surface <b>22</b> of the upper walls <b>5</b> of the inverted annular trough <b>8</b>, where the open shape of the first electroplated layer <b>12</b> allows better access of reactive ions and electrolytes in the electroplating solution to the surfaces <b>18</b>,<b>22</b> of the layer <b>12</b>. Portions of the first non-planar layer <b>12</b> such as the bottom surface <b>18</b> of the top wall <b>5</b> and top surface <b>22</b> of the bottom wall <b>9</b> grow the electroplated layer at a slower rate due to the proximity of inner and outer sidewalls <b>6</b>,<b>4</b> surrounding these regions that at least partially restrict the flow and access of reactive ions and electrolytes to these surfaces. Because of this electroplating rate distribution, the growth of the subsequent electroplated layers <b>20</b><i>a</i><b>20</b><i>b </i>forms inner and outer target structure sidewalls <b>6</b>,<b>4</b> that are more perpendicular to the surface <b>105</b> of the substrate <b>104</b> and bottom and top walls <b>9</b>,<b>5</b> of the target than the original target preform sidewalls <b>6</b>,<b>4</b>, thereby providing the desired target shape, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>d </i>and <b>1</b><i>a </i>through <b>1</b><i>b</i>. The electroplating process may be performed to grow a layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>of sputtering material on the top surface <b>22</b> of the first layer <b>12</b> comprising a thickness of from about 0.1 μm to about 1 μm, such as about 0.5 μm, and may even be at least about 0.5 μm, and even at least about 1 μm. A layer <b>20</b><i>a </i>of sputtering material may be grown on the bottom surface <b>18</b> of the first electroplated layer <b>12</b> via the electroplating process to a thickness of from about 0.1 μm to about 1 μm, such as about 0.5 μm, and may even be at least about 0.5 μm, and even at least about 1 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The subsequent layers <b>20</b><i>a,b </i>may be applied in an electroforming process comprising the same process conditions, such as electrolyte concentration, bias voltage, pH and temperature, as in the first electroforming process to electroplate the first layer <b>12</b>, or may comprise different process conditions. A suitable duration of the electroforming process to form the electroformed layer may be from about 12.5 to about 25 hours. Following the electroplating process, the target <b>111</b> comprising the multiple layers <b>12</b>, <b>20</b><i>a,b </i>of sputtering material may be further machined to provide the desired target dimensions and to provide a smooth target surface <b>24</b> and may also be cleaned to remove particulates from the surface <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The above described method provides a target <b>111</b> comprising one or more electroplated layers <b>12</b>, <b>20</b><i>a,b </i>having improved properties in the processing of substrates. The method is suited for the formation of targets <b>111</b> having planar or non-planar surfaces <b>24</b> and may even be performed to fabricate targets having complex convoluted shapes, such as the target <b>111</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a,b </i>and <b>2</b><i>d</i>. Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with regard to certain preferred versions thereof, other versions are possible. For example, the present invention could be used to form targets having other shapes than those specifically mentioned, and could be used to form targets comprising other sputtering materials besides those mentioned. The process chamber <b>106</b> may also comprise other equivalent configurations as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred versions contained herein.</p>
