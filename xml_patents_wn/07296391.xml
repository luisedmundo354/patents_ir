<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to an apparatus for allowing hands-free packaging and sealing of objects, including diapers, food, materials, and waste, by enveloping the object in material and thereafter sealing the material-enveloped object to form a sealed pouch. The sealed pouch can be stored within the apparatus until otherwise discarded or can pass through the apparatus for deposit into an external area or container.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">STATEMENT AS TO RIGHT TO INVENTIONS MADE UNDER FEDERAL SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">None</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Our population is constantly exposed to health risks. People can spread and contract serious illnesses by merely failing to wash their hands after touching seemingly innocuous items such as grocery goods, and they can develop life threatening diseases by picking up and handling improperly disposed waste. Moreover, viruses that were once thought to be confined to animals are infecting humans who come in contact with the sick animal or its waste. Public concern over sanitation is accordingly escalating and people are regularly adopting more stringent sanitary practices. This is especially true when they are disposing medical waste or even a child's diapers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A growing market exists for disposing of various types of refuse, including diapers. Just a few diaper disposal products on the market include the Diaper Genie®, Diaper Dekor®, Diaper Champ®. In general, these products look like a waste basket and are configured to use refillable plastic cartridges or plastic bags that envelope and seal the diaper to prevent odor and the spread of germs. Not infrequently, however, the disposed diaper will puncture the bag or the cartridge fails to properly enclose seal the diaper. Moreover, they require regular replacement of the cartridges or bags.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosed apparatus provides a convenient, sanitary and odor-less way to dispose of refuse, including diapers. Unlike known art, the disclosed apparatus integrate rolls of sanitary pouch material that envelopes and seals the enclosed waste, ensuring no germs or odors leak, and which need only infrequent replacement. The apparatus can have a housing unit, material rollers for dispensing collection material, a movement mechanism actuated via an actuation device for moving formation rollers which in turn facilitate the collection and enveloping of the object in the collection material to form a sealed pouch. At least one cutting unit for severing the sealed pouch can also be employed.</p>

Each storage area <b>22</b> can have a corresponding access opening and door <b>24</b> and each door <b>24</b> can have a grasping device <b>26</b>. These storage areas <b>22</b> can be used to store used sealed collection pouches <b>18</b> or spare rolls of collection pouch material <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The housing unit <b>2</b> can have a chute <b>26</b> in lieu of or in addition to one or more storage areas <b>22</b> to allow the sealed pouch <b>18</b> to pass through the housing unit <b>2</b> into the container. If a chute <b>26</b> is employed, at least one door can be configured at the bottom of the housing unit <b>2</b> (where the chute <b>26</b> terminates) to permit passage of the sealed pouch into the container. The door can employ a locking device.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">One or more material shaft rollers <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> facilitate the dispensing of the replaceable collection pouch material <b>20</b> and can be further configured to dispense the material <b>20</b> selectively, e.g., only once a certain tension point is created. If at least two shaft rollers <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> are employed, they can be positioned on the opposite upper sides of the housing unit <b>2</b> or at other various positions.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The collection pouch material <b>20</b>, generally shaped like a continuous strip of tape or film, can be made solely of or a combination of paper, plastic, fabric or some other similar material or substance and is designed to envelope the object or waste to be collected and form a sealed pouch <b>18</b>. The pouch material <b>20</b> can be wound on cardboard cylinders, much like athletic or packing tape, which are designed to rotatably ride on the material shaft rollers <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. Configuring the material on such cylinders allows a user to replace the rolls of pouch material as needed. The side of the collection pouch material <b>20</b> facing towards the opening <b>16</b> can be coated completely or in part with an adhesive substance. The adhesive substance not only assists in grasping the product/waste, but also provides the necessary adhesion for sealing the pouch, and permits the material <b>20</b> to be continuously fed even after the pouch is formed and severed, as is further discussed below. Alternatively, the pouch material <b>20</b> may be designed to have corresponding ridges that interlock and seal the pouch <b>8</b>. Other configurations of the pouch material <b>20</b> may also be employed to accomplish the foregoing.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A primary and secondary formation roller <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>, respectively, assist in forming the sealed pouch <b>18</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> can be cylindrical in shape. Although the primary formation roller <b>6</b> is depicted as being of equal size to the secondary formation roller <b>6</b>, the size, shape and dimensions of the rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> can vary. The opposite ends <b>46</b> of the rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> can have engagement mechanisms <b>48</b>, such as grooves, serrations or teeth, like a gear, to permit the rollers to engage one another, as well as the movement mechanism <b>12</b>. The cylindrical face of either or both rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> has one or more cavities <b>40</b> for allowing waste, enveloped by the collecting pouch material <b>20</b>, to pass in between them. A formation bridge or bridges <b>42</b> can be used to press the material together as the enveloped waste passes through the cavities <b>40</b>. Formation bridges <b>42</b> can run along or near the top, bottom and sides of the cavities <b>40</b>. As the rollers <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> rotate in their respective opposite directions, as shown by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, their respective formation bridges <b>42</b> align so that when the enveloped waste passes through the cavity <b>40</b>, the formation bridges <b>42</b> press the pouch material <b>20</b> together, causing anterior, posterior and side seals along the pouch. The number of rotations the rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> make in order to align the formation bridges <b>42</b> will depend on their size and shape. For example, if the primary formation roller <b>6</b> is larger than the secondary rollers <b>6</b>, then the secondary roller <b>8</b> may rotate twice to every one rotation of the primary roller <b>6</b>. Alternatively, if the rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> are of equal size, then the rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> may only be required to each rotate once to align the formation bridges <b>42</b>. Other variations of this rotation process may also be employed and the number of formation bridges <b>42</b> may also vary depending on the sizes of the formation rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>. A locking mechanism (not shown) can also be employed on either or both of the formation rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> to limit them to move only in one direction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Formation of the sealed pouch <b>18</b> may also be accomplished by employing only one formation roller <b>6</b> or <b>8</b>. For example, a plate or scoop <b>50</b> (not shown) can be positioned opposite to and compliment the sole formation roller <b>6</b> or <b>8</b> to allow the enveloped object to pass in between them while forming the sealed pouch <b>18</b>. The plate or scoop <b>50</b> can extend beyond the bottom of the housing to facilitate a dust-shovel/broom type action. Further still, more than two formation rollers can be employed to form the sealed pouch.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The apparatus can also employ grasping mechanisms for grasping and enveloping the object, such as flaps or brushes <b>44</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the brushes <b>44</b> can be attached to the rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>. Alternatively, however, the brushes <b>44</b> can be employed on separate rollers or devices (not shown) that engage the formation rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> or movement mechanism <b>12</b> and facilitate grasping and enveloping motion of the brushes <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The cutting unit <b>10</b> is designed to sever the sealed pouch. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the cutting unit can be a blade that runs parallel to the bottom formation bridge <b>42</b> of the major formation roller <b>6</b>. Accordingly, when the corresponding bottom formation bridges <b>42</b> of the rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> form the posterior and final seal of the collection pouch <b>18</b>, the cutting unit <b>10</b> severs the pouch <b>18</b> as the formation rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> continue to rotate. Although the cutting unit <b>10</b> can be employed on either formation roller <b>6</b> or <b>8</b>, it can also be a separate unit attached to the housing unit <b>2</b> and positioned to sever the sealed collection pouch <b>18</b> after it passes through the formation rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>. Still further, a cutting unit could be movably attached to the housing by a string, chain or similar device, which would permit the user to manually cut the pouches off as necessary. Obviously, more than one or different variations of the cutting unit <b>10</b> can be employed to sever of the pouch. The pouches may be allowed to continue as a string of pouches until all of them are cut off at once.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An actuation device, such as a common motor <b>14</b>, and a movement mechanism, such as a main gear <b>12</b>, can drive formation rollers <b>8</b> and <b>10</b>. The common motor <b>14</b> engages and drives a main gear <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> illustrate how these components of the apparatus assist in the packaging and sealing cycle, i.e., packaging and sealing the object and forming and storing the sealed pouch <b>18</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the apparatus in its inactive, starting position. While in this starting position, the apparatus is ready to collect the object, and the material <b>20</b> is held taught between the roller shafts <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> and the bottom formation bridges <b>42</b> of the rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>. A user positions the desired object in the opening <b>16</b> of the housing unit <b>2</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. When the user activates the motor via the on “On/Off” switch <b>12</b> to the “On” position, the main gear <b>12</b> turns clockwise, engaging and driving the major formation roller <b>6</b> causing it to turn in a counterclockwise direction, which in turn engages the minor formation roller <b>8</b> causing it to turn in the opposite, clockwise direction. As the rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> rotate in opposite directions, they envelope the object. If brushes <b>44</b> are employed on the rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>, the brushes <b>44</b> move in an outward-inward circular converging sweeping and grasping motion. When the brushes <b>44</b> contact the interior side of the pouch material <b>20</b>, the sweeping and grasping motion cause the collection material <b>20</b> to envelope the waste as the brushes <b>44</b> converge. The object is then enveloped by the material, sealed and moved through and severed by the formation rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>. The motor may be also maintained in an “automatic-on” state, whereby it automatically activates when an object is positioned in the opening <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As the movement mechanism <b>16</b> continues to rotate, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the formation rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> continue to rotate and envelope the object between the rollers cavities <b>40</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). When the rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> rotate to where the bottom formation bridges <b>42</b> of the roller cavities <b>40</b> engage, the anterior seal of the pouch is formed. As the roller <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> continue to rotate, and the side formation bridges <b>42</b> engage, the sides of the pouch are sealed. Finally, when the bottom formation bridges <b>42</b> engage as the formation rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> continue to rotate, the posterior seal of the pouch is formed and thereafter severed by the cutting unit <b>10</b>. Brushes <b>44</b> may be employed to assist in moving the enveloped object through the sealing and severing process.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">After the sealed pouch <b>18</b> is severed, it passes through the chute <b>26</b> into the extraneous container or into the one or more storage compartments <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the sealed pouch <b>18</b> may slide along or within a guide mechanism, such as a top and/or bottom tongue or lip (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) that terminates at the opening of the one or more storage compartments <b>22</b>, where the pouch is deposited until removed. The guidance mechanism may be designed at a downwardly sloping angle to facilitate movement of the sealed pouch <b>8</b> into the one or more storage compartments <b>22</b>. Still further, the movement mechanism <b>16</b> may also drive guidance mechanisms, such as guidance rollers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) that are configured in the same fashion as the formation rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> and which, in lieu of or in addition to the chute <b>18</b>, actively moves the sealed pouch <b>8</b> into the one or more storage compartments <b>22</b> or the extraneous container.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Even though the sealed pouch <b>18</b> has been severed, the adhesive sides of the pouch material <b>20</b> have been pressed together during the pouch formation process, forming a tab-like configuration <b>32</b> in the material <b>20</b>, allowing it to retain a continuous strip form. The tab-like configuration <b>32</b> is formed when the portion of the pouch material <b>20</b> just behind the severed pouch <b>18</b> is sealed together by the formation bridges <b>42</b> of the rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>. Accordingly, when the motor deactivates either automatically or by turning the “On/Off” switch <b>12</b> to the “Off” position, and the apparatus returns to its open position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the tab-like configuration <b>32</b> remains pinched between the bottom formation bridges <b>42</b> of the rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>, keeping the pouch material <b>20</b> taught and readying the apparatus for its next collection cycle. When a user loads new material pouch cartridges, he can manually create the tab-like configuration and feed it into the formation rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> to ready the apparatus, or he can run the apparatus through a collection cycle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>. There are of course other various ways to ready the apparatus after first loading the pouch material cartridges. Moreover, the tab-like configuration <b>32</b> can be formed by interlocking ridges or other similar mechanisms in the pouch material <b>20</b>, and the pinching action described can be accomplished by employing only one formation roller <b>6</b> or <b>8</b> and a complimenting scoop or plate <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Another implementation of the apparatus is contemplated as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this implementation, the movement mechanism is an actuator rod <b>52</b>. The rod <b>52</b> can have teeth, grooves or serrations <b>56</b> to engage and drive the one or more formation rollers <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> in same fashion as the motor <b>14</b> and main gear <b>12</b> of the previous embodiment. For example, the actuator rod can have biasing means, such as a spring <b>100</b>, allowing the user to depress the rod <b>52</b> by way of a lever or button <b>102</b> until the packaging and sealing cycle is complete, at which time the button <b>102</b> is released and the rod retracts and the apparatus returns to its open, in active position. Similarly, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the door hinge of the apparatus can act as the actuator rod to either drive the rollers or to provide spring action that stores the power as the door is closing and then releases the power once the door is fully closed.</p>
