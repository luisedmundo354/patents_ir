<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention provides an increased degree of uniformity of radiation dose distribution for the interior of a diseased part. A particle beam therapy system includes a charged particle beam generation apparatus and an irradiation apparatus. An ion beam is generated by the charged particle beam generation apparatus. The irradiation apparatus exposes a diseased part to the generated ion beam. A scattering device, a range adjustment device, and a Bragg peak spreading device are installed upstream of a first scanning magnet and a second scanning magnet. The scattering device and the range adjustment device are combined together and moved along a beam axis, whereas the Bragg peak spreading device is moved independently along the beam axis. The scattering device moves to adjust the degree of ion beam scattering. The range adjustment device moves to adjust ion beam scatter changes caused by an absorber thickness adjustment. The Bragg peak spreading device moves to adjust ion beam scatter changes arising out of an SOBP device. These adjustments provide uniformity of radiation dose distribution for the diseased part.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a particle beam irradiation system, and more particularly to a particle beam irradiation system for use as a particle beam therapy system for exposing a diseased part to a proton, carbon, or other charged particle beam for therapy purposes, a material irradiation system for exposing a material to a charged particle beam, a food irradiation system for exposing food to a charged particle beam, or a radioisotope production system based on a charged particle beam.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional particle beam therapy system comprises a charged particle beam generation apparatus, a beam transport, and a rotary irradiation device. The charged particle beam generation apparatus includes a synchrotron (cyclotron) as an accelerator. After being accelerated to a predefined energy, a charged particle beam (hereinafter referred to as an ion beam) travels to the irradiation device via the beam transport (hereinafter referred to as the first beam transport). The rotary irradiation device includes an irradiation device beam transport (hereinafter referred to as the second beam transport), an irradiation apparatus, and a rotating device (rotary gantry) for rotating the second beam transport and irradiation apparatus as an assembly. The ion beam passes through the second beam transport and then falls on a cancerous part of a patient via the irradiation apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The irradiation apparatus shapes and emits an ion beam, which is generated by the charged particle beam generation apparatus, in accordance with the shape of a diseased part targeted for irradiation. Roughly speaking, the irradiation apparatus can be divided into three types. The first type is an irradiation apparatus based on a scatterer method. The second type is an irradiation apparatus based on a wobbling method (JP-A No. 211292/1998 and JP-A No. 202047/2000). The third type is an irradiation apparatus based on a scanning method (JP-A No. 199700/1998).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the interior of a patient's body is to be irradiated with an ion beam emitted from the irradiation apparatus, it is desirable that the radiation dose distribution be uniform in the direction of ion beam propagation (the direction of the depth within the patient's body) and in the direction perpendicular to the direction of ion beam propagation. Such uniformity of radiation dose distribution is especially important within a cancerous area. This uniformity is desired no matter which one of the above-mentioned three types of irradiation apparatuses is used for ion beam irradiation. In a particle beam therapy system containing the aforementioned conventional irradiation apparatus, however, it has been difficult to maintain a high degree of radiation dose distribution uniformity in the direction of the depth while keeping a high radiation dose level particularly for a bulky diseased part (region targeted for irradiation).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a particle beam irradiation system that is capable of increasing the uniformity of radiation dose distribution in the direction of the depth of a diseased part.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve the above object, the present invention provides an irradiation apparatus in which at least either a scattering device or a Bragg peak spreading device is mounted in such a manner that the device is movable in the direction of charged particle beam propagation. Since at least either the scattering device or Bragg peak spreading device can move in the direction of charged particle beam propagation, it is possible to increase the uniformity of radiation dose distribution for the irradiation target that is exposed to a charged particle beam.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, at least one of a scattering device, a range adjustment device, and a Bragg peak spreading device is mounted in the irradiation apparatus in such a manner that the device is movable in the direction of charged particle beam propagation. Since at least either one of the scattering device, range adjustment device, and Bragg peak spreading device can move in the direction of charged particle beam propagation, it is possible to increase the uniformity of radiation dose distribution for the irradiation target that is exposed to a charged particle beam.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A particle beam therapy system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The particle beam therapy system <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment comprises a charged particle beam generation apparatus <b>2</b> and an irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>. The charged particle beam generation apparatus <b>2</b> includes an ion source (not shown), a preaccelerator <b>3</b>, and a synchrotron <b>4</b>. Ions generated by the ion source (e.g., proton ions or carbon ions) are accelerated by the preaccelerator <b>3</b> (e.g., linear accelerator). An ion beam emitted from the preaccelerator <b>3</b> enters the synchrotron <b>4</b>. In the synchrotron <b>4</b>, the ion beam is energized and accelerated by high-frequency power, which is applied by a high-frequency acceleration cavity <b>5</b>. After the energy of the ion beam circulating within the synchrotron <b>4</b> is raised to a preselected level, an outgoing high-frequency application device <b>6</b> applies a high frequency to the ion beam. Upon high-frequency application to the ion beam, which is circulating within a stability limit, the ion beam exceeds the stability limit and comes out of the synchrotron <b>4</b> via an outgoing deflector <b>13</b>. When the ion beam is emitted, the electrical current induced by a four-pole magnet <b>7</b>, a polarized magnet <b>8</b>, and other magnets provided for the synchrotron <b>4</b> is maintained at a setting and the stability limit is maintained substantially constant. The ion beam emission from the synchrotron <b>4</b> stops at the end of high-frequency power application to the high-frequency application device <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The ion beam emitted from the synchrotron <b>4</b> travels through a beam transport <b>9</b> to the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>, which is an irradiation nozzle apparatus. An inverted U-shaped section <b>10</b>, which is part of the beam transport <b>9</b>, and the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b> are mounted in a rotary gantry (not shown). The inverted U-shaped section <b>10</b> includes polarized magnets <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>. The ion beam comes out of the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b> and falls on a diseased part <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of a patient <b>61</b> who is on a patient couch (bed) <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The configuration of the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b> according to the present embodiment will now be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The irradiation apparatus <b>15</b> is based on the wobbling method. The irradiation apparatus <b>15</b> has a casing <b>16</b>, which is mounted on the inverted U-shaped section <b>10</b>. From upstream to downstream of ion beam propagation, the components housed in the casing <b>16</b> are a first scanning magnet <b>17</b>, a second scanning magnet <b>18</b>, a scattering device <b>19</b>, a range adjustment device <b>20</b>, and a Bragg peak spreading device (hereinafter referred to as an SOBP device) <b>21</b>. The first scanning magnet <b>17</b> and the second scanning magnet <b>18</b> are positioned upstream of the scattering device <b>19</b> and mounted on the casing <b>16</b>. The scattering device <b>19</b> and the range adjustment device <b>20</b> are integral with each other and mounted on a support member <b>24</b> having a through-hole <b>37</b>. The support member <b>24</b> meshes with ball screws <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, which travel through two threaded holes. The upper ends of the ball screws <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> are attached to the casing <b>16</b> in a rotatable manner. The lower ends of the ball screws <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> are coupled to the rotating shafts of AC servomotors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, which are mounted on the casing <b>16</b>. An encoder <b>29</b> is coupled to the rotating shaft of the AC servomotor <b>25</b>. An alternative configuration may be employed so as to use either the AC servomotor <b>25</b> or the AC servomotor <b>26</b>. Further, stepper motors may be used in place of the AC servomotors. The SOBP device <b>21</b> comprises a plurality of wedge shaped members, which are extended toward the range adjustment device <b>20</b>. Strictly speaking, both sides of the wedge-shaped members are shaped like a staircase. A rotary wheel type SOBP filter may be used as the SOBP device. The SOBP device <b>21</b> is mounted on a support member <b>30</b>, which includes a threaded hole meshing with a ball screw <b>32</b> and a through-hole <b>38</b>. The upper end of the ball screw <b>32</b> is attached to the casing <b>16</b> in a rotatable manner. The lower end of the ball screw <b>32</b> is coupled to an AC servomotor <b>31</b>, which is mounted on the casing <b>16</b>. An encoder <b>33</b> is coupled to the rotating shaft of the AC servomotor <b>31</b>. The support member <b>30</b> is mounted, in a movable manner, on a linear guide <b>34</b>, which is installed in the casing <b>16</b>. The casing <b>16</b> includes a bolus retainer <b>35</b>. A linear actuator is composed by a combination of the AC servomotor <b>25</b> and the ball screw <b>27</b>, by a combination of the AC servomotor <b>26</b> and the ball screw <b>28</b>, and by a combination of the AC servomotor <b>31</b> and the ball screw <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The configuration of the scattering device <b>19</b> will now be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The scattering device <b>19</b> includes a plurality of scattering device controllers <b>40</b>, each of which has a compressed-air cylinder <b>41</b> and a piston rod <b>42</b> that is coupled to a piston (not shown) installed within the compressed-air cylinder <b>41</b>. The scattering device controllers <b>40</b> are mounted on a support frame <b>39</b>. The scattering device <b>19</b> includes scatterers <b>43</b>A to <b>43</b>F, which vary in thickness in the direction of ion beam propagation (the direction of a beam axis <b>14</b>). These scatterers are mounted on the respective scattering device controllers <b>40</b> (one scatterer on each scattering device controller). Scatterers <b>43</b>A to <b>43</b>F comprise tungsten, which minimizes the loss of ion beam energy in relation to the amount of ion beam scattering. The scatterers may alternatively be made of a material that contains lead or other substance having a high atomic number in addition to tungsten. Compressed-air pipes <b>49</b>, which each have a solenoid valve <b>50</b>, are connected to the respective compressed-air cylinders <b>41</b> of the scattering device controllers <b>40</b>. Each compressed-air pipe <b>49</b> is connected to a compressed-air supply device (not shown). The support frame <b>39</b> is mounted on the top of a support frame <b>44</b> of the range adjustment device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the range adjustment device <b>20</b> includes a plurality of absorber controllers <b>45</b>, each of which has a compressed-air cylinder <b>46</b> and a piston rod <b>47</b> that is coupled to a piston (not shown) installed within the compressed-air cylinder <b>46</b>. These absorber controllers <b>45</b> are mounted on the support frame <b>44</b>. The range adjustment device <b>20</b> includes absorbers <b>48</b>A to <b>48</b>F, which vary in thickness in the direction of the beam axis <b>14</b>. These absorbers are mounted on the respective absorber controllers <b>45</b> (one absorber on each absorber controller). Each absorber comprises resin that contains hydrocarbon or other substance having a low atomic number. Compressed-air pipes <b>51</b>, which each have a solenoid valve <b>52</b>, are connected to the respective compressed-air cylinders <b>46</b> of the absorber controllers <b>45</b>. Each compressed-air pipe <b>51</b> is connected to a compressed-air supply device (not shown). The support frame <b>44</b> is mounted on the top of the support member <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A limit switch is provided for each of the scattering device controllers <b>40</b> of the scattering device <b>19</b> and the absorber controllers <b>45</b> of the range adjustment device <b>20</b>. The limit switches for the scattering device controllers <b>40</b> detect an associated scatterer when it reaches a predefined position for ion beam passage. The limit switches for the absorber controllers <b>45</b> detect an associated absorber when it reaches a predefined position. The above scattering device and range adjustment device may alternatively be such that two opposing sphenoid plates are included and continuously repositioned so as to vary the thickness of their overlap.</p>

A memory <b>55</b> in the irradiation controller <b>54</b> stores irradiation condition information, which is shown in Table 1. The items of the irradiation condition information are the length of a diseased part <b>62</b> in a direction perpendicular to the beam axis <b>14</b> (irradiation field size), the location of the diseased part <b>62</b> in the direction of the depth (range), the energy incident on the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b> (incident Eg), the thickness of the scatterer (scatterer thickness), the thickness of the absorber (absorber thickness), the position of the scattering device <b>19</b>/range adjustment device <b>20</b> (SC+RS position), the exciting current of the first scanning magnet <b>17</b> (Wbl<b>1</b>), and the exciting current of the second scanning magnet <b>18</b> (Wbl<b>2</b>).

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A plurality of SOBP devices <b>21</b> are prepared as denoted by E150S010, E150S020, etc. in Table 2. E150S010, E150S020, and other similar entries in the table are the numbers of the SOBP devices (SOBP No.). These SOBP devices <b>21</b> differ, for instance, in sphenoid member height and staircase section width and height. The SOBP devices <b>21</b> are selectively mounted beforehand on the support member <b>30</b> in accordance with the energy incident on the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b> and the SOBP width. The SOBP width is determined according to the length of a diseased part in the direction of ion beam propagation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Prior to positioning a patient <b>61</b> in relation to the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>, the irradiation controller <b>54</b> receives the therapy plan information (irradiation field size (irradiation field information), range (range information), incident energy (beam energy information), etc.) about the patient <b>61</b> from the therapy plan device <b>53</b> and stores it in the memory <b>55</b>. The irradiation controller <b>54</b> selects a scatterer thickness and absorber thickness as needed from the irradiation condition information in accordance with the therapy plan information. The greater the ion beam incident energy, the greater the selected scatterer thickness. The shorter the requested range, the greater the selected absorber thickness. Further, the irradiation controller <b>54</b> selects an “SC+RS position” in accordance with the selected thickness information (range information) about a scatterer and absorber. The irradiation controller <b>54</b> outputs the selected thickness information about a scatterer and absorber as well as a drive instruction signal to the drive controller <b>56</b>. In accordance with the scatterer thickness information, the drive controller <b>56</b> selects one or more scatterers from the scatterers in the scattering device <b>19</b>. If, for instance, the total thickness of the scatterers <b>43</b>B and <b>43</b>C agrees with the scatterer thickness information, the drive controller <b>56</b> selects the scatterers <b>43</b>B and <b>43</b>C. The drive controller <b>56</b> opens the solenoid valves <b>50</b> on the compressed-air pipes <b>49</b> connected to the scattering device controllers <b>40</b> that respectively operate scatterers <b>43</b>B and <b>43</b>C. Compressed air is then supplied to the cylinders <b>41</b> of the associated scattering device controllers <b>40</b> so that the piston rods <b>42</b> move to push the scatterers <b>43</b>B and <b>43</b>C to the above-mentioned selected position. The remaining scatterers are positioned at a location away from the position of ion beam passage. Further, the drive controller <b>56</b> selects one or more absorbers from the absorbers in the range adjustment device <b>20</b> in such a manner that the resulting total absorber thickness agrees with the information about the selected absorber thickness. If, for instance, the thickness of the absorber <b>48</b>E agrees with the absorber thickness information, the drive controller <b>56</b> selects the absorber <b>48</b>E. The drive controller <b>56</b> opens the solenoid valve <b>52</b> on the compressed-air pipe <b>51</b> connected to the absorber controller <b>45</b> that operates the absorber <b>48</b>E. Compressed air is then supplied to the cylinder <b>41</b> of the associated absorber controller <b>45</b> so that the piston rod <b>47</b> moves to push the absorber <b>48</b>E to the above-mentioned selected position. The remaining absorbers are positioned at a location away from the position of ion beam passage. When the associated scatterers and absorber reach the selected positions, the associated limit switches actuate to generate position signals and convey them to drive the controller <b>56</b>. The drive controller then outputs scatterer/absorber relocation completion information to the irradiation controller <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The irradiation controller <b>54</b> outputs the “SC+RS position” information, that is, the first position information, as well as a drive instruction signal to the drive controller <b>57</b>. In accordance with the first position information, the drive controller <b>57</b> rotates the AC servomotors <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> in order to move the support member <b>24</b> to a specified position. Consequently, the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> move to positions that correspond to the first position information. The detection signal of the encoder <b>29</b> notifies the drive controller <b>57</b> that the support member <b>24</b> has reached the specified position. The irradiation controller <b>54</b> does not output a drive instruction signal to drive the controller <b>58</b> because the required SOBP width is 10 mm. For treatment of a patient <b>61</b> who requires an SOBP width of 30 mm, the irradiation controller <b>54</b> outputs the positional information about the SOBP devices <b>21</b>, that is, the second position information, as well as a drive instruction signal to the drive controller <b>58</b>. In accordance with the second position information, the drive controller <b>58</b> rotates the AC servomotor <b>31</b> in order to move the support member <b>30</b> to a specified position. The SOBP devices <b>21</b> move to positions that correspond to the second position information. The detection signal of the encoder <b>33</b> notifies the drive controller <b>57</b> that the support member <b>30</b> has reached the specified position.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The irradiation controller <b>54</b> acquires the information about the irradiation field size and incident energy for the patient <b>61</b> from the memory <b>55</b> and uses the acquired information to select the respective exciting currents for the first scanning magnet <b>17</b> and second scanning magnet <b>18</b> from the aforementioned irradiation condition information. The selected information about the respective exciting currents (e.g., the information about the respective exciting currents for the scanning magnets shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>) is conveyed to the scanning magnet controller <b>36</b>. In accordance with the information about the respective exciting currents, the scanning magnet controller <b>36</b> controls the respective exciting currents to be supplied to the first scanning magnet <b>17</b> and second scanning magnet <b>18</b> for the purpose of rotating the ion beam in such a manner as to draw a circle in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis <b>14</b>. The resulting circle is called a wobbling circle. More specifically, the first scanning magnet <b>17</b> conducts a scan to move the ion beam in the X-direction within the above circle, and then the second scanning magnet <b>18</b> conducts a scan to move the ion beam in the direction of the Y-axis, which is perpendicular to the X-axis, within the above circle. Thanks to such a coordinated ion beam scanning operation performed by the first scanning magnet <b>17</b> and second scanning magnet <b>18</b>, the ion beam moves in a circular manner in the above plane. This ion beam scan is conducted when the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b> emits an ion beam. The size of the wobbling circle is determined in accordance with the dimension of a diseased part <b>62</b> in a direction perpendicular to the direction of ion beam propagation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Ion beam adjustments and other pretreatment preparations are made after the selected scatterers and absorber are set at the ion beam passage positions with the scattering device <b>19</b>, range adjustment device <b>20</b>, and SOBP devices <b>21</b> moved to the specified positions. Further, a bolus <b>22</b> for the patient <b>61</b> is set in the bolus retainer <b>35</b> with a collimator <b>23</b> set in a casing <b>16</b> below the bolus retainer <b>35</b>. After these preparations are completely made, the patient couch <b>59</b> is moved until the diseased part <b>62</b> of the patient <b>61</b> aligns with the beam axis <b>14</b> of the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>. Upon completion of alignment, a treatment starts. The operator enters a treatment start signal via an operating console (not shown). Upon receipt of the treatment start signal, an accelerator controller (not shown) operates so that the synchrotron <b>4</b> emits an ion beam. As described earlier, the ion beam reaches the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>. In accordance with the above-mentioned entered treatment start signal, the irradiation controller <b>54</b> outputs an ion beam scan start signal and the aforementioned information about exciting currents to the scanning magnet controller <b>36</b>. The scanning magnet controller <b>36</b> controls the exciting currents to scan the ion beam as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The scanned ion beam passes through the scatterers <b>43</b>B and <b>43</b>C. Being scattered by the scatterers, the ion beam spreads in a conical pattern in relation to the direction of ion beam propagation. The ion beam then passes through the absorber <b>48</b>E. The absorber reduces the ion beam energy to adjust the in vivo range of the ion beam. Further, the ion beam passes through the SOBP devices <b>21</b>. The sphenoid members of the SOBP devices <b>21</b> vary in thickness in the direction of ion beam propagation. Due to the portions that vary in thickness, the degree of energy attenuation in the ion beam, which is spread by the scatterers and scanned by the scanning magnets, varies with the SOBP device portion through which the ion beam passes. After passage through the SOBP devices <b>21</b>, the resulting ion-beams, which now differ from each other in energy, respectively form Bragg peaks at various in vivo locations. This results in an increased uniformity of radiation dose distribution in the direction of the beam axis <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">After passage through the SOBP devices <b>21</b>, the ion beams pass through the bolus <b>22</b>. The bolus adjusts the ranges of the ion beams in accordance with the shape of the diseased part <b>62</b> in the direction of ion beam propagation. The collimator <b>23</b> eliminates ion beams that are positioned, after passage through the bolus <b>22</b>, outside the projection of the diseased part <b>62</b> in the direction of the beam axis <b>14</b>. In other words, the collimator <b>23</b> allows ion beams positioned inside the projection to pass therethrough. The diseased part <b>62</b> is exposed to ion beams that pass through the collimator <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the present embodiment, the size of the wobbling circle located downstream of the diseased part <b>62</b> in the direction of ion beam propagation (irradiation target downstream wobbling circle) and the size of the wobbling circle located upstream of the diseased part <b>62</b> in the direction of ion beam propagation (irradiation target upstream wobbling circle) are defined simply according to the distance from the scanning focus positions of the same scanning magnets <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Meanwhile, the ion beam size and quantity on the downstream side are the size and quantity of an ion beam passing through thin portions of the SOBP devices <b>21</b>. The ion beam size and quantity on the upstream side are the total ion beam size and quantity of ion beams passing through thin and thick portions of the SOBP device <b>21</b>. When the scatterers, absorber, and SOBP devices <b>21</b> are moved and set to their respective positions so as to optimize the ratio between the upstream wobbling circle and ion beam size and the ratio between the downstream wobbling circle and ion beam size, the uniformity of radiation dose distribution for the diseased part can be enhanced while keeping the radiation dose rate high. The irradiation target is determined according to the shape of the diseased part <b>62</b>. It may occasionally be rendered larger than the diseased part so as to leave a certain margin.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the present embodiment, the scatterers (e.g., scatterers <b>43</b>B and <b>43</b>C) at an ion beam passage position are moved in the direction of ion beam propagation. Therefore, the ion beam scatter size prevailing at the position of the diseased part <b>62</b> (the enlarged ion beam size in a direction perpendicular to the direction of ion beam propagation) can be varied. More specifically, the scatter size decreases when the scatterers are moved toward the diseased part <b>62</b> and increases when the scatterers are moved away from the diseased part <b>62</b>. When the scatterers move in the direction of ion beam propagation, the ion beam scatter size can be optimized so as to provide uniform radiation dose distribution in the direction of ion beam propagation without changing the in vivo ion beam range. Consequently, the distribution of radiation dose administered to the diseased part <b>62</b> can be adjusted. More specifically, the scatterers are moved away from the diseased part <b>62</b> when the ion beam scatter size is smaller than the optimum scatter size, and moved toward the diseased part <b>62</b> when the ion beam scatter size is larger than the optimum scatter size.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the thickness of the absorber in the ion beam passage region increases, the ion beam scatter size becomes larger than the optimum scatter size and the radiation dose distribution for the diseased part <b>62</b> becomes worse. In the present embodiment, however, the selected absorber is moved in the direction of ion beam propagation. Therefore, it is possible to inhibit the radiation dose distribution for the diseased part <b>62</b> from deteriorating due to an ion beam scatter size change, which arises from an ion beam range adjustment that is made with an absorber selected. As a result, the radiation dose distribution for the optimum scatter size can be obtained. The move of the absorber adjusts absorber-induced changes in the radiation dose distribution for the diseased part <b>62</b> without changing the ion beam range. When the thickness of the selected absorber increases, the absorber is moved further downstream in the direction of ion beam propagation.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A plurality of SOBP devices <b>21</b>, which vary in the SOBP width, are furnished. As described earlier, one SOBP device <b>21</b> is selected and set. The SOBP devices <b>21</b> provide different ion beam scatter sizes depending on the attainable SOBP width. As the scatter size of an SOBP device <b>21</b> increases, the resulting position is shifted downstream. Thanks to this shift, the ion beam scatter size is optimized. This uniforms the radiation dose distribution for the diseased part <b>62</b> in a direction perpendicular to the direction of ion beam propagation.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As described above, the present embodiment can uniform the radiation dose distribution for the diseased part <b>62</b> because it can move the scattering device <b>19</b>, range adjustment device <b>20</b>, and SOBP device <b>21</b> in the direction of ion beam propagation. Further, the present embodiment increases the radiation dose rate because the ion beam usability improves.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the present embodiment, the scattering device <b>19</b> is installed in the range adjustment device <b>20</b>. Therefore, these devices can be moved together by the same AC servomotors <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, which serve as drive devices. Consequently, the configuration of the present embodiment is simpler than in cases where the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> are moved separately by respective drive devices. In the present embodiment, the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> are integral with each other with absorbers positioned close to scatterers. Therefore, the size of an ion beam incident on an absorber is rendered small so that the length and width of each absorber in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis <b>14</b> can be reduced. This makes the range adjustment device <b>20</b> smaller. Although the influence of absorber-induced scattering is exercised depending on the amount of absorber insertion, the present embodiment moves absorbers and scatterers together in the direction of ion beam propagation. Therefore, it is possible to decrease the amount of absorber travel in the direction of such propagation and increase the distance between the diseased part <b>62</b> and absorbers. Since the distance is increased with scatterers and absorbers positioned close to each other, the radiation dose distribution penumbra (half shadow) beyond the diseased part <b>62</b> decreases. In the present embodiment, the absorbers and scatterers are equal in the amount of travel along the beam axis <b>14</b>. Since the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b>, which are integral with each other, move along the beam axis <b>14</b>, the degree of variation in the radiation dose distribution for the diseased part <b>62</b> can be decreased without regard to the ion beam range determined according to an absorber selection. Due to the use of the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> that are integral with each other, the present embodiment positions a selected absorber near scatterers to reduce the size of an ion beam incident on the absorber. As a result, each absorber can be reduced in size so as to downsize the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The present embodiment uses the functions of the control system <b>70</b>, particularly the functions of the irradiation controller <b>54</b> and drive controller <b>56</b>, to easily move the scatterer of a first scattering device <b>19</b> in the direction of ion beam propagation and set it at a preselected position. In particular, the irradiation controller <b>54</b> can place the scatterer of the first scattering device <b>19</b> in the above preselected position using the therapy plan information about the patient <b>61</b>, more specifically, the range (range information).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the present embodiment, the radiation dose distribution for the irradiation target based on ion beam irradiation is uniform in the direction of the in vivo depth as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. The radiation dose distribution shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is obtained when the range adjustment device <b>20</b> is moved in accordance with the present embodiment. In a conventional configuration in which the scattering device <b>19</b>, range adjustment device <b>20</b>, and SOBP device <b>21</b> are not moved, the radiation dose distribution within the irradiation target varies in the direction of the in vivo depth as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. Such a variation in the radiation dose distribution can be significantly inhibited by the present embodiment. The examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> relate to a case where ion beams having the same energy are used for irradiation.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows the uniformity of radiation dose distribution for an irradiation target in a conventional configuration. In the conventional configuration, the radiation dose distribution remains uniform no matter whether the irradiation target length in the direction of the depth varies. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the present embodiment provides a higher degree of radiation dose distribution uniformity when the irradiation target length in the direction of the depth decreases. The characteristics shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> are obtained when the SOBP device <b>21</b> is moved in accordance with the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although the present embodiment moves the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b>, which are integral with each other, and the SOBP device <b>21</b> along the beam axis <b>14</b>, an alternative configuration may be employed so as to move either a combination of the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> or the SOBP device <b>21</b>. When the employed configuration renders the SOBP device <b>21</b> movable and the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> immovable, the radiation dose distribution variation, which occurs in the diseased part <b>62</b> in response to the selected absorber, is not adjustable; however, the degree of uniformity of radiation dose distribution for the diseased part <b>62</b> is higher than in the conventional configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the present embodiment, the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b>, which are integral with each other, may alternatively be positioned upstream of the first scanning magnet <b>17</b>. Since the scattering device <b>19</b> is located upstream of the first scanning magnet <b>17</b> in this alternative configuration, the degree of ion beam scattering by the scattering device <b>19</b> can be reduced. Consequently, the scatterer thickness of the scattering device <b>19</b> can be decreased so as to render the scattering device <b>19</b> compact. Since the present embodiment positions the range adjustment device <b>20</b> upstream of the first scanning magnet <b>17</b>, the effective radiation source distance can be rendered longer than when the range adjustment device <b>20</b> is positioned downstream of the first scanning magnet <b>17</b>, and the effective radiation source size can be further reduced. As a result, the half shadow further decreases in size. Further, when the range adjustment device <b>20</b> is positioned upstream of the first scanning magnet <b>17</b>, the absorber size (absorber thickness) increases, thereby reducing the ion beam energy and acquiring a larger wobbling circle. This increases the degree of freedom in selecting a ratio between the ion beam scatter size for the diseased part <b>62</b> and the size of the wobbling circle.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although the present embodiment is provided with the range adjustment device <b>20</b>, an alternative configuration, which is without the range adjustment device <b>20</b>, may be employed so that the synchrotron <b>4</b> adjusts the energy given to the ion beam at the time of acceleration for the purpose of adjusting the ion beam range within the body of the patient <b>61</b>. Another alternative configuration may also be formed so as to obtain a desired ion beam range by preselecting a desired bottom thickness of the bolus <b>22</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A particle beam therapy system according to a second embodiment of the present invention will now be described. The particle beam therapy system according to the present embodiment is configured so that the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b> in the particle beam therapy system <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is replaced by an irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>A differs from the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b> in positions of the SOBP device <b>21</b> and the components associated with it. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>A is configured so that the SOBP device <b>21</b> is positioned upstream of the first scanning magnet <b>17</b>. The support member <b>30</b>, AC servomotor <b>31</b>, ball screw <b>32</b>, encoder <b>33</b>, and linear guide <b>34</b> are also positioned upstream of the first scanning magnet <b>17</b> and mounted within the casing <b>16</b>. A rotary wheel type SOBP filter may be used as the SOBP device.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The ion beam passing through a thin portion of the SOBP device <b>21</b> is high in energy. Therefore, the amount of scanning provided by the first and second scanning magnets is small. However, the ion beam passing through a thick portion of the SOBP device <b>21</b> is low in energy. Therefore, the amount of scanning provided by the first and second scanning magnets is larger than the amount of scanning provided for the ion beam passing through the thin portion. As a result, the spread angle of the ion beam passing through the thick portion after scanning by the first and second scanning magnets is greater than the spread angle of the ion beam passing through the thin portion after scanning as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The wobbling circle located upstream of the irradiation target is formed by the ion beam passing through the thick portion, whereas the wobbling circle located downstream of the irradiation target is formed by the ion beam passing through the thick portion. Therefore, the SOBP device <b>21</b> is moved and positioned so as to optimize the ratio between the circle that is drawn in an in vivo, shallow range region by an ion beam scanned by the first and second scanning magnets and composed by various energy components, and the ion beam size provided by ion beams of various energy components, and the ratio between the circle drawn in a deep range region by an ion beam and the ion beam size provided by ion beams of various energy components. Consequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the relative radiation dose distribution on the irradiation target beam axis <b>14</b> (central axis) becomes uniform in the direction of the in vivo depth and the uniformity of relative radiation dose distribution on the irradiation target periphery increases in the direction of the depth. Further, the relative radiation dose distribution on the irradiation target periphery according to the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> exhibits a higher degree of uniformity than the relative radiation dose distribution on the periphery according to the first embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>) in which the SOBP device <b>21</b> is positioned downstream of the second scanning magnet <b>18</b>. In other words, the first embodiment increases the degree of uniformity of radiation dose distribution by balancing the radiation dose distributions, in a direction perpendicular to the beam axis <b>14</b>, for the deep and shallow irradiation target positions. Unlike the first embodiment, the present embodiment eliminates the difference between the radiation dose distributions for the deep and shallow positions.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The present embodiment provides the advantages that are provided by the first embodiment. In addition, the present embodiment makes it possible to reduce the sizes of ion beams and the SOBP device <b>21</b> because the SOBP device <b>21</b> is positioned upstream of the first scanning magnet <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">An alternative configuration may be employed for the present embodiment so that either a combination of the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> or the SOBP device <b>21</b> is movable.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In another alternative configuration for the present embodiment, a combination of the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b>, which are integral with each other, and the drive devices for moving the combination along the beam axis <b>14</b> may be both positioned upstream of the SOBP device <b>21</b>. This alternative configuration makes it possible to render the range adjustment device <b>20</b> compact as mentioned earlier.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The foregoing embodiments relate to a particle beam therapy system that is based on a wobbling type irradiation apparatus. A third embodiment of the present invention, that is, a particle beam therapy system based on a scatterer type irradiation apparatus, will now be described. The particle beam therapy system according to the third embodiment is such that the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b> in the particle beam therapy system <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is replaced by irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>B, which is a scatterer type, first irradiation apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The particle beam therapy system according to the present embodiment does not include a drive controller <b>58</b>. The irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>B includes a scattering device <b>19</b> (first scatterer), a scattering device <b>63</b> (second scatterer), a SOBP device <b>21</b>, and a range adjustment device <b>20</b>, which are mounted within a casing <b>16</b> and sequentially arranged from upstream to downstream of ion beam propagation. The casing <b>16</b> includes a bolus retainer, which is located downstream of the range adjustment device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The scattering device <b>19</b> is mounted on a support member <b>67</b>. The support member <b>67</b> meshes with a ball screw <b>66</b>, which travels through a threaded hole. The upper end of the ball screw <b>66</b> is attached to the casing <b>16</b> in a rotatable manner. The lower end of the ball screw <b>66</b> is coupled to an AC servomotor <b>65</b>, which is mounted on the casing <b>16</b>. An encoder <b>29</b>A is coupled to the rotating shaft of the AC servomotor <b>65</b>. The scattering device <b>63</b> is mounted on the casing <b>16</b> via a support member <b>64</b>. The SOBP device <b>21</b> is mounted on the casing <b>16</b> via a support member. The range adjustment device <b>20</b> is mounted on the casing <b>16</b> via a support member <b>68</b>. In the present embodiment, the scattering device <b>63</b>, SOBP device <b>21</b>, and range adjustment device <b>20</b> cannot move along the beam axis <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The scattering device <b>63</b> is configured so that the degree of ion beam scattering varies from one ion beam incidence point to another. The scattering device <b>63</b> includes, for instance, a double-ring scatterer, which comprises a plurality of materials that differ in the degree of scattering. The scattering device <b>63</b> is a device for adjusting the ion beam radiation dose distribution. More specifically, the inner and outer structures of scattering device <b>63</b> differ from each other. Since the scattering intensity differs between the inner and outer structures, the scattering device <b>63</b> makes adjustments to uniform the radiation dose distribution for an overlap between inner- and outer-passing ion beams. Another example of the scatterer for the scattering device <b>63</b> would be, for instance, a contoured radiation structure in which the material proportion varies stepwise.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As is the case with the first embodiment, the irradiation controller <b>54</b> selects a scatterer thickness and absorber thickness from the irradiation condition information stored in the memory <b>55</b> in accordance with patient therapy plan information stored in the memory <b>55</b>. The memory <b>55</b> stores SC position information instead of the “SC+RS position” information, which is shown as part of the irradiation condition information shown in Table 1. The stored SC position information is the positional information about the scattering device <b>19</b>. The SC position is a position that is based on the first reference position for the scattering device <b>19</b>. In accordance with the information about selected scatterer thickness, the drive controller <b>56</b> selects a scatterer required within the scattering device <b>19</b> and exercises control so as to move the selected scatterer to an ion beam passage position. The drive controller <b>56</b> also selects an absorber required within the range adjustment device <b>20</b> in accordance with the information about selected absorber thickness, and exercises control so as to move the selected absorber to an ion beam passage position. The bolus <b>22</b> is set in the bolus retainer <b>35</b>. Further, the collimator <b>23</b> is set at the lower end of the casing <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The irradiation controller <b>54</b> outputs the SC position information, which is the first position information, as well as a drive instruction to the drive controller <b>57</b>. In accordance with the SC position information, the drive controller <b>57</b> rotates the AC servomotor <b>65</b> in order to move the support member <b>67</b> to a specified position along the beam axis <b>14</b>. The drive controller <b>57</b> provides drive control over the AC servomotor <b>65</b> for the purpose of moving the scattering device <b>19</b> in the direction of the beam axis <b>14</b> in accordance with the size of the diseased part <b>62</b> in a direction perpendicular to the beam axis <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">After an ion beam is emitted from a rotary irradiation device <b>10</b> and incident on irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>C, it is scattered by the selected scatterer of the scattering device <b>19</b>, spread in a conical pattern in the direction of ion beam propagation, and entered into the scattering device <b>63</b>. The ion beam is then scattered by the double-ring scatterer of the scattering device <b>63</b> in order to adjust the radiation dose distribution in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis <b>14</b>. The ion beam then sequentially passes through the Bragg peak spreading device <b>21</b>, range adjustment device <b>20</b>, bolus <b>22</b>, and collimator <b>23</b> and falls on the diseased part <b>62</b>. The Bragg peak spreading device <b>21</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> function the same as described in conjunction with the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Since the present embodiment moves the scatterer in the direction of ion beam propagation, it provides a higher degree of uniformity of radiation dose distribution for the diseased part <b>62</b> than a conventional configuration. The present embodiment also improves the ion beam usability and increases the radiation dose rate. When the scattering device <b>63</b> moves along the beam axis <b>14</b>, two problems arise. The first problem is that a high degree of accuracy is required for linearity of movement in the direction of the beam axis <b>14</b> because the radiation dose distribution is greatly affected by the concentricity between the scattering device <b>63</b> and the beam axis <b>14</b>. The second problem is that the AC servomotor for drive is required to have an increased capacity because the scattering device <b>63</b> is larger and heavier than the scattering device <b>19</b>. However, these problems are solved by the present embodiment, which fixes the scattering device <b>63</b> and moves the scattering device <b>19</b> along its axis.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A fourth embodiment of the present invention will now be described. The particle beam therapy system according to the fourth embodiment is such that the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>B according to the third embodiment is replaced by a scatterer type, second irradiation apparatus. The particle beam therapy system according to the present embodiment does not include the drive controller <b>58</b>. The second irradiation apparatus differs from the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>B in that a scattering device <b>19</b> is mounted in a casing <b>16</b> via a support member <b>67</b> in a stationary manner while a range adjustment device <b>20</b> is mounted in the casing <b>16</b> and rendered movable in the direction of the beam axis <b>14</b>. The drive device for moving the range adjustment device <b>20</b> in the direction of the beam axis <b>14</b> is configured the same as the drive device (an AC servomotor <b>65</b> and a ball screw <b>66</b>) for moving the scattering device <b>19</b> in the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>B in that direction, and mounted in the casing <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As is the case with third embodiment, an irradiation controller <b>54</b> selects a scatterer thickness and absorber thickness. A memory <b>55</b> stores RS position information instead of the “SC+RS position” information, which is shown as part of the irradiation condition information shown in Table 1. The stored RS position information is the positional information about the range adjustment device <b>20</b>. The RS position is a position that is based on the first reference position for the range adjustment device <b>20</b>. As is the case with the third embodiment, the drive controller <b>56</b> selects a required scatterer and absorber and exercises control so as to move the selected scatterer and absorber to an ion beam passage position. A bolus <b>22</b> and a collimator <b>23</b> are also mounted in the casing <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The irradiation controller <b>54</b> outputs the RS position information, which is the first position information, as well as a drive instruction to a drive controller <b>57</b>. In accordance with the RS position information, the drive controller <b>57</b> rotates an AC servomotor in order to move a support member <b>68</b> to a specified position along the beam axis <b>14</b>. After an ion beam is emitted from the rotary irradiation device <b>10</b> and incident on the second irradiation apparatus, it sequentially passes through the selected scatterer of the scattering device <b>19</b>, scattering device <b>63</b>, Bragg peak spreading device <b>21</b>, range adjustment device <b>20</b>, bolus <b>22</b>, and collimator <b>23</b> and then falls on the diseased part <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The present embodiment moves the absorber in the direction of ion beam propagation. The radiation dose distribution for the diseased part <b>62</b>, which results from ion beam scatter changes caused by a selected absorber as described in conjunction with the first embodiment, can therefore be uniformed to a higher degree than a conventional configuration. In addition, the present embodiment improves the ion beam usability and increases the radiation dose rate.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Fifth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A fifth embodiment of the present invention will now be described. The particle beam therapy system according to the fifth embodiment is such that the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>B according to the third embodiment is replaced by a scatterer type, third irradiation apparatus. The particle beam therapy system according to the present embodiment does not include the drive controller <b>57</b>. The third irradiation apparatus differs from irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>B in that a scattering device <b>19</b> is mounted in a casing <b>16</b> via a support member <b>67</b> in a stationary manner while a SOBP device <b>21</b> is mounted in a casing <b>16</b> and rendered movable in the direction of the beam axis <b>14</b>. The present embodiment is equal to the first embodiment in that the SOBP device <b>21</b> is movable in the direction of the beam axis <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As is the case with the third embodiment, a irradiation controller <b>54</b> selects a scatterer thickness and absorber thickness. A memory <b>55</b> stores the irradiation condition information shown in Table 1 excluding the “SC+RS position” information and also stores the irradiation condition information shown in Table 2. As is the case with the third embodiment, a drive controller <b>56</b> selects a required scatterer and absorber and exercises control so as to move the selected scatterer and absorber to an ion beam passage position. A bolus <b>22</b> and a collimator <b>23</b> are also mounted in the casing <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The irradiation controller <b>54</b> outputs the positional information about the SOBP device <b>21</b>, which is the second position information, as well as a drive instruction to a drive controller <b>58</b>. In accordance with the second position information, the drive controller <b>58</b> rotates an AC servomotor in order to move a support member <b>30</b> to a specified position along the beam axis <b>14</b>. After an ion beam is emitted from a rotary irradiation device <b>10</b> and incident on the third irradiation apparatus, it falls on a diseased part <b>62</b> in the same manner as described in conjunction with the fourth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The present embodiment moves the SOBP device <b>21</b> in the direction of ion beam propagation. Consequently, as described in conjunction with the first embodiment, the present embodiment makes it possible to adjust the changes in the radiation dose distribution for the diseased part <b>62</b>, which arise depending on the SOBP device <b>21</b> that is set. As a result, the present embodiment provides a higher degree of uniformity of radiation dose distribution for the diseased part <b>62</b> than a conventional configuration. The present embodiment also improves the ion beam usability and increases the radiation dose rate.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The third to fifth embodiments move one of scattering device <b>19</b>, range adjustment device <b>20</b>, and SOBP device <b>21</b>, all of which are moved by the first embodiment. Therefore, the third to fifth embodiments are inferior to the first embodiment in the capability for adjusting the degree of uniformity of radiation dose distribution for the diseased part <b>62</b>, but provide a higher degree of radiation dose distribution uniformity than a conventional configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An alternative configuration may be employed for the third embodiment so that at least one of the range adjustment device <b>20</b> and SOBP device <b>21</b> is rendered movable in addition to the scattering device <b>19</b>, which is movable. When the drive device for the range adjustment device <b>20</b> is mounted in the casing <b>16</b>, the range adjustment device <b>20</b> can move along the beam axis <b>14</b>. When the drive device for the SOBP device <b>21</b> is mounted in the casing <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the SOBP device <b>21</b> can move along the beam axis <b>14</b>.

Further, an alternative configuration may be employed for the fourth embodiment so that the SOBP device <b>21</b> is rendered movable in addition to the range adjustment device <b>20</b>, which is movable. This alternative configuration can be achieved by mounting the drive device for the above SOBP device <b>21</b> in the casing <b>16</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A sixth embodiment of the present invention will now be described. The particle beam therapy system according to the sixth embodiment is such that the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b> according to the first embodiment is replaced by an irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>E, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>E differs from the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>B in that a combination of a scattering device <b>19</b> and a range adjustment device <b>20</b>, which are integral with each other as described in conjunction with the first embodiment, is positioned upstream of a scattering device <b>63</b>, which is the second scatterer, and that the scattering device <b>19</b>, range adjustment device <b>20</b>, and SOBP device <b>21</b> are movable along the beam axis <b>14</b>. A drive device for moving the integral combination of the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> along the beam axis <b>14</b> is configured the same as its drive device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A drive device for moving the SOBP device <b>21</b> along the beam axis <b>14</b> is configured the same as its drive device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">An irradiation controller <b>54</b> and drive controllers <b>56</b>, <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> for the present embodiment function the same as the counterparts for the first embodiment. The ion beam incident on the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>E passes through internal components and falls on a diseased part <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Since the present embodiment moves the scattering device <b>19</b>, range adjustment device <b>20</b>, and SOBP device <b>21</b> along the beam axis <b>14</b>, it can uniform the radiation dose distribution for the diseased part <b>62</b> as is the case with the first embodiment. In the present embodiment, the integral combination of the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> is positioned upstream of a scattering device <b>63</b>. Therefore, even when the amount of range adjustment is increased by a selected absorber, the present embodiment can increase the effective radiation source distance and decrease the effective radiation source size. Consequently, the radiation dose distribution penumbra (half shadow) beyond the diseased part decreases. Further, the size of the ion beam incident on the range adjustment device <b>20</b> decreases, thereby making it possible to downsize the range adjustment device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When the range adjustment device <b>10</b> is positioned upstream of the scattering device <b>63</b>, which is the second scatterer, the amount of radiation dose distribution variation increases due to range adjustments. However, the present embodiment can move the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> in the direction of the beam axis <b>14</b>, thereby making it possible to adjust the amount of radiation dose distribution variation. Since the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> are integral with each other, the amount of their travel in the direction of the beam axis <b>14</b> can be reduced. When the amount of ion beam energy loss in the range adjustment device <b>20</b> increases (when a thick absorber is selected), the amount of ion beam scattering in the scattering device <b>63</b> increases as well. Therefore, when the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> move, the amount of variation in the radiation dose distribution for the diseased part <b>62</b> can be reduced without regard to the amount of ion beam range adjustment by the absorber.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">An alternative configuration may be employed for the present embodiment so that either the integral combination of the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> or the SOBP device <b>21</b> is immovable along the beam axis <b>14</b>. When the integral combination of the scattering device <b>19</b> and range adjustment device <b>20</b> is immovable, inserting an absorber into the ion beam passage region causes an increase in the amount of ion beam incidence on the outer region of the scattering device <b>63</b>. However, as the energy is decreased by the absorber insertion, the degree of ion beam scattering at the position of scattering device <b>63</b> becomes higher than when no absorber is inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Another embodiment of a wobbling type irradiation apparatus will now be described. The irradiation apparatus according to the present embodiment, which is referred to as the Type A irradiation apparatus, is configured so that the scattering device <b>63</b> of the irradiation apparatus <b>15</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) is replaced by the first scanning magnet <b>17</b> and second scanning magnet <b>18</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A scattering device <b>19</b> located upstream of the first scanning magnet <b>17</b> can move in the direction of the beam axis <b>14</b>.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Still another embodiment of a wobbling type irradiation apparatus will now be described.

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Seventh Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">A seventh embodiment of the present invention, which is based on a scanning type irradiation apparatus, will now be described. The particle beam therapy system according to the seventh embodiment is different from the particle beam therapy system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in ion beam scanning control that the scanning magnet controller <b>36</b> exercises for the first scanning magnet <b>17</b> and second scanning magnet <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Ion beam scanning conducted by the present embodiment will now be described in detail. An irradiation controller <b>54</b> acquires ion beam scanning condition information (e.g., exciting current patterns shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>) about scanning of a patient <b>61</b> from a memory <b>55</b>, and outputs it to the scanning magnet controller <b>36</b>. The ion beam scanning condition information is created when a therapy plan is formulated for the patient <b>61</b>. In accordance with the exciting current pattern information, the scanning magnet controller <b>36</b> controls the currents that are supplied respectively to the first scanning magnet <b>17</b> and second scanning magnet <b>18</b>. The ion beam scanned by the first scanning magnet <b>17</b> and second scanning magnet <b>18</b> passes through a scattering device <b>19</b>, a range adjustment device <b>20</b>, a SOBP device <b>21</b>, a bolus <b>22</b>, and a collimator <b>23</b>, and falls on a diseased part <b>62</b>. As described in conjunction with the first embodiment, wobbling type ion beam scanning is conducted in accordance with the exciting current patterns for the scanning magnets shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The employed scanning method provides irradiation while scanning an ion beam within a plurality of regions into which the diseased part <b>62</b> is divided (e.g., the diseased part <b>62</b> is divided into a plurality of regions in the direction of the in vivo depth). This scanning method can provide ion beam irradiation in accordance with the shape of the diseased part <b>62</b>, thereby preventing healthy cells neighboring the diseased part <b>62</b> from being exposed to the ion beam. When the exciting currents are controlled as indicated by the above-mentioned exciting current patterns shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, the ion beam propagates in a fixed direction while zigzagging within a divided region described above. Ion beam scanning is conducted in this manner to complete ion beam irradiation for one divided region. The ion beam energy is varied in order to move the ion beam into the other divided regions, which vary in the depth from the patient body surface.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">If a conventional scanning type irradiation apparatus is used for ion beam scanning, a problem arises. More specifically, the ion beam size varies with the ion beam length in the direction of propagation within divided regions or the position in the direction of the in vivo depth. However, the present embodiment can adjust the ion beam size because it moves the scattering device <b>19</b> in the direction of the beam axis <b>14</b>. The present embodiment also moves the range adjustment device <b>20</b> in the same direction, thereby making it possible to adjust ion beam size changes arising out of ion beam scatter changes that are caused when the range is adjusted by a selected absorber. Further, the present embodiment moves an SOBP device <b>21</b>, thereby making it possible to adjust ion beam changes that are caused by a selected SOBP device <b>21</b>. As described above, the present embodiment can adjust the ion beam size. Consequently, the present embodiment solves the aforementioned problem in which the ion beam size varies with the ion beam length in the direction of propagation within the divided regions or the position in the direction of the in vivo depth. The present embodiment can easily adjust the ion beam size by moving the scattering device <b>19</b>, range adjustment device <b>20</b>, and SOBP device <b>21</b> along the beam axis <b>14</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The present embodiment controls the scanning magnets in accordance with the exciting current patterns shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>. Therefore, it solves the problem that occurs with the seventh embodiment in which the ion beam size varies, for instance, with the ion beam length in the direction of propagation. That is, the ion beam size remains unchanged even if there is a change in the ion beam length in the direction of ion beam propagation within the divided regions or in the position in the direction of the in vivo depth. In reality, the ion beam shape is similar to that of Gauss distribution. If a circular orbit is drawn by means of wobbling, the ion beam shape represents a circular integral of a distribution shape similar to that of Gauss distribution. However, if the circular orbit for scanning is small relative to the amount of ion beam scattering, it is impossible to presume that the ion beam shape is similar to that of Gauss distribution. More specifically, the scanning magnet controller <b>36</b> controls the exciting currents to be supplied to the first scanning magnet <b>17</b> and second scanning magnet <b>18</b> in such a manner as to make the wobbling pattern (chronological changes in the current value to be applied to a wobbling magnet) larger for a region irradiated with a small beam and make the wobbling pattern smaller for a region irradiated with a large beam. When the present embodiment is applied to raster scanning, an ion beam scan is conducted while drawing a spiral orbit. When the present embodiment is applied to voxel scanning, irradiation takes place in such a manner that each ion beam draws a circular orbit at a fixed position. The present embodiment can adjust ion beam size variations as is the case with the seventh embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">If an alternative configuration is employed for the seventh or eighth embodiment so that one or two of the scattering device <b>19</b>, range adjustment device <b>20</b>, and SOBP device <b>21</b> are moved along the beam axis <b>14</b> instead of moving all of them along the beam axis <b>14</b>, the result is inferior to that is obtained when all of them are moved. However, such an alternative configuration inhibits ion beam size variations to a higher degree than a conventional scanning method.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In embodiments other than the first embodiment and where the first and second scanning magnets are provided, the scanning magnet controller <b>36</b> can control the exciting currents to be supplied to the first and second scanning magnets in accordance with the exciting current patterns described in conjunction with the seventh and eighth embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">All the embodiments described above relate to a particle beam therapy system that includes a synchrotron. However, the irradiation apparatuses described in conjunction with the foregoing embodiments are also applicable to a particle beam therapy system that includes a cyclotron. The particle beam therapy system containing a cyclotron can obtain a desired ion beam range by preselecting an appropriate bottom thickness for the bolus <b>22</b> instead of using the range adjustment device.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">All the foregoing embodiments are applicable to a material irradiation system that contains a charged particle beam generation apparatus and irradiation apparatus and exposes materials to a charged particle beam, a food irradiation system for exposing food to a charged particle beam, and a radioisotope production system based on a charged particle beam.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The present invention enhances the uniformity of radiation dose distribution for the irradiation target that is irradiated with a charged particle beam.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">While the invention has been described in its preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the words which have been used are words of description rather than limitation and that changes within the purview of the appended claims may be made without departing from the true scope and spirit of the invention in its broader aspects.</p>
