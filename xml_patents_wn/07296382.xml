<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to pre-formed inserts, and the like, used with concrete structures.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Pre-formed inserts for use with concrete structures are known. The inserts are typically incorporated into the structure during concrete pouring to facilitate attachment of threaded fasteners, such as bolts and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Prior art inserts include internally threaded barrels which are tensioned axially by an attached bolt. The prior art insert also include a base at a distal end of the barrel. The base extends outwardly from the barrel to embed the insert within a concrete structure and increase the force necessary to pull the insert out of the concrete structure. The prior art insert further includes tapering ribs connected to the base and to an outer surface of the barrel to strengthen the base.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Prior art inserts, initially made of metal, have also been made from injection molded thermoplastic (acetal) materials. The inserts are made in a variety of sizes for receiving bolts of various diameters, such as ¼″, ⅜″, ½″, ⅝″, ¾″, 1″, 1½″, for example. The metal and plastic inserts of the prior art are similar in construction. The plastic prior art inserts, however, stretch to a greater extent than the corresponding metal inserts because of increased elongation properties of plastic compared to steel. As the barrel of the plastic insert stretches, the reinforcing ribs become wedged against the concrete. Resulting failure of the plastic inserts short of the base creates a smaller shear cone compared to that created by a comparably sized metal insert, which undesirably equates to a lower pull out force for the prior art plastic insert.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the present invention there is provided an insert adapted for receiving a threaded fastener for attachment of the fastener to a concrete structure. Preferably, the insert is made from a plastic material. The insert includes an elongated barrel having opposite proximal and distal ends and defining an interior for receiving a shaft of the threaded fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one embodiment of the invention, the insert includes a housing connected to the barrel adjacent the distal end of the barrel. The housing defines an interior adapted to receive an internally threaded member for engagement with a threaded portion of the fastener shaft. The insert further includes at least one bar-engaging member connected to the housing adjacent an outer peripheral edge of the housing and extending outwardly therefrom for contact with a concrete-reinforcing bar of the concrete structure to anchor the insert within the concrete structure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The insert may also include a bar-engaging member located adjacent the proximal end of the barrel adapted for contact with a concrete-reinforcing bar of the concrete structure. Preferably, the proximal bar-engaging member includes a retainer defining a substantially semi-circular channel adapted for receipt of a U-shaped portion of the concrete-reinforcing bar. Preferably, the retainer is connected to a base defining a substantially cylindrical interior removably receiving the barrel to facilitate receipt of the U-shaped portion of the concrete-reinforcing bar in the channel defined by the retainer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The insert may also include a cover adapted for removable attachment to the housing such that the interior defined by the housing is enclosed. Preferably the cover includes at least one ring adapted to engage a post connected to the housing. Preferably, the cover is connected to the housing by an elongated flexible connector.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another embodiment of the invention, the insert includes a base connected to the barrel adjacent the distal end of the barrel. The base extends outwardly beyond an outer surface of the barrel to define a surface that is oriented substantially perpendicular to a central axis of the barrel for anchoring the insert within the concrete structure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The insert also includes a plurality of elongated ribs each connected to the base and to the barrel. Each of the ribs includes a plurality of segments arranged in series along the length of the rib and including a first segment located adjacent the base. Each segment of the rib extends radially from an outer surface of the barrel to a distance that decreases with each succeeding segment from the first segment such that each segment defines a surface that is oriented substantially perpendicular to the central axis of the barrel. Preferably, the ribs are spaced substantially equally about a circumference of the barrel. The barrel of the insert preferably includes threads formed on an inner surface of the barrel for threadedly engaging a threaded portion of the fastener shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the elongated ribs include ribs of varying lengths and are arranged such that a last segment of each rib remote from the base is offset axially with respect to the barrel from the last segment of adjacent ribs.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to the drawings, where like numerals identify like elements, there are illustrated inserts according to the present invention adapted for receiving a threaded fastener, such as a bolt for example. As described in more detail below, the inserts are intended for use in concrete construction to facilitate attachment of a bolt to a poured concrete structure.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>, there is shown an insert <b>10</b> for receiving a threaded bolt according to a first embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the insert <b>10</b> is adapted to engage concrete-reinforcing members (“rebar”) <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. As described in more detail below, the engagement between the insert <b>10</b> and the rebar <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> limits removal of the insert <b>10</b> from a concrete structure following pouring and curing of the concrete structure. The force required to remove an embedded insert from a concrete structure is typically referred to as the “pull out” force. As described in more detail below, the engagement between the insert <b>10</b> and the rebar <b>14</b> also functions to carry shear forces that are applied to an attached bolt in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis of the bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The insert <b>10</b> includes an elongated, substantially cylindrical, barrel <b>16</b> defining a hollow interior <b>18</b> for receiving the shaft of a bolt. The insert <b>10</b> also includes a housing <b>20</b> located at a distal end of the insert <b>10</b> with respect to a threaded bolt that is received by the insert <b>10</b> through an opposite proximal end. The barrel <b>16</b> and the housing <b>20</b> are preferably integrally formed from an injection molded thermoplastic material. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the housing <b>20</b> defines a substantially hexagonal interior for receipt of a hex-shaped nut member <b>22</b>. The nut member <b>22</b> is internally threaded to provide for threaded engagement between the nut member <b>22</b> and an externally threaded portion of a bolt shaft received by the insert <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The nut member <b>22</b> is preferably made from a metal suitable for forming internal threads that are capable of withstanding loads applied by a metal bolt to be inserted into the insert <b>10</b> and tensioned axially. Because the nut member <b>22</b> provides for threaded engagement with an inserted bolt, the insert <b>10</b> does not need to include threads formed in the barrel <b>16</b>. This contrasts with prior art plastic inserts that include internal threads formed along the inner surface of the barrel. Also, the location of the metal nut member <b>22</b> at the distal end portion of the insert <b>10</b> allows for attachment of a bolt having threads formed only at a terminal end portion of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The insert <b>10</b> also includes a cover <b>24</b> including a substantially hexagonally shaped base portion <b>26</b> for enclosing the nut member <b>22</b> within the interior defined by the housing <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cover <b>24</b> is connected to the housing <b>20</b> of insert <b>10</b> by a flexible connector <b>28</b>. Preferably, the cover <b>24</b> and connector <b>28</b> are integrally formed with the housing <b>20</b> from an injection molded thermoplastic material. It is not required, however, that the cover <b>24</b> be connected to the housing <b>20</b> by the flexible connector <b>28</b>. The cover <b>24</b> could be formed as a separate component attachable to the housing <b>20</b>. The integral construction incorporating the flexible connector <b>28</b>, however, facilitates handling of the insert <b>10</b> prior to placement of the nut member <b>22</b> into the interior of the housing <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The enclosed location of the nut member <b>22</b> within the housing <b>20</b> ensures that the nut member will remain properly positioned with respect to the insert <b>10</b> for threaded engagement with a bolt received by the insert. The enclosure provided by the cover <b>24</b> also serves to protect the nut member <b>22</b> from contamination when concrete is placed around the insert thereby ensuring that the threads of the nut member <b>22</b> will threadedly engage a subsequently attached bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The cover <b>24</b> includes substantially ring shaped snap-attachment members <b>30</b> located at opposite sides of the base portion <b>26</b>. The insert <b>10</b> also includes posts <b>32</b> projecting from the housing <b>20</b> at opposite sides thereof, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The posts <b>32</b> are adapted for engagement with the snap-attachment members <b>30</b> of cover <b>24</b> to secure the cover <b>24</b> to the housing <b>20</b> in the closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The cover <b>24</b> also includes a cap portion <b>34</b> connected to the base portion <b>26</b>. The cap portion <b>34</b> of cover <b>24</b> defines an interior <b>36</b> forming an extension of the enclosed interior defined by the housing <b>20</b> for receiving a portion of the shaft of an attached bolt that may extend past the nut member. The interior <b>36</b> provided by the cap portion <b>34</b>, therefore, accommodates bolts having various lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cover <b>24</b> includes a rib-like formation <b>37</b> extending about the base portion <b>26</b> adjacent an outer periphery thereof. This location provides for contact between the rib-like formation <b>37</b> and the housing <b>20</b> when the cover <b>24</b> is attached to the housing for ultrasonically welding the cover <b>24</b> to the housing <b>20</b> to seal the interior containing the nut member <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the interior containing the nut member <b>22</b> could be sealed using a caulking material.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The insert <b>10</b> also includes angles <b>38</b> connected to the housing <b>20</b> at opposite sides thereof. Each of the angles <b>38</b> is adapted for receiving one of the rebars <b>12</b> such that the rebar is located between the angle <b>38</b> and barrel <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Contact between the rebars <b>12</b> and the angles <b>38</b> increases the pull out force for an installed insert.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The insert <b>10</b> also includes a gusset <b>40</b> connected to each angle <b>38</b>. The gusset <b>40</b> reinforces the associated angle <b>38</b> to strengthen the angle <b>38</b> against loads transferred from contact with one of the rebars <b>12</b>. For ease of illustration, the rebars <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> have been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> without surface texture. As is well known in the art, however, rebar is typically provided with an external surface treatment, such as helical ribbing for example, to facilitate engagement between the rebar and concrete placed around the rebar. The gusset <b>40</b>, therefore, will also desirably engage the rebar surface ribbing to limit relative movement between the insert <b>10</b> and the rebar <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the insert <b>10</b> further includes a rebar receiver <b>42</b> connected to the barrel <b>16</b> and located at the proximal end of the insert <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the rebar receiver <b>42</b> is preferably formed separately from the barrel <b>16</b> from a thermoplastic material. The rebar receiver <b>42</b> includes a substantially cylindrical body portion <b>44</b> defining an interior in which an end portion of the barrel <b>16</b> is received, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. An annular shoulder <b>46</b> is defined within the body portion <b>44</b> of the rebar receiver <b>42</b> to provide a hard stop for limiting the insertion of the barrel <b>16</b> into the rebar receiver <b>42</b>. The barrel <b>16</b> and the body portion <b>44</b> of the rebar receiver <b>42</b> may also be dimensioned to create a slight interference therebetween for retaining the barrel <b>16</b> in an inserted position with respect to the rebar receiver <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The rebar receiver <b>42</b> also includes a retainer <b>48</b> connected to the body portion <b>44</b> adjacent one end of the body portion, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The retainer <b>48</b> includes an arcuate rim <b>50</b> defining a substantially semi-circular channel extending partially around the body portion <b>44</b>. The retainer <b>48</b> further includes a pair of extensions <b>52</b> extending inwardly from a peripheral edge of the rim <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a substantially U-shaped bend is formed in the rebar <b>14</b> that is sized for receipt within the channel defined by the rim <b>50</b> of retainer <b>48</b>. With the U-shaped bend of the rebar <b>14</b> received in the channel of the retainer <b>48</b>, the barrel <b>16</b> is then received within the body portion <b>44</b> of the rebar receiver <b>42</b> to limit lateral movement of the rebar <b>14</b> with respect to the insert <b>10</b>. The engagement between the rebar <b>14</b> and the rebar receiver <b>42</b> serves to strengthen the insert <b>10</b> against shearing forces applied to the insert <b>10</b> adjacent the proximal end by transverse loading of an attached bolt. The barrel <b>16</b> of insert <b>10</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> inserted into the rebar receiver <b>42</b> prior to receipt of the rebar <b>14</b> for ease of illustrating the components of the insert <b>10</b>. As described above, however, the rebar receiver <b>42</b> will be separated from the barrel <b>16</b> during placement of the U-shaped bend of rebar <b>14</b> into the retainer <b>48</b> of rebar receiver <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> there is shown an insert <b>54</b> for receiving a threaded bolt in a concrete structure according to a second embodiment of the invention. Preferably, the insert <b>54</b> is made from an injection molded thermoplastic material. The insert <b>54</b> includes an elongated, substantially cylindrical, barrel <b>56</b> defining a hollow interior <b>58</b> for receiving the shaft of a bolt. Threads <b>60</b> are defined on an inner surface of the barrel <b>56</b> for engagement with external threads on the shaft of a bolt received by the insert <b>54</b>. Preferably, the internal threads extend along a majority of the length of the barrel <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The insert <b>54</b> also includes a base <b>62</b> connected to the barrel <b>56</b> at a distal end of the insert <b>54</b> with respect to a bolt inserted into the insert <b>54</b>. The base <b>62</b> extends outwardly beyond an outer surface of the barrel <b>56</b> in a radial direction with respect to the barrel <b>56</b> to define a surface that is oriented substantially perpendicular to the axis of the barrel <b>56</b>. When a concrete structure, such as a wall for example, has been formed around the insert <b>54</b>, the outwardly extending surface of the base <b>62</b> serves to anchor the insert <b>54</b> within the surrounding concrete.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The insert <b>54</b> also includes a plurality of ribs <b>64</b> at spaced locations about the circumference of the barrel <b>56</b>. Each of the ribs <b>64</b> includes sides connected to the barrel <b>56</b> and to the base <b>62</b> to reinforce the connection therebetween against shear load applied to the base <b>62</b> from an axially loaded barrel <b>56</b>. The ribs <b>64</b> also create with the base <b>62</b> a shear cone in the surrounding concrete increasing the pull out force for the insert <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown, the ribs <b>64</b> are not tapered along their lengths and, instead, include a series of stepped segments <b>66</b> each extending radially from the barrel to a distance that diminishes with each succeeding segment from a first segment that is located adjacent the base <b>62</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, this construction defines a bearing surface <b>68</b> for each segment <b>66</b> that is substantially perpendicular to the axis of the barrel <b>56</b>. Each of the perpendicular bearing surfaces <b>68</b> of a rib <b>64</b> provides an anchoring surface engaging the surrounding concrete to resist loading applied by a tensioned bolt. The spacing of the bearing surfaces <b>68</b> along the rib <b>64</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, serves to distribute forces thereby promoting more efficient and uniform transfer of applied loading between the insert <b>54</b> and the surrounding concrete and between the barrel <b>56</b> and the base <b>62</b>. The efficient distribution of applied load limits wedging failures associated with prior art plastic inserts that had undesirably reduced shear cone size, and therefore, reduced pull out force, for the insert.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The ribs <b>64</b> are not uniform in length. As shown, the ribs <b>64</b> that are shortest in length have a last stepped segment <b>66</b> remote from base <b>62</b> having a terminal end <b>67</b> that is located longitudinally along the barrel <b>56</b> adjacent to an end of the internal threads <b>60</b> formed on the barrel <b>56</b>. As shown, the ribs <b>64</b> that are shortest in length include every other rib and therefore comprise approximately one-half of the ribs <b>64</b>. Extension of the ribs <b>64</b> beyond this point along the unthreaded end portion of the barrel <b>56</b> would not significantly increase pull out force for the insert <b>54</b> because the end portion of the barrel <b>56</b> will not be stretched by a tensioned bolt. Terminating ribs <b>64</b> to the shortened length adjacent the end of the threads, therefore, desirably eliminates unnecessary material from the insert <b>54</b>. Some of the ribs <b>64</b>, however, include a last segment that extends along the unthreaded portion of the barrel <b>56</b>, as shown. These ribs provide projecting surfaces on the outer surface of the unthreaded portion of the barrel to facilitate removal of the insert <b>54</b> from the mold during manufacture. To optimize material reduction, however, only a portion of these ribs include a last segment that extends substantially to the proximal end of the barrel <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the longitudinal length of the segments <b>66</b> of a given rib <b>64</b> is different from that of adjacently located ribs. As a result, the bearing surfaces <b>68</b> are staggered such that the bearing surfaces of each of the ribs <b>64</b> is offset longitudinally with respect to those of adjacently located ribs <b>64</b>. This arrangement desirably limits the formation of propagating shear cracks compared to a construction having uniformly located bearing surfaces such that a shear crack could propagate circumferentially around the barrel <b>56</b> at a given longitudinal location.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is shown an alternative insert <b>70</b> including an internally threaded barrel <b>72</b>, a base <b>74</b>, and interconnecting ribs <b>76</b> having stepped segments <b>78</b> defining perpendicular bearing surfaces <b>80</b> to promote efficient load distribution. The ribs <b>76</b> have varying lengths and incorporate varying segment lengths to stagger the bearing surfaces <b>80</b> in a similar fashion as insert <b>54</b>. As may be seen by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, however, insert <b>70</b> is adapted for receipt of a bolt having a relatively large bolt diameter to length ratio compared to that associated with insert <b>54</b>. Accordingly, the ribs <b>76</b> of insert <b>70</b> include fewer stepped segments <b>78</b> on average compared to the ribs <b>64</b> of insert <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The load distribution provided by the stepped configuration of inserts <b>54</b>, <b>70</b> desirably increases shear cone size created in the surrounding concrete over prior plastic inserts to that approaching the shear cone sizes created by corresponding sized metal inserts. Increased shear cone size results in increase in pull out force. It was found that thermoplastic inserts incorporating the stepped rib construction of the present invention provided an increase of 10 to 30 percent over similarly sized plastic inserts of the prior art having tapering ribs. Using injection molded plastic material, the stepped configuration of inserts <b>54</b>, <b>70</b> can also be accomplished without increasing mold cycle time and without complicating the moldability of the insert. In fact, it was found that the stepped rib construction of the present invention actually resulted in reduction in material and a corresponding reduction in mold cycle time because of reduced time required for curing. The reduction in material and mold cycle time was found to provide a reduction in production costs of approximately 30 percent.</p>
