In one embodiment, the material used for the slide blocks <b>111</b> and the guides <b>114</b> and the surface characteristics of the slide blocks <b>111</b> and the guides <b>114</b> are chosen to reduce the coefficient of friction between the slide blocks <b>111</b> and the guides <b>114</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Guide links <b>110</b> restrict the motion of foot links <b>108</b> such that the pivot point <b>138</b> between foot links <b>108</b> and intermediate frame <b>32</b> is restrained to move vertically without moving horizontally.

This restrained movement prevents intermediate frame <b>32</b> from moving through an arc while moving between the upper position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the lower position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> so that intermediate frame <b>32</b> can be raised and lowered without requiring additional hospital room for clearance.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">It will be appreciated that, in order for guide links <b>110</b> to perform the restriction function, the distance between pivots <b>140</b> (pivot between guide link <b>110</b> and foot link <b>108</b>) and <b>142</b> (pivot between guide links <b>110</b> and base frame <b>28</b>) of guide links <b>110</b> is one half the distance between pivot <b>126</b> (pivot between slide blocks <b>128</b> and base frame <b>28</b>) and pivot <b>138</b> (pivot between upper ends <b>134</b> of foot links <b>108</b> and intermediate frame <b>32</b>).

<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, deck support <b>24</b> is in an upper position when actuators <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>are both extended. Deck support <b>24</b> is moved from the upper position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to the Trendelenburg position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> by retracting actuator <b>48</b><i>a </i>and thus lowering head end <b>102</b> of intermediate frame <b>32</b>. Deck support <b>24</b> is returned to the upper position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by extending actuator <b>48</b><i>a </i>back to its prior length. Deck support <b>24</b> is moved from the upper position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to the Reverse Trendelenburg position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> by retracting actuator <b>48</b><i>b </i>and thus lowering foot end <b>104</b>. Deck support <b>24</b> is returned to the upper position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by extending actuator <b>48</b><i>b </i>back to its prior length.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Deck support <b>24</b> is moved from the upper position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to the lowered position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by simultaneously retracting actuators <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>and thus lowering both head end <b>102</b> and foot end <b>104</b> of intermediate frame <b>32</b>. Deck support <b>24</b> is moved back to the upper position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> from the lowered position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> by simultaneously extending actuators <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b</i>. It should be appreciated that actuators <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>can place the patient support <b>10</b> in a variety of positions from any starting position and that the upper position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is simply a reference starting position used to explain the operation of the deck support.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Since actuators <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>retract and extend at substantially the same rates, the simultaneous retraction of actuators <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>causes intermediate frame <b>32</b> to be maintained in a generally horizontal position as it is vertically transitioned from the upper position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to the lowered position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and then raised back again to the upper position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Further, control system <b>44</b> is configured to control each actuator <b>48</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>and therefore can independently control the speed of each actuator <b>48</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>. Also, as discussed above, guide links <b>110</b> are configured to generally maintain the vertical alignment of intermediate frame <b>32</b> and base frame <b>28</b> such that intermediate frame <b>32</b> does not “swing” outwardly or inwardly relative to base frame <b>28</b> as intermediate frame <b>32</b> is transitioned between various positions.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">One of the purposes of intermediate frame <b>32</b> being configured to raise and lower relative to base frame <b>28</b> is to aid in the ingress of a patient to and egress of a patient from patient support <b>10</b>. To allow intermediate frame <b>32</b> to lower further and thus provide additional assistance in the ingress to and egress of the patient from patient support <b>10</b>, patient support <b>10</b> is configured to provide a lowered position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, wherein portions of deck support <b>24</b> nest within other portions of deck support <b>24</b>. Thus, an overall height <b>183</b> of deck support <b>24</b> and, in turn, an overall height of mattress <b>14</b> is reduced. Further, by placing patient support <b>10</b> in the lowered position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the possibility of patient injury due to accidental egress from patient support <b>10</b> is reduced due to the fact that the patient is closer to the floor <b>29</b> than in conventional patient supports.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Nesting Frames</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, portions of intermediate frame <b>32</b> are configured to nest within base frame <b>28</b> and/or extend below base frame <b>28</b> when intermediate frame is in the lowered position. Alternatively, the base frame <b>28</b> can be configured to nest within the intermediate frame <b>32</b> when the intermediate frame <b>32</b> is in the lowered position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, longitudinally-extending members <b>184</b>, <b>186</b> of intermediate frame <b>32</b> define a first outer width <b>188</b> of intermediate frame <b>32</b> that is less than an inner width <b>190</b> defined by longitudinally extending members <b>192</b>, <b>194</b> of base frame <b>28</b> and lifting arms <b>34</b>. Further, an outer length <b>195</b> of intermediate frame <b>32</b> is less than an inner length <b>197</b> of base frame <b>28</b> and lifting arms <b>34</b>, illustratively shown as the separation between cross link <b>185</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 8</figref>, of head links <b>106</b> and cross link <b>187</b> of foot links <b>108</b>. As such, as intermediate frame <b>32</b> is lowered to the lowered position, portions of intermediate frame <b>32</b> are received within an interior region <b>196</b> defined by base frame <b>28</b> and lifting arms <b>34</b>, thereby reducing overall height <b>183</b> of deck support <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">It should be noted that when deck support <b>24</b> is in the lowered position, head links <b>106</b>, foot links <b>108</b> and guide links <b>110</b> are rotated beyond horizontal, such that pivots <b>126</b>, <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> are generally lower than pivots <b>142</b>, <b>143</b>, <b>144</b>. In one embodiment, head links <b>106</b>, foot links <b>108</b> and guide links <b>110</b> are generally rotated from approximately 80° above horizontal in the upper position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to approximately 10° below horizontal in the lowered position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, intermediate frame <b>32</b> includes a plurality of gussets <b>208</b> which each include a stop surface <b>210</b>. Stop surface <b>210</b> is configured to contact and rest upon foot links <b>104</b> and head links <b>106</b>, respectively, when intermediate frame <b>32</b> is fully lowered. Stop surfaces <b>210</b> are configured to prevent other portions of patient support <b>10</b>, such as siderails <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, from contacting base frame <b>28</b>. Alternatively, the stop surface <b>210</b> is configured to contact and rest upon the base frame <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">It is further contemplated that portions of weigh frame <b>36</b> are configured to nest within base frame <b>28</b> when intermediate frame <b>32</b> is in the lowered position.

Further, an outer length <b>204</b> of weigh frame <b>36</b> may be less than inner length <b>197</b> of base frame <b>28</b> and lifting arms <b>34</b>. As such, as intermediate frame <b>32</b> is lowered to the lowered position, portions of weigh frame <b>36</b> as well as intermediate frame <b>32</b> may nest within or extend below base frame <b>28</b> thereby further reducing overall height <b>183</b> of deck support <b>24</b>.</p>

As such, second leg section member <b>292</b> is configured to slide over first leg section member <b>290</b> as leg section <b>42</b> is translated between an extended position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) and a retracted position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>), or between a retracted position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) and an extended position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). Alternatively, the first leg section member <b>290</b> is configured to slide over the second leg section member <b>292</b> as the leg section <b>42</b> is translated between an extended position and a retracted position, or between a retracted position and an extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 20</figref>, second leg section member <b>292</b> is translated relative to first leg section member <b>290</b> by actuator <b>48</b><i>f</i>.

In the illustrated embodiment, first end <b>302</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>f </i>is coupled to a bracket <b>303</b> of first leg section member <b>290</b>. Similarly, second end <b>304</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>f </i>is coupled to a bracket <b>305</b> of second leg section member <b>292</b>. To extend second leg section member <b>292</b> relative to first leg section member <b>290</b>, cylinder rod <b>172</b><i>f </i>of actuator <b>48</b><i>f </i>is extended. To retract second leg section member <b>292</b> relative to first leg section member <b>290</b>, cylinder rod <b>172</b><i>f </i>of actuator <b>48</b><i>f </i>is retracted.

Separator <b>316</b> is made of a material, such as plastic, that assists in the movement of second leg section member <b>292</b> relative to first leg section member <b>290</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, separator <b>316</b> includes a plurality of flexible finger members <b>318</b> which are coupled to second leg section member <b>292</b> and contact first leg section member <b>290</b>. Fingers <b>318</b> are connected to second leg section member <b>292</b> to maintain the position of fingers <b>318</b> at the interface between first leg section member <b>290</b> and second leg section member <b>292</b>.

<p id="p-0242" num="0241">In alternative embodiments other suitable extendable foot sections <b>42</b> may be used. Illustrative suitable foot sections include the patient supports and corresponding foot sections described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,212,714 issued Apr. 10, 2001 to Allen et al., the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,163,903 issued Dec. 26, 2000 to Weismiller et al., the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">As previously mentioned, leg section <b>42</b> of deck <b>26</b> is adjustable in length so that it can be moved from a retracted position to an extended position. Preferably, the length of leg section <b>42</b> is adjusted depending upon the height of the patient positioned on mattress <b>14</b> so that the patient's foot is positioned adjacent to footboard <b>18</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, leg section <b>42</b> is extended to position the heels of a tall patient adjacent to footboard <b>18</b>. Leg section <b>42</b> is retracted to position the heels of a shorter patient adjacent to footboard <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Also illustratively, mattress <b>14</b> is configured to be extended and retracted with leg section <b>42</b> as discussed in more detail herein. As such, the heel of the patient may be maintained over a given section of mattress <b>14</b>, such as heel pressure relief member <b>2154</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 93-95</figref>) which is configured to provide heel-pressure relief.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">According one embodiment of the present disclosure, the length of leg section <b>42</b> corresponds to the position of head section <b>38</b>. For example, if head section <b>38</b> is raised to the titled position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, leg section <b>42</b> of deck <b>26</b> is controlled by control system <b>44</b> to automatically extend by a given distance. If head section <b>38</b> is lowered, leg section <b>42</b> is controlled by control system <b>44</b> to automatically retract to its pre-extended position. More particularly, control system <b>44</b> coordinates movement of head section <b>38</b> and leg section <b>42</b> by simultaneously controlling actuators <b>48</b><i>c </i>and <b>48</b><i>f</i>. By corresponding the extension and retraction of leg section <b>42</b> with the movement of head section <b>38</b>, the patient's foot is maintained above heel pressure relief member <b>2154</b> of mattress <b>14</b>. Furthermore, if footboard <b>18</b> is used as a foot prop, the patient's foot is maintained at a steady distance relative to footboard <b>18</b> during raising and lowering of head section <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Preferably, the degree of automatic extension of leg section <b>42</b> is a function of the angle of head section <b>38</b>. The further up head section <b>38</b> is raised from a generally linear relationship with seat section <b>40</b>, the more leg section <b>42</b> is extended so that heel pressure relief member <b>2154</b> is continuously positioned under the patient's heel throughout the range of motion of head section <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Mattress Deck Articulation</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">As stated previously, patient support <b>10</b> is positionable in a plurality of positions. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref> and <b>22</b>, head section <b>38</b>, seat section <b>40</b> and leg section <b>42</b> are in a linear relationship relative to each other. In one illustrative embodiment, head section <b>38</b>, seat section <b>40</b> and leg section <b>42</b> are placed in the linear relationship by control system <b>44</b> in response to a single button being depressed on one of controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, head section <b>38</b> is rotated about pivot <b>232</b> such that second end <b>235</b> is raised relative to first end <b>231</b>. Second end <b>235</b> is raised by control system <b>44</b> controlling actuator <b>48</b><i>c </i>to further extend cylinder <b>172</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>c</i>. In one illustrative embodiment, head section <b>38</b> is raised by control system <b>44</b> in response a first button being depressed on one of controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> and lowered by control system <b>44</b> in response to a second button being depressed on same controller <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Also, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, seat section <b>40</b> is rotated about pivot <b>237</b> such that second end <b>239</b> is raised relative to first end. Second end <b>239</b> is raised by control system <b>44</b> controlling actuator <b>48</b><i>d </i>to further extend cylinder <b>172</b><i>d </i>of actuator <b>48</b><i>d</i>. Leg section <b>42</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, is raised due to the rotation of seat section <b>40</b> and the coupling of leg section <b>42</b> to seat section <b>40</b>, but leg section <b>42</b> remains in a generally horizontal position due to the rotation of actuator <b>48</b><i>e</i>. In one illustrative embodiment, seat section <b>40</b> is raised by control system <b>44</b> in response to a first button being depressed on same and lowered by control system <b>44</b> in response to a second button being depressed on the same controller <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, head section <b>38</b> and seat section <b>40</b> are in generally the same position as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. However, second end <b>250</b> of leg section <b>42</b> has been lowered such that second end <b>250</b> is lower relative to first end <b>244</b>. Second end <b>250</b> is lowered relative to first end <b>244</b> by control system <b>44</b> controlling actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>to further retract cylinder <b>172</b><i>e </i>of actuator <b>48</b><i>e</i>. In one illustrative embodiment, head section <b>38</b>, seat section <b>40</b> and leg section <b>42</b> are placed in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by control system <b>44</b> in response to a chair button on one of controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> being depressed. In an alternate embodiment, the leg section <b>42</b> is raised by control system <b>44</b> in response to a leg section up button being depressed on one of the controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and lowered by control system <b>44</b> in response to a leg section down button being depressed on the same controller <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>, the weight of actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>and leg section <b>42</b> maintains a first end <b>320</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>adjacent a first end <b>322</b> of slot <b>324</b> in bracket <b>246</b> as cylinder <b>172</b><i>e </i>of actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>is retracted, as opposed to first end <b>320</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>traveling towards a second end <b>326</b> of slot <b>324</b>. The configuration of deck in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an illustrative first chair-like position.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">Further, leg section actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>is lengthened by control system <b>44</b> when seat section <b>40</b> is lowered from the elevated position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Leg section actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>is lengthened to prevent any interference between leg section <b>42</b> and seat section <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates leg section <b>42</b> not being movable between the position of leg section <b>42</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and the position of leg section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, due to an obstruction <b>330</b> impeding the movement of leg section <b>42</b>. Example obstructions include a cart, a wheelchair, a table, a trashcan or any other item. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when leg section <b>42</b> encounters obstruction <b>330</b> first end <b>320</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>travels along elongated slot <b>324</b> in the direction of arrow <b>325</b> toward second end <b>326</b> of slot <b>324</b>. As such, slot <b>324</b> serves as a safety device to avoid crushing obstruction <b>330</b> and to avoid destruction of actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>and damage to patient support <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">The length of slot <b>324</b> is selected to allow actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>to move from a fully extended position to a fully retracted position while first end <b>320</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>travels in slot <b>324</b>. As such, actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>will encounter the end of its range of motion or travel (fully retracted) before or coincident with first end <b>320</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>reaching second end <b>326</b> of slot <b>324</b>. Therefore, leg section <b>42</b> will not crush or otherwise damage obstruction <b>330</b> due to the continued pressure applied by actuator <b>48</b><i>e</i>, actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>will not be damaged due to a larger than expected load being placed on actuator <b>48</b><i>e</i>, and patient support <b>10</b> will not be damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Alternative methods may be used to keep the leg section <b>42</b> from damaging the obstruction and to keep from damaging the actuator <b>48</b><i>e</i>. A first example is to monitor the load placed on the actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>with the control system <b>44</b> and to disengage or reverse the motion of the actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>in response to a larger than expected load for retracting the actuator <b>48</b><i>e</i>. A second example is to place a pressure sensor along the bottom of the leg section <b>42</b> and to disengage the actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>when a higher than expected pressure is detected. An illustrative sensor may be the obstacle detection system of the present invention disclosed herein. Other known safety systems may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">In alternative embodiments, the elongated slot <b>324</b> is located on the bracket <b>248</b> attached to the weigh frame <b>36</b> and the actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>is pivotably coupled to the leg section <b>42</b> and slidably and pivotably coupled to the weigh frame <b>36</b>. In a further alternative embodiment, the elongated slot <b>324</b> is located on the joint between the leg section <b>42</b> and the seat section <b>40</b> such that the leg section <b>42</b> and the seat section <b>40</b> are pivotably and slidably coupled, the leg section <b>42</b> and the actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>are pivotably coupled and the actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>and the weigh frame <b>36</b> are pivotably coupled. In still further alternative embodiments, the elongated slot <b>324</b> feature is incorporated into the configuration for the head section <b>38</b>, is incorporated into the configuration for the seat section <b>40</b>, or is incorporated into the lifting arms <b>34</b> configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a second chair-like configuration of patient support <b>10</b> is shown. Head section <b>38</b>, seat section <b>40</b> and leg section <b>42</b> of deck <b>26</b> are generally oriented relative to intermediate frame <b>32</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. However, deck support <b>24</b> is positioned generally in a Reverse Trendelenburg position, wherein foot end <b>104</b> of intermediate frame <b>32</b> is lower than head end <b>102</b> of intermediate frame <b>32</b>. Deck support <b>24</b> is placed in the second chair-like position by retracting actuator <b>48</b><i>b</i>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and thus lowering foot links <b>108</b>. In one illustrative embodiment, patient support <b>10</b> is placed in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> by control system <b>44</b> in response to a first button being depressed on one of controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> and in response to a second button being depressed on one of controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the patient support is placed in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> in response to a button being depressed on the controllers. In a further alternate embodiment, the patient support <b>10</b> is placed in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in response to a first chair button on one of controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> being depressed and is placed in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> in response to a second chair button on the same controller <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> being depressed.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">A further safety device <b>340</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and is coupled to leg section <b>42</b>. Safety device <b>340</b> includes bracket <b>305</b> rigidly coupled to leg section <b>42</b> and a roller <b>344</b> rotatably coupled to bracket <b>305</b>. Safety device <b>340</b> similar to slot <b>324</b> protects patient support <b>10</b> from damage and also protects an obstruction, such as obstruction <b>330</b> or the floor <b>29</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), from damage. Alternatively, the roller <b>344</b> of the safety device <b>340</b> is directly coupled to or integrated with the leg section <b>42</b>, thereby eliminating the bracket <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, patient support <b>10</b> is transitioned to the second-chair like configuration, however either due to the fact that leg section <b>42</b> is extended, discussed in more detail herein, or that deck support <b>24</b> is somewhat lowered, second end <b>250</b> of leg section <b>42</b> contacts the floor and could potentially be damaged prior to patient support <b>10</b> fully transitioning to the second chair like position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, safety device <b>340</b> is configured to translate second end <b>250</b> of leg section <b>42</b> in a direction <b>341</b> while leg section <b>42</b> rotates in a direction <b>343</b> to avoid damage to leg section <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">As second end <b>250</b> of leg section <b>42</b> is translated in direction <b>341</b> and leg section <b>42</b> is rotated in direction <b>343</b> relative to seat section, first end <b>320</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>is traveling within slot <b>324</b>. As discussed earlier in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, slot <b>324</b> allows the actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>to continue to retract without further lowering leg section <b>42</b>. However, in the current case, wherein patient support <b>10</b> is transitioning from the first chair-like configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to the second chair-like configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>is not retracting. In the current case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, first end <b>320</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>e</i>, a fixed link (since not retracting or extending), travels within slot <b>324</b> and thus leg section <b>42</b> rotates to avoid crushing the obstruction or causing damage to the patient support <b>10</b>. As such, safety device <b>340</b> functions in concert with slot <b>324</b>. It should be appreciated that roller <b>344</b> reduces the friction between the floor <b>29</b> and leg section <b>42</b>, thereby allowing leg section <b>42</b> to more easily rotate and translate.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">A further instance wherein safety device <b>340</b> protects both leg section <b>42</b> and an obstruction from damage is when deck <b>26</b> is in a linear configuration with leg section <b>42</b> in an extended position and the patient support <b>10</b> is moved to a Reverse Trendelenburg position from a low position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, patient support <b>10</b> is transitioning from a low position, wherein both actuators <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b</i>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, are generally retracted, to a Reverse Trendelenburg position, wherein actuator <b>48</b><i>b </i>remains generally retracted and actuator <b>48</b><i>a </i>is generally extended to raise head end <b>102</b> of intermediate frame <b>32</b> relative to foot end <b>104</b>. In such a configuration, the second end <b>250</b> of leg section <b>42</b> could either contact the floor <b>29</b> or an obstruction <b>348</b>, such as a foot. In either case, safety device <b>340</b> and safety device <b>324</b> cooperate to rotate leg section <b>42</b> relative to seat section <b>40</b> and thereby reduce the likelihood of damage to both leg section <b>42</b> and the obstruction <b>348</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">CPR Configuration</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">Often it is required to configure patient support <b>10</b> in a CPR configuration which is tailored to assist a caregiver in providing CPR to the patient supported on patient support <b>10</b>. In one illustrative example, a CPR configuration is defined by placing the head, seat and leg sections <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> in a generally linear relationship and to inflate an upper bladder assembly <b>2122</b> to an elevated or a maximum pressure in the manner further described herein. In a further illustrative CPR configuration, the head, seat and leg sections <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are placed in a generally linear relationship, the upper bladder assembly <b>2122</b> is inflated to an elevated or a maximum pressure and decking support <b>24</b> is oriented such that head end <b>102</b> is lower relative to foot end <b>104</b>, generally a Trendelenburg position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">Patient support <b>10</b> may be placed in the preferred CPR configuration by providing an indication to control system <b>44</b> which in turn controls actuators <b>48</b><i>c</i>, <b>48</b><i>d</i>, <b>48</b><i>e </i>to place head, seat, and leg sections <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> in a generally linear relationship, controls pump <b>64</b> to inflate upper bladder assembly <b>2122</b> to the desired pressure, and controls actuators <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>of deck support <b>24</b> to lower head end <b>102</b> relative to foot end <b>104</b>. The details of control system <b>44</b> and how control system <b>44</b> controls actuators <b>48</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>and pump <b>64</b> are further described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">Illustratively, patient support <b>10</b> is placed in the preferred CPR configuration by manually lowering head section <b>38</b> to a lowered position and providing an indication to control system <b>44</b> which, in turn, controls actuators <b>48</b><i>d </i>and <b>48</b><i>e </i>to place head, seat and leg sections <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> in a linear relationship, controls pump <b>64</b> to inflate upper bladder assembly <b>2122</b> to the desired pressure, and controls actuators <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>of deck support <b>24</b> to lower head end <b>102</b> relative to foot end <b>104</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, both the manual lowering of head section <b>38</b> and the providing of an indication to control system <b>44</b> are initiated by the actuation of a first or user input <b>350</b> from a first state corresponding to an off or inactive condition to a second state corresponding to an on or active condition and are continued as long as first input <b>350</b> remains in the on or active condition.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>, first input <b>350</b> includes a handle <b>352</b> positioned adjacent a longitudinal side of head section <b>38</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, a pair of first inputs <b>350</b> are provided, each first input member <b>350</b> being supported adjacent opposing right or left longitudinal sides of the head section <b>38</b>. In the following description, the first inputs <b>350</b> and related components adjacent the left and right sides will be specifically identified by the respective reference number followed by reference letter “a” or “b”. It should be appreciated that both first inputs <b>350</b><i>a </i>and <b>350</b><i>b </i>have identical components and are mirror images of each other. Further, each first input <b>350</b><i>a </i>and <b>350</b><i>b </i>is configured to function independently of the other first input <b>350</b><i>a </i>and <b>350</b><i>b</i>. Each handle <b>352</b> is coupled to a handle bracket <b>354</b> which is rotatably coupled to a bracket <b>356</b> which is rigidly coupled to head section <b>38</b>. Handle bracket <b>354</b> is rotatably coupled to bracket <b>356</b> by a first fastener <b>358</b>. The degree of rotation of handle bracket <b>354</b> relative to bracket <b>356</b> is limited by a stop, illustratively fastener <b>360</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>), which is received in an elongated slot <b>362</b> in handle bracket <b>354</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">In one illustrative embodiment, handle <b>352</b> includes an indicia <b>353</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, that indicates that the handle corresponds to a CPR condition. Illustrative indicia includes wording such as “CPR” or other text, color-coding, embossed characters or combinations thereof. In alternative embodiments, the indicia is a part of a pedal, a button, a switch, a lever arm, or other suitable actuatable members Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, each handle bracket <b>354</b> includes a flange <b>364</b> that is configured to couple a first end <b>366</b> of a cable <b>368</b>. Bracket <b>356</b> includes a flange <b>370</b> configured to couple a first end <b>372</b> of a cable housing <b>374</b>. Cable <b>368</b> is free to translate or move within cable housing <b>374</b>. As such, as handle bracket <b>354</b> is rotated in direction <b>376</b> relative to bracket <b>356</b>, cable <b>368</b> is extended from cable housing <b>374</b> generally in direction <b>378</b>. As explained later, cable <b>368</b> biases in direction <b>380</b>, in the absence of an external force applied to handle <b>352</b>, thereby causing handle bracket <b>354</b> and handle <b>352</b> to rotate in direction <b>381</b>, opposite direction <b>376</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-28</figref>, a second end <b>382</b> of each cable <b>368</b> and a second end <b>384</b> of each cable housing <b>374</b> are coupled to an actuator assembly <b>386</b> which, in turn, is coupled to actuator <b>48</b><i>c</i>. Actuator assembly <b>386</b> includes a housing <b>388</b> coupled to cylinder rod <b>172</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>c </i>by retainers <b>390</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>. Flange <b>392</b> extends from a top portion <b>394</b> of housing <b>388</b> and is configured to couple to second end <b>384</b> of each cable housing <b>374</b>. A slide bracket <b>396</b> is slidably coupled to top portion <b>394</b> of housing <b>388</b>. Slide bracket <b>396</b> receives second end <b>382</b> of each cable <b>368</b> in one of the plurality of slots <b>400</b> defined by a plurality of upwardly extending flanges <b>402</b> of slide bracket <b>396</b>. A further flange <b>404</b> of slide bracket <b>396</b> is coupled to a release pin <b>406</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>c</i>. As known in the art, release pin <b>406</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>c </i>is configured to allow cylinder rod <b>172</b><i>c </i>of actuator <b>48</b><i>c </i>to freely move relative to cylinder body <b>170</b><i>c</i>, such that rod <b>172</b><i>c </i>can be freely extended from or retracted within cylinder body <b>170</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">Slide bracket <b>396</b> is coupled to each handle bracket <b>354</b> through cables <b>368</b>. As such, the rotation of either handle <b>352</b><i>a</i>, <b>352</b><i>b </i>by a caregiver rotates respective handle bracket <b>354</b><i>a</i>, <b>354</b><i>b </i>which, in turn, translates first end <b>366</b><i>a</i>, <b>366</b><i>b </i>of cable <b>368</b><i>a</i>, <b>368</b><i>b </i>away from first end <b>372</b><i>a</i>, <b>372</b><i>b </i>of cable housing <b>374</b><i>a</i>, <b>374</b><i>b</i>, which translates second end <b>382</b><i>a</i>, <b>382</b><i>b </i>of cable <b>368</b><i>a</i>, <b>368</b><i>b </i>toward second end <b>384</b><i>a</i>, <b>384</b><i>b </i>of cable housing <b>374</b><i>a</i>, <b>374</b><i>b </i>in a direction <b>408</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). The translation of either cable <b>368</b><i>a</i>, <b>368</b><i>b </i>in direction <b>408</b> translates both slide bracket <b>396</b> and release pin <b>406</b> in direction <b>408</b>. As such, while the caregiver keeps either handle <b>352</b><i>a</i>, <b>352</b><i>b </i>in its rotated position, cylinder rod <b>172</b><i>c </i>of actuator <b>48</b><i>c </i>is freely moveable relative to cylinder body <b>170</b><i>c </i>of actuator <b>48</b><i>c </i>and head section <b>38</b> may be manually lowered or raised.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">As known in the art, release pin <b>406</b> is biased in direction <b>410</b> counter to direction <b>408</b>. As release pin <b>406</b> moves in direction <b>410</b>, cylinder rod <b>172</b><i>c </i>of actuator <b>48</b><i>c </i>is no longer freely movable relative to cylinder body <b>170</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>c</i>. Therefore, when the caregiver releases both handles <b>352</b><i>a</i>, <b>352</b><i>b </i>release pin <b>406</b> due to its bias translates slide bracket <b>396</b> in direction <b>410</b> which in turn through respective cables <b>368</b><i>a</i>, <b>368</b><i>b </i>rotates handle bracket <b>354</b><i>a</i>, <b>354</b><i>b </i>and handle <b>352</b><i>a</i>, <b>352</b><i>b </i>in direction <b>381</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>). As such, actuator <b>48</b><i>c </i>is once again actuatable by control system <b>44</b> instead of manually.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, as the caregiver manually lowers head section <b>38</b>, a damper <b>430</b> is provided to reduce the rate at which head section <b>38</b> is lowered thereby ensuring that head section <b>38</b> does not abruptly move to the lowered position. Illustratively, damper <b>430</b> is a gas spring <b>432</b> which is pivotably coupled to weigh frame <b>36</b> and slidably and pivotably coupled to head section <b>38</b>. A first end <b>434</b> of gas spring <b>432</b> is received in an elongated slot <b>436</b> of a bracket <b>438</b> which is rigidly coupled to head section <b>38</b>. As head section <b>38</b> is lowered from the elevated position to an intermediate position, first end <b>434</b> of damper <b>430</b> travels from a first end <b>440</b> of slot <b>436</b>, generally corresponding to the elevated position, towards a second end <b>442</b> of slot <b>436</b>, generally corresponding to the intermediate position. In an illustrative embodiment, the intermediate position corresponds to a position approximately two-thirds of the travel distance from the elevated position to the lowered position.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">Gas spring <b>432</b> has an uncompressed state generally corresponding to head section <b>38</b> being positioned between the intermediate position and the elevated position and a compressed state generally corresponding to head section <b>38</b> being positioned between the intermediate position and the lowered position. As head section <b>38</b> moves from the intermediate position to the lowered position, first end <b>434</b> of gas spring <b>432</b> stays proximate to second end <b>442</b> of slot <b>436</b> and a rod <b>444</b> of gas spring <b>432</b> is forced to slidably move into a housing <b>446</b> of gas spring <b>432</b> against the biasing force exerted by gas spring <b>432</b>. In general, gas spring <b>432</b> prefers to be in the uncompressed state and resists movement to the compressed state. As such, gas spring <b>432</b> resists the movement of head section <b>38</b> from the intermediate position to the lowered position and thereby slows the rate of travel of head section <b>38</b> to the lowered position.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Gas spring <b>432</b> is of conventional design. In alternative embodiments, other types of dampers may be used. Example dampers include compressible foam, air bladders, compressible springs, and other suitable damping means.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, housing <b>388</b> further includes a second input or control <b>448</b> that is connected to control system <b>44</b>. Illustratively, second input/CPR release <b>448</b> is a switch which is engaged by slide bracket <b>396</b>. When switch <b>448</b> is closed, control system <b>44</b> receives an indication that switch <b>4148</b><i>s </i>been closed. Control system <b>44</b> proceeds to place the other portions of patient support <b>10</b> in the preferred CPR configuration. First, control system <b>44</b>, if needed, actuates actuators <b>48</b><i>d </i>and <b>48</b><i>e </i>to place seat section <b>40</b> and leg section <b>42</b> in a linear relationship with head section <b>38</b> corresponding to head section <b>38</b> being in a lowered position. Second, control system <b>44</b>, if needed, inflates upper bladder assembly <b>2122</b> to the desired pressure. Third, control system <b>44</b>, if needed, actuates actuators <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>to lower head end <b>102</b> of decking support <b>24</b> relative to foot end <b>104</b> of decking support <b>24</b>. If switch <b>448</b> remains closed, control system <b>44</b> preferably lowers head end <b>102</b> about 12° to about 15° relative to foot end <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">If switch <b>448</b> is opened as a result of the caregiver releasing handle <b>352</b> before control system <b>44</b> completes the aforementioned tasks, control system <b>44</b> aborts the uncompleted tasks. For example, if the caregiver could release handle <b>352</b> when head end <b>102</b> is approximately 5° lower than foot end <b>104</b>. It is understood that switch <b>448</b> may be located in a variety of locations and activated in a variety of ways. For instance, switch <b>448</b> may be placed on handle <b>352</b> or handle bracket <b>354</b>. In alternate embodiments, the handle <b>352</b> is replaced by a foot pedal, a button, a switch, a lever arm or other suitable actuatable members.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, a second embodiment slide bracket <b>420</b> is shown. Slide bracket <b>420</b> is made from a plastic material and generally functions similar to slide bracket <b>396</b>. Slide bracket <b>420</b> is slidably coupled to housing <b>388</b>, is coupled to release pin <b>406</b>, and is configured to engage switch <b>448</b>. Slide bracket <b>420</b> is further coupled to second ends <b>3822</b>, <b>382</b><i>b </i>of cable <b>368</b><i>a</i>, <b>368</b><i>b. </i></p>

Each caster device <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d </i>is associated with a foot brake pedal <b>452</b><i>a</i>, <b>452</b><i>b</i>, <b>452</b><i>c</i>, <b>452</b><i>d</i>. To simultaneously brake all caster devices <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d</i>, the caregiver steps on one of foot brake pedals <b>452</b> and caster braking system <b>450</b> locks all four caster devices <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d </i>against rolling.

According to alternative embodiments of the present disclosure other configurations of caster braking and/or steering systems with or without simultaneous locking functions are provided for use with the foot brake pedal <b>452</b> and caster-brake link of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 31</figref>, a first end <b>455</b> of hexagonal shaft <b>453</b> is coupled to foot pedal <b>452</b>.

Rods <b>457</b><i>a</i>, <b>457</b><i>b </i>interconnect transversely spaced caster pairs <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b </i>and <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d</i>, respectively. Rod <b>457</b><i>a </i>is coupled to hexagonal shafts <b>453</b><i>a </i>and <b>453</b><i>b </i>and rod <b>457</b> is coupled to hexagonal shafts <b>453</b><i>c </i>and <b>453</b><i>d</i>. As such, the braking of either caster device <b>30</b><i>a </i>or caster device <b>30</b><i>b </i>results in the braking of the other caster device of caster device <b>30</b><i>a </i>and caster device <b>30</b><i>b</i>. Similarly, the braking of either caster device <b>30</b><i>c </i>or caster device <b>30</b><i>d </i>results in the braking of the other caster device <b>30</b><i>c </i>or caster device <b>30</b><i>d. </i></p>

<p id="p-0282" num="0281">In operation, a caregiver depresses one of the foot pedals <b>452</b>, such as foot pedal <b>452</b><i>a</i>, to simultaneously brake all four caster devices <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d</i>. Illustratively, foot pedals <b>452</b> are shown on a first side of each caster device <b>30</b>. Alternatively, the foot pedals <b>452</b> may be located on the other side of the caster devices <b>30</b> or each caster device <b>30</b> could have more than a single foot pedal <b>452</b> associated with the caster device <b>30</b>.

<p id="p-0283" num="0282">The rotating of hexagonal shaft <b>453</b><i>a </i>in turn engages the braking mechanism (not shown) of caster device <b>30</b><i>a</i>, rotates rod <b>457</b><i>a </i>in direction <b>470</b> and rotates bracket <b>462</b><i>a </i>in direction <b>470</b>. The rotation of rod <b>457</b><i>a </i>further rotates hexagonal shaft <b>453</b><i>a </i>in direction <b>470</b> thereby engaging the brake mechanism of caster device <b>30</b><i>b</i>. The rotation of bracket <b>462</b><i>a </i>translates brake link <b>458</b><i>a </i>in a direction <b>472</b>. The translation of brake link <b>458</b><i>a </i>in direction <b>472</b> results in the rotation of bracket <b>462</b><i>c </i>in direction <b>470</b> which, in turn, rotates hexagonal shaft <b>453</b><i>c </i>in direction <b>470</b>, thereby engaging the brake mechanism of caster device <b>30</b><i>c</i>.

<p id="p-0284" num="0283">In order to unlock the caster braking system <b>450</b> of the present invention, one of the four pedals <b>452</b>, such as pedal <b>452</b><i>a </i>is rotated in a direction <b>473</b> counter to the direction <b>470</b>, thereby disengaging the braking mechanism of caster device <b>30</b><i>a</i>. The braking devices of casters <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d </i>are disengaged in a manner similar to how they are engaged through rods <b>457</b><i>a</i>, <b>457</b><i>b </i>and brake links <b>458</b><i>a</i>, <b>458</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">As stated previously, it is advantageous to lower intermediate frame <b>32</b> as low as possible to the floor to aid egress from and ingress to patient support <b>10</b> and to prevent injury in case of accidental fall from patient support <b>10</b>. The configuration of caster braking system <b>450</b> has a low profile which provides additional clearance for deck <b>26</b>, siderails <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and other patient support components as deck support <b>24</b> is lowered. As such, intermediate frame <b>32</b> can be further lowered. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, brake links <b>458</b><i>a</i>, <b>458</b><i>b </i>of caster brake system <b>450</b> extends through longitudinal frame member <b>192</b> and brake link <b>458</b><i>b </i>extends through longitudinal frame member <b>194</b>.

A control system having certain characteristics in common with control system <b>44</b> is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,771,511 (hereinafter “the '511 patent”), which is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. Unlike the peer-to-peer network described in the '511 patent, network <b>510</b> is a controller area network (CAN) having a serial bus connecting the modules, each of which includes a controller, a transceiver and associated electronics. In one embodiment, the bus includes a twisted pair of wire conductors. In general, each module is capable of transmitting data on the bus (when the bus is idle), and multiple modules can simultaneously access the bus. Information transmissions (or messages) are not addressed for receipt by a specific module. Instead, as will be further described below, each message is broadcast on the bus to all modules, and includes an identifier that each module uses to determine whether to process the message. If the message is relevant to a particular module, it is processed. Otherwise, it is ignored.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, seven modules are connected to network <b>510</b> for controlling the operation of patient support <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0288" num="0287">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35D</figref>, power supply module <b>514</b> is electrically coupled to obstacle detection device <b>58</b>, a night light <b>548</b>, foot pedal controls <b>56</b>, battery <b>46</b>, a battery charger <b>552</b>, pneumatic pump <b>64</b>, and power conditioning circuitry <b>556</b>. Power supply module <b>514</b> further includes a connector (not shown) for receiving a test device <b>558</b> for performing various diagnostic and test functions. Power conditioning circuitry <b>556</b> is connected to a conventional AC plug <b>45</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35A</figref>, scale/ppm module <b>516</b> is electrically coupled to the load cells <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> connected to weigh frame <b>36</b>, and to a bed exit sensor <b>562</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35A</figref>, dynamic surface module <b>518</b> is electrically coupled to a plurality of solenoids <b>564</b> for controlling characteristics of mattress <b>14</b>, and a plurality of pressure transducers <b>566</b> associated with mattress <b>14</b> for sensing air pressures of various components of mattress <b>14</b>. Left caregiver control module <b>520</b> is electrically coupled to first pair of permanent siderail controllers <b>52</b> mounted to left head end siderail <b>20</b>. Right caregiver control module <b>522</b> is similarly electrically coupled to first pair of permanent siderail controllers <b>54</b> mounted to right head end siderail <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0290" num="0289">It should be understood that the configuration of network <b>510</b> permits addition of new modules and subtraction of existing modules without requiring manual reconfiguration of the existing modules. When a new module is added, network <b>510</b> recognizes the module and facilitates communications between the added module and the existing modules automatically. Additionally, it should be noted that network <b>510</b> is implemented to operate as a masterless system, wherein each module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> operates substantially autonomously. One feature of network <b>510</b> is the periodic transmission of each module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> of a “heartbeat” message or status message to the bus for receipt by each of the remaining modules. In this manner, control system <b>44</b> periodically verifies the functionality of each module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> in system <b>44</b>, and is able to identify a non-operational module by the absence of the module's “heartbeat” message. As further described herein, communications by and among modules <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> are initiated by the individual modules on an event-driven basis.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">Power for control system <b>44</b> is supplied through power supply module <b>514</b>. More specifically, AC plug <b>45</b> of a power cord (not shown) secured to frame <b>12</b> is inserted into a conventional wall outlet supplying 100 VAC, 120 VAC, or 230 VAC power. Power conditioning circuitry <b>556</b> converts the AC input power to DC levels for use by the various electronic components of control system <b>44</b>. Power supply module <b>514</b> further facilitates limited functionality of patient support <b>10</b> via battery <b>46</b> when AC plug <b>45</b> is not connected to a wall outlet. Battery <b>46</b> is automatically charged by battery charger <b>552</b>, which provides a status signal to power supply module <b>514</b> to indicate the condition of the charge of battery <b>46</b>. In one embodiment, battery charger <b>552</b> permits use of battery <b>46</b> as a back-up power source that allows logic module <b>512</b> to perform (for 24 hours after AC power has been disconnected) a single operation of high-low up/down, head up/down, tilt/reverse tilt, foot retract/extend, Trendelenburg, and chair out. When AC power is applied to patient support <b>10</b>, a light emitting diode (LED) <b>737</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>) indicates the status of battery <b>46</b>. For example, the LED remains lit when battery <b>46</b> has sufficient power, blinks when battery <b>46</b> power is low, or is off when battery <b>46</b> has lost all power or is disconnected. As indicated, power supply module <b>514</b> controls the operation of pneumatic pump <b>64</b> (or a blower or other type of inflating means), which supplies air to mattress <b>14</b> (as described in greater detail below).</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">Power supply module <b>514</b> also receives the signal provided by obstacle detection device <b>58</b> as described herein. Power supply module outputs a message on network <b>510</b> when obstacle detection device <b>58</b> outputs a signal indicating the presence of an obstacle so that appropriate action can be taken to prevent injury or damage.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">Power supply module <b>514</b> also controls night light <b>548</b>. Specifically, night light <b>548</b>, which illustratively is mounted to patient support <b>10</b> at a location to illuminate the ingress/egress area of patient support <b>10</b>, is always active or on when AC power is provided to power supply module <b>514</b>. Night light <b>548</b> may be disabled or shut off during battery powered operation. As further described herein, the illumination element (not shown) of night light <b>548</b> is enclosed by a housing, which also includes circuitry (not shown) to prevent flicker.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">As further described herein, each foot pedal <b>1724</b>, <b>1726</b>, <b>1728</b>, <b>1730</b> of foot pedal controls <b>56</b> provides a signal when depressed. Power supply module <b>514</b> uses these signals to generate messages for transmission on network <b>510</b> indicating the status of pedals <b>1724</b>, <b>1726</b>, <b>1728</b>, <b>1730</b>. Logic module <b>512</b> processes such messages to determine whether foot pedal controls <b>56</b> are enabled, and to control the operation of DC motors <b>604</b> of linear actuators <b>48</b>, as further described herein. Of course, operation of DC motors <b>604</b> is conditioned upon the actual positions of the various components of patient support <b>10</b>, and upon the status of various lockout signals generated by a caregiver using siderail controllers <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">Finally, power supply module <b>514</b> functions as an input location via a connector (not shown) for test device <b>558</b>. Test device <b>558</b> is configured to operate as an additional module on network <b>510</b> for performing diagnostic operations on the various functions of patient support <b>10</b> as is further described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">Scale/ppm module <b>516</b> converts the signals from load cells <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>, described above, into actual weight measured on weigh frame <b>32</b>. This information is outputted for display on a scale display (not shown) and possible transmission to a hospital information network via sidecomm module <b>524</b> and remote network interface <b>572</b>. Scale/ppm module <b>516</b> further receives input from bed exit sensor <b>562</b>, which determines, based on the weight measured on weigh frame <b>32</b>, whether a patient has exited patient support <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">Dynamic surface module <b>518</b> controls the dynamic air surface or mattress <b>14</b>. It processes messages initiated by either of siderail controllers <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> to operate solenoids <b>564</b> (part of valve assemblies <b>2406</b>), which in turn adjust the level of inflation of mattress <b>14</b> during, for example, a turn assist procedure as further described herein. Additionally, dynamic surface module <b>518</b> receives feedback from pressure transducers <b>566</b> in the form of electrical signals that indicate pressure measurements of the various bladders of mattress <b>14</b>. Dynamic surface module <b>518</b> operates solenoids <b>564</b> in response to the feedback signals from pressure transducers <b>566</b> to achieve the desired adjustments to mattress <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">Sidecomm module <b>524</b> functions essentially as an environmental and communications interface. The nurse call, lighting, and entertainment functions are controlled by sidecomm module <b>524</b> based on inputs from siderail controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. Sidecomm module <b>524</b> outputs signals to control these functions, and communicates with the facility's communication systems via remote network interface <b>572</b>. Patient support <b>10</b> includes a connector <b>575</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>) that is configured to interface with the facility's communication system and entertainment system. Another connector (not shown) is provided to interface with the nurse call control <b>570</b> and lighting controls <b>568</b>. As such, sidecomm module <b>524</b> controls room lights, reading lights, television, radio, and communicates with the facility's nurse call network in response to activation of a nurse call switch or button mounted to patient support <b>10</b>. Through remote network interface <b>572</b>, sidecomm module <b>524</b> can provide information to the facility's information network regarding the operation of patient support <b>10</b>. For example, hours of use may be reported for billing or maintenance purposes. Moreover, sidecomm module <b>524</b> can function as an interactive data link between a remote location and patient support <b>10</b>. For example, the facility information network may request weight information on the patient occupying patient support <b>10</b>. Sidecomm module <b>524</b> can send a message on the bus identified as a weight request. The message may be processed by scale/ppm module <b>516</b>, which provides a message containing the requested weight information. Sidecomm module <b>524</b> processes the message and provides the weight information to the facility's information network via remote network interface <b>572</b>. Additionally, brake-not-set sensor <b>576</b> provides an input to sidecomm module <b>524</b> to indicate that the brake preventing movement of patient support <b>10</b> is not in a set position.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">Logic module <b>512</b> controls movement of patient support <b>10</b> and is the entry point for nearly all of the position sensors for the various components of patient support <b>10</b>. As shown, logic module <b>512</b> controls the plurality of motors <b>604</b> of linear actuators <b>48</b> connected to the moveable components (e.g., the articulating deck sections <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, etc.) of patient support <b>10</b>, as is described in detail herein. When a DC drive motor <b>604</b> is activated, a motor sensor <b>546</b> associated with the drive motor <b>604</b> provides a feedback signal to logic module from which logic module <b>512</b> can determine when to deactivate the drive motor <b>604</b>. When logic module <b>512</b> processes a message requesting movement of a particular component of patient support <b>10</b>, logic module <b>512</b> first reads the position of the component (via the appropriate sensor <b>546</b>). If movement of the component is necessary, then logic module <b>512</b> determines whether a lockout signal has been generated from either of the first or second pair of permanent siderail controllers <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. If no lockout is set, logic module <b>512</b> controls the appropriate DC drive motor <b>604</b>, while monitoring the appropriate motor sensor <b>546</b>, to move the component to the desired position.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Controller Area Network</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">In one illustrative embodiment, CAN specification 2.0B as specified in ISO 11898 is used for network <b>510</b>. Network <b>510</b> involves three of the seven network layers defined in the ISO model: the physical layer, the data link layer and the application layer. The physical layer includes the actual cabling or wires connecting modules <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>. The physical layer further includes the hardware present on each of modules <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> for enabling operation according to the CAN specifications. As indicated above, the hardware includes a transceiver for communicating with the bus and a microcontroller with a built-in CAN controller. A suitable transceiver is a TJA1054 CAN transceiver manufactured by Philips Electronics. A suitable microcontroller is a T89C51CC01 microcontroller manufactured by Amtel. The microcontroller is connected to a crystal oscillator, such as a 20 MHz crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">The data layer generates and receives the messages used for communications between modules <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> via the CAN protocol (described below).</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">The application layer complies with the CANopen specification as further described below. CANopen is an open standard based on a model including communication interface and protocol software, an object dictionary, and an application program interface. The communication interface and protocol software provides a means by which a CANopen device can transmit and receive messages over network <b>510</b>. The object dictionary is a collection of all of the system variable information communicated over network <b>510</b>. Finally, the application program interface controls how the application software interacts with the various network parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">The communication interface and protocol software includes a variety of services and protocols. One protocol that handles real-time transfer of data between modules is the Process Data Objects (PDO) protocol. Two PDO services are provided: receive (RPDO) and transmit (TPDO). RPDOs are used to obtain updated information for the object dictionary entries of a module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>. TPDOs, on the other hand, are used to transmit updated information to object dictionary entries of another module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>. According to one embodiment of the invention, eight PDOs can be used for each module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> (four configured as RPDOs and four configured as TPDOs). Each PDO can transfer up to eight bytes of information. While both PDO services share the same basic structure, TPDOs are essentially broadcast messages (any module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> could receive a TPDO), and RPDOs must be unique for each module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> that transmits. For example, power supply module <b>514</b> may send battery status information to all other modules <b>512</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> using a single TPDO. Each module <b>512</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> that needs to use the information must have a corresponding RPDO to receive the information from power supply module <b>514</b>. Moreover, each module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> that needs information from any other module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> must have a separate RPDO for the other module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>. In other words, RPDOs can only receive a message from a single module.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">PDOs are constructed from object dictionary entries in the manner depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. As shown, PDO <b>578</b> is capable of including eight bytes <b>580</b> of information. In this example, PDO <b>578</b> includes only five bytes <b>580</b> of information. The eight bytes <b>580</b> of information can come from any of a variety of different object dictionary entries (such as object dictionary entries <b>582</b> and <b>584</b>) associated with different modules, and the entire data type for the object dictionary entry does not have to be used. Where the entire data type is not used, then the number of bits specified (starting with the LSB) are used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">PDOs of control system <b>44</b> are event driven. When an object dictionary entry changes, for example, because a system variable changed, the corresponding PDO is automatically transmitted, and the object dictionary entry is automatically updated when a message is received. As explained herein, modules <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> determine which messages to process by analyzing an identifier included in the message. The identifier includes three digits in the form of x8y where x is the TPDO of the transmitting module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> and y is the module ID of the transmitting module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>. Thus, if a module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> maps one of its RPDOs with the CAN identifier <b>584</b>, it correlates to TPDO2 from module 4.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">Another protocol is the Service Data Objects (SDO) protocol, which is administered only by a master module. As indicated herein, control system <b>44</b> includes a master only when test device <b>558</b> is coupled to power supply module <b>514</b>. In that case, SDOs allow test device <b>558</b> access to any object dictionary entry present in the other modules <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">The object dictionary defines data types, communication objects, and application objects used on network <b>510</b>. The object dictionary is essentially a group of objects that are accessible via network <b>510</b> in a predefined, ordered fashion, using either SDOs or PDOs. All entries in a object dictionary use a “wxyz” format where w is 2 if used by a PDO, 3 if used by an SDO, x is the module identifier for the transmitting module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>, y is 0 if the entry includes error information, 1 if it includes status information, and 8 if it includes control information, and z is a unique value for multiple wxy entries. For example, an object dictionary entry of <b>2110</b> indicates that the information is communicated between modules <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> during normal operation (i.e., using a PDO as opposed to an SDO used only during testing and diagnostics), that module number 1 is the transmitter of the information (e.g., scale/ppm module <b>516</b>), and that it includes status information. The 0 indicates the unique value for multiple wxy entries.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">Although in a typical CANopen implementation nodes only have object dictionary entries to information generated or received by the node, in control system <b>44</b>, all PDO object dictionary entries (2xyz) are implemented in every module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> to minimize the variance in software among modules <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>. SDO entries (3xyz), however, are unique for each module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> as a result of the application specific nature of built in self test (BIST) data objects.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">Messages of the type mentioned above are transmitted and received using message frames, such as the message frame <b>586</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>. The structure of the message frames is a function of software executed by each module and configured for operation with various 8-bit 8051 family microprocessors. As already indicated, in one embodiment the software conforms to CANopen protocol for the application layer of network <b>510</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, frame <b>586</b> includes seven different bit fields including start of frame (SOF) field <b>588</b>, arbitration field <b>590</b>, control field <b>592</b>, data field <b>594</b>, CRC field <b>596</b>, acknowledge field <b>597</b>, and end of frame (EOF) field <b>598</b>. SOF field <b>588</b> indicates the beginning of message frame <b>586</b>. Arbitration field <b>590</b> includes an 11-bit base identifier, and an 18-bit identifier extension. Together, these identifiers provide the message identifier introduced above. The identifier also determines the priority of the message for use in resolving bus access competition between or among modules <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> according to a non-destructive, contention-based arbitration scheme. This scheme, as is well-known in the art, ensures that messages are sent in order of priority, and that the content of each message is preserved. Arbitration field <b>590</b> further includes a substitute remote request bit that is transmitted as a recessive bit and used to resolve priority conflicts between different frame formats. Control field <b>592</b> includes six bits: two reserved bits (r<b>0</b> and r<b>1</b>) and a four bit data length code (DLC) indicating the number of bytes in data field <b>594</b> that follows. Data field <b>594</b> may contain up to eight bytes of data. CRC field <b>596</b> includes a 15-bit cyclical redundancy check code and a recessive delimiter bit. Acknowledge field <b>597</b> includes two bits: a slot bit which is transmitted as recessive but is subsequently over written by dominant bits transmitted from any module <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> that receives the transmitted message, and a recessive delimiter bit. Finally, EOF field <b>598</b> consists of seven recessive bits. After each message frame <b>586</b>, an intermission field <b>599</b> is provided that includes three recessive bits. Thereafter, the bus is considered idle.</p>

Illustratively, timer <b>618</b> may include a single system clock <b>624</b> coupled to the CPU <b>622</b> and/or a plurality of application timers <b>625</b><i>a</i>, <b>625</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>625</b><i>n</i>, as needed to execute the various features of drive control system <b>601</b>. In general, application timers <b>625</b><i>a</i>, . . . <b>625</b><i>n </i>are incremented at a rate which is a function of the system clock <b>624</b> of CPU <b>622</b>, as is well known.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">The above-mentioned components of drive control system <b>601</b>, e.g., actuators <b>48</b>, power source <b>612</b>, and microcontroller <b>614</b> are well-known and one of ordinary skill in the art would readily be able to select the appropriate models and/or types of such components as needed to operate the articulation functions of patient support <b>10</b>. For example, memory <b>616</b> includes volatile (e.g., flash memory, RAM) and non-volatile (e.g., on-chip EEPROM) memory for storing computer programming code and data required by control system <b>601</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, on-chip EEPROM memory is used for long term data storage while flash based memory is used for storage of computer programming code and RAM memory is used for short term data storage, however, it is understood that other suitable memory configurations would work equally as well.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">Embodiments of drive control system <b>601</b> include one or more of the features described below.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">End of Travel Control System</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">In an illustrative embodiment, linear actuators <b>48</b> including DC drive motors <b>604</b> are used to drive the movement of head, seat, and leg sections <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> of patient support surface <b>10</b>. In general, actuators <b>48</b> are activated by activation by a caregiver or patient of one or more of the control buttons illustratively located on controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> (e.g., buttons <b>1520</b>, <b>1522</b> on detachable siderail controller <b>50</b>; buttons <b>1550</b>, <b>1551</b>, <b>1564</b>, <b>1566</b>, <b>1574</b> on first siderail controllers <b>52</b>; buttons <b>1628</b>, <b>1624</b>, <b>1626</b> on controllers <b>54</b>) or one or more of the pedals of the foot pedal controls <b>56</b>. As common with most linear actuators, failure of any of actuators <b>48</b> may occur if a drive or rod reaches its mechanical end of travel, for example, due to a heavy load on the actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">It is known to provide an actuator with an electrical end of travel that is defined to occur earlier than the mechanical end of travel to prevent the actuator from reaching its mechanical end of travel. Using the electrical end of travel, a loss of current occurs when the driving component, such as a piston rod moves past the electrical end of travel. Many existing drives operate until the electrical end of travel is reached. However, in patient support surfaces such as hospital beds, reaching even the electrical end of travel may cause the drive to bounce back and forth due to hysteresis of the drive mechanism. Such oscillatory motion or bouncing may present a safety concern, particularly in drives used to raise and lower the head section of the patient support surface and in drives that power the hi/lo mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">To prevent the above-described oscillatory motion or bouncing in patient support <b>10</b>, some or all of linear actuators <b>48</b> are coupled to a closed loop end of travel control system <b>626</b>, which establishes a new end of travel setting and thus prevents the actuator from reaching either the electrical or mechanical end of travel during articulation of a section of patient support <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, at least head section actuator <b>48</b><i>c </i>and deck actuators <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>are coupled to control system <b>626</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">Another application of end of travel control system <b>626</b> relates to the CPR function of the illustrative embodiment patient support <b>10</b>. As described above, when CPR handle <b>352</b> is activated by a caregiver or operator of patient support <b>10</b>, head section <b>38</b> is mechanically lowered. Also, the actuator <b>48</b><i>d </i>for seat section <b>40</b> is automatically activated as needed to lower seat section <b>40</b> and the actuator <b>48</b><i>e </i>for leg section <b>42</b> is automatically activated as needed to raise leg section <b>42</b>, to put patient support <b>10</b> into the horizontal position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. End of travel control system <b>626</b> operates to detect when head section <b>38</b>, seat section <b>40</b> and leg section <b>42</b> have reached their respective bottom or zero positions, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Upon detection of the bottom position of head, seat and leg sections <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>, a timer is started. If the caregiver/operator continues to keep CPR handle <b>352</b> activated for a predefined period of time, patient support <b>10</b> is automatically moved into the emergency Trendelenburg position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. If CPR handle <b>352</b> is released before the predefined wait period expires, patient support <b>10</b> does not continue into the emergency Trendelenburg position. In this way, a “single action” CPR handle for moving patient support <b>10</b> into the CPR and emergency Trendelenburg positions is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">Closed loop end of travel control system <b>626</b> of the illustrative embodiment is provided in addition to any other electrical and mechanical end of travel systems. However, it is understood that in other embodiments, closed loop end of travel control system <b>626</b> may be provided in lieu of traditional end of travel systems.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">Linear actuators <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>c</i>, <b>48</b><i>d</i>, <b>48</b><i>e</i>, <b>48</b><i>f </i>are shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 18</figref>. Each actuator <b>48</b> includes DC drive motor <b>604</b> that powers linear movement of respective piston rod <b>172</b>, as is well known in the art. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, it is shown that as drive motor <b>604</b> moves piston rod <b>172</b> including load connector <b>628</b> in the direction of arrow <b>629</b>, it approaches a mechanical end of travel. The closed loop end of travel control system <b>626</b> includes a built-in feedback mechanism that continuously monitors the actual position <b>630</b> of piston rod <b>172</b> and compares the actual position <b>630</b> to a new predetermined end of travel limit <b>632</b>. The new end of travel limit <b>632</b> is set to occur earlier than either the electrical end of travel <b>634</b> or the mechanical end of travel <b>636</b> of the actuator <b>48</b>, so that it will be reached before either the electrical or mechanical end of travel <b>634</b>, <b>636</b>. Movement of the rod <b>172</b> is limited to the predetermined end of travel limit setting <b>632</b> to prevent oscillating or bouncing and to prevent rod <b>172</b> from reaching mechanical end of travel <b>636</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">In the illustrated embodiment, position detector <b>606</b> is a potentiometer located inside the housing of drive motor <b>604</b>, however, it is understood that other means for detecting position, such as a tachometer, may be used. For actuators <b>48</b> that are provided with end of travel control system <b>626</b>, potentiometer <b>606</b> has a predetermined setting approximately equal to new end of travel limit <b>632</b>. Calculation of new end of travel limit <b>632</b> is discussed below. Position detector <b>606</b> measures the current position <b>630</b> of rod <b>172</b> and compares it to new end of travel limit <b>632</b>. If the actual position <b>630</b> reaches new end of travel limit <b>632</b>, an error message or message indicating that the limit has been reached is sent to microcontroller <b>614</b>, and subsequent actions are taken as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">In certain embodiments of end of travel control system <b>626</b>, timer <b>618</b> includes an application timer <b>625</b><i>a </i>that is programmed by software to time the operation of drive motor <b>604</b>, e.g., to track the time of occurrence of each measured position <b>630</b>, as described below. Each time drive motor <b>604</b> starts, whether to perform an up or down/forward or backward motion, timer <b>625</b><i>a </i>is started. When drive motor <b>604</b> stops, timer <b>625</b><i>a </i>stops. Position information <b>630</b>, <b>632</b>, <b>634</b>, <b>636</b> and time of occurrence information are stored in memory <b>616</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> shows steps performed in the method of operation of end of travel control system <b>626</b> when a drive motor <b>604</b> is operating. Beginning at step <b>646</b>, a current position <b>630</b> of the drive rod <b>172</b> during its operation is determined. For each actuator <b>48</b>, the process associated with control system <b>626</b> identifies a known “initial” position of the drive rod <b>172</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the initial position of the drive rod <b>172</b> is the unextended position, but it is understood that any drive position could be designated as the initial position. The initial position may be different for each drive actuator <b>48</b>. The initial position for each actuator <b>48</b> is obtained by measuring the voltage across potentiometer <b>606</b> in a voltage divider circuit and converting the measured value to digital form using A/D converter <b>620</b>. The potentiometer <b>606</b> reading is representative of the movement of the drive shaft or rod <b>172</b> of drive motor <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">Based on the potentiometer <b>606</b> reading at the initial position of each drive rod <b>172</b> and the total stroke length of the drive rod <b>172</b> (typically provided by the drive manufacturer), a correlation can be made between the potentiometer <b>606</b> reading and the stroke length (e.g., with stroke length illustratively measured in millimeters). In this way, current position <b>630</b> of drive rod <b>172</b> during its travel is determined by comparing the current potentiometer <b>606</b> reading to a table of known potentiometer readings and the corresponding stroke length for drive rod <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">Typically, actual position <b>630</b> is measured on a recurring basis over predefined time intervals, such as every 20 milliseconds, as counted by timer <b>625</b><i>a</i>. In other embodiments, the time that position <b>630</b> is measured is also captured. In the illustrative embodiment, if rod <b>172</b> is traveling upward, the last position captured before current position <b>630</b> is kept in memory and used as detailed below. It is understood that the last position could be tracked during upward, downward, forward, and/or backward movement as needed. The last position, and current position <b>630</b>, along with sample times associated with each of the last position and current position <b>630</b>, are converted to digital form by A/D converter <b>620</b> and stored in memory <b>616</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">At step <b>648</b>, new end of travel limit <b>632</b> is determined in the manner described above, e.g., based on the potentiometer <b>606</b> value when the rod <b>172</b> is in the extended position. For example, in one embodiment, a look-up table stored in memory <b>616</b> is used. In another embodiment, limit <b>632</b> is calculated based on the anticipated amount of hysteresis of actuator <b>48</b>. The anticipated amount of hysteresis can be estimated as a percentage of the total stroke length of drive rod <b>172</b>. In the illustrative embodiment, the amount of hysteresis is estimated as about 1% or less of the total stroke length, however, it is understood that other suitable methods for calculating anticipated hysteresis may be used, depending on the particular type or model of drive actuator <b>48</b> being used and/or its particular application. New limit <b>632</b> is determined, for example, by adjusting electrical end of travel limit <b>634</b> by the anticipated amount of hysteresis, so that new limit <b>632</b> occurs earlier than electrical limit <b>634</b>. New limit <b>632</b> may also be based on the height of patient support <b>10</b> and/or the angle of head section <b>38</b> and/or system level noise. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, new limit <b>632</b> is calculated assuming a bed height of approximately 36 centimeters and 65-75 degrees of head angle. It is understood that the values obtained for limits <b>632</b> and <b>634</b>, stroke length, and estimated amount of hysteresis are stored in memory <b>616</b> as needed to perform the above-described calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">At step <b>650</b>, the change in position of rod <b>172</b> is analyzed. Current position <b>630</b> is compared to limit <b>632</b> using computer programming logic. In additional embodiments, a rate of change of position of rod <b>172</b>, is determined by comparing the time of measurement of current position <b>630</b> to the previously measured current position and its time of measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">It is understood by those skilled in the art that the rate of change of position of rod <b>172</b> is determined based on the position readings of potentiometer <b>606</b> and is also affected by the drive's spindle pitch. Speed and pitch data for the drive are generally provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">The rate of change of position is monitored, for example, to determine whether the drive is overloaded or whether something is interfering with the portion of the bed being moved by the drive. For instance, if a patient is attempting to raise the head end of the bed, but does not realize that the frame is caught on something, such as a window sill, the rate of change of position analysis will indicate that though the drive is running, the position has not changed as normal. As a result, an error code is generated and the motor shuts down to avoid further damage to the system or harm to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">At decision step <b>652</b>, actual position <b>630</b> is compared to limit <b>632</b>. Additionally, the rate of change of position is compared to a predetermined rate of change position limit <b>653</b> stored in memory <b>616</b>. If the actual position <b>630</b> of rod <b>172</b> has not reached limit <b>632</b>, or if the actual rate of change of position has not reached the rate of change of position limit <b>663</b>, then the process returns to step <b>646</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">The illustrated embodiments are particularly concerned with monitoring upper position and rate of change of position limits, however, it is understood that in alternative or addition, lower limits may also be defined and controlled in similar fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">If actual position <b>630</b> has reached or exceeded limit <b>632</b>, or if the actual rate of change of position has reached or exceeded the rate of change of position limit <b>653</b>, then at step <b>664</b> potentiometer <b>606</b> sends a fault condition or “limit reached” signal to microcontroller <b>614</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0333">At step <b>656</b>, microcontroller <b>614</b> handles the fault or limit reached condition. In certain embodiments, if position limit <b>632</b> is reached or exceeded, or if the rate of change of position limit <b>661</b> is reached or exceeded, microcontroller <b>614</b> recovers from the error condition by initiating application code, e.g., via a software process or internal or external reset, which resets position <b>632</b> to a zero or home position and requests actuator <b>48</b> to begin motion in the opposite direction. For instance, if limit <b>632</b> is reached during downward travel, position <b>632</b> is reset to zero and a signal to begin travel in the upward direction is issued. The process would occur in reverse, if the actuator <b>48</b> was moving in the opposite direction.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">In other embodiments, at step <b>656</b>, if position limit <b>632</b> is reached or exceeded, or if the rate of change of position limit <b>663</b> is reached or exceeded, microcontroller <b>614</b> places patient support <b>10</b> in a safe/error state that minimizes hazards to patients, caregivers, associated individuals, equipment, and/or data. For instance, microcontroller <b>614</b> may initiate a reset or signal power source <b>612</b> to interrupt, disengage, or reduce current supplied to actuator <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">At step <b>656</b>, microcontroller <b>614</b> may also set a flag to indicate to an operator that service is necessary on the affected actuator <b>48</b> or on the entire drive system. Such indication may be communicated to an operator by illuminating, blinking or flashing one or more LEDs located on one of controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, or other suitable location on patient support <b>10</b>. Different colored LEDs may be used to signal different types of errors. In the illustrated embodiment, red, green, and amber colored LEDs are used. For example, if the position <b>630</b> of actuator <b>48</b><i>c </i>of head section <b>38</b> has exceeded limit <b>634</b>, red and green LEDs may be set to blinking while an amber LED remains off. However, it is understood that any suitable combination of colors and LED activity may be used to indicate the various possible error types. Further, other conventional alarm devices may be utilized such as audible buzzers or bells.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0336">As discussed above, the rate of change of position is monitored to detect whether the drive actuator <b>48</b> is overloaded or when an interference condition exists, for example, if drive motor <b>604</b> is powered on to raise a deck section <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, but something, such as a window sill, piece of equipment, or utility cart, interferes with its movement or there is excessive weight on the deck section. The rate of change of position is determined using a potentiometer <b>660</b> or by other suitable means known in the art. In the illustrated embodiment, potentiometer <b>606</b> is used to determine the rate of change of position by measuring the rate of change of the position of drive rod <b>172</b> over time. If the rate of position change is too high or too low, an overload or interference condition is detected. In the illustrated embodiment, “too high” or “too low” means that the rate of position change is at least approximately 200% above or below the normal operating rate of change of position of drive <b>48</b> when actuated by a user (i.e., the normal rate when an “up” or “down” button is pressed to raise or lower a bed section). If an overload or interference condition is detected, based on comparison of rate of change of position to rate of change of position limit <b>653</b>, an error code will be generated at step <b>654</b> and the error condition will be handled at step <b>656</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Duty Cycle Protection</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">For safety and warranty reasons, linear actuator drive manufacturers typically set a maximum run time for their actuators. Typically, the maximum run time is specified in terms of minutes per hour, e.g., 6 minutes per hour. In view of the safety concerns of the medical environment, a reliable mechanism is needed to detect in a preventative way when an actuator's run time is approaching the predefined run time limit to prevent thermal overload of the actuators, protect against overuse of the actuators, and prolong the life of the actuators. Thus, in certain illustrative embodiments of the present invention, logic module <b>512</b> of control system <b>44</b> includes a closed loop control circuit <b>660</b> that monitors both current and drive run time. Duty cycle protection circuit <b>660</b> measures the actual run time of an actuator <b>48</b> and then prevents drive operation if a maximum run time <b>662</b> is exceeded, as described below. Circuit <b>660</b> is designed to prevent thermal protection circuit <b>670</b> (described below) from experiencing a fault condition.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> shows an illustrative embodiment method of operation of duty cycle protection circuit <b>660</b>. At step <b>688</b>, system <b>660</b> detects whether one or more actuator motors <b>604</b> are running, e.g., by detecting a signal from a motor sensor <b>546</b> or detecting that a signal to start one or more of actuators <b>48</b> has been received. In the illustrated embodiment, this occurs when any of the articulation control buttons (e.g., head up buttons <b>1551</b>, <b>1520</b>, head down buttons <b>1550</b>, <b>1522</b>, tilt button <b>1564</b>, reverse tilt button <b>1566</b>, etc.) of controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are activated (i.e., pressed by a patient or caregiver). Also, in the illustrated embodiment, articulation of a bed section will typically occur in response to activation of a control button for as long as the control button remains activated (until the travel limit is reached). If the patient or caregiver releases pressure from the control button, articulation will stop until the same button is pressed again, or another articulation button is activated. In alternative embodiments, a single press of an articulation button activates the articulation function, and a second press deactivates the articulation function.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">If an articulation signal has been received, process <b>660</b> proceeds to step <b>690</b>. At step <b>690</b>, microcontroller <b>614</b> determines which actuators <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b</i>, <b>48</b><i>c</i>, <b>48</b><i>d</i>, <b>48</b><i>e</i>, <b>48</b><i>f </i>have been activated, e.g., by reference to the correspondingly activated control button and the associated articulation function. For example, if head up button <b>1551</b> is activated, then head section actuator <b>48</b><i>c </i>is actuated. The maximum run time <b>662</b> is determined for the activated actuators <b>48</b> and stored in memory <b>616</b>. The maximum run time may <b>662</b> vary depending on the particular actuator model used and/or its particular application. As mentioned above, the maximum run time <b>662</b> is typically defined by the manufacturer of the actuator. For example, for linear actuator model LA28, made by Linak A/S, the maximum run time is currently stated as 10% or 6 minutes per hour at continuous use. In the illustrative embodiment, the duty cycles of actuators <b>48</b> range from 20% to 80%, however, it is understood that the duty cycle for a suitable actuator may fall outside this range. Further, it is understood that other methods of determining maximum run time may be used, for example, depending upon the particular function to which actuator <b>48</b> is assigned.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">At step <b>692</b>, an application timer <b>625</b><i>b </i>for circuit <b>660</b> is started, in order to keep track of how long motor(s) <b>604</b> of activated actuator(s) <b>48</b> are running. At step <b>694</b>, the actual current <b>668</b> is measured using an ammeter or other suitable means known in the art. Run time <b>666</b> is tracked by timer <b>625</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">At step <b>696</b>, measured current <b>668</b> and run time <b>666</b> are analyzed by microcontroller <b>614</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, run time <b>666</b> is evaluated by using an analysis of the rate of heat transfer in drive motor <b>604</b>. It is known that as current increases, temperature increases, and that the rate of heat transfer is a function of conductivity and temperature gradient. Thus, the rate of heat transfer can be assessed based on the change in current <b>668</b> over time.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">Before drive motor <b>604</b> has started running, e.g., when patient support <b>10</b> is first plugged in, run time <b>666</b> (e.g., the count of timer <b>625</b><i>b</i>) is initialized or set to zero. While drive motor <b>604</b> is running, timer <b>625</b><i>b </i>is incremented by a predefined amount which is based on the measured current <b>668</b>. If current <b>668</b> is high, timer <b>625</b><i>b </i>will be incremented by a greater amount, and if current <b>668</b> is low, timer <b>625</b><i>b </i>will be incremented by a lesser amount. In the illustrated embodiment, different time increments are specified for four different ranges of current, e.g., timer <b>625</b><i>b </i>is incremented by 12, 14, 16 or 18 counts based on the amount of current <b>668</b> being drawn by drive motor <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">If drive motor <b>604</b> stops running, timer <b>625</b><i>b </i>is decremented by a value “L” representative of the rate of heat transfer based on the known thermodynamics equation, q=−KΔT, where q is the rate of heat transfer per unit area, ΔT is the temperature gradient, and K is conductivity. The higher the level of the value of timer <b>625</b><i>b</i>, the greater the value “L” will be. In the illustrated embodiment, L is 1, 2, or 4 depending on how high timer <b>625</b><i>b </i>has been incremented.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">If drive motor <b>604</b> is disconnected from power source <b>612</b>, run time <b>666</b> (e.g., the count of timer <b>625</b><i>b</i>) is stored in memory <b>616</b>. In this way, system <b>660</b> accounts for the fact that drive motor <b>604</b> may not have been disconnected from power for a significant time.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">At decision step <b>698</b>, if the drive run time <b>666</b> reaches or exceeds the predetermined run time threshold <b>662</b>, the process proceeds to step <b>702</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, this is determined by comparing the count of timer <b>625</b><i>b </i>(i.e., run time <b>666</b>) to maximum run time <b>662</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">At step <b>702</b>, a fault condition is signaled and, at step <b>704</b>, the current motor function (e.g., chair head up, head down, etc.) is deactivated or turned off. Also at step <b>702</b>, logic may be used to allow certain emergency functions, such as CPR, to be activated prior to turning off the current motor function. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, CPR mode can still be activated at least one time after system <b>660</b> detects a duty cycle overrun. In response to a fault condition, microcontroller <b>614</b> may place patient support <b>10</b> in a “safe state” that minimizes hazards to patients, caregivers, associated individuals, equipment, and data, e.g., by signaling power source <b>612</b> to interrupt, disengage, or reduce current supplied to drive motor <b>604</b> of the activated actuator <b>48</b>. Microcontroller <b>614</b> may also activate an audible or visual indicator to alert an operator that service is necessary on the affected drive or on the entire system. Such indication may be communicated to an operator by, for example, illuminating, blinking or flashing one or more LEDs located on one of controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, or other suitable location on patient support <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">At step <b>708</b>, a timer <b>625</b><i>c </i>is started, which counts off a predefined wait period after which it is safe to restart the previously operating motor function. The wait period may be determined based on the value of run time <b>666</b> or maximum run time <b>662</b>, or other criteria. For example, the wait period may be set equal to the maximum run time <b>662</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the wait period is set equal to half of the maximum run time <b>662</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">At decision step <b>710</b>, microcontroller <b>614</b> determines whether the wait period has expired. Step <b>710</b> is repeated until the wait period has expired. In the illustrated embodiment, when the wait period has expired, the motor function is restarted at step <b>712</b>. However, it is understood that in other illustrative embodiments, it may not be necessary or desirable to restart the motor function and thus step <b>712</b> may be eliminated in those embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">Returning to step <b>698</b>, if run time <b>666</b> has not reached or exceeded maximum run time <b>662</b>, the process proceeds to decision step <b>700</b>.

If the activated actuator <b>48</b> is still running, the process returns to step <b>694</b> to measure current <b>668</b> and run time <b>666</b>.

<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Thermal Protection</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">To protect DC drive motors <b>604</b> from thermal overload during use in a hospital room environment, a method <b>720</b> for detecting thermal failure of the drive motors <b>604</b> is provided. A thermal overload condition can occur if, for example, failure of the current overload, interference/obstruction detection, or duty cycle protection mechanisms described above occurs. The presently described method <b>720</b> is adapted to the specific safety risks of a medical environment. An embodiment of the method is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">At step <b>722</b>, a maximum temperature <b>723</b> is determined for a drive motor <b>604</b> of a selected actuator <b>48</b>. Maximum temperature <b>723</b> is typically determined by reference to the manufacturer's specifications for the particular actuator <b>48</b>. However, it is understood that other means for determining maximum temperature <b>723</b>, including experimentation, for example, under particular environmental conditions, may be used. Maximum temperature <b>723</b> is stored in memory <b>616</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">Typically, activation of a selected actuator <b>48</b> occurs when a patient or caregiver selects the corresponding actuator control button on controller <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, or <b>54</b>, as described above. During operation of the selected actuator <b>48</b>, a current temperature <b>724</b> of the drive <b>604</b> is measured inside the housing of drive motor <b>604</b>, at step <b>726</b>. Any suitable thermal sensing element, such as a conventional thermocouple, may be used to measure temperature <b>724</b>. An application timer <b>625</b><i>d </i>is used to periodically sample temperature <b>724</b> during operation of actuator <b>48</b> as long as the drive is in operation and maximum temperature <b>723</b> has not been exceeded. Temperature <b>724</b> is converted to digital form by A/D converter <b>620</b> and is stored in memory <b>616</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">At step <b>728</b>, the temperature of drive motor <b>604</b> is analyzed. Current temperature <b>724</b> is compared to maximum temperature <b>723</b>. At decision step <b>730</b>, microcontroller <b>614</b> determines whether operation of actuator <b>48</b> should continue in view of current temperature <b>724</b>. If current temperature <b>724</b> reaches or exceeds maximum temperature <b>723</b>, the process <b>720</b> continues to step <b>732</b>, where an error signal is generated. If current temperature <b>724</b> is less than maximum temperature <b>723</b>, the process <b>720</b> returns to step <b>726</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">At step <b>732</b>, a fault condition is signaled and, at step <b>734</b>, microcontroller <b>614</b> places patient support <b>10</b> in a safe state that minimizes hazards to patients, caregivers, associated individuals, equipment, and data, e.g., by signaling power source <b>612</b> to interrupt, disengage, or reduce current supplied to drive motor <b>604</b> of the activated actuator <b>48</b>. Microcontroller <b>614</b> may also set a flag to indicate to an operator that service is necessary on the affected drive or on the entire system. Such indication may be communicated to an operator by illuminating, blinking or flashing one or more LEDs located on one of controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, or other suitable location on patient support <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, if measured temperature <b>724</b> exceeds maximum temperature <b>723</b>, thermal failure is assumed and the drive <b>604</b> is automatically shut down. Typically, a bimetallic thermal switch located inside the motor housing opens to interrupt the current supply to drive <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">Patient support surfaces, such as hospital beds, often include many features that are electrically powered. Such features include bed articulation controls that allow the various deck sections of the bed to be raised or lowered so that the bed can support patients in a number of different positions. There is a need for at least some of these bed controls to remain available when the bed's primary source of power is lost, i.e., due to a power outage, or while a patient is being transported from one hospital room to another.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Battery Backup System</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">As a result of government regulations that, for example, require hospital beds to be able to assume the emergency Trendelenburg position whether or not AC power is available, and for other reasons, existing hospital beds may include a battery backup system that powers the bed functions when AC power is not available. However, because hospital beds often require a substantial amount of power to operate the various features, a method to conserve battery power while maintaining compliance with existing regulations is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, frame <b>12</b> supports a battery enable switch <b>736</b>. Battery enable switch <b>736</b> is a normally open contact, momentary function switch. In the illustrated embodiment, battery enable switch <b>736</b> is located on the portion of base frame <b>28</b> that is substantially underneath head section <b>38</b> of deck <b>26</b>, however, it is understood that battery enable switch <b>706</b> could be located anywhere on base frame <b>28</b> or other area of patient support <b>10</b> as necessary or convenient. Battery enable switch <b>736</b> is electrically coupled to a battery <b>46</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 31</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">Battery enable switch <b>736</b> allows a person, such as a health care provider, to operate electrically-controlled bed functions (such as bed articulation functions) of patient support <b>10</b> using a backup power source (in the illustrated embodiment, battery system <b>46</b>) when the primary power source <b>738</b> (e.g., AC power coupled to bed <b>10</b> by plug connection <b>45</b>) is not available. Such instances may occur, for example, when a power outage occurs or when a bed <b>10</b> is being moved from one area of a hospital to another.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, battery enable switch <b>736</b> is a momentary switch, such as a push button. Switch <b>736</b> includes a light-emitting diode (LED) <b>737</b> or other suitable illuminating means known in the art, enclosed in or covered by a translucent or transparent housing made of plastic or other suitable material. The LED <b>737</b> is illuminated when either primary power source <b>738</b> is coupled to bed <b>10</b> through plug connection <b>45</b>, or backup power or battery <b>46</b> is charged and supplying power to bed functions of patient support <b>10</b>. When patient support <b>10</b> is disconnected from primary power source <b>738</b>, or if backup power source <b>46</b> is discharged, the LED <b>737</b> is not illuminated. If primary power source <b>738</b> is disconnected and backup power source <b>46</b> is in need of power or is recharging, the LED <b>737</b> blinks or flashes intermittently on and off.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">Circuitry for controlling the activation of backup power source <b>46</b> is included in control system <b>44</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, primary power source <b>738</b> is connected to switching regulator <b>740</b> through diode <b>742</b> and connection <b>744</b>. Backup power source <b>46</b> is connected to switching regulator <b>740</b> via connection <b>746</b>, contact <b>748</b> of relay <b>750</b>, diode <b>752</b> and connection <b>744</b>. Switching regulator <b>740</b> provides power to at least the electrically-controlled bed functions that are required or desired to operate under backup power, such as bed articulation functions.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">Relay <b>750</b> includes contact <b>748</b> and coil <b>754</b>. When primary power source <b>738</b> is operating, voltage is applied to switching regulator <b>740</b> through connection <b>744</b> and to microprocessor <b>756</b> through connection <b>758</b>. When voltage is not present on connection <b>758</b>, microprocessor <b>756</b> senses the lack of primary power and closes contact <b>748</b> of relay <b>750</b> by energizing coil <b>754</b>. Closing relay contact <b>748</b> provides sufficient backup power to the bed for a predetermined amount of time to allow an orderly shutdown of the bed functions. After the predetermined period of time expires, microprocessor <b>756</b> opens relay contact <b>748</b> to remove logic power from the bed functions and put patient support <b>10</b> into sleep mode.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362">When patient support <b>10</b> is in sleep mode, activation of battery enable switch <b>736</b>, e.g., by momentarily pressing switch <b>736</b>, causes patient support <b>10</b> to switch out of sleep mode. Activating switch <b>736</b> while primary power source <b>738</b> is operating has no effect.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">In the illustrated embodiment, battery enable switch <b>736</b> is activated by the application of pressure on the housing, i.e., by depressing switch <b>736</b> with one's finger. In other embodiments, activating any one of the bed function control buttons located on controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> while patient support <b>736</b> is in sleep mode will also switch it out of sleep mode.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">When switch <b>736</b> is activated, sufficient power is provided from backup power source <b>46</b> so that at least certain required electrically operational functions of patient support <b>10</b>, such as articulation of patient support <b>10</b>, can be performed. In the illustrated embodiment, activation of switch <b>736</b> selectively powers certain bed functions, including the bed articulation functions, while other features, such as scale/ppm module <b>516</b> and dynamic surface module <b>518</b>, are not powered by backup power source <b>46</b> in order to conserve power. Also, power is always provided to nurse call control <b>570</b>, even when backup source <b>46</b> is in sleep mode. It is understood however, that control system <b>44</b> may be configured so that any particular combination of electrically-controlled features of patient support surface <b>10</b> (including scale/ppm module <b>516</b> and/or dynamic surface module <b>518</b>) may be powered by backup power source <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">When microprocessor <b>756</b> detects that no power is being supplied by primary power source <b>738</b>, pressing switch <b>736</b> causes microprocessor <b>714</b> to apply voltage from backup power source <b>46</b> to energize relay coil <b>754</b> and close relay contact <b>748</b>. Closing relay contact <b>748</b> again provides logic power to bed functions via switching regulator <b>740</b> and Vcc power to microprocessor <b>756</b>. When microprocessor <b>756</b> receives power Vcc, it activates a transistor <b>760</b> through connection <b>762</b>. Microprocessor <b>756</b> includes a timer and holds transistor <b>760</b> in an on or activated state for a predetermined period of time, as further explained below. When the predetermined period of time expires, microprocessor <b>756</b> turns off or deactivates transistor <b>760</b>. Turning off transistor <b>760</b> shuts off logic power to the bed electronics, thus saving battery power.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> shows a flow diagram of an embodiment of the logic process encoded in microprocessor <b>756</b>. At decision step <b>770</b>, microprocessor <b>756</b> determines whether primary power source <b>738</b> is available. If primary power source <b>738</b> is operating, then normal power continues to be provided to the bed functions via primary power source <b>738</b>, at step <b>771</b>. Also, while primary power source <b>738</b> is operating, backup power source <b>46</b> is continuously charging as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">If microprocessor <b>756</b> senses that primary power source <b>738</b> is not operating, electrically-controlled functions of patient support <b>10</b> are put into sleep mode as described above, at step <b>772</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0370" num="0369">If a key has been pressed, microprocessor <b>756</b> determines if backup power source <b>46</b> is sufficiently charged to provide power to the bed functions, at step <b>776</b>.

If backup power source <b>46</b> is sufficiently charged, relay <b>750</b> is closed so that bed functions can be activated using backup power source <b>46</b>, as described above, at step <b>780</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">As mentioned above, microprocessor <b>756</b> includes a timer. At step <b>782</b>, when backup power <b>46</b> is activated, microprocessor <b>756</b> sets the timer to count until one of the following occurs: a bed function control button is depressed, battery enable switch <b>736</b> is depressed, or a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 5 minutes) elapses. It is understood that in different embodiments, less than all of these conditions may be tested. For example, in one embodiment, pressing battery enable switch <b>736</b> may not interrupt the timer.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0371">At step <b>784</b>, microprocessor <b>756</b> determines whether the preset amount of time has elapsed. If the predefined time period has elapsed, the process returns to step <b>772</b>, where the bed functions are put into sleep mode. If the time period has not elapsed, microprocessor <b>756</b> checks to see if another key (e.g., a bed function-activating key or the battery enable switch) has been pressed, at step <b>786</b>. If no key has been pressed, the timer continues counting until the predetermined time period expires, at step <b>784</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0372">If another key has been pressed, as determined at step <b>786</b>, then the timer is reset at step <b>788</b>. The process then returns to step <b>780</b> and backup power source <b>46</b> is reactivated or awakened out of sleep mode.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0373">In this manner, backup power is conserved and, in embodiments where a battery <b>46</b> is used to support backup power system, a smaller battery can be used.

<p id="p-0471" num="0470">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, foot pedal controls <b>56</b> are coupled to base frame <b>28</b>. Foot pedal controls <b>56</b> are provided to control raising and lowering of deck <b>26</b> relative to base frame <b>28</b> and to control raising and lowering head section <b>38</b> of deck <b>26</b> relative to weigh frame <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0471">Each foot pedal control <b>56</b> is associated with one of the above-mentioned functions and includes a pedal or control member <b>1660</b> appropriately labeled for the respective function. By stepping on any of pedals <b>1660</b> with the tip of one's foot as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>, one of these functions of patient support <b>10</b> is activated. When pedals <b>1660</b> are released, they are automatically biased back to the neutral position and the function terminates.</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0472">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 76-79</figref>, pedals <b>1660</b> are pivotably coupled to a pedal housing <b>1662</b> that is fixedly coupled to base frame <b>28</b> in a spaced-apart relationship with the floor <b>29</b>. Pedal housing <b>1662</b> includes an L-shaped body portion <b>1664</b> that couples to base frame <b>28</b> and a housing portion <b>1666</b> that defines an enclosed space <b>1668</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0473">Because housing portion <b>1666</b> is centrally located and raised relative to foot pedals <b>1660</b>, it acts as a locator for pedals <b>1660</b>. For example, a caregiver who is familiar with patient support <b>10</b> will be able to sweep their foot over pedals <b>1660</b> until striking either side of housing portion <b>1666</b>. Because of their familiarity with patient support <b>10</b>, they will recognize which pedal <b>1660</b> is located beneath their foot. If this pedal <b>1660</b> performs the desired function, the need only step down without looking down at the respective pedal <b>1660</b> for an decal or indicator that indicates the specific function of that respective pedal <b>1660</b>. If the desired pedal <b>1660</b> is not the one located under their foot, they will recognize that they need to back away from housing portion <b>1666</b> to the next adjacent foot pedal <b>1660</b> that does perform the desired function. Preferably, the caregiver will initially sweep toward the correct side of housing portion <b>1666</b> on which the desired foot pedal <b>1660</b> is located.</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0474">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 77 and 78</figref>, each pedal <b>1660</b> is pivotable between a first or up position and a second or down position. Each pedal <b>1660</b> has a stepped profile and includes a pedal portion <b>1670</b>, a pivot portion <b>1672</b>, and a sensor portion <b>1674</b>. Pedal portion <b>1670</b> extends beyond pedal housing <b>1662</b> to permit a caregiver to press down on pedal portion <b>1670</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>. When in the first raised position, a top surface <b>1676</b> of pedal portion <b>1670</b> is about 6 inches above the floor <b>29</b> so that 5.5 inches of clearance <b>1677</b> exists under pedal portion <b>1670</b>. Furthermore, this spacing permits a caregiver or other person to operate pedals <b>1660</b> while his or her heal <b>1680</b> rests on floor <b>29</b>. Because the caregiver's heal <b>1680</b> is on the ground <b>29</b> during the movement of patient support <b>10</b>, his or her foot is further away from the moving components of the patient support. Preferably, decals or indicators (not shown) are provided on inward portions <b>1682</b> of top surface <b>1676</b> that is at an angle of 45 degrees from horizontal to help a caregiver's line of sight in viewing the decal or indicator that indicates what function of patient support <b>10</b> is controlled by the particular pedal <b>1660</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0475">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref>, a pin <b>1684</b> is provided that extends through pivot flanges <b>1686</b> and to define a pivot axis <b>1688</b> about which pedals <b>1660</b> pivot on housing <b>1662</b>. Each foot pedal control <b>1660</b> includes a biaser or spring <b>1690</b> through which pin <b>1684</b> extends that biases pedal <b>1660</b> up toward the first raised position.</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0476">The position of each pedal <b>1660</b> is detected by a sensor <b>538</b>. If sensor <b>538</b> detects that any one of pedals <b>1660</b> is moved and held in the second lowered position for about one second and then returned to the first raised position, pedals <b>1660</b> are enabled to operate the respective functions of patient support <b>10</b> for twenty seconds. To activate any of these functions, a respective pedal <b>1660</b> must be moved to the second lowered position within the twenty second enabled window.</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0477">If a pedal <b>1660</b> is not moved back down to the second lowered position within the twenty second enabled widow, pedals <b>1660</b> are disabled and must be enabled again as described above by holding one of pedals <b>1660</b> in the second lowered position for about one second. If any of pedals <b>1660</b> are lowered within the twenty second window, the function is performed and the window is reset for another twenty seconds. If twenty seconds go by without any of the pedals <b>1660</b> being moved back down to the second lowered position, pedals <b>1660</b> are again disabled.

Sensor <b>1734</b> is preferably a tape sensor embedded in a resilient material <b>1736</b>, such as potting material, that provides a water proof cover to sensor <b>1734</b>. Pedals <b>1660</b>′ are provided with a rubber plunger <b>1738</b> that presses down on resilient material <b>1736</b> and moves contact strips <b>1740</b> of sensor <b>1734</b> to close a circuit. When the circuit is closed, control system <b>44</b> detects that the respective pedal <b>1660</b> is in the second lowered position. When the respective pedal <b>1660</b>′ is released, contact strips <b>1740</b> separate and the circuit is open. Control system <b>44</b> detects the open circuit and recognizes that the respective pedal <b>1660</b>′ has moved away from the second lowered position.

Control system <b>44</b> detects the open circuit and recognizes that the respective pedal <b>1660</b>′ has moved away from the second lowered position. The preferred embodiment dome switch sensor is a Cannon SD 350 Dome Switch that requires 2.25 N operating forces and is sold by Cannon, ITT Industries.</p>
<p id="p-0490" num="0489">Another such alternative embodiment sensor <b>1750</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 89-91</figref>. Sensor <b>1750</b> is preferably a force sensing resistor having its contacts with a cable <b>1752</b> embedded in a resilient material <b>1754</b>, such as potting material, that provides a water proof cover to the contact. Pedals <b>1660</b>′ are provided with rubber plunger <b>1738</b> that presses down on sensor <b>1750</b> and creates force on sensor <b>1750</b>. When force is applied to sensor <b>1750</b>, the overall electrical resistance of sensor <b>1750</b> changes. This change is resistance is monitored by the control system <b>44</b>. When the resistance reaches a predetermined value, control system <b>44</b> detects that the respective pedal <b>1660</b>′ is in the second lowered position. When the respective pedal <b>1660</b>′ is released, the resistance returns to its normal value and control system <b>44</b> recognizes that the respective pedal <b>1660</b>′ has moved away from the second lowered position. Preferably, enough force is required that accidental lowering of the respective foot pedal <b>1660</b>′ will not change the resistance to the predetermined value. Furthermore, this force will preferably be greater that what a typical child can generate to avoid activation by children. According to an alternative embodiment, once the predetermined resistance is reached, the speed at which the function operates is controlled by the amount of force applied to the pedal <b>1660</b>′ which controls the amount of resistance of the sensor <b>1750</b> above the predetermined value. For example, if the force applied creates a resistance just above or at the predetermined value, the function, such as lowering the patient support <b>10</b>, will occur slowly. However, if more force is applied and the resistance is increased above the predetermined value, the speed of the patient support lowering will increase proportionally with the amount of force applied to the pedal <b>1660</b>′. Thus, if a smaller force is applied, the patient support <b>10</b> will lower slowly. If a greater force is applied, the patient support <b>10</b> will lower faster. If an even greater force is applied, the patient support <b>10</b> will lower even faster. Preferably, the function will have a maximum speed that cannot be exceeded regardless of the amount of force applied.</p>

<p id="p-0491" num="0490">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>57</b>, the obstacle or interference detection device <b>58</b> is shown as coupled to the base frame <b>28</b> of the patient support <b>10</b>. The obstacle detection device <b>58</b> illustratively includes first and second sensors <b>1802</b> and <b>1804</b> which are coupled to top surfaces <b>474</b> and <b>476</b> of the longitudinally extending first and second side members <b>192</b> and <b>194</b> of the base frame <b>28</b>, respectively. While in the following description, first and second sensors <b>1802</b> and <b>1804</b> are illustrated as being associated with the side members <b>192</b> and <b>194</b> of the patient support <b>10</b>, it should be appreciated that additional sensors could be positioned adjacent the head end <b>25</b> and the foot end <b>27</b> of the patient support <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0492" num="0491">Each sensor <b>1802</b> and <b>1804</b> is configured to provide an obstacle detection signal to control system <b>44</b> in the event that it detects an obstacle or determines that a fault condition exists. More particularly, each sensor <b>1802</b> and <b>1804</b> is configured to provide the obstacle detection signal to control system <b>44</b> upon detecting that an object, such as an individual's foot, is supported on one of the upper surfaces <b>474</b> and <b>476</b> of the base frame <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0493" num="0492">In response to the obstacle detection signal from either of sensors <b>1802</b> or <b>1804</b>, control system <b>44</b> will prevent the lowering of the intermediate frame <b>32</b> relative to the base frame <b>28</b>. Moreover, the obstacle detection signal indicates that either an obstacle is supported on the base frame <b>28</b> or that at least one of the sensors <b>1802</b> or <b>1804</b> is not operating properly and is in a fault condition. As such, in order to avoid potential damaging impact with the detected obstacle, control system <b>44</b> prevents actuators <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>from operating to lower the intermediate frame <b>32</b>. In an illustrative embodiment, control system <b>44</b> permits continued operation of the actuators <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>to raise the intermediate frame <b>32</b>. Further, upon receiving the obstacle detection signal, control system <b>44</b> may instruct the actuators <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>to raise the intermediate frame <b>32</b> for a predetermined time period, illustratively 2 seconds, while preventing operation of the actuators <b>48</b><i>a </i>and <b>48</b><i>b </i>to lower the intermediate frame <b>32</b>. Raising the intermediate frame <b>32</b> for a time period after an obstacle has been detected, provides for the immediate and automatic movement of the frame <b>32</b> in a direction away from the detected obstacle.</p>
<p id="p-0494" num="0493">While the sensors <b>1802</b> and <b>1804</b> of the obstacle detection device <b>58</b> are illustratively positioned on the base frame <b>28</b>, it should be appreciated that the sensors <b>1802</b> and <b>1804</b> could likewise be positioned on a lower surface of the intermediate frame <b>32</b>. Further, the obstacle detection device <b>58</b> may be utilized to detect obstacles between any two portions of a patient support <b>10</b> which move relative to each other. For example, the obstacle detection device <b>58</b> may be used between the head end and foot end siderails <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, between the head end siderails <b>20</b> and the headboard <b>16</b>, and between the foot end siderails <b>22</b> and the footboard <b>18</b>.</p>

<p id="h-0030" num="0000">Heel Pressure Relief Member</p>
<p id="p-0501" num="0500">The foot section <b>2110</b> includes a receiving recess <b>2148</b> extending downwardly from an upper surface <b>2150</b> of the base portion <b>2128</b> at a foot end <b>2152</b> thereof. A heel pressure relief member <b>2154</b> is configured to be received within the recess <b>2148</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 94-97</figref>, the heel pressure relief member <b>2154</b> includes a sleeve or case <b>2156</b> and a fiber fill <b>2158</b> received within the sleeve <b>2156</b>. With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref>, the sleeve <b>2156</b> includes a closed first end <b>2160</b> and an opposing releasably closable second end <b>2162</b>. More particularly, a releasable fastener <b>2164</b>, such as a hook and loop fastener, may be utilized to secure the second end <b>2162</b> of the sleeve <b>2156</b>. Illustratively, the sleeve <b>2156</b> is formed from a substantially air impermeable material, such as a urethane coated twill. The fiber fill <b>2158</b> illustratively comprises a material having high loft properties, such as a layered polyfill material. In operation, air enters the sleeve <b>2156</b> through the hook and loop fastener <b>2164</b>, thereby supplying the sleeve <b>2156</b> with air and providing air pressure for supporting the heels of a patient. The air pressure within the pressure relief member <b>2154</b> is self-regulating as changes in force applied by the patient's heels will cause air to enter or exit the sleeve <b>2156</b> through the releasable fastener <b>2164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0502" num="0501">An alternative embodiment heel pressure relief member <b>2154</b>′ is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95</figref>.

The remainder of the member <b>2154</b>′ is substantially air impermeable. Rapid inflation of the sleeve <b>2156</b> is provided by air passing through the check valve <b>2166</b>. However, the check valve <b>2166</b> prevents the passage of air therethrough from inside the sleeve <b>2156</b> to atmosphere. The bleed orifice <b>2168</b> permits for the slow passage of air from within the sleeve <b>2156</b> to atmosphere, such that pressure within the pressure relief member <b>2154</b>′ may be optimized and self-regulated for each individual patient.</p>
<p id="p-0503" num="0502">The heel pressure relief member <b>2154</b> is configured to reduce the level of raised pressure between the patient's foot and the mattress.

<p id="h-0038" num="0000">Shear Cover</p>
<p id="p-0522" num="0521">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 92 and 110</figref>, the shear cover <b>2125</b> is configured to fit over the above-identified mattress components as received within the fire barrier <b>2124</b>. The shear cover <b>2125</b> is substantially planar, but folded during assembly to form a top surface <b>2360</b>, a sidewall <b>2362</b>, and bottom inwardly extending flaps <b>2364</b>. RF welded seams are utilized to form the four corners of the shear cover <b>2125</b> about the mattress components. A belly band (not shown) may be wrapped laterally around the outer surface of the shear cover <b>2125</b> to assist in securing a mid-portion thereof. The shear cover <b>2125</b> is configured to be located between the internal components and the top cover portion <b>2106</b> to permit the top cover portion <b>2106</b> to slide easily over the mattress components and reduce shear forces between the patient's body and the mattress <b>14</b> and reduce the likelihood of sacral breakdown.</p>
<p id="p-0523" num="0522">The shear cover <b>2125</b> is formed from a material having a low coefficient of friction so that the mattress outer cover <b>2102</b> can slide relative to the other mattress components. As the mattress <b>14</b> is articulated or as the patient moves, the shear cover <b>2125</b> minimizes shear forces acting between the mattress top cover portion <b>2106</b> and the patient's body. The shear cover <b>2125</b> may be made from a woven nylon or parachute material. Illustratively, the shear cover <b>2125</b> is made from a polyurethane material such as Deerfield urethane PT611OS having a thickness of approximately 0.002 inches. The polyurethane material provides an inexpensive shear material which reduces shear forces applied to the patient's body situated on the mattress <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0039" num="0000">Outer Cover</p>
<p id="p-0524" num="0523">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 92 and 111</figref>, the top cover portion <b>2106</b> of the outer cover <b>2102</b> includes a top wall <b>2363</b> and a sidewall <b>2365</b>. The top cover portion <b>2106</b> is illustratively formed from a ticking material, such as a stretchable polyurethane material which is resistant to fluids and chemical stains.</p>
<p id="p-0525" num="0524">The bottom cover portion <b>2104</b> includes a bottom wall <b>2366</b> and a sidewall <b>2368</b>. The sidewall <b>2368</b> is illustratively formed from a ticking material similar to the sidewall <b>2365</b> of the top cover portion <b>2106</b>. The sidewall <b>2368</b> of the bottom cover portion <b>2104</b> is coupled to the sidewall <b>2365</b> of the top cover portion <b>2106</b>, illustratively through RF welding. Illustratively, the bottom wall <b>2366</b> of the bottom cover portion <b>2104</b> is formed from a polyurethane coated twill material for enhanced wear resistance and to protect other components of the mattress <b>14</b> from contamination. The bottom wall <b>2366</b> includes an access panel <b>2370</b> defined by a zipper <b>2372</b>. The access panel <b>2370</b> is utilized during assembly of the mattress <b>14</b> and further facilitates removal of the replacement of the modular components of the mattress <b>14</b>. Illustratively, the zipper <b>2372</b> is RF welded to the bottom wall <b>2366</b>. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the zipper <b>2372</b> may be utilized to couple the sidewall <b>2368</b> of the bottom cover portion <b>2104</b> to the sidewall <b>2365</b> of the top cover portion <b>2106</b>.</p>

More particularly, as the head section <b>38</b> is elevated relative to the seat section <b>40</b>, the head portion <b>2192</b> of the receiving base <b>2108</b> moves relative to the seat portion <b>2194</b> of the receiving base <b>2108</b>. The slit <b>2196</b> and stress relief apertures <b>2198</b> and <b>2200</b> reduce the stress applied to the receiving base <b>2108</b> during this movement. Likewise, the stress relief zone <b>2374</b> of the bottom cover portion <b>2104</b> reduces stress within the outer cover <b>2102</b> of the mattress <b>14</b>. As the mattress <b>14</b> bends to follow the contour of the deck <b>26</b>, the extra material within the stress relief zone <b>2374</b> accounts for the increased distance between the head portion <b>2192</b> and the seat portion <b>2194</b> proximate the bottom cover portion <b>2104</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 112 and 113</figref>.</p>

More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 114</figref> illustrates a normal mode of operation with the head zone <b>2302</b> of the upper bladder assembly <b>2122</b> inflated, and the turn assist bladders <b>2262</b> and <b>2264</b> deflated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 115</figref> illustrates a left turn assist mode of operation wherein the left turn assist bladder <b>2264</b> is inflated. Since the left turn assist bladder <b>2264</b> is laterally offset from the longitudinal center axis <b>2284</b> of the mattress <b>14</b>, inflation of the bladder <b>2264</b> causes one side of the upper bladder assembly <b>2122</b> to raise above the other side. The hinges <b>2320</b> and <b>2322</b> between the side portions <b>2316</b> and <b>2318</b> and the center portion <b>2314</b> of the bladders <b>2306</b> of the upper bladder assembly <b>2122</b> permit the mattress <b>14</b> to substantially conform to the shape resulting from the inflation of the left turn assist bladder <b>2264</b>. In an illustrative embodiment, upon inflation of one of the turn assist bladders <b>2262</b> and <b>2264</b>, a patient supported on the mattress <b>14</b> is rotated by an angle α of approximately 20 degrees from horizontal. Upon completion of the turn assist, the control system <b>44</b> causes the inflated turn assist bladder <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> to vent to atmosphere. Simultaneously, the upper bladder assembly <b>2122</b> is instructed by the central system <b>44</b> to inflate to a maximum pressure. Since the turn assist bladder assembly <b>2120</b> is sandwiched intermediate the upper bladder assembly <b>2122</b> and the crowning core <b>2218</b>, inflation of the upper bladder assembly <b>2122</b> facilitates the rapid venting of air within the turn assist bladders <b>2262</b> and <b>2264</b> to atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0531" num="0530">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 116-119</figref>, an illustrative embodiment manifold assembly <b>62</b> for use in connection with the mattress <b>14</b> is shown.

<p id="p-0536" num="0535">Details of the valve assembly <b>2406</b><i>c </i>for controlling air pressure within the right turn assist bladder <b>2262</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 119</figref>. It should be appreciated that the valve assembly <b>2406</b><i>d </i>for use with the left turn assist bladder <b>2264</b> is identical. Further, the valve assemblies <b>2406</b><i>a </i>and <b>2406</b><i>b </i>for use with the head zone <b>2302</b> and the seat zone <b>2304</b> of the upper bladder assembly <b>2122</b> are substantially the same except for the substitution of a second normally closed pilot valve for the normally open pilot valve <b>2410</b><i>c </i>of the valve assembly <b>2406</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0537" num="0536">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 119</figref>, air is supplied to the valve assembly <b>2406</b><i>c </i>by a fill port <b>2418</b> which is in communication with the pump <b>64</b>. The fill port <b>2418</b> is in fluid communication with an accumulator port <b>2420</b> through a check valve (not shown). The check valve provides for air flow from the fill port <b>2418</b> to the accumulator port <b>2420</b> but prevents air flow in the reverse direction. The check valve therefore helps maintain pressure within the accumulator port <b>2420</b> should pressure be lost in the fill port <b>2418</b>, for example, if the pump <b>64</b> would stop operating. The accumulator port <b>2420</b>, in turn, is in fluid communication with the upper pilot pressure chamber <b>2422</b> of the first pilot valve <b>2408</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0538" num="0537">Each pilot valve <b>2408</b><i>c </i>and <b>2410</b><i>c </i>includes a conventional solenoid (not shown) received within a body portion <b>2424</b> and configured to move a pin <b>2426</b>. The first pilot valve <b>2408</b><i>c </i>is normally closed, such that a diaphragm <b>2428</b> coupled to the pin <b>2426</b> sealingly engages a valve seat <b>2430</b>.

As such, air from the fill port <b>2418</b> may not pass to a supply port <b>2434</b> connected to the right turn assist bladder <b>2262</b> of the mattress <b>14</b>. However, upon activation, the solenoid is energized such that the pin <b>2426</b> is pulled upwardly and the diaphragm <b>2428</b> moves away from the valve seat <b>2430</b>. As such, a passageway represented by arrow <b>2436</b> is defined such that air may pass through the fill port <b>2418</b> over the valve seat <b>2430</b> and through the supply port <b>2434</b> to the right turn assist bladder <b>2262</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0553" num="0552">If the pressure of an air zone <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>, <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b> is too high, microcontroller <b>3004</b> actuates the appropriate valve assembly <b>2406</b> to allow air to escape from the air zone <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>, <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b>. If the pressure is too low, microcontroller <b>3004</b> sends a message over network <b>510</b> to power supply module <b>514</b> of patient support <b>10</b> (parts of which are generally depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 124</figref> as power supply <b>3006</b>), and power supply <b>3006</b> activates pump <b>64</b>. When microcontroller <b>3004</b> detects that pump <b>64</b> is turned on, it actuates the appropriate valve assembly <b>2406</b> to allow air to enter the appropriate controlled air zone <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>, <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0554" num="0553">Among other things, embodiments of pressure control system <b>3000</b> illustratively include one or more of the following features: a process <b>3030</b> for controlling the inflation of controlled air zones <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>, <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b> according to the size of a patient, a process <b>3032</b> for controlling inflation of turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>, and/or a process <b>3070</b> for controlling inflation of seat section <b>40</b> in response to elevation of head section <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0043" num="0000">Mattress Pressure Determination</p>
<p id="p-0555" num="0554">In certain embodiments of pressure control system <b>3000</b> of dynamic surface module <b>518</b>, a process <b>3030</b> for controlling the inflation of controlled air zones <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>, <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b> according to the size of a patient disposed on patient support <b>10</b> is provided. One embodiment of process <b>3030</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 125</figref> and described below.</p>
<p id="p-0556" num="0555">Process <b>3030</b> begins at step <b>3014</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 125</figref>, where the microcontroller <b>3004</b> detects whether it has been activated to determine patient size. In one illustrative embodiment, patient size button <b>1628</b> of siderail controllers <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> is optional. In other embodiments, button <b>1628</b> is not optional and the operator or caregiver is required to select an appropriate patient size. In still other illustrative embodiments, button <b>1628</b> automatically selects a default setting, e.g., the “medium” size, if a patient size is not selected by the operator or caregiver.</p>
<p id="p-0557" num="0556">In the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 125</figref>, there are three possible patient sizes that can be selected by using button <b>1628</b>: “small,” “medium,” and “large.” In general, the determination of whether a patient is of small, medium, or large size is made by the caregiver. However, it is understood that there are any number of different ways to indicate a patient's size. For example, in lieu of button <b>1628</b>, pressure control system <b>3000</b> may provide the ability to automatically determine the patient's size based on the patient's weight, which may be determined by weigh frame <b>36</b> and/or by a force sensor located in seat section <b>40</b> in the manner detailed herein. Another alternative is to provide a user interface on siderail controllers <b>52</b>,<b>54</b> whereby the caregiver may enter the patient's height, and system <b>3000</b> determines the patient's size based on the entered height value and the patient's weight.</p>
<p id="p-0558" num="0557">At step <b>3016</b>, the controlled air zone(s) <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>, <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b> being monitored is determined. All of head section air zone <b>2302</b>, seat section air zone <b>2304</b>, and turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> may be inflated to varying pressures based on patient size. However, it is understood that in alternative embodiments not all of air zones <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>, <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b> may be inflated based on patient size.</p>
<p id="p-0559" num="0558">At step <b>3018</b>, process <b>3030</b> determines the desired inflation pressure for the respective air zone(s) <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>, <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b> being monitored based on the patient size. In the illustrated embodiment, microcontroller <b>3004</b> obtains the desired pressure for the air zone(s) <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>, <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b> from at least one look-up table stored in memory <b>3010</b>. The desired pressure may be a discrete value or a range of permissible values. Also, the desired pressure may be different for each air zone <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>, <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b>. Further, various other factors, including environmental factors such as temperature and/or altitude, may affect the desired pressure values and be reflected in data in the look-up table. As an example, in one embodiment, under normal hospital room conditions, for a patient considered “small,” the appropriate pressure is about 4-7 inches in water for head section air zone <b>2302</b>, about 7 to 21 inches in water for seat section air zone <b>2304</b>, and about 18-24 inches in water for turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>. Tables 1, 2, and 3 show examples of desired pressure values based upon patient size.</p>
<p id="p-0560" num="0559">As indicated by decision step <b>3020</b>, in the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 125</figref>, the appropriate pressure for seat section air zone <b>2304</b> also depends on the elevation of head section <b>38</b>. If process <b>3030</b> causes inflation of seat section air zone <b>2304</b>, then at step <b>3022</b> the pressure of seat section air zone <b>2304</b> is adjusted based on the angle of head section <b>38</b>. This adjustment is discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 128</figref> below. Thus, for seat section air zone <b>2304</b>, the appropriate pressure is determined by reference to both patient size and head angle. However, adjusting the pressure of seat section air zone <b>2304</b> based on only one of these criteria is also within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0561" num="0560">At decision step <b>3024</b>, microcontroller <b>3004</b> measures the current pressure as described above and determines whether the current pressure is less than, equal to, or greater than the desired pressure determined as described above. If the current pressure is less than the desired pressure at step <b>3026</b>, microcontroller <b>3004</b> commands power supply <b>3006</b> to activate pump <b>64</b> to inflate air zone <b>2304</b> to the desired pressure as described above. If the current pressure is greater than the desired pressure, then at step <b>3028</b>, air zone <b>2304</b> are deflated as described above.</p>
<p id="h-0044" num="0000">Patient Turn Assist</p>
<p id="p-0562" num="0561">In addition to other functions discussed above and elsewhere in this disclosure, pressure control system <b>3000</b> of dynamic surface module <b>518</b> controls the operation of turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>. Turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> illustratively are bladders of mattress <b>14</b> that selectively inflate to assist a caregiver in turning or rotating a patient, e.g., for therapy or treatment reasons. One embodiment of a process <b>3032</b> for controlling operation of turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 126 and 127</figref> as described below. Process <b>3032</b> is implemented using application software stored in memory <b>3010</b> of microcontroller <b>3004</b>. The structure of illustrative turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> is described above.</p>
<p id="p-0563" num="0562">Process <b>3032</b> begins at step <b>3034</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 126</figref>, where microcontroller <b>3004</b> detects whether a request has been received to activate one of turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, such a request is initiated by an operator or caregiver activating one of turn assist buttons <b>1624</b>, <b>1626</b> located on siderail controllers <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. However, it is understood that other means for activating the turn assist may be used. For example, control system <b>44</b> may be programmed to automatically activate one or more of turn assist buttons <b>1624</b>, <b>1626</b> at scheduled times during the day or night.</p>
<p id="p-0564" num="0563">At decision step <b>3036</b>, prior to initiating the turn assist function, process <b>3032</b> checks to make sure that the siderail(s) <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> toward which the patient is being turned is in the up or raised position, based on signals provided by siderail position detector(s) <b>60</b>. If one or more of siderails <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> toward which the patient is being turned is not in the up position (i.e. in down or lowered position), an error signal is generated at step <b>3038</b> and process <b>3032</b> returns to step <b>3034</b> without activating the turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>. In the illustrative embodiment, an audible or visual signal is generated for a brief period or until the siderail or siderails <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are brought to the up position. Thus, in the illustrative embodiment, the siderails <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> toward which the patient is being turned must be in the up position in order for the turn assist process to initiate. It is possible, however, that in other embodiments, a caregiver or operator may override this restriction, or that this restriction may be made optional, for example, depending on the circumstances of a particular patient.</p>
<p id="p-0565" num="0564">At decision step <b>3040</b>, microcontroller <b>3004</b> checks to see if the angle of head section <b>38</b> (head angle) is less than, equal to, or greater than a predetermined maximum angle. In the illustrated embodiment, the maximum head angle is about 40°. The head angle determination is made by logic module <b>512</b> and is discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 128</figref> below. Logic module <b>512</b> reports the head angle to dynamic surface module <b>518</b> for use in process <b>3032</b>, via network <b>510</b>. If the head angle is less than or equal to 40°, then the turn assist process continues to step <b>3044</b>. However, if the head angle is greater than about 40°, an error signal is generated at step <b>3042</b>, and the turn assist process returns to block <b>3034</b> without activating the turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0566" num="0565">At step <b>3044</b>, the size of the patient being supported by patient support <b>10</b> (e.g., small-medium-large) is determined as described above so that a desired pressure based on patient size is applied to the selected turn assist bladder <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0567" num="0566">At step <b>3046</b>, if first turn assist button <b>1624</b> is activated, first turn assist bladder <b>2262</b> inflates to rotate a person in patient support <b>10</b> upwardly in a counter-clockwise from the perspective of a person standing behind head section <b>38</b>. If second turn assist button <b>1626</b> is activated, second turn assist bladder <b>2264</b> inflates to rotate the person upwardly in the opposite direction as rotated in response to activation of first turn assist button <b>1624</b>. Inflation of the selected turn assist bladder <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> raises one side of the patient to a predetermined angle. In the illustrated embodiment, the selected turn assist bladder <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> inflates to rotate the patient onto his or her side at about a 20 degree angle with respect to mattress <b>14</b>, in approximately 20-50 seconds, depending on the size of the patient. It is understood that the predetermined angle and speed of inflation may be changed or modified as needed based on a variety of factors, including the purpose for rotating the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0568" num="0567">A timer, illustratively part of the central processing unit <b>3012</b>, is set at step <b>3048</b> when the selected turn assist bladder <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> is inflated. The selected turn assist bladder <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> remains inflated for a predetermined period of time, for example 5-30 seconds. In the illustrated embodiment, the duration of turn assist inflation is about 5 seconds. At step <b>3050</b> the timer counts out this wait period. After the wait period is complete (e.g., after 5 seconds), an audible or visual signal is generated to indicate to the patient and caregiver that the selected turn assist bladder is about to enter a “post-turn assist” phase. Process <b>3032</b> then begins deflating the selected turn assist bladder <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> at step <b>3052</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, deflation is expedited by quickly “hyperinflating” bladders <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b> to a firm, “post-turn assist” inflation pressure (see, e.g., Table 1 and Table 2). Inflation of bladders <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b> exerts pressure on turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>, causing turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> to expel air more rapidly. Alternatively, a vacuum mechanism may be coupled to turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> to accelerate deflation.</p>
<p id="p-0569" num="0568">The post-turn assist inflation and deflation processes may be interrupted under certain circumstances. For example, when a patient's bed <b>10</b> needs a linen change, it may be desirable for first and second turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> to be activated in more rapid succession than would be possible if the full post-turn assist process were performed. In such instances, if one of turn assist buttons <b>1624</b>, <b>1626</b> is activated, and then the other turn assist button <b>1624</b>, <b>1626</b> is activated before the previous turn assist process is complete, the previous process is interrupted and, as long as the turned-to-side siderails <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are in the up position as described above, and head section <b>38</b> is positioned at an angle less than or equal to 40°, the new turn assist mode is started.</p>
<p id="p-0570" num="0569">For example, assume a caregiver presses first turn assist button <b>1624</b>. If the caregiver then presses second turn assist button <b>1626</b> while first turn assist bladder <b>2262</b> is inflating, then process <b>3032</b> will interrupt the inflation, bypass the post-turn assist phase (i.e., head and seat bladders <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b> will not be inflated), and begin inflating second turn assist bladder <b>2264</b> as long as siderails <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are up on the side of the bed the patient is being turned to, and the head angle is less than or equal to the maximum head angle. If the caregiver presses second turn assist button <b>1626</b> while first turn assist bladder <b>2262</b> is in post-turn assist mode, post-turn assist mode is interrupted and second turn assist bladder <b>2264</b> begins inflating as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0571" num="0570">Monitor activity step <b>3060</b> is a step that is periodically executed during the turn assist operation. The monitor activity process <b>3060</b> is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 127</figref>. This process <b>3060</b> detects whether a patient or caregiver attempts to utilize other bed features while either turn assist bladder <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> is in operation. For example, at step <b>3062</b>, process <b>3032</b> checks to see if siderail <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> on the side to which the patient is being turned is raised or lowered. In the illustrated embodiment, if siderails <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are in the raised position at the beginning of turn assist, but one or more of them are lowered during turn assist, an audible signal or alarm is generated for a brief period at step <b>3064</b>, or until the siderail <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> is returned to the raised position, but the turn assist process <b>3032</b> is not interrupted. In alternative embodiments, however, upon detecting a lowering of siderail <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, the turn assist process <b>3032</b> may be suspended for a brief period or stopped until or unless the lowered siderail <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> is returned to the raised position.</p>
<p id="p-0572" num="0571">At step <b>3066</b>, process <b>3060</b> detects whether a patient or caregiver has selected another mode, e.g., turn assist for the other side of the patient, max inflate, or pressure relief. During the turn assist operation, the selection of another mode causes process <b>3060</b> to begin exiting the turn assist mode at block <b>3067</b>. If the other turn assist mode is selected, the current turn assist bladder <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> is deflated and the other turn assist mode is entered substantially immediately. If the pressure relief mode or the max-inflate mode is selected, process <b>3060</b> immediately enters the post-turn assist operation and enters the newly selected mode upon completion of the post-turn assist phase. However, if the CPR function is activated, process <b>3060</b> immediately deflates turn assist bladder <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b> and enters the CPR mode substantially immediately. If no mode is selected during turn assist, process <b>3060</b> will exit as described previously and enter the pressure relief mode upon completion of the post-turn assist phase.</p>
<p id="p-0573" num="0572">At step <b>3068</b>, process <b>3060</b> detects whether the angle of head section <b>38</b> has been increased above the maximum head angle as described above. If the head angle increases above the maximum head angle, an error message, e.g., in the form of an audible or visual signal, is generated at step <b>3069</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the turn assist process <b>3032</b> is interrupted if the head angle exceeds the maximum angle. In alternative embodiments, the turn assist process <b>3032</b> is not interrupted.</p>

<p id="p-0577" num="0576">At step <b>3072</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 128</figref>, the position of head section <b>38</b>, or head angle, is determined by position detector <b>606</b>. In the illustrative embodiment, a potentiometer reading corresponding to the head angle is determined by logic module <b>512</b> and reported to dynamic surface module <b>518</b> via network <b>510</b> for use in process <b>3070</b>. In the illustrated embodiment the potentiometer reading is a value ranging from 0 to 255. A change of 10 counts has been determined to indicate a change of approximately 3 degrees of head angle in the illustrated embodiment. The potentiometer <b>624</b> in the motor housing of actuator <b>48</b><i>c</i>, which operates to raise and lower head section <b>38</b> varies proportionally with movement of the motor drive shaft <b>172</b><i>c </i>while actuator <b>48</b><i>c </i>is operating. The logic module <b>512</b> measures a change in voltage across potentiometer <b>624</b> in a voltage divider circuit and converts it to a digital value using A/D converter <b>620</b>. The corresponding head angle is determined in process <b>3070</b> by reference to a look-up table stored in memory <b>3010</b>. Table 5 below shows examples of the head angle values and their corresponding potentiometer readings.

<p id="p-0579" num="0578">At decision step <b>3074</b>, process <b>3070</b> evaluates the input received from logic module <b>512</b> and determines whether head section <b>38</b> has experienced at least a 3 degree change in position by comparing the current head angle to the previous head angle. If the head angle has changed at least approximately 3 degrees, the process <b>3070</b> continues to step <b>3076</b>. If no change or less than approximately 3 degrees change in either direction has occurred, process <b>3070</b> returns to step <b>3072</b>. It is understood that 3 degrees is an exemplary value and that a change in the head angle may be indicated by a greater or lesser value as appropriate. Of course, during this time, pressure control system <b>3000</b> continues to periodically measure the pressure of seat section air zone <b>2304</b> to make sure that it is within the desired ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0580" num="0579">At decision step <b>3076</b>, it is determined whether the change in position of head section <b>38</b> occurred in the upward or downward direction. This determination is derived from the comparison of the current head angle to the previous head angle. As shown in Table 5, the ranges of values indicating a change in head elevation overlap, in order to take into consideration hysteresis in the head angle evaluation.</p>
<p id="p-0581" num="0580">For example, head section <b>38</b> will be considered to have moved from region zero to region <b>1</b> if a potentiometer value of about 52 is received by process <b>3070</b> (corresponding to a head angle of 1-10 degrees). However, once head section <b>38</b> is in region <b>1</b>, it will not be considered to have moved back to region zero unless a potentiometer reading outside the specified range for region <b>1</b>, e.g., approximately 40 or less, is received.</p>
<p id="p-0582" num="0581">If a change in position occurs in the downward direction, i.e., head section <b>38</b> is lowered, then at step <b>3078</b> the inflation pressure of seat section air zone <b>2304</b> is decreased according to the size of the patient and the current head angle. The desired pressure range is determined by reference to a look-up table stored in memory <b>3010</b>. Table 4 above is an example of such a table.</p>
<p id="p-0583" num="0582">If a change in position occurs in the upward direction, i.e., head section <b>38</b> is elevated, then at step <b>3080</b> the inflation pressure of seat section air zone <b>2304</b> is increased. First, a “seat boost” is applied to seat section air zone <b>2304</b>, meaning that seat section air zone <b>2304</b> is initially over-inflated for a brief period of time to compensate for the above-mentioned weight shift. Examples of the initial “seat boost” pressures are shown in Table 2 above. In the illustrated embodiment, the period of time for the seat boost is about 15 seconds. After the seat boost period expires, process <b>3070</b> adjusts the pressure of seat section bladders <b>2304</b> to the desired level based on patient size and head angle, as determined by the look-up table mentioned above.</p>

<p id="p-0629" num="0628">According to an illustrative embodiment, the sensor <b>4462</b> comprises a Hall effect field sensor <b>4464</b> that detects the characteristics of a dynamic field generated by the mattress connector <b>4068</b>. More particularly, a magnet <b>4466</b> is positioned within a receiving boss <b>4468</b> of the mattress connector <b>4068</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 151</figref>). The manifold connector <b>4070</b> includes an opening <b>4470</b> configured to receive the boss <b>4468</b>, and the magnet <b>4466</b> received therein, when the mattress connector <b>4068</b> is fluidly coupled with the manifold connector <b>4070</b>. As such, the Hall effect sensor <b>4464</b> detects the magnetic field generated by the magnet <b>4466</b>. Based upon the detection of the predetermined magnetic field, the sensor <b>4464</b> sends a signal indicative of the respective mattress <b>4014</b> to the control system <b>44</b>. The control system <b>44</b> then permits operation of the air mattress functions.</p>
<p id="p-0630" num="0629">An illustrative circuitry associated with the sensor <b>4464</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 152</figref>. The circuitry includes an op-amp <b>4474</b> coupled to the sensor <b>4464</b>, an open collector <b>4476</b>, a transistor <b>4478</b>, and a resistor <b>4480</b>. The sensor <b>4464</b>, the op-amp <b>4474</b>, the open collector <b>4476</b>, and the transistor <b>4478</b> are coupled to ground <b>4482</b>.

It should be appreciated that based upon the desired control characteristics, the value of the resistor <b>4480</b> and the proximity sensor <b>4464</b> may be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0631" num="0630">Further, the type and functionality of an air mattress <b>4014</b> connected to the manifold connector <b>4070</b> may be associated with a predetermined sensitivity of Hall effect sensor <b>4464</b> or strength of magnet <b>4466</b>. Alternatively, multiple magnets <b>4466</b> and associated Hall effect sensors <b>4464</b> may be used to distinguish between different types of mattresses <b>4014</b>. Upon sensing a particular type of mattress <b>4014</b>, the control system <b>44</b> may deactivate and/or activate selected functions. For example, should the control system <b>44</b> receive a signal from the mattress sensor <b>4462</b> indicating that the mattress <b>4014</b> has no turn assist bladder assembly <b>4220</b>, then the left and right turn assist functionality may be deactivated.</p>
<p id="p-0632" num="0631">In a further illustrative embodiment, the presence of the fluid connector <b>4068</b> of the mattress <b>4014</b> may be detected by the pressure sensors, illustratively pressure transducers <b>566</b>, which are in communication with the control system <b>44</b>. More particularly, the control system <b>44</b> can initiate a diagnostic routine or process at predetermined intervals by supplying pressure to the outlets <b>4436</b> in the manifold connector <b>4070</b>. Should no mattress <b>4014</b> be connected to the manifold connector <b>4070</b>, then the pressure transducers <b>566</b> connected to the sensor outlets <b>4438</b> will measure atmospheric pressure (i.e., no back pressure). However, if a mattress <b>4014</b> is connected, then the sensor outlets <b>4438</b>, upon the application of fluid through the fill outlets <b>4436</b>, will measure a certain amount of back pressure. As such, through this diagnostic routine, the control system <b>44</b> can determine if a mattress <b>4014</b> is connected to the manifold <b>4063</b>, and also which outlets <b>4436</b> are connected to respective air zones <b>4254</b>, <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>, <b>4390</b> and <b>4392</b>.

<p id="p-0635" num="0634">Pressure sensors, illustratively transducers <b>566</b>, periodically sense the pressure in one or more of controlled air zones <b>4254</b>, <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>, <b>4390</b>, and <b>4392</b> of mattress <b>4014</b> and output a voltage proportional to the amount of pressure that is sensed. Analog-to-digital converter <b>3002</b> converts the voltage to digital form and feeds the digital value to microcontroller <b>3004</b>.

Memory <b>3010</b> stores data, illustratively in the form of look-up tables or algorithms, which is used in this analysis. For example, the desired pressure of air zones <b>4254</b>, <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>, <b>4390</b>, and <b>4392</b> may depend on the particular operating mode of the system <b>3000</b> (e.g., pressure relief, max-inflate, CPR, turn assist, and post-turn assist), whether head section <b>4038</b> is elevated and the degree of elevation, and/or the size or weight of the patient. The microcontroller <b>3004</b> operates valve solenoids <b>564</b> in response to the feedback signals from pressure transducers <b>566</b> to achieve the desired adjustments to mattress <b>4014</b>. The valve solenoids <b>564</b> control the flow of air to and resulting pressure within the mattress <b>4014</b>. Additional details regarding the valve solenoids <b>564</b> are provided above.</p>
<p id="h-0063" num="0000">Valve Sensor</p>
<p id="p-0636" num="0635">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 153</figref>, a valve sensor <b>4484</b> is operably coupled to the valve solenoids <b>564</b> to determine the type of pneumatic valve <b>2406</b> application or technology. More particularly, the valve sensor <b>4484</b> determines the presence of either (1) a direct acting solenoid valve or (2) a pilot operated, or pilot assisted, solenoid valve. The operational requirements for these two types of valves differ. The direct acting solenoid valve pulls more current from a solenoid voltage source <b>4486</b>, and therefore pulse modulation of the current is employed. The pilot operated solenoid valve requires the application and maintenance of a pilot air pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0637" num="0636">The determination of the particular type of valve <b>2406</b> is achieved by energizing each connected solenoid <b>564</b> individually. When a valve <b>2406</b> is actuated by the closing of a valve control relay <b>4488</b>, the current pulled by the respective solenoid <b>564</b> is measured by a current transducer <b>4490</b>. This measurement is supplied to an analog to digital converter <b>4492</b> which, in turn, supplies the measurement to a microcontroller, illustratively the microcontroller <b>3004</b> of the pressure control system <b>3000</b>. Alternatively, the microcontroller may be independent of the microcontroller <b>3004</b>. The microcontroller <b>3004</b> compares the measurement to known operating current values which are representative of the direct acting solenoid valve and the pilot operated solenoid valve. This comparison is the basis for deciding the type of valve <b>2406</b> (i.e. direct acting solenoid valve or pilot operated solenoid valve).</p>
<p id="p-0638" num="0637">If the microcontroller <b>3004</b> determines that the number and types of valves <b>2406</b> equal a predetermined configuration, then the valves <b>2406</b> are driven by the microcontroller <b>3004</b> as appropriate for those types. If the microcontroller <b>3004</b> determines that the number and types of valves <b>2406</b> does not equal the predetermined configuration, then an error is reported by the microcontroller <b>3004</b>. In one illustrative embodiment, the predetermined configuration is defined such that all of the valves <b>2406</b> coupled to the manifold <b>4063</b> are pilot operated solenoid valves. As such, the microcontroller <b>3004</b> queries whether all of the valves <b>2406</b> are pilot operated solenoid valves. If so, then the valves <b>2406</b> are driven by the microcontroller <b>3004</b> as appropriate for pilot operated solenoid valves. If the valves <b>2406</b> collectively are determined not to be of the predetermined configuration, in this illustrative embodiment meaning that all of the valves <b>2406</b> are not pilot operated solenoid valves, then the microcontroller <b>3004</b> reports an error. It should be appreciated that the predetermined configuration may comprise all direct acting solenoid valves, all pilot operated solenoid valves, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0639" num="0638">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 153</figref>, a supervisor relay <b>4496</b> may be positioned intermediate the solenoid voltage source <b>4486</b> and the current transducer <b>4490</b>. Further, the solenoid <b>564</b> is coupled to ground <b>4498</b> through the valve control relay <b>4488</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0640" num="0639">The valve sensor <b>4484</b> permits the utilization of different predetermined configurations of valves <b>2406</b> in different patient supports. More particularly, the configuration of valves <b>2406</b> may be varied for different types or model years of patient supports in order to facilitate cost effectiveness and to take advantage of technological developments in valve design. For example, in a first patient support, all pilot operated valves may be utilized and the predetermined configuration stored in the microcontroller <b>3004</b> reflects this situation. However, in a later second patient support, all direct acting solenoid valves may be utilized. As such, the microcontroller <b>3004</b> may be modified or re-programmed to detect this new predetermined configuration.</p>

<p id="p-0647" num="0646">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 154</figref>, an illustrative process <b>4710</b> of operation of the dynamic surface module <b>518</b> incorporating the mattress sensor <b>4462</b> begins at block <b>4712</b> with the operator or caregiver depressing appropriate keys or buttons on the one of the controllers <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> to deactivate or turn off the air pressure control system <b>3000</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the operator simultaneously depresses the “Pressure Relief” button <b>1628</b> and the “Max Inflate” button <b>1622</b> on the controller <b>54</b> for a minimum of five (5) seconds in order to cause the pressure control system <b>3000</b> to deactivate or enter into an OFF mode. By deactivating the pressure control system <b>3000</b>, continuous alarms or error messages for alerting the operator of the absence of an air mattress <b>4014</b> coupling are eliminated. In other words, if the pressure control system <b>3000</b> is active or in an ON mode when the air mattress <b>4014</b> is uncoupled from the control system <b>44</b> of the bed <b>4010</b>, then the mattress sensor <b>4462</b> detects the absence of the air mattress <b>4014</b> and controller <b>3004</b> causes an error code to display on panel <b>1242</b> of the controller <b>54</b> and causes the activation of an audible alarm for a preset time period.</p>
<p id="p-0648" num="0647">Next, as indicated at block <b>4714</b>, the pressures in the head, seat, right turn assist and left turn assist zones <b>4390</b>, <b>4392</b>, <b>4360</b> and <b>4362</b> are not regulated by the pressure control system <b>3000</b>. Further, all air mode indicators <b>1518</b> on the controller <b>54</b> are deactivated or off. At block <b>4716</b>, the controller <b>3004</b> queries whether a mode button <b>1622</b>, <b>1624</b>, <b>1626</b>, <b>1628</b> for operation of the pressure control system <b>3000</b>, has been selected on the controller <b>54</b>. If not, then the process returns to block <b>4714</b>. If a mode button <b>1622</b>, <b>1624</b>, <b>1626</b>, <b>1628</b> has been selected, then the process continues to decision block <b>4718</b>, where the controller <b>3004</b> determines if the mattress sensor <b>4462</b> detects a mattress <b>4014</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0649" num="0648">If at block <b>4718</b>, the mattress sensor <b>4462</b> does not detect a coupled mattress <b>4014</b>, then the controller <b>3004</b> at block <b>4720</b> flashes selected mode indicators <b>1518</b> on the controller <b>54</b> and also sounds an audible alarm for a selected time period. The process then returns to block <b>4714</b>. If at block <b>4718</b>, the mattress sensor <b>4462</b> detects a coupled mattress <b>4014</b>, then the process continues to block <b>4722</b> when the pressure controller <b>3000</b> enters or initiates the selected mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0650" num="0649">As such, it may be appreciated that the mattress sensor <b>4462</b> of the present invention provides the operator with the flexibility of utilizing the bed <b>10</b>′ with a dynamic air mattress <b>4014</b> or some other support surface, such as a static foam mattress. If the bed <b>10</b>′ is to be used with a static foam mattress, for example, then the mattress sensor <b>4462</b> signals the controller <b>3004</b> which, in turn, cannot be activated by the operator. The pressure control system <b>3000</b> remains in an inactive or OFF mode, thereby locking out an operator from activating or turning ON the pressure control system <b>3000</b> and attempting to use the system on a foam mattress.</p>
<p id="p-0651" num="0650">The controller <b>3004</b> of pressure control system <b>3000</b> regulates pressure within the air mattress <b>4014</b>. If the pressure of an air zone <b>4254</b>, <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>, <b>4390</b>, and <b>4392</b> is too high, controller <b>3004</b> actuates the appropriate valve assembly actuator <b>564</b> to allow air to escape from the air zone <b>4254</b>, <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>, <b>4390</b>, and <b>4392</b>. If the pressure is too low, microcontroller <b>3004</b> sends a message over network <b>510</b> to power supply module <b>514</b> of patient support <b>4010</b> (parts of which are generally depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 124</figref> as power supply <b>3006</b>), and power supply <b>3006</b> activates pump <b>4064</b>. When microcontroller <b>3004</b> detects that pump <b>4064</b> is turned on, it actuates the appropriate valve assembly actuator <b>564</b> to allow air to enter the respective air zone <b>4254</b>, <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>, <b>4390</b>, <b>4392</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0652" num="0651">Among other things, embodiments of pressure control system <b>3000</b> include one or more of the following functionalities: a process <b>3030</b> for controlling the inflation of air zones <b>4254</b>, <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>, <b>4390</b>, and <b>4392</b> according to the size or weight of a patient, a process <b>3032</b> for controlling inflation of turn assist bladders <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>, a process <b>3070</b> for controlling inflation of seat section <b>4392</b> of mattress <b>4014</b> in response to elevation of the head section <b>4038</b> of the deck <b>26</b>′ and/or a process for controlling inflation of seat section <b>4392</b> of mattress <b>4014</b> in response to the patient sitting up on the bed <b>4014</b> with little or no support by the head section <b>4038</b> of the deck <b>26</b>′.</p>
<p id="h-0065" num="0000">Mattress Pressure Dependency on Patient Weight</p>
<p id="p-0653" num="0652">In certain illustrative embodiments of pressure control system <b>3000</b> of dynamic surface module <b>518</b>, a process <b>4730</b> for controlling the inflation of air zones <b>4254</b>, <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>, <b>4390</b>, and <b>4392</b> according to the size or weight of a patient disposed on patient support <b>4010</b> is provided. One illustrative embodiment of process <b>4730</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 155</figref> and described below.</p>
<p id="p-0654" num="0653">In certain illustrative embodiments as detailed above, an operator or caregiver is required to select an appropriate patient weight. In still other embodiments, the controller <b>3004</b> automatically selects a default setting, e.g., the “medium” size, if a patient weight is not selected by the operator or caregiver.</p>
<p id="p-0655" num="0654">In yet another illustrative embodiment, pressure control system <b>3000</b> automatically determines the patient's weight through measurements by weigh frame <b>36</b> and/or by a force sensor supported by seat section <b>40</b>′. More particularly, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 129 and 156</figref>, the patient's weight is derived from an algorithm whose inputs include force sensing resistors (FSRs) <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>5008</b>, and <b>5010</b> supported on the deck <b>26</b>′ below the mattress <b>4014</b>, and the four load cells <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, and <b>226</b> forming a portion of the in-bed scale weighing system. The load cells <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> are coupled to the scale controller <b>5012</b>, which is configured to perform diagnostic evaluations of the load cells to determine if they are working properly. In the illustrative embodiment, there are a total of five FSRs, including three FSRs <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, and <b>5006</b> supported by the head section <b>38</b>′ of the bed deck <b>26</b>′, and two FSRs <b>5008</b> and <b>5010</b> supported by the seat section <b>40</b>′ of the bed deck <b>26</b>′. The two FSRs <b>5008</b> and <b>5010</b> in the seat section <b>40</b>′ and one of the FSRs <b>5004</b> in the head section <b>38</b>′ are connected to a scale controller <b>5012</b>. These FSRs <b>5004</b>, <b>5008</b>, and <b>5010</b> are used for a patient position monitoring (PPM) system operated by the scale controller <b>5012</b> and which is configured to notify a caregiver when the patient changes position relative to the patient support <b>10</b>′. The two additional FSRs <b>5002</b> and <b>5006</b> in the head section <b>38</b>′ are connected to the air controller <b>3004</b>. These two additional FSRs <b>5002</b> and <b>5006</b> provide additional detection coverage in the head section <b>4038</b>, and also provide a diagnostic function in order to allow the air controller <b>3004</b> to determine when these FSRs <b>5002</b> and <b>5006</b> are disconnected or malfunctioning.</p>
<p id="p-0656" num="0655">The FSRs are of conventional design and have resistance values which change depending upon the amount of force applied thereto. FSRs generally comprise polymer thick film (PTF) devices which exhibit a decrease in resistance with an increase in the force applied to an active surface. More particularly, the resistance of the FSRs drop below a predetermined value when a certain force is applied. While force sensing resistors (FSRs) are utilized in the illustrated embodiment, it should be appreciated that other sensors for detecting the presence of a patient supported on the head section <b>4390</b> and the seat section <b>4392</b> of the mattress <b>4014</b> may be substituted therefore. Illustratively, the FSRs are available from Interlink Electronics of Camarillo, Calif. as part number 408.</p>
<p id="h-0066" num="0000">Patient Weight Determination</p>
<p id="p-0657" num="0656">As noted above, four load cells <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, and <b>226</b> are attached to the four corners of the weigh frame <b>36</b> of the bed <b>10</b>′. The summation of these four load cells <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, and <b>226</b>, when their output is converted to a weight, provide the total weight supported by the weigh frame <b>36</b>. The weight of weigh frame <b>36</b> and anything supported by weigh frame <b>36</b>, such as deck <b>26</b>′, mattress <b>4014</b>, any other bed components supported on weigh frame <b>36</b>, and a patient, is transmitted to load cells <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>. This weight deflects or otherwise changes a characteristic of load cells <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> that is detected to determine the total weight supported thereby. By subtracting a known weight of weigh frame <b>36</b>, deck <b>26</b>′, mattress <b>4014</b> and any other bed components supported on weigh frame <b>36</b>, the weight of the patient positioned on patient support <b>10</b> can be determined. Additional description of load cells and methods for determining a patient's weight, position in the bed, and other indications provided by load cells is provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/669,707, filed Sep. 26, 2000, titled Load Cell Apparatus, to Mobley et al., and PCT international patent application Ser. No. PCT/US/08189, titled Hospital Bed Control Apparatus, to Dixon et al., the disclosures of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein. In one illustrative embodiment, the load cells are available from HBM, Inc. of Marlborough, Mass. According to alternative embodiments of the present disclosure, other configurations and methods of using load cells or other devices to determine a patient's weight or other information related to the patient known to those of ordinary skill in the art are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0658" num="0657">Information from the scale controller <b>5012</b> is transmitted to the air controller <b>3004</b> through the controller area network (CAN) <b>510</b>. The information is parsed into seven data sets (four load cells <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>, three FSRs <b>5004</b>, <b>5008</b>, <b>5010</b>) with each transmission being spaced apart by approximately 100 milliseconds. Along with each data set is an error byte that contains diagnostic information pertaining to the load cells <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0659" num="0658">Referring further to the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 155</figref>, the illustrative process begins upon appropriate activation of the controller <b>3004</b> and with the initialization of all variables. Next, the process continues at block <b>4734</b>, where the scale controller <b>5012</b> determines the weight of the patient, as represented by the variable Patient_Weight. In the illustrative process <b>4730</b>, the value of Patient_Weight is determined by the subprocess <b>5020</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 157 and 158</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0660" num="0659">Process <b>5020</b> begins at block <b>5022</b> with the initialization of all variables. As detailed below, the variable Load_Beam_Offset is set to equal a value from the most recent operation of the controller <b>3004</b>. At decision block <b>5024</b>, the controller <b>3004</b> queries whether it is ready for processing data. More particularly, the controller <b>3004</b> determines whether a complete set of data from the FSRs <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>5008</b>, <b>5010</b> and load cells <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> is available for utilization. As noted above, a complete set of updated data is received every 700 milliseconds. More particularly, seven packages of data are received from the scale controller <b>5012</b> at the rate of one package every 100 milliseconds. Two additional packages of information are received from the first and third head section FSRs <b>5002</b> and <b>5006</b>, one every 350 milliseconds. If a complete new set of data from the FSRs <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>5008</b>, <b>5010</b> and the load cells <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> is not available, then the process returns at block <b>5026</b> to start block <b>5022</b>. If decision block <b>5024</b> is answered in the affirmative, then the process continues to decision block <b>5028</b> where the controller <b>3004</b> processes data from the FSRs <b>5002</b> and <b>5006</b> and the scale controller <b>5012</b>. More particularly, the processor <b>3004</b> determines the value of the variable Load_Beam_Total to be equal to the sum of the four inputs from the load cells <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>. The controller <b>3004</b> further analyzes the values from the FSRs <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>5008</b>, <b>5010</b>. If any of the FSRs <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>5008</b>, <b>5010</b> have a resistance indicating the presence of a patient, then the controller <b>3004</b> sets the flag Patient_Present to TRUE.</p>
<p id="p-0661" num="0660">The process <b>5020</b> next continues to block <b>5030</b> where the controller <b>3004</b> queries whether the data from both the FSRs <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>5008</b>, <b>5010</b> and the scale controller <b>5012</b> are stable. More particularly, the controller <b>3004</b> queries whether the patient has been consistently detected as being present or not present for a minimum predetermined amount of time. In the illustrative embodiment, if (1) the patient has been detected for at least approximately 3.5 seconds as indicated by the flag Patient_Present being set to TRUE, or (2) the patient has not been detected for at least approximately 3.5 seconds as indicated by the flag Patient_Present being set to FALSE, then the FSR data is considered stable. Similarly, if the Load_Beam_Total variable has not changed by more than five pounds for at least approximately 3.5 seconds, then the scale data is considered stable. If the controller <b>3004</b> determines that the data is not stable at block <b>5030</b>, then the process proceeds to block <b>5026</b>. If the data is considered stable, then the process <b>5020</b> then continues to process block <b>5032</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0662" num="0661">In one illustrative embodiment, the FSRs <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>5008</b>, <b>5010</b> are grouped into two sets, with the first group comprising all of the FSRs <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>5008</b>, <b>5010</b>, and the second group comprising the head section FSRs <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, <b>5006</b>. In order for the FSR data to be considered stable by the controller <b>3004</b>, then (1) all of the FSRs in either the first group or the second group must not detect a patient for at least approximately 3.5 seconds, or (2) any of the FSRs in either the first group or the second group must detect a patient for at least approximately 3.5 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0663" num="0662">At block <b>5032</b>, the controller <b>3004</b> recalculates the variable Load_Beam_Adj. More particularly, the controller sets Load_Beam_Adj to be equal to the variable Load_Beam_Total minus the variable Load_Beam_Offset. As mentioned above, the variable Load_Beam_Offset is saved from the prior operation of the controller <b>3004</b>. The Load_Beam_Offset is defined as the weight measured by the scale controller <b>5012</b> prior to a patient getting on the bed <b>10</b>′ and being supported by the weigh frame <b>36</b>, and following the addition of the mattress <b>4014</b>, footboard <b>18</b> and any other equipment supported by the weigh frame <b>36</b>. The Load_Beam_Offset takes into consideration the factory calibration, typically the zeroing or initializing of the weight measured by the scale controller <b>5012</b> without the mattress <b>4014</b>, footboard <b>18</b>, or other equipment supported by the weigh frame <b>36</b>. In summary, the Load_Beam_Offset is equal to a load applied to the weigh frame <b>36</b> in excess of that when the bed <b>10</b>′ is calibrated during manufacture and without the patient supported by the weigh frame <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0664" num="0663">The process <b>5020</b> then continues to decision block <b>5034</b>, where the controller <b>3004</b> queries whether the conditions have been satisfied to “zero” the bed <b>10</b>′. In other words, the controller <b>3004</b> determines whether conditions are satisfied for recalculating the offset (Load_Beam_Offset) for the bed <b>10</b>′. More particularly, the controller <b>3004</b> queries whether (1) the variable Load_Beam_Adj is less than zero or (2) the variable Load_Beam_Adj is less than a maximum detected offset value and the flag Patient_Present is FALSE. The first instance, where the Load_Beam_Adj is negative, could occur where equipment has been removed from the weigh frame <b>36</b> since the last operation of the controller <b>3004</b>. As such, the value of the variable Load_Beam_Total could be less than the value of the variable Load_Beam_Offset as saved from the prior operation. The second instance, where the variable Load_Beam_Adj is less than a maximum detected offset value and the Patient_Present flag is FALSE could occur where equipment has been added to the bed <b>4010</b> and is supported by the weigh frame <b>36</b> since the last operation of the controller <b>3004</b>, and no patient is detected as being supported by the deck <b>26</b>′. If at block <b>5034</b>, the controller <b>3004</b> determines that the conditions are right to zero the bed <b>10</b>′ then the process <b>5020</b> continues to block <b>5036</b>. Illustratively, the maximum detected offset value is defined as approximately 50 pounds.</p>
<p id="p-0665" num="0664">At process block <b>5036</b>, the controller <b>3004</b> calculates a new offset and clears the flag New_Offset_Pending. More particularly, the controller <b>3004</b> equates the variable Load_Beam_Offset to the variable Load_Beam_Total, and sets the New_Offset_Pending flag to FALSE. As such, the controller <b>3004</b> resets the Load_Beam_Offset to be equal to the value of the Load_Beam_Total. The process then continues at block <b>5038</b> where the controller <b>3004</b> recalculates the variable Load_Beam_Adj. More particularly, the controller <b>3004</b> equates the variable Load_Beam_Adj to be equal to the variable Load_Beam_Total minus the variable Load_Beam_Offset.</p>
<p id="p-0666" num="0665">The process <b>5020</b> then continues to block <b>5040</b> where the controller <b>3004</b> applies output filter and weight limits. More particularly, the controller <b>3004</b> updates the variable Patient_Weight only if (1) the variable Load_Beam_Adj is greater than the variable Patient_Weight plus a minimum patient weight change or (2) the variable Load_Beam_Adj is less than the variable Patient_Weight minus the minimum patient weight change. Illustratively, the minimum patient weight change is defined as approximately ten pounds. If the variable Load_Beam_Adj is greater than a maximum patient weight, then the controller <b>3004</b> sets Patient_Weight to be equal to a default maximum patient weight. Illustratively, the maximum patient weight is defined as approximately 350 pounds, while the default maximum patient weight is defined as approximately 400 pounds. If the variable Load_Beam_Adj is less than a minimum patient weight, then the variable Patient_Weight is set to be equal to a default minimum patient weight. Illustratively, the minimum patient weight and the default minimum patient weight are both set to be equal to approximately 65 pounds. The process <b>5020</b> then continues to return block <b>5026</b> and subsequently to decision block <b>5024</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0667" num="0666">Referring again to decision block <b>5034</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 157</figref>, if the conditions are not proper for resetting the bed <b>4010</b> as detailed above, then the process <b>5020</b> continues to decision block <b>5042</b>. At decision block <b>5042</b>, the controller <b>3004</b> queries whether there is a possible large offset to record. More particularly, the controller <b>3004</b> determines whether (1) the variable Load_Beam_Adj is greater than or equal to the maximum detected offset value and (2) the flag Patient_Present is FALSE. In other words, the controller <b>3004</b> determines whether a large load has been measured by the weigh frame <b>36</b> and no patient is detected on the deck <b>26</b>′. As noted above, the maximum detected offset value is illustratively defined as approximately 50 pounds. If decision block <b>5042</b> is answered in the affirmative, then the process <b>5020</b> continues to process block <b>5044</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0668" num="0667">At block <b>5044</b>, the controller <b>3004</b> stores the pending offset and sets the New_Offset_Pending flag. More particularly, the variable Pending_Offset is set equal to the Load_Beam_Total and the flag New_Offset_Pending is set to TRUE. The process <b>5020</b> then continues to process block <b>5040</b> and continues to operate as detailed herein as if a patient is present on the deck <b>26</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0669" num="0668">Referring again to decision block <b>5042</b>, if there is no possible large offset to record, then the process continues to decision block <b>5046</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 158</figref>). At decision block <b>5046</b>, the controller <b>3004</b> queries whether there is an existing pending offset. More particularly, the controller <b>3004</b> queries whether the flag New_Offset_Pending is set to TRUE. If decision block <b>5046</b> is answered in the negative, then the process <b>5020</b> continues to process block <b>5040</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>). If decision block <b>5046</b> is answered in the affirmative, then the process <b>5020</b> continues to decision block <b>5048</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0670" num="0669">At decision block <b>5048</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 158</figref>, the controller <b>3004</b> queries whether the variable Load_Beam_Adj is much greater than the pending offset. More particularly, the controller <b>3004</b> determines whether the variable Load_Beam_Adj is greater than the variable Pending_Offset plus a minimum new patient weight. Illustratively, the value of the minimum new patient weight is defined as approximately 90 pounds. If decision block <b>5048</b> is answered in the negative, then the process <b>5020</b> continues to process block <b>5050</b> where the New_Offset_Pending flag is cleared or set to FALSE. The process <b>5020</b> then continues to process block <b>5040</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 157</figref>). If the decision block <b>5048</b> is answered in the affirmative, then the process continues to block <b>5052</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0671" num="0670">At block <b>5052</b>, the controller <b>3004</b> updates the offset with the pending offset. More particularly, the controller <b>3004</b> sets a variable Load_Beam_Offset to be equal to the variable Pending_Offset. The situation could occur where a patient is now present on the deck <b>26</b>′ and the prior pending offset value was equipment supported by the weigh frame <b>36</b>. The process then continues to process block <b>5054</b>. At process block <b>5054</b>, the controller <b>3004</b> recalculates the variable Load_Beam_Adj. Again, Load_Beam_Adj is equal to the variable Load_Beam_Total minus the variable Load_Beam_Offset. The process <b>5020</b> then continues to block <b>5050</b> where the New_Offset_Pending flag is cleared or set to FALSE. The process <b>5020</b> then continues to process block <b>5040</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 157</figref>) where the controller <b>3004</b> applies output filter and weight limits and updates the patient weight if appropriate. The process <b>5020</b> then continues to the return block <b>5026</b> and subsequently to decision block <b>5024</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0672" num="0671">Once the value of the variable Patient_Weight has been determined, for example by the above detailed process <b>5020</b>, the process <b>4730</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 155</figref> continues at block <b>4736</b>. At step <b>4736</b>, the air zone(s) <b>4254</b>, <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>, <b>4390</b>, and <b>4392</b> being monitored is determined. The bladders in the heel pressure relief member <b>4254</b>, the head section <b>4390</b>, the seat section <b>4392</b>, and the turn assist bladders <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b> may be inflated to varying pressures based on patient weight, as represented by the variable Patient_Weight. However, it is understood that in alternative embodiments not all of the air zones <b>4254</b>, <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>, <b>4390</b>, and <b>4392</b> may be inflated based on patient weight.</p>
<p id="p-0673" num="0672">At step <b>4736</b>, process <b>4730</b> determines the desired inflation pressure for the air zone(s) <b>4254</b>, <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>, <b>4390</b>, and <b>4392</b> being monitored based on the patient weight. In the illustrated embodiment, microcontroller <b>3004</b> obtains the desired pressure for the air zone(s) <b>4254</b>, <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>, <b>4390</b>, and <b>4392</b> from data, such as one or more look-up tables, stored in memory <b>3010</b>. The desired pressure may be a discrete value, a range of permissible values, or calculated from an equation or algorithm as a function of patient weight. Also, the desired pressure may be different for each air zone <b>4254</b>, <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>, <b>4390</b>, and <b>4392</b>. Further, various other factors, including environmental factors such as temperature and/or altitude, may affect the desired pressure values and be reflected in data in the look-up table.</p>
<p id="p-0674" num="0673">As detailed in Table 7, in the illustrated embodiment the appropriate pressures for the seat section <b>4392</b>, in pressure relief and turn assist modes of operation, also depends on the elevation of head section <b>38</b>′, as represented by the variable Head_Elevation. Thus, for seat section <b>4392</b>, the appropriate pressure is determined by reference to both patient weight and head angle. However, adjusting the pressure of seat section <b>4392</b> based on only one of these criteria, regardless of the mode of operation, is also within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="h-0067" num="0000">Mattress Seat Section Boost</p>
<p id="p-0675" num="0674">As may be appreciated, when the head section <b>38</b>′ is elevated, a portion of the patient's weight naturally shifts from being supported by the head section <b>4390</b> of the mattress <b>4014</b> to the seat section <b>4392</b> of the mattress <b>4014</b>. To compensate for this weight shift, the inflation pressure of the seat section <b>4392</b> is adjusted in response to changes in the position of the head section <b>4038</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, and as shown in Table 7, the pressure in the seat section <b>4392</b> is dependent upon the elevation of the head section <b>4390</b> only during the pressure relief and turn assist modes of operation. In other words, the pressure in the seat section <b>4392</b> is not varied in response to changes in elevation of the head section <b>4390</b> in the max inflate, CPR, or post-turn assist modes of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0676" num="0675">Illustratively, the position of head section <b>38</b>′, or head angle, is determined by position detector <b>606</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, a potentiometer reading corresponding to the head angle is determined by logic module <b>512</b> and reported to dynamic surface module <b>518</b> via network <b>510</b> for use in process <b>4730</b>. Additional details regarding operation of the potentiometer for determining head angle is detailed above.</p>
<p id="p-0677" num="0676">In determining the pressure for the seat section <b>4392</b> at block <b>4738</b>, the microcontroller <b>3004</b> compares the angle as determined by the position detector <b>606</b> to data stored in memory <b>3010</b>, such as those values contained in Table 10 below. The ranges of values for adjacent angular regions indicating a change in head elevation in Table 10 overlap, in order to take into consideration hysteresis (dependence of the state of a system on its previous history, generally in the form of a lagging of a physical effect behind its cause) in the head angle evaluation.</p>

However, once head section <b>38</b>′ is in region 1 (one), it will not be considered to have moved back to region <b>0</b> (zero) unless the position detector <b>606</b> measures a head angle below region <b>1</b> (one), e.g., approximately 26 degrees or less, is received. Further, as indicated in Table 10, the variable Head_Elevation for use in pressure calculations is set to a predetermined value for each region of measured head elevation. For example, in region <b>1</b> (one), the variable Head_Elevation is set to 40 degrees, while in region <b>2</b> (two), the variable Head_Elevation is set to 50 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0680" num="0679">If a change in position occurs in the downward direction, from one angular region to a different angular region, i.e., head section <b>4038</b> is lowered from region 2 (two) to region <b>1</b> (one) in Table 10, then at step <b>4738</b> the desired pressure of seat section <b>4392</b> is decreased according to the weight of the patient, represented by Patient_Weight, and the current head angle set as Head_Elevation. The desired pressure range (Pressure_Seat range) is determined by reference to a look-up table stored in memory <b>3010</b>. Table 7 is an example of such a table.</p>
<p id="p-0681" num="0680">If a change in position occurs in the upward direction, from one angular region to a different angular region, i.e., head section <b>38</b>′ is elevated from region <b>0</b> (zero) to region <b>1</b> (one) in Table 10, then at step <b>4738</b> the desired pressure of seat section <b>4392</b> is increased according to the weight of the patient, represented by the variable Patient_Weight, and the current head angle set as Head_Elevation. In addition, a “seat boost” may be applied to seat section, as detailed below, meaning that seat section <b>4392</b> is initially over-inflated for a brief period of time to compensate for the above-mentioned weight shift.</p>
<p id="p-0682" num="0681">At step <b>4740</b>, microcontroller <b>3004</b> measures the current pressure as described above and determines whether the current pressure is less than, equal to, or greater than the desired pressure determined as described above. At block <b>4742</b>, the microcontroller <b>3004</b> queries whether the actual pressure is greater than the desired pressure determined at step <b>4738</b> above. If so, then at step <b>4744</b>, the zone is deflated to the desired pressure. At block <b>4746</b>, the microcontroller <b>3004</b> queries whether the current pressure is less than the desired pressure. If so, the microcontroller <b>3004</b> commands power supply <b>3006</b> to activate pump <b>4064</b> to inflate bladders <b>2304</b> to the desired pressure as described above, at step <b>4738</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0683" num="0682">After the pressure is decreased or increased at blocks <b>4744</b> and <b>4748</b>, respectively, the process <b>4730</b> continues to block <b>4750</b>. At block <b>4750</b>, the controller <b>3004</b> determines if the seat section <b>4392</b> requires a pressure “boost.”</p>
<p id="p-0684" num="0683">In addition to other functions discussed above and elsewhere in this disclosure, pressure control system <b>3000</b> may perform additional processes <b>4800</b>, <b>4900</b> for increasing or “boosting” the inflation of seat section according to the elevation of head section <b>4038</b>. One embodiment of such method is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 160</figref> and described below.</p>
<p id="p-0685" num="0684">As noted above, when head section <b>38</b>′ is elevated, a portion of the patient's weight naturally shifts from head section <b>4390</b> of the mattress <b>4014</b> to seat section <b>4392</b> of the mattress <b>4014</b>. A similar weight shift occurs when the patient sits up in the bed <b>10</b>′ such that the patient's weight is supported mostly or entirely by the seat section <b>4392</b>. To anticipate this weight shift and prevent “bottoming out,” the inflation pressure of seat section <b>4392</b> is boosted in response to changes in the position of head section <b>38</b>′. Table 11 shows boost pressure ranges for seat section depending on ranges of patient weight.</p>

<p id="p-0687" num="0686">Process <b>4800</b> begins at block <b>4802</b> with the determination of the elevation of the head section (Head_Elevation), in the manner detailed above. At decision step <b>4804</b>, process <b>4800</b> evaluates the input received from logic module <b>512</b> and determines whether head section <b>38</b>′ has experienced at least a 3 degree increase in position by comparing the current head angle to the previous head angle. If the head angle has increased by at least approximately 3 degrees, the process <b>4800</b> continues to step <b>4806</b>. If the head section <b>38</b>′ has not been elevated by at least approximately 3 degrees, then process <b>4800</b> returns to step <b>4802</b>. It is understood that 3 degrees is an exemplary value and that a change in the head angle may be indicated by a greater or lesser value as appropriate. Of course, during this time, pressure control system <b>3000</b> continues to periodically measure the pressure of the seat section <b>4392</b> to make sure that it is within the desired ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0688" num="0687">It should be appreciated that if a change in position occurs in the downward direction, i.e., head section <b>38</b>′ is lowered, then at step <b>4804</b> no pressure increase in the seat section <b>4392</b> is triggered. If a change in position occurs in the upward direction by at least 3 degrees, i.e., head section <b>38</b>′ is elevated, then at step <b>4806</b> the inflation pressure of seat section is increased. In other words, a “seat boost” is applied to seat section <b>4392</b>, meaning that seat section <b>4392</b> is initially over-inflated for a brief period of time to compensate for the above-mentioned weight shift. At block <b>4808</b>, a timing decision is executed by the controller <b>3004</b> to determine if the pressure boost exceeds a predetermined time, illustratively between 1 second and 30 seconds. In one illustrative embodiment, the predetermined time is set at approximately 15 seconds. If the pressure boost does not exceed the predetermined time, then the pressure boost continues at block <b>4806</b>. If the predetermined time has passed, then the process <b>4800</b> continues to block <b>4810</b>, where the pressure boost is terminated.</p>
<p id="p-0689" num="0688">Examples of the initial “seat boost” pressures are shown in Table 11. After the seat boost period expires, process <b>4800</b> adjusts the pressure of seat section <b>4392</b> to the desired level based on patient weight and head angle, as determined by the look-up Table 7 as detailed above.</p>
<p id="p-0690" num="0689">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 161</figref>, process <b>4900</b> for providing a sudden elevation or “boost” of pressure in the seat section <b>4392</b> likewise is triggered when the patient Sits up in the bed <b>10</b>′ such that the patient's weight is supported mostly or entirely by the seat section <b>4392</b>. Process <b>4900</b> begins at block <b>4902</b> with the controller <b>3004</b> monitoring the patient sensors or FSRs <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>5008</b>, <b>5010</b>. At decision block <b>4904</b>, the controller <b>3004</b> queries whether the head section patient sensors or FSRs <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, <b>5006</b> detect the presence of a patient in the head section <b>38</b>′. If block <b>4904</b> is answered in the affirmative, then the process returns to block <b>4902</b> and the controller <b>3004</b> continues monitoring the FSRs <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>5008</b>, <b>5010</b>. If at block <b>4904</b> the head section FSRs <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, <b>5006</b> do not detect a patient, then the process continues to block <b>4906</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0691" num="0690">At decision block <b>4906</b>, the controller <b>3004</b> queries whether the patient weight (Patient_Weight) is greater than a predetermined amount. In the illustrative embodiment, the predetermined amount is approximately 100 pounds. If the value of Patient_Weight is not greater than approximately 100 pounds, then the process returns to block <b>4902</b>. In other words, the no pressure boost will occur in the seat section <b>4392</b> if the determined patient weight is not greater than approximately 100 pounds. If the value of Patient_Weight is greater than approximately 100 pounds, then the process <b>4900</b> continues to block <b>4908</b> where the inflation pressure of seat section <b>4392</b> is increased. In other words, a “seat boost” is applied to seat section <b>4392</b>, meaning that seat section <b>4392</b> is initially over-inflated for a brief period of time to compensate for the above-mentioned weight shift. The seat boost continues indefinitely as long as the decision blocks <b>4904</b> and <b>4906</b> are answered affirmatively. Of course, during this time, pressure control system <b>3000</b> continues to periodically measure the pressure of the seat section <b>4392</b> to make sure that it is within the desired ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0692" num="0691">Examples of the initial “seat boost” pressures are shown in Table 11.

<p id="h-0068" num="0000">Patient Turn Assist</p>
<p id="p-0693" num="0692">In addition to other functions discussed above and elsewhere in this disclosure, pressure control system <b>3000</b> of dynamic surface module <b>518</b> controls the operation of turn assist bladder assembly <b>4220</b> during the turn assist mode of operation. Turn assist bladders <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b> are configured to be selectively inflated to assist a caregiver in turning or rotating a patient, e.g., for therapy or treatment reasons. One embodiment of a process <b>3032</b> for controlling operation of turn assist bladders <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 159</figref> described below. Process <b>3032</b> is implemented using application software stored in memory <b>3010</b> of microcontroller <b>3004</b>. The structure of turn assist bladders <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b> is described elsewhere in this application.</p>
<p id="p-0694" num="0693">At step <b>3034</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 159</figref>, process <b>3032</b> detects whether a request has been received to activate one of turn assist bladders <b>2262</b>, <b>2264</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, such a request is initiated by an operator or caregiver activating one of the turn assist buttons <b>1624</b>, <b>1626</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref>) located on siderail controllers <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. However, it is understood that other means for activating the turn assist may be used. For example, control system <b>44</b> may be programmed to automatically activate one or more of the turn assist buttons <b>1624</b>, <b>1626</b> at scheduled times during the day or night.</p>
<p id="p-0695" num="0694">At decision step <b>3036</b>, prior to initiating the turn assist function, process <b>3032</b> checks to make sure that the siderails <b>4020</b>, <b>4022</b> located on the side of patient support <b>10</b>′ that the patient is being turned toward are in the up position, based on signals provided by siderail position detectors <b>60</b>. If one or more of siderails <b>4020</b>, <b>4022</b> on the side of patient support <b>10</b>′ toward which the patient is being turned is not in the up position, an error signal is generated at step <b>3038</b> and process <b>3032</b> ends. In the illustrated embodiment, an audible or visual signal is generated for a brief period or until the siderail or siderails <b>4020</b>, <b>4022</b> are brought to the up position. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, the siderails <b>4020</b>, <b>4022</b> toward which the patient is being turned must be in the up position in order for the turn assist process to initiate. It is possible, however, that in other embodiments, a caregiver or operator may override this restriction, or that this restriction may be made optional, for example, depending on the circumstances of a particular patient.</p>
<p id="p-0696" num="0695">At step <b>3040</b>, process <b>3032</b> checks to see if the angle of head section <b>38</b>′ (Head_Elevation) is less than, equal to, or greater than a predetermined maximum angle. In the illustrated embodiment, the maximum head angle is about 25°. In one embodiment, signals are provided by the position detector <b>606</b> directly to the dynamic surface module <b>518</b>, which determines the head angle. Alternatively, the head angle determination is made by logic module <b>512</b> which reports the head angle to dynamic surface module <b>518</b> for use in process <b>3032</b>, via CAN network <b>510</b>. If the head angle is less than or equal to 25°, then the turn assist process continues to step <b>3044</b>. However, if the head angle is greater than about 25°, an error signal is generated at step <b>3042</b>, and the turn assist process is not permitted to continue.</p>
<p id="p-0697" num="0696">At step <b>3044</b>, the weight of the patient (Patient_Weight) being supported by patient support <b>10</b>′ is determined as described above so that a desired pressure based on patient weight is applied to the selected turn assist bladder <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0698" num="0697">At step <b>3046</b>, if first turn assist button <b>1624</b> is activated, first turn assist bladder <b>4358</b> inflates to rotate a person in patient support <b>10</b>′ upwardly in a counter-clockwise from the perspective of a person standing behind head section <b>38</b>′. If second turn assist button <b>1626</b> is activated, second turn assist bladder <b>4360</b> inflates to rotate the person upwardly in the opposite direction as rotated in response to activation of first turn assist button <b>1624</b>. Inflation of the selected turn assist bladder <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b> raises one side of the patient to a predetermined angle. In the illustrated embodiment, the selected turn assist bladder <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b> inflates to rotate the patient onto his or her side at about a 20 degree angle with respect to mattress <b>4014</b>, in approximately 20-50 seconds, depending on the weight or size of the patient. It is understood that the predetermined angle and speed of inflation may be changed or modified as needed based on a variety of factors, including the purpose for rotating the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0699" num="0698">A timer is set at step <b>3048</b> when the selected turn assist bladder <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b> is inflated. The selected turn assist bladder <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b> remains inflated for a predetermined period of time and is then automatically “reset” or deflated. The predetermined time is empirically determined by the needs and desires of the patient and caregiver in an operating environment and illustratively is a time within a range of approximately 5 seconds to approximately 5 minutes. In the illustrative embodiment, the duration of turn assist inflation is about 10 seconds. At step <b>3050</b> the timer counts out this wait period. After the wait period is complete (e.g., after 10 seconds), an audible or visual signal is generated to indicate to the patient and caregiver that the selected turn assist bladder <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b> is about to enter a “post-turn assist” mode or phase.</p>
<p id="p-0700" num="0699">In the post-turn assist mode, process <b>3032</b> begins deflating the selected turn assist bladder <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b> at step <b>3052</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, deflation is expedited by quickly “hyperinflating” bladders of the head and seat sections <b>4390</b> and <b>4392</b> to a firm, “post-turn assist” inflation pressure (see, e.g., Table 6 and Table 7). Inflation of head and seat sections <b>4390</b> and <b>4392</b> exerts pressure on turn assist bladders <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b> causing turn assist bladders <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b> to expel air more rapidly. Alternatively, a vacuum mechanism may be coupled to turn assist bladders <b>4358</b>, <b>4360</b> to accelerate deflation.</p>
<p id="p-0701" num="0700">Monitor activity step <b>3060</b> is a step that is periodically executed during the turn assist operation. This process detects whether a patient or caregiver attempts to utilize other bed features while the turn assist is in operation. Additional details regarding the operation of the dynamic surface module are provided above.</p>
<p id="h-0069" num="0000">CPR Configuration</p>
<p id="p-0702" num="0701">Patient support <b>10</b>′ may be placed in the preferred CPR configuration by providing an indication to control system <b>44</b> which in turn controls actuators <b>48</b><i>c</i>, <b>48</b><i>d</i>, <b>48</b><i>e </i>to place head, seat, and leg sections in a generally linear relationship, controls pump <b>4064</b>, to inflate upper bladder assembly <b>4222</b> to the desired pressures, and controls deck support <b>24</b> to lower a head end relative to a foot end. In the illustrative embodiment, the control system <b>44</b> inflates the bladder assembly <b>4394</b> of the head section <b>4390</b> to its desired CPR pressure before it inflates the bladder assembly <b>4396</b> of the seat section <b>4392</b> to its desired CPR pressure. As such, the head section <b>4390</b> reaches its desired firmness prior to the seat section <b>4392</b>. This functionality is desirable since CPR procedures typically require pressure to be applied to the upper torso or chest of a patient.</p>
<p id="h-0070" num="0000">Mattress Air Pump</p>
<p id="p-0703" num="0702">Pump <b>64</b> is configured to provide pressurized air to manifold <b>62</b> and the pneumatic devices of mattresses <b>14</b>, <b>4014</b>. As shown in the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 162 and 163</figref>, pump <b>64</b> includes a support bracket <b>5440</b> coupled to a strut <b>211</b> of weigh frame <b>36</b>, a pump cover support plate or bracket <b>5444</b> supported by support bracket <b>5440</b>, a pump cover <b>5446</b> supported by housing support bracket <b>5444</b>, a pump unit support bracket <b>5448</b> also supported by housing support bracket <b>5444</b>, a pump unit <b>5450</b> supported by pump unit support bracket <b>5448</b>, and a filter and muffler unit <b>5452</b> supported on the outside of pump cover <b>5446</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0704" num="0703">Many pump units, such as pump unit <b>5450</b>, create noise and vibration during operation. Several of the components of pump <b>64</b> are configured to reduce the transmission of the noise and vibration generated by pump unit <b>5450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0705" num="0704">As shown in FIGS. <b>113</b> and <b>162</b>-<b>164</b>, support bracket <b>5440</b> includes a pair of saddle-shaped portions <b>5454</b> that hook or loop over strut <b>211</b> and four arms <b>5456</b> that extend down from saddle-shaped portions <b>5454</b>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 163 and 166</figref>, pump unit <b>5450</b> illustratively includes a plurality of apertures <b>5496</b> and pump unit support bracket <b>5448</b> includes a plurality of apertures <b>5498</b> sized to receive feet <b>5486</b>. To install feet <b>5486</b>, an assembler inserts pull portions <b>5494</b> through respective apertures <b>5496</b>, <b>5498</b> and pulls on pull portions <b>5494</b> until the upper-most and lower most head portions <b>5488</b> are pulled through respective apertures <b>5496</b>, <b>5498</b>. After assembly, portions of pump unit support bracket <b>5448</b> and pump unit <b>5450</b> are positioned in annular grooves <b>5490</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 166</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0712" num="0711">An alterative embodiment resilient foot <b>5510</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 167</figref> coupled to pump unit <b>5450</b> and pump unit support bracket <b>5448</b>. Resilient foot <b>5510</b> includes a body portion <b>5512</b> made of a rubber or elastic material, a nut <b>5514</b>, and a threaded stud <b>5516</b>. Body portion <b>5512</b> is molded around nut <b>5514</b> and threaded stud <b>5516</b>. To couple foot <b>5510</b> to pump unit <b>5450</b> and pump unit support bracket <b>5448</b>, a bolt <b>5518</b> is threaded into nut <b>512</b> and a nut <b>5520</b> is threaded onto stud <b>5516</b>. Preferably, portions of body portion <b>5512</b> are positioned between nut <b>5514</b> and pump unit <b>5450</b> and between stud <b>5516</b> and pump unit support bracket <b>5448</b> to provide increased frictional contact therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0713" num="0712">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 162</figref>, a lower end of filter and muffler unit <b>5452</b> is positioned in an inverted cover or pan <b>5522</b> of pump cover <b>5446</b>. Pan <b>5522</b> includes three side walls <b>5524</b>, <b>5526</b>, <b>5528</b> and a bottom wall <b>5530</b>. Side walls <b>5524</b>, <b>5526</b>, <b>5528</b> cooperate to form a pair of slits or inlets <b>5532</b> therebetween and side wall <b>5526</b> includes a pair of apertures <b>5534</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 165</figref>, lower end of filter and muffler unit <b>5452</b> is spaced apart from bottom wall <b>5530</b> by a distance <b>5531</b> so that a downwardly facing inlet <b>5536</b> of filter and muffler unit <b>5452</b> is spaced apart and facing bottom wall <b>5530</b>. A cable tie <b>5538</b> is provided that wraps around filter and muffler unit <b>5452</b> and extends through apertures <b>5534</b> to couple filter and muffler unit <b>5452</b> to side wall <b>5526</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0714" num="0713">If liquid is sprayed into or otherwise enters pan <b>5522</b>, it will drain out of slits <b>5532</b>. Furthermore, because inlet <b>5536</b> is facing and relative close to bottom wall <b>5530</b>, liquid cannot be sprayed into inlet <b>5536</b> through slits <b>5532</b> from outside of pan <b>5522</b> because the path between slits <b>5532</b> and inlet <b>5536</b> is non-linear. Thus, pan <b>5522</b> blocks any direct spray path into inlet <b>5536</b> so that it is difficult for liquid to inter filter and muffler unit <b>5452</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0715" num="0714">Preferably, filter and muffler unit <b>5452</b> is configured to filter out many impurities in the air so that these impurities are not introduced to pump unit <b>5450</b>, manifold <b>62</b>, or mattress <b>14</b>. With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 163 and 165</figref>, air from filter and muffler unit <b>5452</b> is communicated to pump unit <b>5450</b> through tube <b>5540</b> coupled to an outlet <b>5542</b> of filter and muffler unit <b>5452</b>.

<p id="p-0718" num="0717">A further illustrative embodiment mattress air pump <b>4064</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 168 and 170</figref>, includes a support bracket <b>5640</b> coupled to strut <b>211</b> of weigh frame <b>36</b>, a pump cover support plate or bracket <b>5644</b> supported by support bracket <b>5640</b>, a pump cover <b>5646</b> supported by housing support bracket <b>5644</b>, a pump unit support bracket <b>5648</b> also supported by housing support bracket <b>5644</b>, a pump unit <b>5650</b> supported by pump unit support bracket <b>5648</b>, and a filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b> supported inside pump cover <b>5646</b>. Pump unit <b>5650</b> draws air through filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b> from outside of pump <b>4064</b> and provides the air to manifold <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0719" num="0718">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 169 and 170</figref>, support bracket <b>5640</b> includes a saddle member <b>5654</b> that hangs from strut <b>211</b> and a support member <b>5657</b> having four arms <b>5656</b> that extend away from saddle member <b>5654</b>. A pair of rubber or elastic grommets <b>5658</b> are positioned between respective tab sets <b>5659</b> of saddle member <b>5654</b> and strut <b>211</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 170</figref> to reduce the vibration transmitted from pump <b>4064</b> to strut <b>211</b>. Steel sleeves <b>5661</b> (only one is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 169</figref>) are welded in place within strut <b>211</b> to receive grommets <b>5658</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0720" num="0719">Tab sets <b>5659</b> includes apertures <b>5660</b> sized to receive fasteners <b>5662</b> that couple bracket <b>5654</b> to strut <b>211</b>. Similarly, strut <b>211</b> includes apertures <b>5664</b> sized to receive steel sleeve <b>5661</b>. When positioned in apertures <b>5664</b>, portions of steel sleeves <b>5661</b> extend below the bottom of strut <b>211</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 170</figref>. Steel sleeves <b>5661</b> are welded to strut <b>211</b> along two lines <b>5665</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 169</figref>) defined between the bottom of strut <b>211</b> and sleeve <b>5661</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0721" num="0720">Steel sleeves <b>5663</b> (only one is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 169</figref>) are positioned in respective grommets <b>5658</b> to receive fasteners <b>5662</b>. Grommets <b>5658</b> are sandwiched or positioned between strut <b>211</b> and bracket <b>5654</b> and strut <b>211</b> and fasteners <b>5662</b> to avoid a direct, rigid coupling between bracket <b>5654</b> and strut <b>211</b>. Rather, the coupling occurs through grommets <b>5658</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0722" num="0721">Pump cover support bracket <b>5644</b> includes four arms <b>5666</b> that include fastener-receiving notches <b>5668</b>. Resilient bushings <b>5670</b> and provided that are received in each of notches <b>5668</b>. Bushings <b>5670</b> are positioned in notches <b>5668</b> so that upper head portions <b>5671</b> of bushings <b>5670</b> overlap portions of arms <b>5666</b> and a shank portions <b>5673</b> are positioned in notches <b>5668</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 173</figref>. Resilient washers <b>5675</b> are positioned on top of arms <b>5656</b> of support bracket <b>5640</b> so that the lower head portions are positioned between support bracket <b>5640</b> and pump cover support bracket <b>5644</b>. Fasteners <b>5676</b>, such as machine screws, extend through metal washers <b>5677</b> and bushings <b>5670</b> so that washers <b>5677</b> and upper head portions <b>5671</b> of bushings <b>5670</b> are positioned between head portions of fasteners <b>5676</b> and arms <b>5666</b>. Fasteners <b>5676</b> are screwed into arms <b>5656</b>. Because portions of bushings <b>5670</b> and washers <b>5675</b> are positioned between fasteners <b>5676</b> and arms <b>5666</b>, <b>5656</b>, no rigid, direct coupling is provided between pump cover support bracket <b>5644</b> and support bracket <b>5640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0723" num="0722">Bushings <b>5670</b> and wasters <b>5675</b> are preferable made of thermoset, polyether-based, polyurethane material sold under the name SORBOTHANE by Sorbothane, Inc. of Kent, Ohio. SORBOTHANE-brand material is a visco-elastic material. According to alternative embodiments, other resilient or elastic materials such as rubber are used for the bushings and washers.</p>
<p id="p-0724" num="0723">Pump cover <b>5646</b> is coupled to pump cover support bracket <b>5644</b> by a plurality of fasteners <b>5678</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 171</figref>, a foam lining <b>5680</b> is provided in an interior region <b>5684</b> defined by pump cover <b>5646</b> and pump cover support bracket <b>5644</b> to reduce the transmission of noise and vibration. Foam lining <b>5680</b> includes a foam top <b>5682</b> adhered to pump cover support bracket <b>5644</b>, a foam wall <b>5683</b> adhered to the walls of pump cover <b>5646</b>, and a foam bottom <b>5685</b> adhered to the bottom of pump cover <b>5646</b>. Foam top <b>5644</b> provides a seal between pump cover <b>5646</b> and pump cover support bracket <b>5644</b>. Foam lining <b>5680</b> is made of acoustic damping material to attenuate noise introduced inside pump cover <b>5646</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0725" num="0724">Pump unit support bracket <b>5648</b> is welded or otherwise rigidly coupled to the underside of pump cover support bracket <b>5644</b> so that pump unit support bracket <b>5648</b> is suspended within an interior region <b>5684</b> defined by foam lining <b>5680</b>. As shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 171</figref>, pump unit <b>5650</b> extends into and compresses portions of foam lining <b>5680</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0726" num="0725">Pump unit <b>5650</b> is supported on pump unit support bracket <b>5648</b> by at least four resilient feet <b>5686</b> (only two such feet are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 169</figref>) made of a rubber or elastic material. Additional description of suitable resilient feet <b>5686</b> is provided above.</p>
<p id="p-0727" num="0726">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 171</figref>, filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b> is held in interior region <b>5684</b> by a flange <b>5688</b> welded to a sidewall <b>5690</b> of pump cover <b>5646</b>. Before assembly, flange <b>5688</b> toward the center of pump cover <b>5646</b>. During assembly, filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b> is positioned adjacent flange <b>5688</b>. Flange <b>5688</b> is then bent toward sidewall <b>5690</b> to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 169</figref> to press filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b> into foam lining <b>5680</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 171</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0728" num="0727">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 171</figref>, an inlet <b>5710</b> of filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b> is coupled to a tube or hose <b>5712</b> that extends through an aperture or inlet <b>5714</b> in pump cover <b>5646</b>. A grommet <b>5716</b> is positioned in aperture <b>5714</b> to provide a seal between tube <b>5712</b> and pump cover <b>5646</b>. A tube cover <b>5718</b> is welded to pump cover <b>5646</b> that cover an end <b>5713</b> of tube <b>5712</b> extending out of pump cover <b>5646</b>. Tube cover <b>5718</b> includes three sidewalls <b>5720</b>, <b>5722</b>, <b>5724</b> and a top wall <b>5726</b>. Sidewalls <b>5720</b>, <b>5722</b>, <b>5724</b> cooperate with pump cover <b>5646</b> to form an aperture or inlet <b>5728</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0729" num="0728">If liquid is sprayed into or otherwise enters cover <b>5646</b>, it will drain out of aperture <b>5728</b>. Furthermore, because end <b>5713</b> of tube <b>5712</b> is facing and relative close to wall <b>5722</b> of cover <b>5718</b>, liquid cannot be directly sprayed into inlet end <b>5713</b> of tube <b>5712</b> through aperture <b>5728</b> from outside of pan cover <b>5718</b> because the path between aperture <b>5714</b> and aperture <b>5728</b> is non-linear. Thus, cover <b>5718</b> blocks any direct spray path into end <b>5713</b> of tube <b>5712</b> so that it is difficult for liquid to enter filter and muffler unit <b>4652</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0730" num="0729">Interior components (not shown) of filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b> filter out many impurities in the air so that these impurities are not introduced to pump unit <b>5650</b>, manifold <b>62</b>, or mattress <b>4014</b>. Air from filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b> is communicated to pump unit <b>5650</b> through interior region <b>5684</b> from an outlet <b>5642</b> of filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b>. During operation of pump unit <b>5650</b>, air from interior region <b>5684</b> is drawn into an inlet <b>5730</b> of pump unit <b>5650</b> that is spaced apart from filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b>. This creates negative pressure within interior region <b>5684</b>. Because of the pressure difference between interior region <b>5684</b> and the environment outside of pump <b>5660</b>, air is drawn into interior region <b>5684</b> through filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b>. This air enters interior region <b>5684</b> defined by foam lining <b>5680</b> before entering into inlet <b>5730</b> of pump unit <b>5650</b>. Thus, foam lining <b>5680</b> defines a portion of the path of travel of the air through pump unit <b>5650</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0731" num="0730">Because inlet <b>5730</b> of pump unit <b>5650</b> is not directly coupled to filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b>, noise exiting pump unit <b>5650</b> is not directly transmitted to filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b>. This noise exits pump unit <b>5650</b> into interior region <b>5684</b> and is attenuated by foam lining <b>5680</b>. Any noise that enters outlet <b>5642</b> of filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b> from interior region <b>5684</b> is attenuated further by filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b>. Furthermore, because pump unit <b>5650</b> is not directly coupled to filter and muffler unit <b>5652</b>, most vibration generated by pump unit <b>5650</b> is not transmitted outside of pump <b>4064</b> by tube <b>5712</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0732" num="0731">Another tube <b>5732</b> is coupled to an outlet fitting <b>5734</b> of pump unit <b>5650</b> that supplies pressurized air to manifold <b>62</b>. Tube <b>5732</b> extends through an aperture <b>5736</b> in pump cover support bracket <b>5644</b>. A grommet <b>5738</b> is positioned in aperture <b>5736</b> to provide a seal between tube <b>5732</b> and pump cover support bracket <b>5644</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 172</figref>, support member <b>5657</b> includes a notch <b>5739</b> that provides clearance for tube <b>5732</b> to extend through support member <b>5657</b>. Pump unit <b>5650</b> also includes a power cord <b>5740</b> that extends through a cord-receiving notch <b>5742</b> in pump cover support bracket <b>5644</b> and couples to the power supply.</p>
