<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to protective covers and, more particularly, to protective covers for distribution lines and insulators, such as power distribution lines and associated insulators.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Support structures, such as utility poles, are often used to suspend electrical lines, such as power distribution lines, above the ground. These support structures are generally located outdoors and may be of a variety of different configurations to suspend one or more lines. One problem with such lines, particularly with power distribution lines that transmit electrical power at high voltages, is that birds or other animals may land or climb onto the lines. Such contact of distribution lines by animals, particularly adjacent the support structure, may cause a short or electrical flash-over allowing current flow through the animal, which may cause a power outage or other problem with the power distribution system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to embodiments of the present invention, a cover for a distribution line conductor includes a cover body defining a channel extending along a lengthwise axis and adapted to receive the conductor. A unitarily formed attachment structure adjoins the cover body. The attachment structure includes first and second jaws positioned adjacent the channel. The first and second jaws are positioned at different locations along a jaw axis parallel to the lengthwise axis and, in a closed position, overlap one another across the jaw axis. The first and second jaws are relatively deflectable from the closed position to an open position to permit passage of the conductor therebetween and into the channel and the first and second jaws can thereafter return toward the closed position to secure the conductor in the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to further embodiments of the present invention, a cover for an insulator body and a distribution line conductor coupled thereto includes a cover body. The cover body includes a main body portion and a lateral body extension. The main body portion defines a chamber to receive the insulator body. The lateral body extension defines a channel to receive the conductor, and the main body portion and the lateral body extension each open to a receiving side of the cover. A stud bore is defined in the main body portion and is adapted to receive and engage the stud to secure the cover to the insulator body.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to further embodiments of the present invention, a surge arrestor assembly for use with a distribution line conductor includes a surge arrestor and a cover. The surge arrestor is adapted to operatively couple with the conductor and to redirect electrical current from the conductor in the event of an overvoltage event. The cover is adapted to be mounted on the surge arrestor. The cover includes a cover body including a main body portion and a lateral body extension. The main body portion defines a chamber to receive the surge arrestor. The lateral body extension defines a channel to receive the conductor. The main body portion and the lateral body extension each open to a receiving side of the cover.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to further embodiments of the present invention, a cover for use with an insulator body includes a cover body defining a channel extending along a lengthwise axis and adapted to receive the insulator body. A unitarily formed attachment structure adjoins the cover body. The attachment structure includes first and second jaws positioned adjacent the channel. The first and second jaws are positioned at different locations along a jaw axis parallel to the lengthwise axis and, in a closed position, overlap one another across the jaw axis. The first and second jaws are relatively deflectable from the closed position to an open position to permit passage of the insulator body therebetween and into the channel and the first and second jaws can thereafter return toward the closed position to secure the insulator body in the channel.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which illustrative embodiments of the invention are shown. In the drawings, the relative sizes of regions or features may be exaggerated for clarity. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being “coupled” or “connected” to another element, it can be directly coupled or connected to the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly coupled” or “directly connected” to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. As used herein the term “and/or” includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, spatially relative terms, such as “under”, “below”, “lower”, “over”, “upper” and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is inverted, elements described as “under” or “beneath” other elements or features would then be oriented “over” the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term “under” can encompass both an orientation of over and under. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Well-known functions or constructions may not be described in detail for brevity and/or clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms “comprises” and/or “comprising,” when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a protective cover <b>100</b> according to embodiments of the invention is shown mounted on a power distribution system <b>10</b>. The power distribution system <b>10</b> includes a utility pole <b>12</b> and a transformer <b>14</b> mounted on the pole <b>12</b>. A bushing <b>16</b> extends from the transformer <b>14</b>. A surge arrestor <b>50</b> is mounted on the pole <b>12</b> and/or the transformer <b>14</b> adjacent the transformer <b>14</b>. An electrical conductor <b>20</b> extends to the arrestor <b>50</b>, then to the bushing <b>16</b>, and thereafter to a further component of the system <b>10</b>. The conductor <b>20</b> may be operatively electrically and mechanically connected to the bushing <b>16</b> and the arrestor <b>50</b> in any suitable manner, such mounting methods being well-known to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the arrestor <b>50</b> includes an insulator body <b>52</b> having alternating core segments <b>52</b>A and skirts <b>52</b>B that extend radially outwardly from the core segments <b>52</b>A. The insulator body <b>52</b> may be formed of a polymer or a ceramic, for example. A threaded stud <b>54</b> extends longitudinally and generally vertically out of the insulator body <b>52</b>. The conductor <b>20</b> extends through a lateral passage <b>54</b>A formed in the stud <b>54</b> and is secured by a washer <b>58</b> and a nut <b>56</b>. As shown, the conductor <b>20</b> is a continuous elongated member or segment extending through the arrestor <b>50</b> (and, when installed, the cover <b>100</b>). Alternatively, the ends of two or more conductors may be connected to the arrestor <b>50</b> or the conductor may extend from only one side. Suitable surge arrestor components are housed in the insulator body <b>52</b> and are electrically connected to the stud <b>54</b> to absorb and/or redirect (e.g., to ground) current (e.g., from a lightning strike) from the conductor <b>20</b> to limit or prevent damage to the transformer or other components from an overvoltage event. The surge arrestor components may include, for example, metal oxide varistor blocks or the like with suitable electrical contacts. Suitable surge arrestors will be apparent to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Turning to the protective cover <b>100</b> in more detail and as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref>, the protective cover <b>100</b> has a cover body including a main body or shroud portion <b>110</b> and a pair of opposed, laterally extending body extensions or arms <b>140</b>. The protective cover <b>100</b> is adapted to receive the arrestor <b>50</b> and portions of the conductor <b>20</b> such that at least a portion of the conductor <b>20</b> generally extends along a lengthwise axis C-C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>). Generally, the main body <b>110</b> provides coverage for the electrically conductive components of the arrestor <b>50</b> and portions of the conductor <b>20</b>, and the arms <b>140</b> provide coverage for more extant portions of the conductor <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the main body <b>110</b> includes a top wall <b>112</b> and a surrounding sidewall <b>114</b> that together define a cavity <b>116</b> that extends along a vertical axis V-V (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</figref>). The lower edge <b>114</b>A of the sidewall <b>114</b> defines a lower opening <b>118</b> that communicates with the cavity <b>116</b>. Side slots <b>120</b> are defined in the sidewall <b>114</b> at the arms <b>140</b> and communicate with the cavity <b>116</b> as well. Relatively thin, bendable walls <b>122</b> extend across the slots <b>120</b>. A boss <b>124</b> projects from the top wall <b>112</b> into the cavity <b>116</b>. A downwardly opening bore <b>126</b> is defined in the boss <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this embodiment, the arms <b>140</b> are mirror images of one another and therefore only one of the arms <b>140</b> will be described in detail, it being understood that such description applies likewise to the other arm <b>140</b>. The arm <b>140</b> has a pair of opposed, spaced apart sidewalls <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> adjoining and extending laterally outwardly from the main body <b>110</b> along the lengthwise axis C-C (which is transverse to the vertical axis V-V) to respective wall ends <b>142</b>A, <b>144</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). An arcuate connecting wall <b>146</b> extends along the lengthwise axis C-C and connects the top edges of the sidewalls <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>. The sidewalls <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> and the connecting wall <b>146</b> together define a generally U-shaped channel <b>150</b> having a lengthwise bottom opening <b>152</b> (defined by the lower edges <b>142</b>C, <b>144</b>C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the sidewalls <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>) and an end opening <b>156</b>. The channel <b>150</b> includes a conductor channel portion in the top of the channel <b>150</b> adjacent the connecting wall <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">An attachment structure <b>160</b> is located on the outer end of the arm <b>140</b>. The attachment structure <b>160</b> includes an inner wall or jaw <b>162</b> joined to the end <b>142</b>A of the sidewall <b>142</b>. The attachment structure <b>160</b> further includes an outer wall or jaw <b>164</b> joined to the end <b>144</b>A of the sidewall <b>144</b>. The jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> have respective convex inner edges <b>162</b>A, <b>164</b>A and respective concave latching edges <b>162</b>B, <b>164</b>B. When the attachment structure <b>160</b> is in a closed position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and <b>5</b>-<b>7</b>, the lower portions of the inner edges <b>162</b>A, <b>164</b>A collectively define a guide slot <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The latch edges <b>162</b>B, <b>164</b>B and the walls <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> collectively define a conductor slot <b>174</b> on the lengthwise axis C-C and contiguous with the conductor channel <b>150</b>. According to some embodiments and as shown, a notch <b>172</b> is formed in at least the connecting wall <b>146</b> above the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</figref>, the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> are staggered or located at different positions along a jaw axis J-J that is generally parallel with the lengthwise axis C-C. Additionally, the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> overlap across the axis J-J. As will be appreciated from the disclosure herein, this configuration may provide a secure engagement with the conductor <b>20</b> and allow for savings in manufacture of the cover <b>100</b>. According to some embodiments and as shown, the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> extend generally perpendicularly with respect to the axis J-J and the side walls <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>. According to some embodiments, the overlap distance O (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is at least 0.06 inch. According to some embodiments, the overlap distance O is at least 0.15 inch. According to some embodiments, the overlap distance is between about 0.15 and 0.375 inch. According to some embodiments and as shown, the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> are spaced apart along the jaw axis J-J, which may facilitate manufacture. According to some embodiments, the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> are spaced apart along the axis J-J a distance U (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of no more than the diameter of the intended conductor <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The cover <b>100</b> may be formed of any suitable material. According to some embodiments, the cover <b>100</b> is formed of a flexible polymeric material. According to some embodiments, the cover <b>100</b> is formed of a track resistant, insulating grade, UV stable polymer. The main body <b>110</b>, the arms <b>140</b> and the attachment structures <b>160</b> may be formed of the same or different materials. Preferably, the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> are formed of a rigid or semi-rigid material. According to some embodiments, the material of the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> has a secant modulus of at least 25,000 psi. According to some embodiments, the material of at least the arms <b>140</b> has a tensile strength of from about 1200 to 2500 psi. According to some embodiments, the attachment structures <b>160</b> are unitarily and integrally formed with the walls <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>. According to some embodiments, the main body <b>110</b>, the arms <b>140</b> and the attachment structures <b>160</b> are unitarily and integrally formed. According to some embodiments, the cover <b>100</b> is unitarily molded. According to some embodiments, the cover <b>100</b> is unitarily injection molded.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The cover <b>100</b> may be mounted on the arrestor <b>50</b> and the conductor <b>20</b> in the following manner. The conductor <b>20</b> is first installed on the arrestor <b>50</b> in conventional or other suitable manner as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The cover <b>100</b> is then forced downwardly onto the conductor <b>20</b> and the arrestor <b>50</b> such that a portion of the arrestor <b>50</b> is received through the opening <b>118</b> and into the cavity <b>116</b> and portions of the conductor <b>20</b> are received through the openings <b>152</b> and into the channels <b>150</b> of the arms <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">More particularly, and with reference to one of the arms <b>140</b> (it being understood that the other arm <b>140</b> operates in the same manner), the cover <b>100</b> is forced in a downward direction I as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and such that the conductor <b>20</b> is guided by the guide slot <b>170</b>. As the cover <b>100</b> and jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> are lowered onto the conductor <b>20</b>, the conductor <b>20</b> slides along the jaw inner edges <b>162</b>A, <b>164</b>A and relatively displaces the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, causing them to deflect and separate in divergent directions D to an open position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Such deflection may be accommodated by flexure of the sidewalls <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, the connecting wall <b>146</b> and/or the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>. According to some embodiments, the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> themselves do not flex or only flex minimally. The cover <b>100</b> is further forced down onto the conductor <b>20</b> until the conductor <b>20</b> seats in the conductor slot <b>174</b>, whereupon the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> recover or return in convergent directions R toward the closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. According to some embodiments, the attachment structure <b>160</b> is adapted to recover or snap back substantially completely to the closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> return toward or to the closed position, portions of the latch edges <b>162</b>B, <b>164</b>B locate below the conductor <b>20</b> (i.e., between the conductor <b>20</b> and the channel opening <b>152</b>) so that the conductor <b>20</b> is mechanically secured or interlocked in the channel <b>150</b>. According to some embodiments, the sidewalls <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, the connecting wall <b>146</b> and the latch edges <b>162</b>B, <b>164</b>B surround the circumference of the conductor <b>20</b> by at least 360 degrees. According to some embodiments, the jaw inner edges <b>162</b>A, <b>164</b>A at least partially overlap and the sidewalls <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, the connecting wall <b>146</b> and the latch edges <b>162</b>B, <b>164</b>B surround the circumference of the conductor <b>20</b> by greater than about 360 degrees, and according to some embodiments by greater than about 400 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As the cover <b>100</b> is placed onto the surge arrestor <b>50</b> and the conductor <b>20</b> as described above, the stud <b>54</b> is received in the bore <b>126</b>. According to some embodiments, the bore <b>126</b> is sized and configured to provide an interference fit between the stud <b>54</b> and the interior of the boss <b>124</b> so that the boss <b>124</b> grips the stud <b>54</b>. The engagement between the stud <b>54</b> and the boss <b>124</b> may serve to restrict rotation of the cover <b>100</b> about the conductor <b>20</b> and to resist removal of the cover <b>100</b> from the arrestor <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The cover <b>100</b> can be installed on a “hot” or powered line using gloves or the like. The cover <b>100</b> may be modified to allow installation with a hot stick. In accordance with some embodiments, the attachment structure <b>160</b> automatically springs back to the closed or locked position once the conductor <b>20</b> is in place, thereby reducing the degree and complexity of manipulation needed to complete the installation. Removal may be accomplished by forcing the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> apart (e.g., by hand or using a tool) and lifting the cover <b>100</b> off of the conductor <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Notably, the cavity <b>116</b> and the channels <b>150</b> both open from the same receiving side (i.e., the bottom side) of the cover <b>100</b> so that the cover <b>100</b> can be mounted on the arrestor <b>50</b> and the conductor <b>20</b> without requiring disconnection of the conductor <b>20</b> from the arrestor <b>50</b>. Likewise, the configuration of the cover may allow for removal of the cover <b>100</b> from the arrestor <b>50</b> and the conductor <b>20</b> without requiring disconnection of the conductor <b>20</b> from the arrestor <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition to providing for convenient and positive attachment of the cover <b>100</b> to the conductor <b>20</b>, the configuration of the attachment structures <b>160</b> may allow for improved flexibility, efficiency and/or cost-effectiveness in manufacture. The lengthwise-staggered, overlapping jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> do not require the formation of an undercut that may require special provision in the molding of the cover <b>100</b>. In the cover <b>100</b> as illustrated, such an undercut is avoided by providing the notch <b>172</b> above the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>. The notch <b>172</b> may also serve to reduce the force required to open the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> to permit insertion of the conductor <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The cover <b>100</b> may be adapted for use with a prescribed range of conductor sizes. According to some embodiments, for any conductor within the prescribed range of sizes, an insertion force of no more than 20 lbs. and of no less than 1 lbs. is required to install each attachment structure <b>160</b> onto the conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The cover <b>100</b> can likewise be sized and configured to fit over a range of surge arrestor sizes. According to some embodiments, the cover <b>100</b> provides a minimum or nominal air gap between the electrically conductive portions of the arrestor <b>50</b> and the lower edge <b>114</b>A of the main body <b>110</b> of at least ¼ inch. According to some embodiments, and as shown, the cover <b>100</b> is configured such that the sidewall <b>114</b> fits around and over the first (i.e., uppermost) skirt <b>52</b>B of the arrestor <b>50</b>. According to some embodiments, the diameter M of the cavity <b>116</b> is between about 4.75 and 5 inches. According to some embodiments, the depth K (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of the bore <b>126</b> is between about 0.75 and 1 inch. According to some embodiments, the nominal diameter L (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of the bore <b>126</b> is between about 95 and 100% of the diameter of the portion of the stud <b>54</b> received therein. According to some embodiments, the depth N (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of the cavity <b>116</b> is between about 2.75 and 3.5 inches. According to some embodiments, the length P (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of each arm <b>140</b> to the outer end of the shortest of the walls <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> is at least 2 inches. According to some embodiments, the depth Q (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of each conductor channel <b>150</b> is at least 1.75 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The arrestor <b>50</b> and the cover <b>100</b> may be provided as a matched combination or kit <b>51</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The kit <b>51</b> may be installed as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">While the cover <b>100</b> has been described as mounted on a surge arrestor <b>50</b>, the cover <b>100</b> or covers otherwise formed in accordance with the present invention may be used with other types of devices. For example, the body of the cover <b>100</b> may be differently shaped. The arms <b>140</b> may be omitted and the attachment structures <b>160</b> formed directly on the main body <b>110</b>. The arms <b>140</b> may be relatively positioned at different locations about the main body <b>110</b>. More or fewer arms <b>140</b> may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The cover <b>100</b> may be mounted on a different type of insulated component than a surge arrestor. For example, the cover <b>100</b> may be mounted on a simple insulator. Covers in accordance with the present invention may be mounted on a conductor without also covering an insulator or the like. For example, the cover may be configured to cover only a length of conductor and incorporate one or more attachment structures such as the attachment structures <b>160</b> to secure the cover to the length of conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a protective cover <b>200</b> according to further embodiments of the present invention is shown therein. The cover <b>200</b> may be formed and used in the same manner as described above for the protective cover <b>100</b>, except as follows. The cover <b>200</b> is provided with an attachment structure <b>260</b> in place of the attachment structure <b>160</b>, and the attachment structure <b>260</b> is formed closely adjacent the main body <b>210</b> with relatively short sidewalls <b>242</b>, <b>244</b>, and no wall corresponding to the connecting wall <b>146</b>. The attachment structure <b>260</b> includes jaws <b>262</b>, <b>264</b> generally corresponding to the jaws <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> except that the latch edges of the jaws <b>262</b>, <b>264</b> have first latch edge portions <b>262</b>A, <b>264</b>A and second latch edge portions <b>262</b>B, <b>264</b>B. The latch edge portions <b>262</b>A, <b>262</b>B, <b>264</b>A, <b>264</b>B and the opening <b>221</b> in the body <b>210</b> collectively define a T-shaped conductor slot <b>274</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The T-shaped conductor slot <b>274</b> has a narrow lower slot portion <b>274</b>B and a relatively wider upper slot portion <b>274</b>A. The T-shaped conductor slot <b>274</b> can serve accommodate conductors at various offset positions relative to the cover <b>200</b>. For example, the conductor may be mounted at one of several centered or offset positions relative to the insulator body on which the cover <b>200</b> is mounted. The T-shaped conductor slot <b>274</b> may accommodate each of these positions by permitting the conductor to pass through the lower slot portion <b>274</b>B or the left, right or center portions of the upper slot portion <b>274</b>A. Thus, the T-shaped conductor slot <b>274</b> may accommodate both lateral and heightwise offset of the conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, a protective cover <b>300</b> according to further embodiments of the present invention is shown therein. The protective cover <b>300</b> may be mounted on an insulator body <b>72</b> of an insulated component <b>70</b> (e.g., a surge arrestor, an insulator, a bushing, etc.). The protective cover <b>300</b> includes a cover body <b>310</b> and an attachment structure <b>360</b>. The attachment structure <b>360</b> includes jaws <b>362</b>, <b>364</b> that are staggered along and overlap across a jaw axis G-G, which is generally parallel to a lengthwise axis F-F. The lengthwise axis F-F extends through an opening <b>374</b> defined by the body <b>310</b> and the jaws <b>362</b>, <b>364</b>. The cover <b>300</b> can be mounted on the insulator <b>70</b> by forcing the cover <b>300</b> downwardly onto the insulator <b>70</b> between skirts <b>72</b>B, thereby radially outwardly displacing or deflecting the jaws <b>362</b>, <b>364</b> until the core section <b>72</b>A is received in the slot <b>374</b>, whereupon the jaws <b>362</b>, <b>364</b> return to a closed or locked position. When the cover <b>300</b> is mounted on the insulator <b>70</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the axis F-F may correspond generally to the lengthwise center axis of the insulator <b>70</b>. The slot <b>374</b> is sized and configured to fit about the core section <b>72</b>A and between the adjacent skirts <b>72</b>B to secure the cover <b>300</b> on the insulator as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. According to some embodiments, the attachment structure <b>360</b> is unitarily formed with the body <b>310</b>. According to some embodiments, the entirety of the cover <b>300</b> is unitarily formed. The cover <b>300</b> may be formed of the same materials and using the same manufacturing techniques as described above with regard to the cover <b>100</b>.</p>
