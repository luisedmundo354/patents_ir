<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to staplers, and more specifically to low staple indicators for staplers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known to incorporate low staple indicators on both manual and electric staplers. These indicators come in various forms and are intended to provide visual notification to a user when the number of staples remaining in the stapler is getting low. Most typically, these indicators are part of the staple pusher assembly, either as part of the pusher itself or as part of the spring that biases the pusher toward the front of the magazine.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention provides an improved low staple indicator for a stapler. In one embodiment, the indicator is not part of (i.e., is distinct from) the staple pusher assembly, but rather is a separate unit designed to accurately and reliably provide the user with notification visible from the top of the stapler. The indicator is cost effective, from both a part cost perspective and an assembly cost perspective.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More specifically, the invention provides a low staple indicator that can be used on virtually any stapler that utilizes strips of staples, stacked sheets of staples, or rolls of staples. A stapler embodying the invention includes a base, a staple storage chamber coupled to the base and housing a plurality of staples, and a low staple indicator assembly adjacent the staple storage chamber. In one embodiment, the low staple indicator includes an engaging portion configured to engage at least one of the plurality of staples housed in the staple storage chamber to position the low staple indicator assembly in a first position when there are a sufficient number of staples remaining in the staple storage chamber. The engaging portion of the low staple indicator assembly is further configured to disengage the staples housed in the staple storage chamber to position the low staple indicator assembly in a second position when the number of staples remaining in the staple storage chamber is getting low.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, the low staple indicator is used with a manual stapler having a base, a magazine movably coupled to the base, and a cover assembly movably coupled to the magazine. A staple pusher assembly is positioned within the magazine to bias a strip of staples within the magazine toward a staple driving end of the magazine. The low staple indicator includes a movable member distinct from the pusher assembly and that includes a mounting portion configured to mount the movable member above the strip of staples. A pawl arm is coupled to the mounting portion and includes a pawl configured to engage the strip of staples within the magazine when there are a sufficient number of staples remaining in the magazine. When the number of staples remaining in the magazine gets low, the pawl disengages the staples and drops below the level normally defined by the staples. This movement of the pawl moves the low staple indicator to a low staple notification position that will alert the user to the low staple condition of the stapler.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The indicator further includes a notification portion having a first indicator portion configured to indicate to the user that a sufficient number of staples remains in the stapler, and a second indicator portion configured to indicate to the user that the number of staples remaining in the stapler is getting low. The indicator portions are selectively visible through an opening in the top of the stapler's cover assembly. The indicator portions are coupled with the movable member so that when the pawl is supported by the staples, the first indicator portion is visible through the opening in the top of the cover assembly. When the pawl disengages from the staples, the movable member moves such that the second indicator portion becomes visible through the opening in the top of the cover assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of the following detailed description and drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Before one embodiment of the invention is explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways. Also, it is understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of “including”, “having”, and “comprising” and variations thereof herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref> illustrate a stapler <b>10</b> embodying a low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> of the present invention. It is to be understood that, while the illustrated stapler <b>10</b> is a manual, desktop-type stapler, the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> of the invention can be practiced with almost any type of stapler, including, but not limited to, manual hand-held or upright staplers, manual heavy-duty staplers, and all forms of electric staplers, including desktop-type, heavy-duty, and hand-held electric staplers. Additionally, while the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> of the invention is illustrated as being used with a stapler containing a strip of staples housed within a staple magazine, the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> of the invention can also be used with cartridge staplers that employ stacked or rolled sheets of staples.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to the illustrated embodiment, the stapler <b>10</b> includes a base <b>18</b> having an upper surface <b>22</b> configured to receive and support a stack of sheets <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>) to be stapled. An anvil <b>26</b> is supported by the surface <b>22</b> for clinching staples driven through the stack of sheets. As used herein and in any appended claims, the terms “upper”, “lower”, “top”, “bottom”, “side”, “front”, “rear”, “forward”, “rearward”, and the like are for the purposes of description only, and are not intended to imply any required orientation of the stapler.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A staple storage chamber in the form of a staple magazine <b>30</b> is pivotally connected to the rear end of the base <b>18</b>, as is understood in the art. The magazine <b>30</b> is configured to receive one or more strips of staples S, and includes a nose piece <b>32</b> coupled to the front end of the magazine <b>30</b> in a known manner. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>10</b>, a staple pusher <b>34</b> is positioned within the magazine <b>30</b> and is biased toward the front of the magazine <b>30</b> to urge the strip of staples S toward the staple ejection point. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and as will be described further below, the staple pusher <b>34</b> is biased forward by a constant force spring <b>38</b>, but other biasing arrangements can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the staple pusher <b>34</b> includes a top surface <b>42</b> defined between a leading end <b>46</b> and a trailing end <b>50</b> of the pusher <b>34</b>. An elongated slot <b>54</b> is formed in the top surface <b>42</b>. The magazine <b>30</b> also includes a rail <b>55</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>10</b>) that supports the underside of the staples S and the staple pusher <b>34</b>. A top surface of the rail <b>55</b> also includes an elongated slot <b>56</b> that is generally aligned with the elongated slot <b>54</b> in the pusher <b>34</b>. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the constant force spring <b>38</b> is housed on the underside of the rail <b>55</b>, and one end of the spring <b>38</b> is hooked around a downward facing tab <b>57</b> of the staple pusher <b>34</b> that extends through the slot <b>56</b>. Note that portions of the spring <b>38</b> have been removed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b> for clarity. The rail <b>55</b> retains the coiled portion of the constant force spring <b>38</b> and prevents the spring <b>38</b> from interfering with the strip of staples S as the spring <b>38</b> extends and recoils with movement of the staple pusher <b>34</b>. If an alternative spring arrangement is used to bias the staple pusher <b>34</b>, the rail <b>55</b> could be eliminated from within the magazine <b>30</b>, as magazines without rails are well-known.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A cover assembly <b>58</b> is also pivotally connected to the base <b>18</b>, and is capable of pivoting both with the magazine <b>30</b> and with respect to the magazine <b>30</b> during stapling operations. The cover assembly <b>58</b> also pivots away from the magazine <b>30</b> to facilitate re-filling the magazine <b>30</b> with strips of staples S.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The cover assembly <b>58</b> includes an outer cover <b>62</b> that can be depressed by the user to actuate the stapler <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the outer cover <b>62</b> includes a window or cutout <b>66</b> formed in a top surface <b>70</b> of the outer cover <b>62</b>. A translucent lens <b>74</b> can be positioned in or adjacent the cutout <b>66</b> to prevent debris from entering the cover assembly <b>58</b>. A staple driver <b>76</b> is secured to the underside of the outer cover <b>62</b> so that when the cover assembly <b>58</b> is closed, the staple driver <b>76</b> is positioned directly above the staple ejection point defined by the front of the magazine <b>30</b>. The staple driver <b>76</b> includes a slot <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-7</figref>, the cover assembly <b>58</b> further includes a case <b>82</b> that is pivotally connected to the base <b>18</b>. The case <b>82</b> at least partially closes the upper portion of the magazine <b>30</b> when the cover assembly <b>58</b> is in the closed position, and pivots with the outer cover <b>62</b> to the open position for re-filling the magazine <b>30</b> with staples S. The case <b>82</b> is also pivotable with respect to the outer cover <b>62</b> during stapling, such that the outer cover <b>62</b> and the staple driver <b>76</b> can move in a staple driving direction (downwardly) relative to the case <b>82</b>. A projection <b>86</b> at the front end of the case <b>82</b> is received in the slot <b>78</b> of the staple driver <b>76</b> to facilitate the relative movement between the staple driver <b>76</b> and the case <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, the case <b>82</b> includes spaced-apart sidewalls <b>90</b> and a top wall <b>94</b> extending at least partially between the sidewalls <b>90</b>. The top wall <b>94</b> includes an upper surface <b>98</b> and a lower surface <b>102</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). A portion of the top wall <b>94</b> is open to receive the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> is positioned above the strip of staples S in the magazine <b>30</b> and is coupled to the cover assembly <b>58</b>. More specifically, the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> is positioned at least partially between the outer cover <b>62</b> and the case <b>82</b>. The structure of the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> will be described first, and the operation and interaction of the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> with the remainder of the stapler <b>10</b> will be subsequently discussed in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the illustrated embodiment, the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> includes a movable member <b>106</b> having a mounting portion <b>110</b> movably mounted between the sidewalls <b>90</b> of the case <b>82</b>. Specifically, the mounting portion <b>110</b> receives two mounting pins <b>114</b> that are supported in apertures formed in the sidewalls <b>90</b> of the case <b>82</b>. Therefore, the movable member <b>106</b> is pivotal or rotatable relative to the sidewalls <b>90</b> of the case <b>82</b>. The sidewalls of the magazine <b>30</b> include notched portions <b>108</b> (see FIG. <b>5</b>—only one notched portion is shown) that provide clearance for the mounting pins <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The movable member <b>106</b> further includes a pawl arm <b>118</b> extending from the mounting portion <b>110</b> toward the front end of the magazine <b>30</b>. The pawl arm <b>118</b> terminates in a downwardly extending pawl <b>122</b> that includes a lower engagement surface <b>126</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The movable member <b>106</b> additionally includes a body portion <b>134</b> coupled to the mounting portion <b>110</b>. The body portion <b>134</b> is illustrated as being generally oval-shaped, but could also have different geometries. In the illustrated embodiment, the body portion <b>134</b> includes upper and lower straight segments <b>138</b> and <b>142</b>, respectively, and front and rear curved segments <b>146</b> and <b>150</b>, respectively. A plurality of ribs <b>154</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) are positioned around the inner surface of the body portion <b>134</b> and add strength and rigidity to the oval-shaped geometry of the body portion <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The body portion <b>134</b> also includes spring mounts <b>158</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) formed on the upper and lower straight segments <b>138</b>, <b>142</b> and generally in line with the mounting portion <b>110</b>. The spring mounts <b>158</b> receive a compression spring <b>162</b> that helps to ensure the resiliency of the oval-shaped body portion <b>134</b> over the life of the stapler <b>10</b>. It should be noted that the use of the compression spring <b>162</b> is optional and could be eliminated depending on the construction of the body portion <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A notification portion <b>166</b> of the movable member <b>106</b> is coupled to the upper straight segment <b>138</b> of the body portion <b>134</b>. The notification portion <b>166</b> includes first and second indicator portions <b>170</b> and <b>174</b>, respectively. The first indicator portion <b>170</b> is on the front end of the notification portion <b>166</b> and includes indicia, coloring, or any other suitable notification means to inform a user that the stapler <b>10</b> contains a sufficient amount of staples. In the illustrated embodiment, the first indicator portion <b>170</b> is colored green to signify that the stapler <b>10</b> contains a sufficient amount of staples for continued stapling. The green coloring is achieved by using green colored plastic for the notification portion <b>166</b>, but could also be achieved by printing or otherwise applying a green coloring to the first indicator portion <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The second indicator portion <b>174</b> is on the rear end of the notification portion <b>166</b> and includes indicia, coloring, or any other suitable notification means to inform a user that the number of staples S in the stapler <b>10</b> is getting low. In the illustrated embodiment, the second indicator portion <b>174</b> is colored red to signify that the number of staples in the stapler <b>10</b> is getting low and that the magazine <b>30</b> will need to be re-filled either soon or immediately for continued stapling. The red coloring is achieved through the application of a red pressure-sensitive label on the second indicator portion <b>174</b>, but could also be achieved by printing or otherwise applying a red coloring to the second indicator portion <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first and second indicator portions <b>170</b> and <b>174</b> are spaced along a generally arcuate and stepped surface of the notification portion <b>166</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the step in the notification portion <b>166</b> defines the border between the first and second indicator portions <b>170</b>, <b>174</b> and facilitates application of the red pressure-sensitive label by providing an alignment guide or edge for applying the label. Depending on the orientation of the movable member <b>106</b>, either the first indicator portion <b>170</b> or the second indicator portion <b>174</b> will be positioned closer to the underside of the outer cover <b>62</b>, and more specifically, closer to the cutout <b>66</b> formed in the outer cover <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the illustrated embodiment, the movable member <b>106</b> is a polymer part that can be molded or formed through other suitable processes. While the notification portion <b>166</b>, the body portion <b>134</b>, and the mounting portion <b>110</b> are illustrated as being integrally formed as the movable member <b>106</b>, one or more of these portions can alternatively be separate components connected together. The mounting pins <b>114</b> can be integrally formed with the remainder of the mounting portion <b>110</b>, or as illustrated, can be separately inserted or insert-molded metal pins. A single mounting shaft could also be used. The optional compression spring <b>162</b> is also illustrated as being a separate component. Of course, any suitable plastic or metallic materials can be used to form the movable member <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the movable member <b>106</b> is mounted between the sidewalls <b>90</b> of the case <b>82</b> as described above, a torsion spring <b>178</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) is coupled to the movable member <b>106</b> to bias the movable member <b>106</b> toward a forward-pivoted orientation. Specifically, a coil portion <b>178</b><i>a </i>of the torsion spring <b>178</b> is supported by the mounting portion <b>110</b>, while a rearwardly-extending leg portion <b>178</b><i>b </i>of the torsion spring <b>178</b> rests against the upper surface <b>98</b> of the top wall <b>94</b> of the case <b>82</b>. A forwardly-extending leg portion <b>178</b><i>c </i>of the torsion spring <b>178</b> includes a 90° bend that hooks over the top of the pawl arm <b>118</b> to retain its position on the top of the pawl arm <b>118</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>), thereby biasing the pawl arm <b>118</b> downwardly to urge the movable member <b>106</b> toward the forward-pivoted orientation. Two ribs <b>130</b> on the top of the pawl arm further retain the leg portion <b>178</b><i>c </i>in position on the pawl arm <b>118</b>. However, the ribs <b>130</b> are optional and could be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a rib <b>132</b> that extends rearwardly from the mounting portion <b>110</b> operates to limit the rotation of the movable member <b>106</b> toward the forward-pivoted orientation. Specifically, when the rib <b>132</b> engages the lower surface <b>102</b> of the top wall <b>94</b> of the case <b>82</b>, the movable member <b>106</b> cannot rotate any further toward the forward-pivoted orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The operation of the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> will now be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref> illustrate a first position of the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b>, when there are a sufficient number of staples S in the magazine <b>30</b>. The lower engagement surface <b>126</b> of the pawl <b>122</b> is biased into engagement with and rests on top of the strip of staples S in the magazine <b>30</b>. The engagement between the pawl <b>122</b> and the staples S prevents the movable member <b>106</b> from pivoting forward any more. In this first position, the first indicator portion <b>170</b> is positioned directly underneath the cutout <b>66</b> in the outer cover <b>62</b> such that a user sees the green coloring on the first indicator portion <b>170</b> through the cutout <b>66</b> and the lens <b>74</b>. In observing the green coloring of the first indicator portion <b>170</b>, the user is notified that there are a sufficient number of staples S remaining in the magazine <b>30</b> for continued stapling.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, as the user depresses the outer cover <b>62</b> to actuate stapling, the oval-shaped body portion <b>134</b> is compressed and deformed between the outer cover <b>62</b> and the case <b>82</b>. Specifically, the underside of the lens <b>74</b> engages the notification portion <b>166</b> and pushes the notification portion <b>166</b> downwardly, thereby deforming the body portion <b>134</b>. When the user releases the outer cover <b>62</b> after stapling, the cover <b>62</b> moves upwardly and the body portion <b>134</b> returns to its original oval-shape, either due to its geometry alone, and/or with assistance from the optional compression spring <b>162</b>. This sequence of compressions and subsequent restorations to the original state of the body portion <b>134</b> repeatedly occurs with each stapling action that takes place when the movable member <b>106</b> is in the first position.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As continued stapling occurs, the pusher <b>34</b> continuously urges the strip of staples S forward in the magazine <b>30</b>, and the lower engagement surface <b>126</b> of the pawl <b>122</b> remains supported by the forward-moving staples S. When the rearward-most staple S in the magazine <b>30</b> passes by the lower engagement surface <b>126</b> of the pawl <b>122</b>, the lower engagement surface <b>126</b> is supported for a few more stapling cycles by the top surface <b>42</b> of the pusher <b>34</b> adjacent the leading end <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As stapling continues, the pusher <b>34</b> will eventually move forward within the magazine <b>30</b> to a point where the lower engagement surface <b>126</b> of the pawl <b>122</b> will encounter the elongated slot <b>54</b> in the top surface <b>42</b> of the pusher <b>34</b>. When this occurs, the pawl <b>122</b> is no longer supported by the staples S or the top surface <b>42</b> of the pusher <b>34</b> and will fall into the slot <b>54</b> in the pusher <b>34</b> and into the slot <b>56</b> in the underlying rail <b>55</b> due to the biasing force of the torsion spring <b>178</b>, thereby allowing the movable member <b>106</b> to pivot forward to a second position. Of course, it should be understood that the slot <b>54</b> in the pusher <b>34</b> could extend all the way to the leading end <b>46</b> of the pusher <b>34</b> such that the pawl <b>122</b> will fall into the slot <b>54</b> immediately upon disengagement with the last staple S in the strip.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>7</b>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b> show the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> in the second position. In the illustrated embodiment, the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> moves to the second position when the number of staples S in the magazine <b>30</b> drops below about twenty staples S. Of course, the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> can be sized and/or positioned to move to the second or low staple notification position with any desired number of remaining staples. For example, the apertures in the case <b>82</b> for receiving the mounting pins <b>114</b> could be moved forward or rearward to change the location of the pawl <b>122</b>. Alternatively, the length of the pawl arm <b>118</b> could be shortened or lengthened.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the movable member <b>106</b> is pivoted to this second position, the second indicator portion <b>174</b> is positioned directly underneath the cutout <b>66</b> in the outer cover <b>62</b> such that a user sees the red coloring on the second indicator portion <b>174</b> through the cutout <b>66</b> and the lens <b>74</b>. In observing the red coloring of the second indicator portion <b>174</b>, the user is alerted to the fact that the number of staples S in the magazine <b>30</b> is getting low, or that the magazine <b>30</b> is empty. This enables the user to take action to refill the magazine <b>30</b> for continued stapling.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the deformation of the body portion <b>134</b> that occurs during stapling operations when the movable member <b>106</b> is pivoted to the second position. As the user depresses the cover <b>62</b>, the curved underside of the lens <b>74</b> engages the arcuate notification portion <b>166</b> to apply force generally coaxially with the optional compression spring <b>162</b>, thereby compressing and deforming the body portion <b>134</b>. When the user releases the outer cover <b>62</b> after stapling, the cover <b>62</b> moves upwardly and the body portion <b>134</b> returns to its original oval-shape, either due to its geometry alone, and/or with assistance from the optional compression spring <b>162</b>. This sequence of compressions and subsequent restorations to the original state of the body portion <b>134</b> repeatedly occurs with each stapling action that takes place when the movable member <b>106</b> is in the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To refill the magazine <b>30</b>, the user opens the cover assembly <b>58</b>. The low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b>, which is coupled to the case <b>82</b>, will be pivoted with the case <b>82</b> away from the magazine <b>30</b> so that the user can insert one or more strips of staples S into the magazine. Typically, opening the cover assembly <b>58</b> automatically moves the pusher <b>34</b> to the rear end of the magazine <b>30</b> to facilitate insertion of staples S. In the illustrated embodiment, a pull-back strap <b>182</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) is connected between the staple pusher <b>34</b> and the case <b>82</b> to move the pusher <b>34</b> to the rear of the magazine <b>30</b> when the cover assembly <b>58</b> is opened. Once the staples S are inserted into the magazine <b>30</b>, the user closes the cover assembly <b>58</b>, thereby returning the case <b>82</b> and the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Due to the sufficient number of staples in the magazine <b>30</b>, the lower engagement surface <b>126</b> of the pawl <b>122</b> will again be supported on top of the staples S such that the movable member <b>106</b> is oriented in the first position.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> could also be modified to include more than two indicator portions <b>170</b>, <b>174</b> to provide even further graduated notification to the user. For example, a third indicator portion could be added between the illustrated first and second indicator portions <b>170</b> and <b>174</b>, and could be colored yellow to indicate a remaining supply of staples somewhere between generally full and generally low. Instead of either being supported by the staples S or falling through the slots <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, the engaging surface <b>126</b> of the pawl <b>122</b> could encounter an intermediate surface that would position this third indicator portion beneath the lens <b>74</b> and the cutout <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another example, the engaging surface <b>126</b> of the pawl <b>122</b> could move along a sloped or ramped surface to impart a more gradual rotation or pivoting of the movable member <b>106</b>. As mentioned above, other methods for providing notifying indicia on the notification portion <b>166</b> could be used, such as graduated markings, markings like those known for use on fuel gauges (e.g., F-¾-½-¼-E), or any other suitable markings.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Those skilled in the art will understand that the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> can also be used in its illustrated form, or in a modified form, in staplers having different staple storage chambers (e.g., cartridge-type staplers). For example, the pawl <b>122</b> could engage a top sheet of a stacked sheet of staples within a staple cartridge. As the staple sheets are used, and the stack diminishes in height, the pawl would move downwardly with the diminishing stack, causing the movable member <b>106</b> and the notification portion <b>166</b> to move toward a low staple notification position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another example, the low staple indicator assembly <b>14</b> could be positioned adjacent a cartridge containing a rolled sheet of staples. The pawl <b>122</b> could engage the sheet of staples exiting the cartridge such that when the last staple in the sheet passes the pawl, the pawl would disengage the sheet of staples and move downwardly, thereby moving the low staple indicator assembly to a low staple notification position.</p>
