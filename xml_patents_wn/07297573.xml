<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to manufacturing of Micro Electromechanical System (MEMS) devices, and more specifically to, getter devices and problems caused by gettering materials within MEMS devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) include electrical and mechanical components integrated on the same substrate, for example, a silicon substrate. Substrates for MEMS devices are sometimes referred to as dies. The electrical components are fabricated using integrated circuit processes, while the mechanical components are fabricated using micromachining processes that are compatible with the integrated circuit processes. This combination makes it possible to fabricate an entire system that fits within a chip carrier using standard manufacturing processes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One common application of MEMS devices is utilization within inertial sensor. The mechanical portion of the MEMS device provides the sensing capability for the inertial sensor, while the electrical portion of the MEMS device processes the information received from the mechanical portion. One example of an inertial sensor that utilizes a MEMS device is a gyroscope.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The MEMS production process involves the placement of the operational portion of the MEMS device, sometimes referred to as a micro-machine, within a chip carrier or housing, which is then hermetically sealed. Getters are sometimes attached to the housing to facilitate removal of water vapor and hydrogen, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Getters can however, release particles that can interfere with operation of the MEMs device. In one example, a MEMS gyroscope and other MEMS based inertial devices can be exposed to high-G forces that may cause an amount of particles to be released from the getter, and come into contact with moving components of the MEMS device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, a method for assembling a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) device that includes a micro-machine is provided. The method comprises forming the micro-machine on a die, the die having a top surface and a bottom surface, providing a plurality of die bonding pedestals on a surface of a housing, and mounting at least one of the top surface of the die and components of the micro-machine to the die bonding pedestals such that a bottom surface of the die at least partially shields components of the micro-machine from loose gettering material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) device is provided that comprises a micro-machine comprising a die and at least one each of a proof mass, a motor drive comb, a motor pick-off comb, and a sense plate. The MEMS device also comprises a housing configured to hold the micro-machine, a cover to be attached to the housing, to form a substantially sealed cavity, and a getter within the substantially sealed cavity. The micro machine is attached to the housing such that the die shields the proof mass, the motor drive comb, the motor pick-off comb, and the sense plate from particles that become dislodged from the getter.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In still another aspect, a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscope is provided that comprises a housing and a micro-machine comprising a die, at least one sense plate, at least one proof mass suspended a distance from said at least one sense plate, at least one motor drive comb and at least one motor pick-off comb. The gyroscope also comprises a getter comprising gettering material and a cover attached to the housing forming a substantially sealed cavity for the micro-machine and getter. The die is mounted within the cavity such that any gettering material that becomes dislodged from the getter is at least partially prevented from contacting the sense plates, the proof masses, the motor drive combs, and the motor pick-off combs.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another aspectt, a method for mounting a micro-machine portion of a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) within a housing portion of the MEMS that also contains a getter is provided. The method comprises forming a micro-machine on a die and orienting the micro-machine within the housing such that the die is between the getter and components of the micro-machine.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet still another aspect, a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) accelerometer is provided that comprises a housing, a micro-machine, a getter, and a cover attached to the housing. The micro-machine comprises a die, at least one sense plate, at least one proof mass suspended a distance from the at least one sense plate, at least one motor drive comb and at least one motor pick-off comb. The getter includes a gettering material, and the cover and housing are configured to form a substantially sealed cavity for the micro-machine and getter. The die is mounted within the cavity such that gettering material that becomes dislodged from the getter is substantially blocked from contacting the sense plates, proof masses, motor drive combs, and motor pick-off combs.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram of one known embodiment of a Micro-Electromechanical System (MEMS) <b>100</b>. MEMS <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>102</b> (sometimes referred to as a chip carrier) to which a cover <b>104</b> is eventually attached in order to form a sealed cavity. Electrical leads <b>106</b> provide electrical connections to a micro-machine <b>108</b> which includes a die <b>110</b> that is attached to housing <b>102</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, electrical connections <b>109</b> are provided through housing <b>102</b> to external devices (not shown). For example, in the case of a MEMS tuning fork gyroscope, micro-machine <b>108</b> includes, proof masses <b>114</b>, motor drive combs <b>116</b>, and motor pick-off combs <b>118</b>. Micro-machine <b>108</b> further includes sense plates <b>120</b> which form parallel plate capacitors with proof masses <b>114</b>. In one embodiment, sense plates <b>120</b> are metal films that have been deposited and patterned onto die <b>110</b>. Die <b>110</b> is attached to a bottom surface <b>122</b> of housing <b>102</b> utilizing contacts <b>124</b>. Contacts <b>124</b> are sometimes referred to as die bonding pedestals. In one embodiment, the attachment of die <b>110</b>, contacts <b>124</b>, and housing <b>102</b> is accomplished utilizing a thermocompression bonding process or another known bonding process.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Upon attachment of micro-machine <b>108</b> to housing <b>102</b>, cover <b>104</b> is attached to housing <b>102</b> to form a substantial hermetic seal. In one embodiment, a cavity <b>126</b> is formed when cover <b>104</b> is attached to housing <b>102</b>. Cavity <b>126</b> is first evacuated to remove any gases (i.e. oxygen, hydrogen, water vapor) within cavity <b>126</b>. Cavity is then backfilled with a dry gas to a controlled pressure. Typically the dry gas is an inert gas, for example, nitrogen or argon. In another embodiment, cover <b>104</b> is attached to housing <b>102</b> under vacuum conditions, and a vacuum is formed within cavity <b>126</b>. Cavity <b>126</b> provides an environment that allows components of micro-machine <b>108</b> to move freely. For example, proof masses <b>114</b> may be movably coupled to die chip <b>110</b> and therefore may oscillate within the vacuum of cavity <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, the seal between housing <b>102</b> and cover <b>104</b> is typically not absolute. In one embodiment, a getter <b>130</b> which includes a gettering material (not shown) is attached to a getter substrate <b>132</b>. Getter substrate <b>132</b> is then attached to cover <b>104</b>. Getter <b>130</b> removes water vapor or other gases (e.g. hydrogen) within cavity <b>126</b>, as is known in the art. These gases are known to permeate the seal between housing <b>102</b> and cover <b>104</b> over time and are also known to be emitted over time (into cavity <b>126</b>) by the materials which make up housing <b>102</b> and cover <b>104</b>. Removal of the water vapor and gases facilitates maintaining the environment within cavity <b>126</b>. The gettering material of getter <b>130</b> is typically particle based, and as described above, some gettering material may break free from getter <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a side view of a MEMS device <b>200</b> that includes a housing <b>200</b> onto which a cover <b>204</b> is attached to provide a substantially sealed cavity <b>206</b>. MEMS device <b>200</b> includes a micro-machine <b>208</b> that is attached to housing <b>202</b> in a flipped configuration. The term flipped, as used herein, refers to a mounting orientation of a micro-machine within a housing which is upside down as compared to known mounting orientations. Micro-machine <b>208</b> includes a die <b>210</b>, proof masses <b>214</b>, motor drive combs <b>216</b>, and motor pick-off combs <b>218</b>. Micro-machine <b>208</b> further includes sense plates <b>220</b> which form parallel plate capacitors with proof masses <b>214</b>. In one embodiment, sense plates <b>220</b> are metal films that have been deposited and patterned onto die <b>210</b>. Proof masses <b>214</b>, motor drive combs <b>216</b>, motor pick-off combs <b>218</b>, and sense plates <b>220</b> are mounted onto die <b>210</b> utilizing known processes. However, rather than mounting a bottom surface <b>222</b> of die <b>210</b> directly to die bonding pedestals, as is done in known MEMS devices, micro-machine <b>208</b> is flipped over before being attached to the die bonding pedestals, and therefore other portions of micro-machine <b>208</b> are attached to the die bonding pedestals, as further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, motor drive combs <b>216</b> and a top surface <b>224</b> of die <b>210</b> is attached to die bonding pedestals <b>226</b>, which are located on a bottom surface <b>228</b> of housing <b>202</b>, typically through a thermocompression bonding process. In one embodiment, die bonding pedestals <b>226</b> are gold contacts. By flipping micro-machine <b>208</b>, die <b>210</b> is also flipped, and bottom surface <b>222</b> of die <b>210</b> provides protection for operational and moveable portions (e.g. proof masses <b>214</b> and sense plates <b>220</b>, and portions of motor drive combs <b>216</b> and motor pick-off combs <b>218</b>) of micro machine <b>208</b>. Protection is provided such that particles of gettering material which become dislodged from getter <b>230</b>, for example, due to vibration, are blocked from components of micro-machine <b>208</b>, due to the orientation of micro-machine <b>208</b> with respect to getter <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Orientation of die <b>210</b> and arrangement of die bonding pedestals <b>226</b> also allows such pedestals to be utilized as electrical contacts for components of micro-machine <b>208</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, pedestals <b>240</b> are in contact with electrical nodes <b>242</b> on die <b>210</b>, and pedestals <b>244</b> are in electrical contact with motor drive combs <b>216</b>. Pedestals <b>240</b> and <b>244</b> also provide electrical contact with circuits outside of housing <b>202</b>, for example, through one of a plurality of electrical conductors <b>250</b>. One electrical conductor <b>250</b>, is illustrated as providing an electrical path from bottom surface <b>228</b> of housing <b>202</b> to an exterior surface <b>254</b> of housing <b>202</b>. A number of such electrical connections utilizing electrical conductors similar to conductor <b>250</b> are further described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> below. Additional connections to such conductors can be made to components of micro-machine <b>208</b> with additional pedestals <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">MEMS device <b>200</b> may comprise more or fewer components than described. For instance, while four electrical connections are illustrated (e.g. four pedestals <b>226</b>), those skilled in the art will recognize that a MEMS device may comprise more than two contacts and/or extruding pins as well. Additionally, more or fewer members (proof masses, drive combs, pick-off combs, etc.) may be present in MEMS device <b>200</b> other than those components above described. Further, components of MEMS device <b>200</b> may comprise multiple functions. Micro-machine <b>208</b> may be any such electromechanical machine used in accordance with MEMS and MEMS based devices. In addition, alternate packages may be used as well to provide a housing for MEMS device <b>200</b>. The illustrations in the Figures are intended to show embodiments for mounting a micro-machine that provides protection from dislodged gettering material rather than provide a description of a specific MEMS device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic illustration of a MEMS gyroscope <b>400</b> which incorporates a micro-machine oriented similarly to micro-machine <b>208</b>, described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Such an orientation has been referred to herein as a flipped or upside down orientation. MEMS gyroscope <b>400</b> includes a housing <b>402</b> (similar to housing <b>202</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>)) that includes therein a micro-machine which is a tuning fork gyroscope (TFG) <b>404</b>. Housing <b>402</b> is sealed with a cover (not shown). Housing <b>402</b> may be a plastic package, a small outline integrated circuit (SOIC) package, a ceramic leadless chip carrier, a plastic leaded chip carrier (PLCC) package, a quad flat package (QFP), or other housings as known in the art. Housing <b>402</b> may provide a structure to co-locate elements of TFG <b>404</b> and/or locate other elements within a close proximity of one another within the housing <b>402</b>. TFG <b>404</b>, in one embodiment, is located within a substantially sealed cavity <b>406</b> which is formed by bonding the cover to housing <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, TFG <b>404</b> includes proof masses <b>414</b>, motor drive combs <b>416</b>, motor pick-off combs <b>418</b>, and sense plates <b>420</b> constructed on a wafer. A pre-amplifier <b>422</b> may be included within housing <b>402</b> and is electrically connected or coupled to each proof mass <b>414</b> and sense plate <b>420</b> combination, for example, through die bonding pedestals <b>226</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Pre-amplifier <b>422</b> and TFG <b>404</b> may both be formed on a common substrate and, in one embodiment, are electrically connected. In other embodiments, pre-amplifier <b>422</b> is electrically connected to proof masses <b>414</b>. An output of pre-amplifier <b>422</b> is sent to sense electronics <b>424</b>, or alternatively, pre-amplifier <b>422</b> may be incorporated within sense electronics <b>424</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition, an output <b>426</b> of motor pick-off combs <b>418</b> is transferred to feedback monitors <b>428</b>. Feedback monitors <b>428</b> provide output signals <b>430</b> to drive electronics <b>432</b>, which power motor drive combs <b>416</b>. Alternatively, feedback monitors <b>428</b> may be incorporated within drive electronics <b>432</b>. MEMS gyroscope <b>400</b> may also include a system power source and other operational electronics, which are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for ease of illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In other embodiments (not shown) one or more of pre-amplifier <b>422</b>, sense electronics <b>424</b>, feedback monitors <b>428</b>, and drive electronics <b>432</b> may be mounted on bottom surface <b>222</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of die <b>210</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). To make electrical connections between these components and components external to housing <b>202</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), housing <b>202</b> can be configured with electrical leads <b>106</b> and electrical connections <b>109</b>, similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Motor drive combs <b>416</b> excite the proof masses <b>414</b> using electrostatic forces by applying a voltage to electrodes of proof masses <b>414</b>. Motor pick-off combs <b>418</b> monitor the excitation or oscillation of proof masses <b>414</b> by monitoring voltage signals on electrodes on proof masses <b>414</b>. Motor pick-off combs <b>418</b> output a feedback signal to feedback monitors <b>428</b>. Feedback monitor <b>428</b> provides an output <b>430</b> which is input to drive electronics <b>432</b>. If proof masses <b>414</b> begin to oscillate too fast or too slow, drive electronics <b>432</b> may adjust an oscillation frequency such that proof masses <b>414</b> vibrate at a resonant frequency. Excitation at such a frequency may enable a higher amplitude output signal to be generated. Many or all of the above described electrical interconnections may be accomplished utilizing die bonding pedestals when the micro-machine is in a flipped configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">While operation of gyroscope <b>400</b> is described, such operation is not likely if particles of gettering materials, for example, as described above, are released within cavity <b>406</b>. By orienting the micro-machine in an upside down or flipped configuration, a secondary cavity is essentially obtained which substantially reduces probabilities of gettering particles coming into contact with components, of the micro-machine, including those components which need to be able to move freely for proper operation.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Such a flipped micro-machine configuration is further usable in other sensor based-devices. It is contemplated to utilize the flipped micro-machine orientation and method described herein in a variety of MEMS devices, including, but not limited to, MEMS inertial measurement units, gyroscopes, pressure sensors, temperature sensors, resonators, air flow sensors, and accelerometers.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">While the invention has been described in terms of various specific embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims.</p>
