<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 21</figref> thereof, a new fluid dispensing system embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 21</figref>, the fluid dispensing system <b>10</b> generally comprises a housing <b>12</b>; a tank <b>14</b> for holding a vehicle fluid <b>2</b> such as windshield washing fluid, hydraulic brake fluid, antifreeze, soap solutions, or power steering fluid; a dispensing hose <b>16</b>; and a control assembly <b>20</b>. The dispensing system <b>10</b> is designed for permitting desired automatic dispensing of the vehicle fluid at a desired location of a fuel filling station. The vehicle solutions could also be any other known fluids typically used in association with automotive, farm or aviation vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The tank <b>14</b> is positioned in the housing and has an interior space designed for holding the vehicle fluid <b>2</b>. The housing <b>12</b> is structured to have an opening <b>18</b> in a forward face <b>19</b> of the housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The dispensing hose <b>16</b> is part of a dispensing hose assembly <b>30</b> that is coupled to the tank <b>14</b>. The dispensing hose <b>16</b> has a first end <b>14</b>A in environmental communication with the interior space of the tank <b>14</b>. Thus, the dispensing hose <b>16</b> is designed for dispensing the vehicle fluid <b>2</b> through the dispensing hose <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A pump assembly <b>40</b> includes a pump <b>42</b> and is coupled to the dispensing hose <b>16</b> for pumping the vehicle fluid <b>2</b> through the dispensing hose <b>16</b>. The pump assembly <b>40</b> includes a filter <b>44</b> positioned between the tank <b>14</b> and the pump <b>42</b> for removing debris from the vehicle fluid <b>2</b>. Thus, the filter <b>44</b> removes debris from the vehicle fluid <b>2</b> before the vehicle fluid <b>2</b> enters the pump <b>42</b>. In an embodiment, the pump assembly <b>40</b> also includes a flow meter <b>46</b> for monitoring flow of the vehicle fluid <b>2</b> through the pump assembly <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The control assembly <b>20</b> is operationally coupled to the pump assembly <b>40</b> for selectively activating the pump <b>42</b>. Thus, the pump <b>42</b> dispenses the vehicle fluid <b>2</b> only upon activation by the control assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A cover member <b>32</b> is couplable to the housing <b>12</b> for covering the opening <b>18</b> in the forward face <b>19</b> such that the control assembly <b>20</b> is covered to prevent unauthorized access to the control assembly <b>20</b>. A currency collection assembly <b>50</b> is operationally coupled to the control assembly <b>20</b> such that the control assembly <b>20</b> dispenses the vehicle fluid only upon reception of a pre-determined initial value of currency collected by the currency collection assembly <b>50</b>. Preferably, the currency collected can be in the form of either bills or coins.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The currency collection assembly <b>50</b> includes a currency collection bin <b>52</b> coupled to the cover member <b>32</b>. The currency collection bin <b>52</b> is positionable beneath a main portion <b>54</b> of the currency collection assembly <b>50</b> when the cover member <b>32</b> is engaged to the housing. Thus, currency passing through the main portion <b>54</b> of the currency collection assembly <b>50</b> is collected in the currency collection bin <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a most preferred embodiment, the control assembly <b>20</b> utilizes a computer controller <b>59</b> for crediting a pre-determined number of pulses upon accumulation of a pre-determined amount of currency. Each pulse is associated with a given amount of fluid such that a desired amount of fluid can be purchased by insertion of sufficient currency. As an additional feature, the computer controller <b>59</b> is operationally coupled to the currency collection assembly to prevent acceptance of currency when the level of fluid in the tank is below a pre-determined level, thus preventing acceptance of money in excess of an amount available to be dispensed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Alternately, the control assembly <b>20</b> may include an accumulating timer <b>56</b> for permitting dispensing of the vehicle fluid <b>2</b> for a pre-determined period of time upon reception of the initial value of currency collected by the currency collection assembly <b>50</b>. In an embodiment, the currency collection assembly <b>50</b> is operationally coupled to the control assembly <b>20</b> such that the vehicle fluid <b>2</b> is dispensable for an additional pre-determined period of time upon reception of additional currency in excess of the initial value of currency collected by the currency collection assembly <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The opening <b>18</b> in the housing <b>12</b> has a channel <b>62</b> extending along a bottom <b>64</b> of the opening <b>18</b> for receiving a bottom <b>66</b> of the cover member <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an embodiment, the cover member <b>32</b> includes a holster assembly <b>68</b> for receiving a free end of the dispensing hose <b>16</b>. Typically, the free end of the dispensing hose <b>16</b> will have a pistol style attachment or other comparable nozzle with a trigger mechanism to permit a user to regulate flow of the vehicle fluid <b>2</b> through the dispensing hose <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A holster switch <b>65</b> is operationally coupled to the control assembly <b>20</b> for preventing dispensing of the vehicle fluid <b>2</b> upon return of the free end of the dispensing hose <b>16</b> to the holster portion <b>68</b> after use. This may be by zeroing the credited pulses when the computer controller <b>59</b> is used or by zeroing an amount of time on the accumulating timer <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The holster assembly <b>68</b> includes a holster opening <b>22</b> for receiving the free end of the dispensing hose <b>16</b>. The holster assembly <b>68</b> also includes a sliding panel <b>24</b> movable between a receiving position and a blocking position. The blocking position is for at least partially blocking the holster opening <b>22</b>. Thus, insertion of the free end of the dispensing hose <b>16</b> is prevented until the sliding panel <b>24</b> is moved from the blocking position.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The free end of the dispensing hose <b>16</b> supports the sliding panel <b>24</b> in the receiving position when the free end of the dispensing hose <b>16</b> rests in the holster opening <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The sliding panel <b>24</b> is vertically oriented such that gravity urges the sliding panel <b>24</b> into the blocking position.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The sliding panel <b>24</b> is coupled to an interior of the cover member <b>32</b>. In an embodiment, the sliding panel <b>24</b> has an arcuate edge <b>26</b> extending across the holster opening <b>22</b> such that the sliding panel partially blocks the holster opening <b>22</b> when the sliding panel <b>24</b> is in the blocking position. Thus, insertion of the free end of the dispensing hose is made easier in that partial obstruction of the holster opening prohibits total insertion of the free end into the holster opening but permits use of an edge of the free end to move the sliding panel to permit full insertion of the free end.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The holster switch includes a main portion <b>67</b> positioned adjacent to the sliding panel <b>24</b>. A switch arm <b>69</b> extends from the main portion <b>67</b>. The switch arm <b>69</b> is operationally coupled to the sliding panel <b>24</b> such that movement of the sliding panel <b>24</b> between the receiving position and the blocking position moves the switch arm <b>69</b> between a use position and a shutoff position. The switch arm <b>69</b> is in the use position when the sliding panel <b>24</b> is in the blocking position to permit activation of the pump assembly <b>40</b> and use of the dispensing hose <b>16</b> when the sliding panel <b>24</b> is in the blocking position. A guide member <b>71</b> is statically positioned on an interior face of the cover member and the sliding panel <b>24</b> is secured to slide within a medial cutout portion <b>79</b> of the guide member.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A display panel <b>70</b> is coupled to the cover member <b>32</b> and is operationally coupled to the control assembly <b>20</b> for displaying either remaining amount of fluid dispensable or remaining time for dispensing the vehicle fluid <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A spindle lock <b>72</b> is coupled to the cover member <b>32</b> proximate a top <b>63</b> of the cover member <b>32</b>. The spindle lock <b>72</b> has a threaded interior end portion <b>73</b> selectively engageable to a brass socket <b>82</b> coupled to an interior wall <b>74</b> of the housing <b>12</b> for locking the cover member <b>32</b> to the housing <b>12</b>. In use, the spindle lock <b>72</b> secures the top portion of the cover member <b>32</b> while the bottom <b>66</b> of the cover member <b>32</b> is held within the channel <b>62</b> to prevent the cover member <b>32</b> from being removed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In an embodiment, the cover member <b>32</b> has orthogonal side portions <b>60</b> for seating in a recessed lip <b>61</b> of the housing <b>12</b> to prevent prying of the cover member <b>32</b> from the housing <b>12</b> when the cover member <b>32</b> is secured to the housing <b>12</b>. The orthogonal side portions <b>60</b> can be provided by bending edges of the cover member <b>32</b> forwardly to a 90 degree angle with respect to an interior portion of the cover member <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an embodiment, the channel <b>62</b> in the opening <b>18</b> of the housing <b>12</b> has a protrusion <b>75</b>. The bottom <b>66</b> of the cover member <b>32</b> has a notch <b>76</b> for receiving the protrusion <b>75</b> when the cover member <b>32</b> is coupled to the housing <b>12</b>. The notch <b>76</b> extends upwardly into the cover member <b>32</b> such that an upper portion <b>77</b> of the notch <b>76</b> receives the dispensing hose <b>16</b> therethrough when the cover member <b>32</b> is coupled to the housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In an embodiment, a transmitter <b>78</b> is operationally coupled to the control assembly <b>20</b> for transmitting status data to a remote location for monitoring use of the fluid dispensing system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A tank fluid level sensor <b>23</b> is coupled to the tank <b>14</b> for monitoring a level of the vehicle fluid <b>2</b> in the tank <b>14</b>. The tank level sensor <b>23</b> is operationally coupled to the control assembly <b>20</b> such that the transmitter <b>78</b> transmits a refilling signal to the remote location upon detection of a pre-determined level of fluid in the tank <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The tank <b>14</b> has a fill opening <b>15</b> positioned on a top surface <b>17</b> of the tank <b>14</b>. A perimeter edge of the fill opening <b>15</b> is molded to engage a cap member <b>25</b> that is selectively engageable to the fill opening <b>15</b> for covering the fill opening <b>15</b>. In an embodiment, the cap member <b>25</b> has a locking mechanism <b>27</b> for preventing removal of the cap member <b>25</b> for facilitating access to the tank <b>14</b> only by authorized persons for maintenance of the fluid dispensing system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an embodiment, the control assembly <b>20</b> includes an electronic connection port <b>53</b>. A wire <b>55</b> is coupled between the pump assembly <b>40</b> and the control assembly <b>20</b>. Thus, the pump <b>42</b> is activatable by the control assembly <b>20</b>. The wire <b>55</b> has a first end <b>57</b> removably insertable into the electronic connection port <b>53</b> for facilitating replacement of the control assembly <b>20</b> in the event the control assembly <b>20</b> breaks down. Most preferably parts as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are coupled to the cover member <b>32</b> to permit replacement these parts as a single unit to facilitate replacement of these parts. Typically, other parts or combinations of parts may also be coupled to the cover member to permit easy replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a first free standing embodiment utilizing attachment to an outside power source, a base portion <b>13</b> is integrally coupled to the housing <b>12</b> for supporting the housing <b>12</b> above a surface on which the base portion <b>13</b> rests. The base portion <b>13</b> includes a channeled rib <b>29</b> extends upward from a bottom of the base portion <b>13</b>. An electrical wire conduit <b>35</b> for enclosing electrical wiring is positioned substantially within the channeled rib <b>29</b> and has an upper end <b>29</b>A extending into the housing <b>12</b>. The base portion <b>13</b> may also be an integral portion of the tank to provide additional fluid holding capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another portable freestanding embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the housing <b>12</b> and tank <b>14</b> are self-contained. The power source <b>33</b> includes a 12 volt direct current battery <b>34</b> is provided on a shelf <b>36</b> within the housing <b>12</b>. The power source <b>33</b> is operationally coupled to the control assembly <b>20</b> and the pump assembly <b>40</b>. The housing is attached to a portable stand member <b>38</b> having a base section <b>37</b> and an elevated portion <b>39</b>. The housing is attached to the elevated portion of the stand member <b>38</b> using a main mounting bracket <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The main mounting bracket <b>43</b> is designed for coupling to the stand member <b>38</b> or to an existing surface to provide maximum flexibility in use. The housing <b>12</b> is coupled to the main mounting bracket <b>43</b>. The main mounting bracket <b>43</b> includes a medial portion <b>45</b> designed for coupling to an outer surface of a structure. The main mounting bracket <b>43</b> further includes a pair of outer portions <b>47</b> extending from the medial portion <b>45</b>.
