<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A home carbonation device uses a tube to form a gas-tight seal between two separate existing soda-pop bottles. A threaded cap holds flanges on the tube tight against the opening of each bottle. The liquid to be carbonated is contained in one bottle, while the chemicals for producing carbon dioxide are placed in the second bottle. To keep the chemical reactants from reacting while the gas-tight seal is made, a tall thin cylinder in the second bottle acts as a barrier between reactants until the bottle is placed on its side, at which point the chemicals meet and react producing the carbon dioxide that passes through the tube and carbonates the liquid.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This invention relates to home carbonation devices, especially those that are for simple, inexpensive, small-scale production of carbonated beverages.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Description of Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Current home carbonation techniques include using yeast, dry ice, compressed carbon dioxide, and chemical reactants to obtain the carbon dioxide for carbonating liquids. The current techniques have weaknesses in the area of simplicity and corresponding price, or availability of product, or introduction of undesirable byproducts.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One method for carbonating liquids involves using yeast. In this method, some yeast is added to a sweet sugar-based liquid. The yeast bacteria consume the sugars and produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct. This carbon dioxide production continues for a number of days in a warm environment after which it is to be kept refrigerated. This method is simple, inexpensive, and yeast is fairly easy to come by, but there are several drawbacks to it. First, yeast bacteria need sugar to produce carbon dioxide. This means that one cannot carbonate sugar-free beverages, or water alone. Second, the yeast is placed directly into the beverage to be carbonated. The flavor of the yeast can be unpleasant to taste. Third, yeast bacteria are biological creatures and can be unpredictable. New yeast can be healthy and produce larger amounts of carbon dioxide than old yeast would. Furthermore, yeast thrives better in warm environments, making more carbon dioxide in warm conditions and less in cold conditions. This opposes the fact that carbon dioxide dissolves more readily in cold liquid than in warm. Unexpected variations in temperature or carbon dioxide production times can lead to explosive pressures within the container being used.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another method for carbonating liquids includes using dry ice as a source of carbon dioxide. In this method, carbon dioxide is in a solid state, and is placed into the liquid to be carbonated. The carbon dioxide sublimates from a solid to gaseous state, and carbonates the liquid. Because the freezing point of carbon dioxide is so low, it will begin the sublimation process under normal atmospheric conditions, even if it is kept in household freezers. This means that one cannot store dry ice at home, and so if it is to be used for carbonation, it will have to be purchased and used on the day of carbonation. The low temperature of dry ice also makes it a hazardous material, introducing the risk of freezing skin. Furthermore, dry ice is not readily available and must be purchased at special outlets. It is inconvenient to use dry ice, because one needs to plan ahead to purchase the dry ice before preparing the beverage. Because of this, the current household method for using dry ice often includes putting the liquid into a large bucket or barrel, and carbonating large quantities of liquid at a time. Making carbonated beverages with dry ice becomes an extensive procedure that exceeds the limits of convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another source of carbon dioxide used for household carbonation is compressed carbon dioxide. One such design is found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,036,054 issued to Grill Mar. 14, 2000. In this patent, compressed carbon dioxide can be injected into an existing soda-pop bottle, but it involves a valve system which is relatively complicated to manufacture. Systems for injecting compressed carbon dioxide into a liquid are complex. Furthermore, as with dry ice, compressed carbon dioxide is not readily available and must be obtained or recharged at special outlets. Compressed carbon dioxide carbonation systems are relatively complicated and expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Using chemical reactants that produce carbon dioxide is another way to carbonate a beverage. Of the simple devices that use chemical reactants and can be used on a small scale, some do not use common household reactants. These require obtaining the special reactants, or reactants prepared in a special way. There are some that can use common household reactants. U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,584 issued to Annese et al. Jul. 10, 1984 was designed primarily for home use, and used chemical reactants to produce the carbon dioxide. It uses a specially designed container and a sophisticated lid and reaction system that is not as simple or inexpensive to manufacture as it could be.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Home carbonation devices in general can struggle for market success due in part to the low cost and high availability of soda-pop. The convenience and relatively low price of soda-pop often keeps consumers purchasing soda-pop more often than they make it. Carbonating beverages at home usually holds more of a novel advantage rather than an economical or convenient advantage as a replacement source of soda-pop. Because of this, a home carbonation device should be low enough in cost to justify a novel purchase, rather than as a money-saving or time-saving investment.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Despite the many home carbonation techniques found in prior art, they have not succeeded in being simple in design, easy and inexpensive to manufacture, while utilizing a convenient source of carbon dioxide, and preventing unpleasant byproducts from entering the beverage.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention comprises an extremely simple and inexpensive option for carbonating beverages, in which a tube connects the openings of two existing soda-pop bottles. Chemical reactants in one soda-pop bottle produce carbon dioxide that passes through the tube to carbonate the liquid contained in the other soda-pop bottle.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0025">A preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and <b>3</b>. An existing soda-pop bottle <b>10</b>, hereafter referred to as bottle A, contains a water-based liquid to be carbonated. A flanged tube <b>12</b> is held in a gas-tight manner with the opening <b>24</b> of bottle A <b>10</b> by an internally threaded cap <b>14</b> the threads of which coincide with the externally threaded neck <b>26</b> of bottle A <b>10</b>. Cap <b>14</b> has an axially centered hole that allows the tube part <b>20</b> of flanged tube <b>12</b> to pass through it, while the flange part <b>22</b> is unable to pass through it. Cap <b>14</b> presses flange <b>22</b> tight against the opening <b>24</b> of bottle A <b>10</b>, the said flange <b>22</b> having diameter large enough to completely cover opening <b>24</b>, but small enough to fit within the inside diameter of cap <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0026">Flanged tube <b>12</b> is flanged at both ends, and a second cap <b>14</b> holds the other end of flanged tube <b>12</b> in a gas-tight manner on a second existing soda-pop bottle <b>16</b> (hereafter referred to as bottle B) using an identical configuration as the connection of the first side of the flanged tube <b>12</b> with bottle A <b>10</b> described above. Namely that the other end of flanged tube <b>12</b> is held in a gas-tight manner with opening <b>24</b> of bottle B <b>16</b> by an internally threaded cap <b>14</b>, the threads of which coincide with the externally threaded neck <b>26</b> of bottle B <b>16</b>. Cap <b>14</b> has an axially centered hole that allows the tube part <b>20</b> of flanged tube <b>12</b> to pass through it, while the flange part <b>22</b> is unable to pass through it. Cap <b>14</b> presses flange <b>22</b> tight against the opening <b>24</b> of bottle B <b>16</b>, the said flange <b>22</b> having diameter large enough to completely cover opening <b>24</b>, but small enough to fit within the inside diameter of cap <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0027">Flanged tube <b>12</b> can be made with flange <b>22</b> and tube <b>20</b> of a solid single material, preferably of flexible material, and of such material that flange <b>22</b> can make a gas-tight seal with opening <b>24</b> of both bottle A <b>10</b> and bottle B <b>12</b>. Such material such as polyethylene must also be strong enough to withstand the pressures of carbonation. If, however, a material is chosen that does not make a gas-tight seal by itself, the addition of a rubber washer or washer of another flexible material may be used to aid in forming the gas-tight seal.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0028">Tube <b>20</b> can be made with inside diameter small enough to keep liquid from readily passing through it, and producing small bubbles to aid in carbon dioxide dissolution. Such a diameter could be ⅛ inch for example.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0029">Within bottle B <b>16</b> is a hollow cylinder <b>18</b> open on the top and closed on the bottom with radial bores <b>28</b>. Bores <b>28</b> are situated on cylinder <b>18</b> so as to be far enough from the bottom so that liquid reactant in bottle B <b>16</b> will not enter in through bores <b>28</b> when bottle B <b>16</b> is in an upright position. Bores <b>28</b> are small enough so that solid reactant held therein does not readily escape through the bores <b>28</b>. Cylinder <b>18</b> has diameter small enough to fit through opening <b>24</b> of bottle B <b>16</b>. Cylinder <b>18</b> also has length suited to hold the appropriate amount of reactant to produce the correct amount of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0030">In an alternative embodiment, if liquid reactant is held in cylinder <b>18</b>, then radial bores <b>28</b> are not required. Cylinder <b>18</b> may also be marked to various levels representing to various quantities of reactant corresponding to various amounts of carbon dioxide produced.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Advantages</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0031">From the description above, a number of advantages of my carbonation device become apparent:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0032">(a) The use of existing soda-pop bottles reduces the size, production requirements and packaging of the device. This makes the device simpler and less expensive than other carbonation devices.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0033">(b) The use of existing soda-pop bottles allows a convenient container for storing the carbonated beverage once it is made, capping it with its original bottle cap.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0034">(c) The use of reactants to produce carbon dioxide provides a convenient and available source for carbon dioxide.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0035">(d) The use of two bottles keeps reactants from mixing with the liquid to be carbonated, thereby avoiding unpleasant tastes.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0036">(e) The use of the cylinder keeps reactants from reacting before the system is sealed in a gas-tight manner.
<br/>
Operation
</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0037">The manner for carbonating a water-based liquid with the present device begins by placing the liquid to be carbonated into bottle A <b>10</b>. One side of flanged tube <b>12</b> is fit to opening <b>24</b> of bottle A <b>10</b> and fastened in place with cap <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0038">In the preferred embodiment, liquid reactant such as acetic acid (vinegar) is placed in bottle B <b>16</b>. Cylinder <b>18</b> is filled with solid reactant such as sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). Some of the solid reactant is added to the liquid reactant to produce enough carbon dioxide to purge bottle B <b>16</b> of air. Cylinder <b>18</b> is then inserted through opening <b>24</b> of bottle B <b>16</b>. The liquid does not reach bores <b>28</b> with bottle B <b>16</b> in an upright position. In an alternative embodiment, liquid reactant could be placed in Cylinder <b>18</b> instead, Cylinder <b>18</b> having no bores <b>28</b>. In yet another alternative embodiment, Cylinder <b>18</b> can have bores <b>28</b> low enough that a few bores <b>28</b> are situated below the liquid reactant level. This will allow a small amount of reaction to occur, enough to purge bottle B <b>16</b> of air, thereby removing the need to add some of the solid reactant separately as mentioned in the preferred embodiment. With common vinegar that is 5% acetic acid by volume, the quantity of vinegar needed to produce enough carbon dioxide does not fit in a cylinder that has diameter small enough to fit through the opening <b>24</b> of bottle B <b>16</b> and length short enough to fit within the height of bottle B <b>16</b>. However, the quantity of baking soda needed to react with the vinegar does fit within a cylinder that has diameter small enough to fit through the opening <b>24</b> of bottle B <b>16</b> and length short enough to fit within the height of bottle B <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0039">With cylinder <b>18</b> placed in bottle B <b>16</b>, the free end of flanged tube <b>12</b> is positioned on opening <b>24</b> of bottle B <b>16</b> and fastened in place with cap <b>14</b>. This creates a gas-tight connection from bottle B <b>16</b> to bottle A <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0040">Next, bottle B <b>16</b> is placed on its side. With cylinder <b>18</b> now on its side, the reactants are able to reach each other and the reaction begins. Carbon dioxide gas is produced and it passes through tube <b>20</b> and through the principles of Henry's Law of Dissolved Gasses, the pressure of the carbon dioxide gas sets the level of carbonation in the liquid. The pressurized system is then left for a predetermined length of time until carbonation is complete.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">CONCLUSIONS, RAMIFICATIONS, AND SCOPE</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0041">Accordingly, it can be seen that the carbonation device of this invention can be made at a very low cost. The carbonation process is presented in a novel and basic manner. A convenient source of carbon dioxide is used, and unpleasant byproducts are kept from mixing with the carbonated liquid. Furthermore, the carbonation device has the additional advantages that:</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0042">it provides a carbonation device that can be simple and inexpensive to manufacture;</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0043">it provides a carbonation device that uses readily available chemical reactants to produce the carbon dioxide for carbonation;</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0044">it provides a carbonation device that keeps the byproducts of reaction from mixing with the liquid to be carbonated;</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0045">it provides a carbonation device that keeps the products of reaction from combining until a gas-tight seal is formed;</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0046">it provides a carbonation device that can carbonate water-based liquids, including water, soda-pop, punches, fruit juices, and so forth; and</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0047">it provides a carbonation device that uses existing soda-pop bottles to allow a convenient familiar container for the carbonated beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0048">Although the description above contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but as merely providing illustrations of some of the presently preferred embodiments of this invention. For example, the tube part of the flanged tube could be extended so that it reaches into the liquid to be carbonated to facilitate the bubbling of carbon dioxide bubbles through solution; there could be an introduction of a porous membrane at the end of the flanged tube to produce finer bubbles into solution thereby increasing the gas dissolution rate; rigid tubes could be used in place of flexible ones, the flanged tube can be made of separate flange and tube parts, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0049">Thus the scope of this invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents, rather than by the examples given.</p>
