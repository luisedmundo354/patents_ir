Each of the water inlet seats <b>106</b>′ of the valve body <b>10</b>′ is formed with a substantially inverted L-shaped water inlet channel <b>107</b>′ having a first portion communicating with a respective one of the water inlet holes <b>104</b>′ and a second end mounted on a respective one of the water inlet pipes <b>12</b>. A cover <b>190</b>′ is mounted on the valve body <b>10</b>′ to cover the water inlet seats <b>106</b>A′.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0038">In assembly, the water faucet is mounted on a batch tub <b>16</b>. Each of the water inlet pipes <b>12</b> is extended through the batch tub <b>16</b>. Then, the pivot hinge <b>1</b> <b>10</b> of each of the clamping members <b>11</b> is mounted on a respective one of the water inlet pipes <b>12</b>. Then, the locking bolt <b>70</b> is extended through the locking hole <b>105</b>′ of a respective one of the water inlet seats <b>106</b>′ of the valve body <b>10</b>′ and is screwed into the locking nut <b>111</b>′ of a respective one of the clamping members <b>11</b>. In such a manner, when each of the locking bolts <b>70</b> is rotated by a screwdriver, the locking nut <b>111</b>′ of each of the clamping members <b>11</b> is moved upward on the respective locking bolt <b>70</b> to push the first end of the pivot hinge <b>110</b> of the respective clamping member <b>11</b> to move upward. At this time, the second end of each of the pivot hinge <b>110</b> of each of the clamping members <b>11</b> is limited by a respective one of the water inlet pipes <b>12</b>, so that the pivot hinges <b>110</b> of the clamping members <b>11</b> are expanded outward to lock the valve body <b>10</b>′ on the batch tub <b>16</b>. Thus, the water faucet is mounted on the batch tub <b>16</b> by the locking action between the two clamping members <b>11</b>, the two locking bolts <b>70</b> and the two water inlet pipes <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0039">Accordingly, the water faucet is mounted on the sink <b>15</b> by the locking action between the clamping member <b>11</b>, the locking bolt <b>70</b> and the water inlet pipes <b>12</b>, so that the water faucet is mounted on the sink <b>15</b> easily and conveniently without having to mount the water faucet in a narrow space under the sink <b>15</b>, thereby facilitating a user mounting the water faucet. In addition, the water faucet is mounted on the batch tub <b>16</b> by the locking action between the two clamping members <b>11</b>, the two locking bolts <b>70</b> and the two water inlet pipes <b>12</b>, so that the water faucet is mounted on the batch tub <b>16</b> easily and conveniently without having to mount the water faucet in a narrow space under the batch tub <b>16</b>, thereby facilitating a user mounting the water faucet.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0040">Although the invention has been explained in relation to its preferred embodiment(s) as mentioned above, it is to be understood that many other possible modifications and variations can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. It is, therefore, contemplated that the appended claim or claims will cover such modifications and variations that fall within the true scope of the invention.</p>
