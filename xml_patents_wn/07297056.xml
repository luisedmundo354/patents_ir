<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A turning point marker on a power gauge and an impact point object are displayed in a game image. The impact point object is displayed according to the current lie. The turning point marker is positioned away from the left end of the power gauge depending on the difficulty of the shot. The moving direction of a cursor moving along the power gauge is reversed at the turning point marker. With the turning point marker, it is possible to clearly indicate to the player how limited the power available is under the current situation as compared with the situation where the maximum power is available, and thus how difficult it is to play the current situation.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The technology herein relates to a video game device and a storage medium storing a video game program, and, more particularly, to a video game device and a storage medium storing a video game program for playing a golf game that proceeds as the player hits a ball.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various video game devices and video game programs have been developed in the art for playing a golf game on a screen by using a computer provided in a video game device, or the like. Typically, in a golf game, the player operates a controller to select a club to be used for hitting the ball, the power, the direction and the impact point position of the shot, and the impact timing, etc. Then, a shot is reproduced on the screen according to these operations. Shot parameters of the golf game include pre-shot parameters and in-shot parameters. The pre-shot parameters are parameters that are set by the player before the shot action, and include the club to be used for hitting the ball, and the direction and the impact point position of the shot. The in-shot parameters are parameters that are determined by the timing of the operation by the player during the shot action, and include the power and the impact timing of the shot. Thereafter in the shot action, the ball's trajectory is calculated, and the final position to be reached by the ball is determined, based on the pre-shot parameters and the in-shot parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A golf game disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 10-151277 uses a power gauge for setting the power of a shot. The power gauge may be, for example, a power gauge of one type where the inside of the gauge is filled gradually, or a power gauge of another type where a cursor moves along the gauge. These types of power gauges are not substantially different from each other, and they both indicate to the player the increase/decrease of the shot power. The player can set the shot power by performing a predetermined operation at a time when a desirable portion of the power gauge is filled or when the cursor is at a desirable position along the power gauge. In the golf game disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 10-151277, the length of the power gauge itself is varied according to the stance width when making a shot. Specifically, the greater the stance width set by the player is, the longer the power gauge will be. The variation of the length of the power gauge itself allows the player to make a shot with great power or with a limited range of power depending on the situation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the golf game where the length of the power gauge itself is varied, the player may not be able to know the length of the current power gauge with respect to the largest possible length of the power gauge (i.e., such a length of the power gauge that allows the player to make a shot with the maximum power possible). For example, when the gauge length is 90, with 100 being the largest possible length of the power gauge, the player may not notice the shortening of the gauge length. Even if the player notices the shortening of the gauge length, it is difficult for the player to know whether the gauge length is 90, 85 or 95. Therefore, it is difficult for the player to know, with the power gauge being displayed, when to perform the predetermined power-setting operation in order to set an appropriate power. Moreover, a beginning player may be confused by the change in the display of the power gauge itself in the golf game disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 10-151277.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, a feature of the exemplary illustrative embodiments herein provides a video game device and a storage medium storing a video game program in which the limitation on the power available for a shot is varied depending on the situation, wherein it is possible to clearly indicate how limited the power available is under the current situation as compared with the situation where the maximum power is available, and thus how difficult it is to play in the current situation. Another feature of the exemplary illustrative embodiments herein provides a video game device and a storage medium storing a video game program, in which changing the limitation on the power depending on the situation can be realized simply without changing the display of the power gauge itself.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The exemplary illustrative embodiments herein have the following features to attain the objects mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first aspect of an exemplary illustrative embodiment is directed to a video game device for playing a golf game that proceeds in response to a player's operation. The video game device includes input means (e.g., the controller <b>6</b> in the illustrated exemplary embodiment), gauge display control means (e.g., the CPU <b>31</b> performing steps S<b>14</b> and S<b>21</b> in the illustrated exemplary embodiment; only the step numbers will be indicated hereinafter), cursor display control means (S<b>32</b>, S<b>35</b>, S<b>39</b> and S<b>41</b>), first determination means (S<b>38</b> and S<b>40</b>), shot condition setting means (S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b> and S<b>19</b>), and marker display control means (S<b>13</b> and S<b>20</b>). The input means is operated by the player. The gauge display control means displays, with a constant length, a gauge (the power gauge <b>24</b>) used for determining the power for hitting the ball. The cursor display control means displays a cursor (the cursor <b>244</b>) moving along the gauge. The first determination means determines the power based on the position of the cursor (open arrow At<b>2</b>) with respect to the gauge at the time of a predetermined operation of the input means (the activation of the A button <b>62</b>). The shot condition setting means sets a shot condition (the lie, the club, an environment factor) influencing the ball travel distance determined according to the power. The marker display control means displays a marker (the turning point marker <b>241</b>) indicating one end of the moving range of the cursor along the gauge at a position according to the shot condition set by the shot condition setting means.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to this aspect of an exemplary illustrative embodiment, the position of the marker, which is displayed on or near the gauge, is changed, thereby changing the moving range of the cursor along the gauge, according to the situation in the golf game (the shot condition) while the gauge length stays constant. As the change in the position of the marker is displayed in the game image, the player can visually check the position of the marker with respect to the gauge, which is displayed with a constant length for various situations in the golf game, and the player can readily determine how difficult it is to play the current situation. Specifically, the power is determined based on the position of the cursor moving along the gauge. Since the cursor does not move across the marker, the portion of the gauge beyond the marker is not used for determining the power. Therefore, as the position of the marker changes, the player can readily see where the marker is being currently positioned with respect to the gauge. Therefore, the player can readily determine how limited the power available is under the current situation as compared with the situation where the maximum power is available, and thus how difficult it is to play the current situation. Moreover, the player can readily estimate the influence of the power limitation on the shot distance, and thus to estimate the shot distance available under the current situation. Moreover, changing the limitation on the power depending on the situation can simply be realized without changing the display of the gauge itself.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one example, when the cursor displayed by the cursor display control means reaches the marker, the moving direction of the cursor is reversed (S<b>35</b>) so that the cursor thereafter moves in the opposite direction along the gauge. Therefore, by changing the position of the marker, it is possible to significantly change the rhythm and the difficulty of the power determination operation, thereby enhancing the playability of the game. The cursor display control means may continue to move the cursor in the same direction along the gauge even after the power is determined by the first determination means. In this case, the video game device further includes second determination means (S<b>47</b>). The second determination means further determines, after the power is determined by the first determination means, another shot parameter (impact timing) based on the position of the cursor (open arrow At<b>3</b>) with respect to the gauge at the time of a predetermined operation of the input means (the activation of the A button <b>62</b>). Thus, as the marker is displayed at a position such that the moving range of the cursor is narrowed, the amount of time allowed for the power determination operation and the operation of determining the other shot parameter is shortened, and the difficulty of these operations is increased, thereby further enhancing the playability of the game. Specifically, where the power is determined while the cursor is moving in one direction, and the other shot parameter is determined while the cursor is moving in the other direction after reversing its moving direction at the marker position, as the marker is displayed at a position such that the moving range of the cursor is narrowed, the amount of time from the power determination operation to the operation of determining the other shot parameter is shortened. Moreover, where the power and the other shot parameter are determined while the cursor is moving in the second direction after reversing its moving direction at the marker position, as the marker is displayed at a position such that the moving range of the cursor is narrowed, the amount of time from the reversal of the moving direction of the cursor to the power determination operation is also shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another example, when the cursor displayed by the cursor display control means reaches the marker, the cursor jumps back to the other end of the moving range and repeats moving in the same direction along the gauge. Thus, after the cursor reaches the marker position along the gauge, the cursor appears at the other end of the gauge and repeats moving in the same direction. Therefore, by changing the position of the marker, it is possible to significantly change the rhythm and the difficulty of the power determination operation, thereby enhancing the playability of the game.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The video game device may further include difficulty table storing means (the work memory <b>32</b>). The difficulty table storing means pre-stores, as a difficulty table (the lie-club compatibility table, the environmental factor table, the cursor speed table), a data table defining a numerical difficulty level (marker position data) associated with each shot condition that can be set in the golf game so that each difficulty level reflects that in real golf under the associated shot condition. In this case, the marker display control means retrieves, from the difficulty table, a value associated with the shot condition set by the shot condition setting means, and determines the position of the marker based on the retrieved value. Thus, the position of the marker is determined based on a numerical difficulty level for the current shot condition, which reflects the difficulty of the shot in real golf, whereby the player can enjoy various shots with realistic difficulty levels in determining the cursor position.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With respect to the use of the difficulty table storing means, various examples are possible as follows. In a first example, the marker display control means displays the marker at a position closer to the starting position of the cursor (the best timing point <b>243</b>) for a difficulty level indicated by the retrieved value as higher. Thus, the position of the marker is determined based on a numerical difficulty level for the current shot condition, which reflects the difficulty of the shot in real golf, so that the marker is displayed at a position closer to the starting position of the cursor for a higher difficulty level. As the marker is displayed at a position closer to the starting position of the cursor, the operation of determining the cursor position becomes more difficult. Thus, the difficulty of the controller operation for a certain situation can be linked with the difficulty of the situation in real golf, and the situation can be indicated to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a second example, the difficulty table (the lie-club compatibility table) defines a value for each lie indicating the condition of the ground on which the ball is lying. Then, the shot condition setting means sets at least the lie before a shot as the shot condition. In this case, the marker display control means retrieves, from the difficulty table, a value associated with the lie before a shot, and determines the position of the marker based on the retrieved value. Thus, the position of the marker can be determined based on the condition of the lie before the shot operation. Since each value defined in the difficulty table represents the difficulty level for a lie, the difficulty of a shot under the lie condition can be indicated to the player by way of the marker position. For example, the marker can be displayed at a position closer to the starting position of the cursor for a poorer lie condition, so that the difficulty of the operation of determining the cursor position is increased higher for poorer lie conditions. As the marker position is changed, the increase in the difficulty is indicated to the player, which can be a reference for the player when setting a shot condition such as the power. The difficulty table (the lie-club difficulty table) may further define a value for each combination of the lie and the club that can be selected in the golf game. In this case, the shot condition setting means sets at least the combination of the lie before a shot and the club selected for the shot as the shot condition. Then, the marker display control means retrieves, from the difficulty table, a value associated with the combination of the lie before the shot and the selected club, and determines the position of the marker based on the retrieved value. Since each value defined in the difficulty table represents the difficulty level for a combination of a lie and a club, the position of the marker can be determined based on how appropriate the club selection is for the lie before the shot operation. Thus, the difficulty of a shot with the selected club for the current lie condition can be indicated to the player by way of the marker position. For example, the marker can be displayed at a position closer to the starting position of the cursor for a less appropriate club selection for the lie condition, so that the difficulty of the operation of determining the cursor position can be increased for an inappropriate club selection for the lie.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a third example, the difficulty table (the environmental factor table) defines a value for each environmental factor of a hole played. Then, the shot condition setting means sets at least an environmental factor of a hole currently being played as the shot condition. In this case, the marker display control means retrieves, from the difficulty table, a value associated with the environmental factor of the hole being played, and determines the position of the marker based on the retrieved value. Since each value defined in the difficulty table represents the difficulty level for the environment of a hole, the difficulty of a shot for an environmental factor of the hole being played can be indicated to the player by way of the marker position. For example, the marker can be displayed at a position closer to the starting position of the cursor for an undesirable environmental factor (rain, night, etc.), so that the difficulty of the operation of determining the cursor position can be increased for an undesirable environmental factor.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a fourth example, the video game device further includes cursor speed calculation means (S<b>31</b>). The cursor speed calculation means calculates the speed of the cursor moving along the gauge. The cursor speed calculation means retrieves, from the difficulty table (cursor speed table), a value associated with a shot condition set by the shot condition setting means, and calculates the speed based on the retrieved value. In this case, the cursor display control means moves the cursor along the gauge based on the speed calculated by the cursor speed calculation means. Thus, the speed of the cursor moving along the gauge is changed in addition to changing the position of the marker, thereby changing the rhythm of the operation of determining the position of the cursor moving along the gauge, thus further enhancing the playability of the game. Since the speed of the cursor is changed based on a value representing the difficulty of the shot in real golf, the player can enjoy various shots with realistic difficulty levels in determining the cursor position.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The video game device may further include character table storing means (the work memory <b>32</b>). The character table storing means pre-stores, as a character table (the character table, the turning point settings table), a data table defining a numerical shot characteristic associated with each combination of a character that can be used in the golf game and a shot condition that can be set in the golf game. In this case, the marker display control means retrieves, from the character table, a value associated with the combination of the character making the shot and the shot condition set by the shot condition setting means, and determines the position of the marker based on the retrieved value. With the character table defining characteristic of each character in terms of the shot characteristic, the position of the marker can be changed according to the characteristic of the character being used. Thus, the player can enjoy a variety of rhythms of the controller operation for different characters, and the game is provided with a wide diversity. Since the characteristic of the character is indicated to the player by way of the marker position, the player can enjoy the characteristic of each character by the position of the marker. For example, the character table defines a value for each combination of a lie indicating the condition of the ground on which the ball is lying and the character. In this case, the marker display control means retrieves, from the character table, a value associated with a combination of the lie before the shot and the character making the shot, and determines the position of the marker based on the retrieved value. Thus, a lie at which a given character is good can be defined in the character table, and the position of the marker can be determined on this basis. Thus, the player can know if the character is good or poor at the lie by way of the marker position, and the game is provided with wide diversity.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">At least if the condition of the ground on which the ball is lying at the time the shot is to be taken is a rough or a bunker, the shot condition setting means may set, as the shot condition, the ground condition being a rough or a bunker. Then, the marker display control means may display the marker at a position closer to the starting position of the cursor if the ground condition is a rough or a bunker. Thus, the marker can be displayed at a position closer to the starting position of the cursor for a lie that is generally more difficult to hit from in real golf, such as a rough or a bunker, whereby the difficulty of the operation of determining the cursor position can be increased for a shot from a rough or a bunker.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A second aspect of an exemplary illustrative embodiment is directed to a video game device for playing a golf game that proceeds in response to a player's operation. The video game device includes input means, gauge display control means, cursor display control means, determination means (S<b>38</b> and S<b>40</b>), putt condition setting means (S<b>11</b> and S<b>12</b>) and marker display control means. The input means is operated by the player. The gauge display control means displays, with a constant length, a gauge used for determining the power for hitting the ball. The cursor display control means displays a cursor moving along the gauge. The determination means determines the power based on the position of the cursor with respect to the gauge at the time of a predetermined operation of the input means. The putt condition setting means sets a putt condition (the lie, an environment factor) influencing the ball travel distance determined according to the power. The marker display control means displays a marker indicating one end of the moving range of the cursor along the gauge at a position according to the putt condition set by the putt condition setting means.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to this aspect of an exemplary illustrative embodiment, when making a putt on the green, the position of the marker, which is displayed on or near the gauge, is changed, thereby changing the moving range of the cursor along the gauge according to the putt condition, while the gauge length stays constant. As the change in the position of the marker is displayed in the game image, the player can visually check the position of the marker with respect to the gauge, and the player can readily determine the current condition for the putt. Specifically, the power is determined based on the position of the cursor moving along the gauge. The portion of the gauge beyond the marker is not used for determining the power. Therefore, as the position of the marker changes, the player can readily see where the marker is being currently positioned with respect to the gauge. Therefore, the player can readily determine how limited the power available is under the current situation as compared with the situation where the maximum power is available, and thus how difficult it is to play the current situation. Moreover, the player can readily estimate the influence of the power limitation on the ball travel distance for the putt, and thus estimate the ball travel distance available under the current situation. Moreover, changing the limitation on the power depending on the situation can be realized simply without changing the display of the gauge itself. Moreover, it is possible to change the rhythm and the difficulty of the operation of determining the position of the cursor moving along the gauge, thereby enhancing the playability of the game.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, at least if the condition of the ground on which the ball is lying at the time the shot is to be taken is a green, the putt condition setting means sets, as the putt condition, the speed at which the ball rolls on the green. Then, the marker display control means displays the marker at a position closer to the starting position of the cursor if the speed of the ball is higher than a predetermined value. Thus, by displaying the marker at a position closer to the starting position of the cursor for a fast green on which it is more difficult to putt in real golf, it is possible to increase the difficulty of the operation of determining the cursor position for a putt on a fast green.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A third aspect of an exemplary illustrative embodiment is directed to a video game device for playing a golf game that proceeds in response to a player's operation. The video game device includes input means, gauge display control means, filling means, determination means (S<b>38</b> and S<b>40</b>), shot condition setting means and turning point marker display control means (S<b>13</b> and S<b>20</b>). The input means is operated by the player. The gauge display control means displays, with a constant length, a gauge used for determining the power for hitting the ball. The filling means gradually fills the inside of the gauge in a predetermined direction. The determination means determines the power based on the position of the front end of the filled area filled by the filling means with respect to the gauge at the time of a predetermined operation of the input means. The shot condition setting means sets a shot condition influencing the ball travel distance determined according to the power. The turning point marker display control means displays a turning point marker (the turning point marker <b>241</b>) at a position according to the shot condition set by the shot condition setting means, the turning point marker indicating the position at which the direction of the filling operation by the filling means is reversed. The filling means reverses the direction of the filling operation when the front end of the filled area reaches the turning point marker.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to this aspect of an exemplary illustrative embodiment, where the gauge is gradually filled and the power is determined based on the position of the front end of the filled area, the turning point marker indicating the position at which the filling direction is reversed is displayed in the game image, whereby the player can visually check the position of the turning point marker with respect to the gauge, and the player can readily determine how difficult it is to play the current situation. Specifically, the power is determined based on the position of the front end of the filled area along the gauge, and the portion of the gauge beyond the turning point marker is not used for determining the power. Therefore, as the position of the turning point marker changes, the player can readily see where the turning point marker is being currently positioned with respect to the gauge. Therefore, the player can readily determine how limited the power available is under the current situation as compared with the situation where the maximum power is available, and thus how difficult it is to play the current situation. Moreover, the player can readily estimate the influence of the power limitation on the shot distance, and thus to estimate the shot distance available under the current situation. Moreover, changing the limitation on the power depending on the situation can simply be realized without changing the display of the gauge itself. The filling direction is reversed when the front end of the filled area reaches the turning point marker along the gauge, and the gauge is thereafter filled in the opposite direction. Therefore, by changing the position of the turning point marker, it is possible to significantly change the rhythm and the difficulty of the operation of determining the power based on the position of the front end of the filled area, thereby enhancing the playability of the game.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A fourth aspect of an exemplary illustrative embodiment is directed to a video game device for playing a game in which an object is moved in response to a player's operation. The video game device includes input means, gauge display control means, cursor display control means, determination means, object moving condition setting means (S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b> and S<b>19</b>), and marker display control means. The input means is operated by the player. The gauge display control means displays, with a constant length, a gauge used for determining the power for moving the object. The cursor display control means displays a cursor moving along the gauge. The determination means determines the power based on the position of the cursor with respect to the gauge at the time of a predetermined operation of the input means. The object moving condition setting means sets an object moving condition (the lie, the club, an environment factor) influencing the object travel distance determined according to the power. The marker display control means displays a marker indicating one end of the moving range of the cursor along the gauge at a position according to the object moving condition set by the object moving condition setting means.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to this aspect of an exemplary illustrative embodiment, effects similar to those of the first aspect of an exemplary illustrative embodiment can be obtained with a game in which an object is moved in response to a player's operation (e.g., a fishing game, a soccer game, an object throwing game such as a hammer throw game, etc.) by displaying the marker at a position according to the object moving condition.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A fifth aspect of an exemplary illustrative embodiment is directed to a storage medium storing a video game program to be executed by a computer for playing a golf game that proceeds in response to a player's operation. The video game program stored in the storage medium instructs the computer to perform a gauge display control step (S<b>14</b> and S<b>21</b>), a cursor display control step (S<b>32</b>, S<b>35</b>, S<b>39</b> and S<b>41</b>), a first determination step (S<b>38</b> and S<b>40</b>), a shot condition setting step (S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b> and S<b>19</b>), and a marker display control step (S<b>13</b> and S<b>20</b>). The gauge display control step displays, with a constant length, a gauge used for determining the power for hitting a ball. The cursor display control step displays a cursor moving along the gauge. The first determination step determines the power based on the position of the cursor with respect to the gauge at the time of a predetermined operation of an input section (the controller <b>6</b>) by the player. The shot condition setting step sets a shot condition influencing the ball travel distance determined according to the power. The marker display control step displays a marker indicating one end of the moving range of the cursor along the gauge at a position according to the shot condition set in the shot condition setting step.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to this aspect of an exemplary illustrative embodiment, effects similar to those of the first aspect of an exemplary illustrative embodiment can be obtained with a storage medium storing a video game program to be executed by a computer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one example, when the cursor displayed in the cursor display control step reaches the marker, the moving direction of the cursor is reversed so that the cursor thereafter moves in an opposite direction along the gauge. The cursor display control step may continue to move the cursor in the same direction along the gauge even after the power is determined in the first determination step. In this case, the video game program stored in the storage medium instructs the computer to further perform a second determination step (S<b>47</b>). The second determination step further determines, after the power is determined in the first determination step, another shot parameter based on the position of the cursor with respect to the gauge at the time of a predetermined operation of the input section.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another example, when the cursor displayed in the cursor display control step reaches the marker, the cursor jumps back to the other end of the moving range and repeats moving in the same direction along the gauge.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The video game program may instruct the computer to further perform a difficulty table storing step (the work memory <b>32</b>). The difficulty table storing step pre-stores, as a difficulty table, a data table defining a numerical difficulty level associated with each shot condition that can be set in the golf game so that each difficulty level reflects that in real golf under the associated shot condition. Then, the marker display control step retrieves, from the difficulty table, a value associated with the shot condition set in the shot condition setting step, and determines the position of the marker based on the retrieved value.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">With respect to the use of the difficulty table storing step, various examples are possible as follows. In a first example, the marker display control step displays the marker at a position closer to the starting position of the cursor for a difficulty level indicated by the retrieved value as higher.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a second example, the difficulty table defines a value for each lie indicating the condition of the ground on which the ball is lying. Then, the shot condition setting step sets at least the lie before a shot as the shot condition. In this case, the marker display control step retrieves, from the difficulty table, a value associated with the lie before a shot, and determines the position of the marker based on the retrieved value. The difficulty table may further define a value for each combination of the lie and the club that can be selected in the golf game. In this case, the shot condition setting step sets at least the combination of the lie before a shot and the club selected for the shot as the shot condition. Then, the marker display control step retrieves, from the difficulty table, a value associated with the combination of the lie before the shot and the selected club, and determines the position of the marker based on the retrieved value.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a third example, the difficulty table defines a value for each environmental factor of a hole played. Then, the shot condition setting step sets at least an environmental factor of a hole currently being played as the shot condition. In this case, the marker display control means retrieves, from the difficulty table, a value associated with the environmental factor of the hole being played, and determines the position of the marker based on the retrieved value.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a fourth example, the video game program stored in the storage medium instructs the computer to further perform a cursor speed calculation step (S<b>31</b>). The cursor speed calculation step calculates the speed of the cursor moving along the gauge. The cursor speed calculation step retrieves, from the difficulty table, a value associated with a shot condition set in the shot condition setting step, and calculates the speed based on the retrieved value. In this case, the cursor display control step moves the cursor along the gauge based on the speed calculated in the cursor speed calculation step.</p>

Then, the shot condition setting step sets at least the combination of the lie before a shot and the character making the shot as the shot condition. In this case, the marker display control step retrieves, from the character table, a value associated with a combination of the lie before the shot and the character making the shot, and determines the position of the marker based on the retrieved value.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At least if the condition of the ground on which the ball is lying at the time the shot is to be taken is a rough or a bunker, the shot condition setting step may set, as the shot condition, the ground condition being a rough or a bunker. Then, the marker display control step may display the marker at a position closer to the starting position of the cursor if the ground condition is a rough or a bunker.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A sixth aspect of an exemplary illustrative embodiment is directed to a storage medium storing a video game program to be executed by a computer for playing a golf game that proceeds in response to a player's operation. The video game program stored in the storage medium instructs the computer to perform a gauge display control step, a cursor display control step, a determination step (S<b>38</b> and S<b>40</b>), a putt condition setting step (S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b> and S<b>19</b>) and a marker display control step. The gauge display control step displays, with a constant length, a gauge used for determining the power for hitting a ball. The cursor display control step displays a cursor moving along the gauge. The determination step determines the power based on the position of the cursor with respect to the gauge at the time of a predetermined operation of an input section by the player.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, at least if the condition of the ground on which the ball is lying at the time the putt is to be taken is a green, the putt condition setting step sets, as the shot condition, the speed at which the ball rolls on the green.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A seventh aspect of an exemplary illustrative embodiment is directed to a storage medium storing a video game program to be executed by a computer for playing a golf game that proceeds in response to a player's operation. The video game program stored in the storage medium instructs the computer to perform a gauge display control step, a filling step, a determination step, a shot condition setting step and a turning point marker display control step (S<b>13</b> and S<b>20</b>). The gauge display control step displays, with a constant length, a gauge used for determining the power for hitting the ball. The filling step gradually fills the inside of the gauge in a predetermined direction. The determination step determines the power based on the position of the front end of the filled area filled in the filling step with respect to the gauge at the time of a predetermined operation of an input section by the player.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A video game system <b>1</b> according to one exemplary illustrative embodiment will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view generally illustrating the video game system <b>1</b>. The exemplary illustrative embodiment will be described below using a home-console type video game device as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the video game system <b>1</b> includes a home-console type video game device (hereinafter referred to simply as a “video game device”) <b>3</b>, which is connected via a connection cable to a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) display (hereinafter referred to as a “TV”) <b>2</b> with loudspeakers <b>2</b><i>a</i>, such as a household television set. The video game device <b>3</b> includes a controller <b>6</b> connected to the video game device <b>3</b> via a connection cable, and an optical disk <b>4</b> as an exemplary storage medium. A selected optical disk <b>4</b> is mounted/dismounted onto/from the video game device <b>3</b>. As necessary, the video game device <b>3</b> can accommodate a memory card <b>5</b>. The memory card <b>5</b> includes a backup memory for static storage of saved data, etc. The video game device <b>3</b> executes a video game program stored in the optical disk <b>4</b> to obtain and display a game image on the TV <b>2</b>. The video game device <b>3</b> can also display a game image on the TV <b>2</b> by recovering the status of a previously-played game based on saved data stored in the memory card <b>5</b>. The player of the video game device <b>3</b> operates the controller <b>6</b> while watching the game image displayed on the TV <b>2</b> to enjoy the play of the game. While a video game program, etc., are recorded on the optical disk <b>4</b> in the present exemplary illustrative embodiment, they may alternatively be provided from a different medium or via a communications line.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described above, the controller <b>6</b> is connected to the video game device <b>3</b> via a connection cable, and the connection cable is detachable from the video game device <b>3</b>. The controller <b>6</b> is an operation means for operating, primarily, a player object appearing in the game space displayed on the TV <b>2</b> (typically, the main character of the game to be operated by the player). The controller <b>6</b> has input sections, including a plurality of operation buttons, a control pad, a control stick, etc. Specifically, the controller <b>6</b> includes grips to be gripped by the player. The controller <b>6</b> also includes a main control stick <b>61</b> and a cross-shaped control pad <b>67</b>, both of which can be operated by the player's left thumb, for example, a C stick <b>68</b>, an A button <b>62</b>, a B button <b>63</b>, an X button <b>64</b>, a Y button <b>65</b> and a start/pause button <b>69</b>, all of which can be operated by the player's right thumb, for example. The controller <b>6</b> also includes an R button <b>66</b><i>a </i>and an L button <b>66</b><i>b</i>, which can be operated respectively by the player's right and left index fingers, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">For example, where the controller <b>6</b> is used to play a golf game to be described below, the main control stick <b>61</b> is operated left or right to change the direction of the shot, and up or down to change the club to be used. The cross-shaped control pad <b>67</b> is operated up, down, left or right to change the ball impact point position for the shot. The A button <b>62</b> is used to determine the shot action of the player object in the game space. For example, the A button <b>62</b> is used to start the shot action, determine the shot power, determine the impact timing, etc. Other input sections, which may also be used during the play of the game, will not be described herein in detail as they are not directly relevant to the description of this exemplary illustrative embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Now, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the configuration of the video game device <b>3</b> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a functional block diagram of the video game device <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the video game device <b>3</b> includes, for example, a 128-bit CPU (Central Processing Unit) <b>31</b> for executing various programs. The CPU <b>31</b> executes a boot program stored in a boot ROM (not shown) and performs various processes such as the initialization of a memory (e.g., a work memory <b>32</b>), after which the CPU <b>31</b> executes a video game program stored in the optical disk <b>4</b> to perform various game processes according to the video game program. Connected to the CPU <b>31</b> via a predetermined bus are the work memory <b>32</b>, a video RAM (VRAM) <b>33</b>, an external memory interface (I/F) <b>34</b>, a controller I/F <b>35</b>, a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) <b>36</b>, and the optical disk drive <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The work memory <b>32</b> is a memory area used by the CPU <b>31</b>. A video game program, etc., necessary for the processing of the CPU <b>31</b> are stored as necessary in the work memory <b>32</b>. For example, the work memory <b>32</b> stores a video game program and various data that are read out by the CPU <b>31</b> from the optical disk <b>4</b>. The video game program, the various data, etc., stored in the work memory <b>32</b> are executed and used by the CPU <b>31</b>. The VRAM <b>33</b> stores data of a game image to be displayed on the TV <b>2</b>. The external memory I/F <b>34</b> communicably connects the video game device <b>3</b> and the memory card <b>5</b> to each other as the memory card <b>5</b> is plugged into a connector (not shown). Then, the CPU <b>31</b> accesses a backup memory in the memory card <b>5</b> via the external memory I/F <b>34</b>. The controller I/F <b>35</b> communicably connects one or more external devices and the video game device <b>3</b> to each other as the external devices are plugged into connectors (not shown). For example, the controller <b>6</b> can be plugged into the connector via a connection cable so as to be connected to the video game device <b>3</b> via the controller I/F <b>35</b>. The GPU <b>36</b>, which may be, for example, a semiconductor chip capable of performing arithmetic operations necessary for 3D graphics display, processes the game image data, which has been processed by the CPU <b>31</b>, and displays the game image on the TV <b>2</b>. The optical disk drive <b>37</b> reads out data from the optical disk <b>4</b> placed in a predetermined read position, and outputs the data to the bus of the video game device <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Now, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an exemplary golf game that is executed by the video game device <b>3</b> according to a golf game program stored in the optical disk <b>4</b> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an exemplary game image <b>20</b> of the golf game to be displayed on the TV <b>2</b> according to the golf game program executed by the video game device <b>3</b>. The game image <b>20</b> is an image of a player object <b>21</b> making a shot as operated by the player, as viewed from behind. Displayed in front of the player object <b>21</b> is an image of the hole being played (hereinafter referred to as a “background image”). The golf game proceeds as the player of the video game device <b>3</b> hits a ball <b>22</b> toward a pin <b>23</b> drawn in the background image.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the present golf game, the player operates the controller to select the club to be used for hitting the ball <b>22</b>, and the power, the direction, the impact point position, the impact timing, etc., of the shot. Then, the shot is reproduced on the screen according to the player's operation of the controller. While the player cannot set the stance of the player object <b>21</b> making a shot in the present exemplary illustrative embodiment, the player may alternatively be allowed to set the stance in other exemplary illustrative embodiments. Shot parameters of the present golf game include pre-shot parameters and in-shot parameters. The pre-shot parameters are parameters that are set by the player before the shot action, and include the club to be used for hitting the ball <b>22</b>, and the direction and the impact point position of the shot. The in-shot parameters are parameters that are determined by the timing of the operation by the player during the shot action, and include the power and the impact timing of the shot. Thereafter in the shot action, the trajectory of the ball <b>22</b> is calculated, and the final position to be reached by the ball <b>22</b> is determined, based on the pre-shot parameters and the in-shot parameters. The pre-shot parameters and the in-shot parameters are displayed against the background image in the form of a power gauge <b>24</b>, an impact point object <b>25</b> and a selected club display object <b>27</b>. For the club selected by the player, the selected club display object <b>27</b> shows the club number and the normal distance of the club. The target direction of the shot set by the player is indicated to the player by moving the background image left and right relative to the player object <b>21</b>. The impact point position on the ball <b>22</b> for the shot set by the player is shown on the impact point object <b>25</b>, which also shows the current lie condition. Thus, the impact point position is shown on the ball-shaped object representing the ball lying on the current lie. The power and the impact timing of the shot, which are determined by the timing of the operation by the player during the shot action, are shown by the power gauge <b>24</b>, more specifically by the cursor movement along the power gauge <b>24</b> to be described below. Moreover, a turning point marker character (hereinafter referred to simply as a “turning point marker”) <b>241</b> is displayed at a predetermined position along the power gauge <b>24</b> depending on the difficulty of the current lie of the ball <b>22</b>, the characteristics of the character being used, etc. The method for displaying the turning point marker <b>241</b> and the position thereof will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Now, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>, the cursor movement along the power gauge <b>24</b> during the shot action of the present golf game will be described. In the present exemplary illustrative embodiment, the player operates an operation button (specifically, the A button <b>62</b>) three times during the shot action. The first operation is the shot action start operation, the second operation is the power determination operation, and the third operation is the impact timing determination operation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating how the cursor moves along the power gauge <b>24</b> if only the shot action start operation is performed during the shot action, i.e., if the A button <b>62</b> is operated only once during the shot action. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating how the cursor moves if the shot action start operation, the power determination operation and the impact timing determination operation are performed during the shot action, i.e., if the A button <b>62</b> is operated three times to perform a complete shot action. Each solid arrow in these figures indicates the movement of a cursor <b>244</b>. Each open arrow in these figures indicates the position of the cursor <b>244</b> along the power gauge <b>24</b> at which the A button <b>62</b> is operated.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, the power gauge <b>24</b> is displayed with its longitudinal axis lying in the left-right direction, and with the cursor <b>244</b> moving left and right along the power gauge <b>24</b>. The turning point marker <b>241</b> is displayed on the power gauge <b>24</b>, and a meet area <b>242</b> is displayed to extend over a predetermined range in the right half of the power gauge <b>24</b>, with a best timing point <b>243</b> being located at the center of the meet area <b>242</b> in the left-right direction. The position along the power gauge <b>24</b> at which the turning point marker <b>241</b> is displayed is defined by marker position data to be described below that takes a value in the range from 0.00 to 1.00. Thus, the turning point marker <b>241</b> is superimposed on the power gauge <b>24</b> at a position according to the marker position data. The marker position data of 0.00 corresponds to the position of the best timing point <b>243</b>, and the value of the marker position data gradually increases as the position moves to the left along the power gauge <b>24</b>, with the marker position data of 1.00 corresponding to the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). These values do not need to be displayed in the game image <b>20</b>. In all of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>, the turning point marker <b>241</b> is shown at an exemplary position that corresponds to the marker position data of 0.80 (i.e., a position 20% away from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>, with 100% being the length from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b> to the best timing point <b>243</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows the power gauge <b>24</b> before the shot action start operation is performed. Before the shot action start operation is performed, the cursor <b>244</b> is standing still with its center being aligned with the best timing point <b>243</b>. In the present golf game, the shot action is started by the player activating the A button <b>62</b> while the cursor <b>244</b> is standing still at the position of the best timing point <b>243</b> (indicated by open arrow At<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Once the shot action start operation is performed, the cursor <b>244</b> starts moving leftward from the best timing point <b>243</b> toward the turning point marker <b>241</b> along the power gauge <b>24</b> at a predetermined speed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Then, as the cursor <b>244</b> reaches the turning point marker <b>241</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>) without the player performing the power determination operation to be described below, the moving direction of the cursor <b>244</b> is reversed at the turning point marker <b>241</b>, after which the cursor <b>244</b> moves rightward at a predetermined speed. Then, as the cursor <b>244</b> reaches the best timing point <b>243</b> of the power gauge <b>24</b> without the player performing the power determination operation, the cursor <b>244</b> stops with its center being aligned with the best timing point <b>243</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>). This is the same state as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> described above. Thus, if only the shot action start operation is performed during a shot action, the process regards the shot action as being incomplete, and waits for the player to perform the shot action start operation again.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Now, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>, how the cursor moves along the power gauge <b>24</b> if the shot action start operation, the power determination operation and the impact timing determination operation are performed during a shot action will be described. The power determination operation and the impact timing determination operation are also performed by the player activating the A button <b>62</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows the power gauge <b>24</b> before the shot action start operation is performed, in the same state as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. Then, the shot action is started by the player activating the A button <b>62</b> (indicated by open arrow At<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Once the shot action start operation is performed, the cursor <b>244</b> starts moving leftward from the best timing point <b>243</b> toward the turning point marker <b>241</b> along the power gauge <b>24</b> at a predetermined speed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). Then, as the player activates the A button <b>62</b> before the cursor <b>244</b> reaches the turning point marker <b>241</b> (indicated by open arrow At<b>2</b>), a shot power is set according to the position of the cursor <b>244</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>), and the cursor <b>244</b> continues to move leftward. Then, as the cursor <b>244</b> reaches the turning point marker <b>241</b> along the power gauge <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>), the moving direction of the cursor <b>244</b> is reversed at the turning point marker <b>241</b>, after which the cursor <b>244</b> moves rightward at a predetermined speed. As indicated above, the power is set according to the position of the cursor <b>244</b>, and a greater power is obtained as the position of the cursor <b>244</b> at the player's activation of the A button <b>62</b> is closer to the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>. However, the cursor <b>244</b> cannot move beyond the turning point marker <b>241</b>. Thus, where the turning point marker <b>241</b> is positioned between the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b> and the best timing point <b>243</b>, 100% of the power available under the situation is obtained if the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> coincides with that of the cursor <b>244</b> at the player's activation of the A button <b>62</b>. As the cursor <b>244</b> moves rightward away from the turning point marker <b>241</b>, the power to be set decreases at a predetermined rate. While the present exemplary non-limiting implementation is directed to a case where the cursor <b>244</b> continues to move leftward after the player activates the A button <b>62</b> before the cursor <b>244</b> reaches the turning point marker <b>241</b>, the moving direction of the cursor <b>244</b> may alternatively be reversed to the rightward direction at the player's activation of the A button <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">If the cursor <b>244</b> reaches the turning point marker <b>241</b> of the power gauge <b>24</b> without the player performing the power determination operation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>), the moving direction of the cursor <b>244</b> is reversed, after which the cursor <b>244</b> moves rightward at a predetermined speed. Then, if the power determination operation is performed during the rightward movement of the cursor <b>244</b>, a shot power is set according to the position of the cursor <b>244</b>, and the cursor <b>244</b> continues to move rightward at a predetermined speed.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The impact timing of the shot is determined by the player activating the A button <b>62</b> again while the cursor <b>244</b> is moving rightward at a predetermined speed after the power determination operation. For example, if the player activates the A button <b>62</b> when the cursor <b>244</b> is at a position within the meet area <b>242</b> (open arrow At<b>3</b>), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>, it is regarded that the ball <b>22</b> is properly struck by the club. If the player activates the A button <b>62</b> when the cursor <b>244</b> is just at the best timing point <b>243</b>, it is regarded that the center of the ball <b>22</b> is struck by the center of the clubface, whereby the ball <b>22</b> will be shown to fly in the shot direction as set before the shot action. If the player activates the A button <b>62</b> when the cursor <b>244</b> is off the best timing point <b>243</b>, the ball <b>22</b> will be shown to fly off the intended trajectory accordingly. For example, if the cursor <b>244</b> is off to the left or right with respect to the best timing point <b>243</b> at the activation of the A button <b>62</b>, the ball <b>22</b> will be shown to slice or hook, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">If the player activates the A button <b>62</b> when the cursor <b>244</b> is outside the meet area <b>242</b> (open arrow At<b>3</b>), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>, or if the cursor <b>244</b> reaches the right end of the power gauge <b>24</b> without the player performing the impact timing determination operation, it is regarded that the ball <b>22</b> is mis-hit, whereby the shot will be shown to be a duffed shot or an air shot.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Now, the impact point object <b>25</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the impact point position and the lie, as indicated by the impact point object <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the impact point object <b>25</b> includes a ball-shaped object <b>251</b>, an impact point position object <b>252</b> indicating the impact point position on the ball <b>22</b> set by the player, and a lie object <b>253</b> indicating the condition of the lie on which the ball <b>22</b> is lying. The player can set the impact point position on the ball <b>22</b> by operating the cross-shaped control pad <b>67</b> before the shot action. There are a total of 49 different impact point positions (7 horizontal positions by 7 vertical positions) on the ball <b>22</b>, from which the player can selectively set an intended impact point position. The impact point object <b>25</b> sets the impact point position as fixed coordinates with respect to the ball object <b>251</b>. For example, an impact point position can be represented by an x coordinate selected from x-3 to x3 (x0 being the center in the horizontal direction) and a y coordinate selected from y-3 to y3 (y0 being the center in the vertical direction). The player can move the impact point position object <b>252</b> discretely through the coordinates x-3 to x3 by operating the cross-shaped control pad <b>67</b> in the horizontal direction, and discretely through the coordinates y-3 to y3 by operating the cross-shaped control pad <b>67</b> in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the shot action, the trajectory of the ball <b>22</b> is changed according to the impact point position set by the player. For example, if the impact point position object <b>252</b> is shifted leftward or rightward relative to the center (x0, y0) of the ball object <b>251</b>, the ball <b>22</b> will have a slice or hook trajectory, respectively. If the impact point position object <b>252</b> is shifted upward or downward relative to the center of the ball object <b>251</b>, the trajectory of the ball <b>22</b> will shift lower or higher, respectively. The degree of shift in the ball trajectory will increase as the impact point position object <b>252</b> is farther away from the center (x0, y0) of the ball object <b>251</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the shot action, the post-landing run of the ball <b>22</b> will also change according to the impact point position set by the player. For example, if the impact point position object <b>252</b> is shifted upward or downward relative to the center (x0, y0) of the ball object <b>251</b>, the run of the ball <b>22</b> will increase or decrease, respectively. The degree of change in the run will increase as the impact point position object <b>252</b> is farther away from the center (x0, y0) of the ball object <b>251</b>. If the impact point position object <b>252</b> is significantly shifted downward relative to the center of the ball object <b>251</b>, the ball <b>22</b> may be shown to land on the ground and then roll backward from the landing position due to backspin.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The impact point object <b>25</b> also includes the lie object <b>253</b> indicating the condition of the lie on which the ball <b>22</b> is lying. For example, the lie object <b>253</b> represents a course terrain (e.g., fairway, rough, bunker, green, etc.). The lie object <b>253</b> also indicates the condition of the terrain on which the ball <b>22</b> is placed (e.g., teed up, divot hole, light/heavy rough, fried egg, etc.). The lie object <b>253</b> can be obtained by referencing terrain data corresponding to the current coordinate position of the ball <b>22</b> in the game space, and selecting an appropriate terrain according to the terrain data. The ball object <b>251</b> is displayed as being placed on the lie object <b>253</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Now, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the shot action process executed by the video game device <b>3</b> of the video game system <b>1</b> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart illustrating the entire shot process executed by the video game device <b>3</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart illustrating the subroutine of the pre-shot setting process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in detail, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flowchart illustrating the subroutine of the power determination process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in detail, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flowchart illustrating the subroutine of the impact timing determination process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As the video game device <b>3</b> is turned ON, the CPU <b>31</b> of the video game device <b>3</b> executes the boot program stored in the boot ROM (not shown), and various units such as the work memory <b>32</b> are initialized. Then, the golf game program stored in the optical disk <b>4</b> is read out into the work memory <b>32</b> via the optical disk drive <b>37</b>, and the golf game program is started. Then, the game space is rendered on the TV <b>2</b> via the GPU <b>36</b>, thereby starting the game.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">First, the player of the video game device <b>3</b> selects a course and a character of the player object <b>21</b> that the player wishes to play with, while watching the game image displayed on the TV <b>2</b>. These selections can be made by the player operating the various input sections provided on the controller <b>6</b>. Then, the game image <b>20</b> is displayed on the TV <b>2</b> according to the course and the character selected by the player (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the process to be executed after the process above.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the CPU <b>31</b> first sets the pre-shot parameters for the hole being played (step S<b>1</b>). Specifically, the CPU <b>31</b> sets the club to be used for hitting the ball <b>22</b>, the direction of the shot, and the impact point position of the shot, which are determined by the player before the shot action.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Then, the CPU <b>31</b> determines the shot power (step S<b>2</b>). The power determination process is performed as follows. As the player activates the A button <b>62</b> while watching, in the game image, the movement of the cursor <b>244</b> along the power gauge <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>), the CPU <b>31</b> determines the shot power according to the position of the cursor <b>244</b> at the player's activation of the A button <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Then, the CPU <b>31</b> determines the impact timing of the shot (step S<b>3</b>). Then, the trajectory and the run of the ball <b>22</b> will be reproduced on the TV <b>2</b> based on the pre-shot parameters set in step S<b>1</b> and the power and the impact timing of the shot determined in step S<b>2</b>. The impact timing determination process is performed as follows. As the player activates the A button <b>62</b> while watching, in the game image, the movement of the cursor <b>244</b> along the power gauge <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>), the CPU <b>31</b> determines the impact timing according to the position of the cursor <b>244</b> at the player's activation of the A button <b>62</b>. After the completion of step S<b>3</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> terminates the shot process. The golf game proceeds as the shot process is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Data to be used in the shot process include the current ball position data, a club table, a trajectory shift table, impact point position data, terrain data, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The ball position data represents, in three-dimensional coordinates, the current position of the ball <b>22</b> in the game space in which the game is being played. The club table defines, for each club-lie combination and for each character, a shot distance and a shot height that is obtained if the ball <b>22</b> is hit with the maximum power. The trajectory shift table defines the degree of shift in the ball trajectory for each combination of the ball striking conditions, including the impact point position, which as described above is set with respect to the center of the ball <b>22</b>, and the impact timing. The terrain data represents the terrain to be reproduced in the game space, indicating the overall undulations of each hole, the lie (e.g., the type of the ground surface), and the presence/absence of an obstruction such as a tree. The terrain data also indicates the influence that each terrain gives upon contact with the ball <b>22</b> (e.g., the rebound coefficient, the decrease in the run, the influence of the angle of slope, etc.). The club table, the trajectory shift table and the terrain data are pre-stored in the optical disk <b>4</b> as a part of the video game program. During the execution of the video game program, the CPU <b>31</b> reads out and stores these data in the work memory <b>32</b> as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The process of setting the pre-shot parameters in step S<b>1</b> will now be described in detail. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the CPU <b>31</b> detects the current lie on which the ball <b>22</b> is lying (step S<b>11</b>). Specifically, the CPU <b>31</b> references the terrain data corresponding to the current coordinate position of the ball <b>22</b> in the game space. Then, the CPU <b>31</b> determines the final lie taking into consideration other parameters such as the ball trajectory of the last shot. For example, the CPU <b>31</b> determines, from the terrain data, the course terrain (e.g., fairway, rough, bunker, green, etc.) and the condition of the terrain on which the ball <b>22</b> is placed (e.g., teed up, divot hole, light/heavy rough, etc.), and determines other parameters dependent on the last shot (how deeply submerged in sand in a bunker, etc.) by using a random number, etc., to determine the final lie.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Then, the CPU <b>31</b> sets the pre-shot parameters to their respective default values based on the remaining distance from the ball <b>22</b> to the pin <b>23</b> and the lie determined in step S<b>11</b> (step S<b>12</b>). For example, the default club is a club that is appropriate for the remaining distance to the pin and the lie (e.g., a driver (1W) for a tee shot at a par 5 hole, a sand wedge (SW) for a bunker shot). The default shot direction is typically the direction from the current position of the ball <b>22</b> toward the pin <b>23</b>. The default impact point position is the center of the ball <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Then, the CPU <b>31</b> calculates the position where the turning point marker <b>241</b> is to be displayed, based on the character making a shot, the lie before the shot (the lie determined in step S<b>11</b>), the club being selected, and the environmental factor of the hole being played (step S<b>13</b>). Thus, shot parameters used in the calculation of the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> include the character making a shot, the lie before the shot, the club being selected, and the environmental factor of the hole being played. Now, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, data tables that are used when the CPU <b>31</b> calculates the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a character table, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a turning point settings table, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a lie-club compatibility table, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows an environmental factor table. These tables are pre-stored in the optical disk <b>4</b> as a part of the video game program. During the execution of the video game program, the CPU <b>31</b> reads out and stores these data in the work memory <b>32</b> as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the character table contains each character that can be selected as the player object <b>21</b> and the associated turning point setting. For example, the character table contains Characters 1, 2, 3, . . . , from which the player can select the character to play with, and Turning Point Settings A, B, C, associated with the characters. Some characters may share the same turning point setting. The turning point setting is involved in the determination of the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> for the associated character. Thus, different characters can be distinguished from each other by the character table. In step S<b>13</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> references the character table to retrieve the turning point setting associated with the character being selected as the player object <b>21</b>. For example, where Character 1 is selected, the CPU <b>31</b> retrieves Turning Point Setting A.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the turning point settings table defines data for determining the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> for each lie and for each turning point setting. Specifically, each data defined in the turning point settings table is a value indicating how far to the left the turning point marker <b>241</b> is to be displayed with respect to the best timing point <b>243</b> along the power gauge <b>24</b>, 0.00 corresponding to the best timing point <b>243</b> and 1.00 corresponding to the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>. Hereinafter, the data will be referred to as “marker position data”. Thus, the turning point marker <b>241</b> is displayed at the best timing point <b>243</b> along the power gauge <b>24</b> if the marker position data is 0.00, and at the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b> if the marker position data is 1.00. For marker position data of 0.50, 0.75 and 0.25, the turning point marker <b>241</b> will be displayed in the middle between the best timing point <b>243</b> and the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>, at a position shifted rightward by ¼ from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>, and at a position shifted leftward by ¼ from the best timing point <b>243</b>, respectively. For example, if the ball <b>22</b> is teed up (i.e., the easiest lie to hit from), the marker position data is set to 1.00. For Turning Point Setting A, the marker position data is set to 0.80 for a “heavy rough” lie, indicating that the turning point marker <b>241</b> will be displayed at a position shifted leftward by 0.80 from the best timing point <b>243</b> for such a lie. Basically, the turning point marker <b>241</b> is displayed farther away from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b> as the difficulty of the lie increases, as with Setting A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. However, the settings may be varied to distinguish various characters from each other. For example, for a turning point setting that is associated with a character with relatively poor golf skills (e.g., Setting B as opposed to Setting A), the turning point marker <b>241</b> may be displayed farther away from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>. Moreover, for a turning point setting that is associated with a character particularly good at hitting from a certain lie, the turning point marker <b>241</b> may be displayed closer to the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b> for that certain lie relative to other turning point settings (for example, Setting C is associated with a character particularly good at hitting from a “bunker”. Thus, with the turning point settings table defining different positions of the turning point marker <b>241</b> for different turning point settings associated with different characters, various characters can be distinguished from each other. The CPU <b>31</b> references the turning point settings table in step S<b>13</b>, and obtains marker position data corresponding to the obtained turning point setting and the lie determined in step S<b>11</b>. For example, where the turning point setting is Setting A and the lie is “light rough”, the CPU <b>31</b> obtains marker position data of 0.90.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the lie-club compatibility table defines, in terms of the marker position data as described above, the compatibility between each club that can be selected by the player and each lie. For example, the marker position data is set to 0.95 for the combination of 3-iron (3I) and “light rough”, indicating that the turning point marker <b>241</b> will be displayed at a position shifted leftward by 0.95 from the best timing point <b>243</b> for such a club-lie combination. The lie-club compatibility table is designed so that the turning point marker <b>241</b> will be displayed closer to (or farther away from) the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b> for a club-lie combination that would be more appropriate (or less appropriate) in real golf. Moreover, the lie-club compatibility table is designed so that, for a difficult lie to hit from, the turning point marker <b>241</b> will be displayed farther away from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b> generally for any club. The CPU <b>31</b> references the lie-club compatibility table in step S<b>13</b>, and obtains marker position data corresponding to the club number set in step S<b>12</b> and the lie determined in step S<b>11</b>. For example, where the club number is 3I and the lie is “light rough”, the CPU <b>31</b> obtains marker position data of 0.95.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the environmental factor table defines, in terms of the marker position data as described above, the relationship between the environmental factor of the hole being played and the difficulty of a shot under the influence of the environmental factor. In the environmental factor table, the marker position data is set to 1.00 for an environmental factor of “daytime-fair” under which one can play most stably. For example, if the environmental factor of the hole being played is “dusk-fair”, the marker position data is 0.90, whereby the turning point marker <b>241</b> is displayed at a position shifted leftward by 0.90 from the best timing point <b>243</b>. The environmental factor table is designed so that the turning point marker <b>241</b> will be displayed farther away from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b> for an environmental factor that would make the shot more difficult in real golf. The CPU <b>31</b> references the environmental factor table in step S<b>13</b>, and obtains marker position data corresponding to the environmental factor of the hole being played. For example, the CPU <b>31</b> obtains marker position data of 0.90 for “dusk-fair”.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In step S<b>13</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> references the character table, the turning point settings table, the lie-club compatibility table and the environmental factor table to obtain respective marker position data values, and multiplies the obtained marker position data values together to obtain the position where the turning point marker <b>241</b> is to be displayed. For example, assume that the player object <b>21</b> being selected is Character 1 (Turning Point Setting A), the lie determined in step S<b>11</b> is “light rough”, the club number set in step S<b>12</b> is 3I, and the environmental factor of the hole being played is “dusk-fair”. Then, the CPU <b>31</b> multiplies together 0.90 (for Setting A-“light rough”), 0.95 (for 3I-“light rough”), and 0.90 (for “dusk-fair”), as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>0.90×0.95×0.90≈0.77.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Thus, the CPU <b>31</b> sets the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> to 0.77.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Then, the CPU <b>31</b> forms a game image based on the resulting parameters from steps S<b>11</b> to S<b>13</b>, and displays the game image on the TV <b>2</b> (step S<b>14</b>). Specifically, the number of the club set in step S<b>12</b> is displayed in the selected club display object <b>27</b>. The target direction of the shot set in step S<b>12</b> is indicated to the player by moving the background image left and right relative to the player object <b>21</b>. The impact point position for the shot set in step S<b>12</b> is indicated to the player by the position of the impact point position object <b>252</b> on the impact point object <b>25</b>. The lie determined in step S<b>111</b> is indicated to the player by the lie object <b>253</b> of the impact point object <b>25</b>. Moreover, the turning point marker <b>241</b> is displayed on the power gauge <b>24</b> based on the marker position data obtained in step S<b>13</b>. Now, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</figref>, the turning point marker <b>241</b> displayed on the power gauge <b>24</b> of the game image <b>20</b> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</figref> are each an example of a portion of the game image <b>20</b>, showing the turning point marker <b>241</b>, which is displayed at a position according to the lie, and the impact point object <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> shows the turning point marker <b>241</b> and the impact point object <b>25</b> for a “tee shot” lie. On a tee shot, the ball is shown to be teed up in the impact point object <b>25</b>, and the turning point marker <b>241</b> is displayed at a position corresponding to marker position data of 1.00. In this case, the turning point marker <b>241</b> is displayed at the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>. A cursor position closer to the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b> indicates more power, as described above, and the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b> typically corresponds to a 100% power. The position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> indicates the maximum power available under the current situation. The power is decreased at a predetermined rate as the cursor position moves rightward away from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>, and the position around the best timing point <b>243</b> typically corresponds to a 0% power.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref> indicate how the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> is shifted from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> for the same club number as the lie changes. The change of the lie is indicated in the impact point object <b>25</b> in these figures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> is for a “light rough” lie. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, the impact point object <b>25</b> shows a ball lying on the lie object <b>253</b> representing a “light rough”, and the turning point marker <b>241</b> is displayed at a 0.80 position, for example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref> is for a “heavy rough” lie. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>, the impact point object <b>25</b> shows a ball lying on the lie object <b>253</b> representing a “heavy rough”, and the turning point marker <b>241</b> is displayed at a 0.65 position, for example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref> is for a “bunker (normal)” lie. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref>, the impact point object <b>25</b> shows a ball lying on the lie object <b>253</b> representing a “bunker”, and the turning point marker <b>241</b> is displayed at a 0.50 position, for example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref> is for a “bunker (fried egg)” lie. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref>, the impact point object <b>25</b> shows a ball submerged in the lie object <b>253</b> representing a “bunker”, and the turning point marker <b>241</b> is displayed at a 0.40 position, for example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref>, the gauge length of the power gauge <b>24</b> is constant in any case.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As indicated above, a cursor position closer to the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b> indicates more power, and the power is decreased at a predetermined rate as the cursor position moves rightward away from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>. The portion of the power gauge <b>24</b> to the left of the turning point marker <b>241</b> is not used for setting the shot power. Therefore, as the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> changes, the player can readily see where the turning point marker <b>241</b> is being currently positioned with respect to the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>. Therefore, the player can readily determine how limited the power available is, and thus how difficult it is to play the current situation. Moreover, the player can readily estimate the influence of the power limitation on the shot distance, and thus to estimate the shot distance available under the current situation.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As indicated above, the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> is where the moving direction of the cursor <b>244</b> is reversed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>). Therefore, as the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> shifts away from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>, the rhythm of the movement of the cursor <b>244</b> changes. Thus, by changing the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b>, it is possible to change the rhythm and the difficulty of the power determination operation and the impact timing determination operation. Specifically, as the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> shifts to the right, the moving direction of the cursor <b>244</b> is reversed more quickly, forcing the player to perform the power determination operation and the impact timing determination operation more quickly, whereby the difficulty of the operation is increased. The difficulty of the power determination operation is increased due to a decrease in the interval from when the cursor <b>244</b> first comes to a desired position along the power gauge <b>24</b> until the cursor <b>244</b> comes back to the desired position after the turn. The difficulty of the impact timing determination operation is increased due to a decrease in the interval between the power determination operation and the impact timing determination operation.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">While the turning point marker <b>241</b> is superimposed on the power gauge <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</figref>, it may alternatively be displayed in other positions such as above or below the power gauge <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</figref> shows a case where an inappropriate club (e.g., a driver (1W)) is selected for a “bunker (normal)” lie. In this case, the turning point marker <b>241</b> is displayed at a 0.10 position, for example. Thus, if an inappropriate club is selected for the current lie, the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> shifts more to the right, further decreasing the maximum power available for the shot and increasing the difficulty of the power determination operation and the impact timing determination operation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15F</figref>, the gauge length of the power gauge <b>24</b> is constant also in this case.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the CPU <b>31</b> determines whether or not the player has changed any of the shot parameters (steps S<b>15</b> to S<b>17</b>). The determination can be made by identifying the input section of the controller <b>6</b> operated by the player. For example, the CPU <b>31</b> determines whether or not the club to be used is changed (step S<b>15</b>) by determining whether or not the main control stick <b>61</b> is operated up or down by the player. Similarly, the CPU <b>31</b> determines whether or not the shot direction is changed (step S<b>16</b>) by determining whether or not the main control stick <b>61</b> is operated left or right, and determines whether or not the impact point position is changed (step S<b>17</b>) by determining whether or not the cross-shaped control pad <b>67</b> is operated up, down, left or right.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">If the CPU <b>31</b> determines in step S<b>15</b> that the club to be used is changed, the CPU <b>31</b> accordingly updates club data, one of the shot parameters (step S<b>19</b>). Then, the CPU <b>31</b> calculates the position where the turning point marker <b>241</b> is to be displayed based on the club number indicated by the updated club data (step S<b>20</b>), and displays, in the game image, the selected club display object <b>27</b> corresponding to the updated club data and the turning point marker <b>241</b> at the newly calculated position (step S<b>21</b>). Then, the CPU <b>31</b> returns to step S<b>15</b> to repeat the process. The calculation of the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> in step S<b>20</b> and the process of displaying the turning point marker <b>241</b> in step S<b>21</b> are similar to step S<b>13</b> and step S<b>14</b>, respectively, and thus will not be further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">If the CPU <b>31</b> determines in step S<b>16</b> that the shot direction is changed, the CPU <b>31</b> updates direction data, one of the shot parameters, and the updated target direction is indicated to the player by moving the background image left and right relative to the player object <b>21</b> (step S<b>22</b>). Then, the CPU <b>31</b> returns to step S<b>15</b> to repeat the process.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">If the CPU <b>31</b> determines in step S<b>17</b> that the impact point position is changed, the CPU <b>31</b> updates impact point position data, one of the shot parameters, and accordingly changes the position of the impact point position object <b>252</b> on the impact point object <b>25</b> (step S<b>23</b>). Then, the CPU <b>31</b> returns to step S<b>15</b> to repeat the process.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">If the CPU <b>31</b> determines through steps S<b>15</b> to S<b>17</b> that none of the shot parameters is changed by the player, the CPU <b>31</b> then determines whether or not the A button <b>62</b> is operated by the player (step S<b>18</b>). If the A button <b>62</b> is not operated by the player, the CPU <b>31</b> returns to step S<b>15</b> to repeat the process. If the CPU <b>31</b> detects the activation of the A button <b>62</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> exits the subroutine of the pre-shot setting process and proceeds to step S<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The power determination process of step S<b>2</b> will now be described in detail. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the CPU <b>31</b> references a cursor speed table to determine the cursor speed corresponding to the lie determined in step S<b>11</b> (step S<b>31</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is an exemplary cursor speed table referenced by the CPU <b>31</b> in step S<b>31</b>. This table is also pre-stored in the optical disk <b>4</b> as a part of the video game program. During the execution of the video game program, the CPU <b>31</b> reads out and stores the table in the work memory <b>32</b> as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the cursor speed table shows the various lies with associated cursor speeds. The cursor speed indicates the speed at which the cursor <b>244</b> moves left and right along the power gauge <b>24</b>, with a cursor speed of a greater value indicating a faster cursor movement. For example, the cursor speed for a “tee shot” lie is the reference speed “1”, and the cursor speed for a “heavy rough” lie is “3”. The cursor speed table is designed so that a higher cursor speed is associated with a lie that is generally considered to be more difficult to hit from. For example, if the lie is determined in step S<b>11</b> to be a “light rough”, the CPU <b>31</b> references the cursor speed table and retrieves the cursor speed “2”. This means that the cursor will move at a speed twice as high as that for a tee shot.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Then, the CPU <b>31</b> starts moving the cursor <b>244</b>, placed within the power gauge <b>24</b>, leftward along the power gauge <b>24</b> (step S<b>32</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>), and waits for the operation of the A button <b>62</b> by the player (step S<b>33</b>). If the A button <b>62</b> is activated by the player, the CPU <b>31</b> proceeds to step S<b>38</b>. Otherwise, the CPU <b>31</b> proceeds to step S<b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In step S<b>34</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> determines whether or not the cursor <b>244</b> has reached the turning point marker <b>241</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>). If the cursor <b>244</b> has not reached the turning point marker <b>241</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> returns to step S<b>32</b> to repeat the process. If the cursor <b>244</b> has reached the turning point marker <b>241</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> reverses the moving direction of the cursor <b>244</b> at the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> so that the cursor <b>244</b> thereafter moves rightward along the power gauge <b>24</b> (step S<b>35</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>), and waits for the operation of the A button <b>62</b> by the player (step S<b>36</b>). If the A button <b>62</b> is activated by the player, the CPU <b>31</b> proceeds to step S<b>40</b>. Otherwise, the CPU <b>31</b> proceeds to step S<b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In step S<b>37</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> determines whether or not the cursor <b>244</b> has reached the best timing point <b>243</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>). If the cursor <b>244</b> has not reached the best timing point <b>243</b> of the power gauge <b>24</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> returns to step S<b>35</b> to repeat the process. If the cursor <b>244</b> has reached the best timing point <b>243</b> of the power gauge <b>24</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> returns to step S<b>15</b> to repeat the pre-shot setting process.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As the turning point marker <b>241</b> is closer to the best timing point <b>243</b> of the power gauge <b>24</b>, and as the cursor speed is higher, the cursor <b>244</b> reaches the turning point marker <b>241</b> (step S<b>34</b>) more quickly, and the cursor <b>244</b>, moving back from the turning point marker <b>241</b>, reaches the best timing point <b>243</b> (step S<b>37</b>) more quickly. As described above, as the current shot is more difficult to play, the turning point marker <b>241</b> is located farther away from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>. Then, it is more difficult for the player to operate the A button <b>62</b> at an intended cursor position in step S<b>33</b> or S<b>36</b>. Thus, the difficulty of a shot is linked with the difficulty of the play of the game.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In step S<b>38</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> determines the power for the shot action based on the position of the cursor <b>244</b> at the player's activation of the A button <b>62</b> in step S<b>33</b> (see open arrow At<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>), and proceeds to the following step. As indicated above, the power is set according to the position of the cursor <b>244</b>, and a greater power is obtained as the position of the cursor <b>244</b> at the player's activation of the A button <b>62</b> is closer to the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>. As the cursor <b>244</b> moves rightward away from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>, the power to be set decreases at a predetermined rate. In the process of step S<b>38</b>, the power determined may be used as it is, or may alternatively be increased or decreased based on a random number value.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Then, after the cursor <b>244</b> reaches the turning point marker <b>241</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> reverses the moving direction of the cursor <b>244</b> so that the cursor <b>244</b> thereafter moves rightward along the power gauge <b>24</b> (step S<b>39</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>). Then, the CPU <b>31</b> exits the subroutine of the power determination process and proceeds to step S<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Also in step S<b>40</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> determines the power for the shot action based on the position of the cursor <b>244</b> at the player's activation of the A button <b>62</b> in step S<b>36</b>, after which the CPU <b>31</b> exits the subroutine of the power determination process and proceeds to step S<b>3</b>. Again, the power is set according to the position of the cursor <b>244</b>, and a greater power is obtained as the position of the cursor <b>244</b> at the player's activation of the A button <b>62</b> is closer to the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>. As the cursor <b>244</b> moves rightward away from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>, the power to be set decreases at a predetermined rate.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The impact timing determination process of step S<b>3</b> will now be described in detail. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the CPU <b>31</b> continues to move the cursor <b>244</b>, placed within the power gauge <b>24</b>, rightward along the power gauge <b>24</b> (step S<b>41</b>), and waits for the operation of the A button <b>62</b> by the player (step S<b>42</b>). If the A button <b>62</b> is activated by the player, the CPU <b>31</b> proceeds to step S<b>45</b>. Otherwise, the CPU <b>31</b> proceeds to step S<b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In step S<b>43</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> determines whether or not the cursor <b>244</b> has reached the right end of the power gauge <b>24</b>. If the cursor <b>244</b> has not reached the right end of the power gauge <b>24</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> returns to step S<b>41</b> to repeat the process. Otherwise, the CPU <b>31</b> proceeds to step S<b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">As the turning point marker <b>241</b> is closer to the right end of the power gauge <b>24</b>, and as the cursor speed is higher, the cursor <b>244</b> reaches the right end of the power gauge <b>24</b> (step S<b>43</b>) more quickly, and the cursor <b>244</b> reaches the best timing point <b>243</b> more quickly. As described above, as the current shot is more difficult to play, the turning point marker <b>241</b> is located farther away from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>. Also in this case, it is more difficult for the player to operate the A button <b>62</b> at an intended cursor position in step S<b>42</b>. Thus, the difficulty of a shot is linked with the difficulty of the play of the game.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In step S<b>45</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> stops the movement of the cursor <b>244</b> along the power gauge <b>24</b>, and determines whether the position at which the cursor <b>244</b> is stopped is within the meet area <b>242</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>) or not (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>) (step S<b>46</b>). If the position at which the cursor <b>244</b> is stopped is within the meet area <b>242</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> proceeds to step S<b>47</b>. Otherwise, the CPU <b>31</b> proceeds to step S<b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In step S<b>47</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> determines the power and the impact timing according to the position at which the cursor <b>244</b> is stopped in step S<b>45</b>. For example, if the cursor <b>244</b> coincides with the best timing point <b>243</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> regards that the center of the ball is struck by the sweet spot of the clubface, whereby the CPU <b>31</b> will perform the shot process with the power as determined in step S<b>38</b> or S<b>40</b> and with the impact point position data as set in the pre-shot setting process. If the cursor <b>244</b> is shifted leftward from the best timing point <b>243</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> regards that the club hits a point on the ball that is shifted leftward by a distance according to the distance between the cursor <b>244</b> and the best timing point <b>243</b>. In this case, the CPU <b>31</b> decreases the power as determined in step S<b>38</b> or S<b>40</b> by a certain amount according to the distance between the cursor <b>244</b> and the best timing point <b>243</b>, and shifts the impact point position as set in the pre-shot setting process leftward by a certain amount according to the distance between the cursor <b>244</b> and the best timing point <b>243</b>. If the cursor <b>244</b> is shifted rightward from the best timing point <b>243</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> regards that the club hits a point on the ball that is shifted rightward by a distance according to the distance between the cursor <b>244</b> and the best timing point <b>243</b>. In this case, the CPU <b>31</b> decreases the power as determined in step S<b>38</b> or S<b>40</b> by a certain amount according to the distance between the cursor <b>244</b> and the best timing point <b>243</b>, and shifts the impact point position as set in the pre-shot setting process rightward by a certain amount according to the distance between the cursor <b>244</b> and the best timing point <b>243</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Then, the CPU <b>31</b> calculates the trajectory data and the run data using the current values of the shot parameters (step S<b>48</b>), and proceeds to step S<b>49</b>. The shot parameter data used by the CPU <b>31</b> in step S<b>48</b> include the current ball position data, the current values of the shot parameters (the club data and the direction data), the power and the impact point position data as determined in step S<b>47</b>, and the terrain data.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The CPU <b>31</b> calculates the shot distance and the shot height corresponding to the selected club and the lie, and calculates the trajectory data, starting from the current coordinate position of the ball, by using the direction data corresponding to the selected target direction and the trajectory shift data corresponding to the determined power data and impact point position data. The CPU <b>31</b> may, in some cases, calculate the trajectory data while varying the trajectory shift data based on a random number value. Then, the CPU <b>31</b> calculates the landing position data, i.e., the coordinates of the final point of the obtained trajectory data. Then, the CPU <b>31</b> calculates the run data based on the terrain data around the landing position based on the landing position data. For example, the CPU <b>31</b> calculates the run data along the terrain from the landing position to the final ball position based on the angle at which the ball trajectory meets the ground at the landing position, the change in the run corresponding to the determined impact point position, and the influence of the terrain data on the ball. The trajectory data and the run data represent, each in terms of a collection of coordinate points in the game space, the calculated trajectory and the calculated run, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In step S<b>44</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> performs a mis-hit process, and proceeds to step S<b>49</b>. For example, the CPU <b>31</b> regards the shot as an air shot, a shot with a very weak contact, or a duffed shot, and calculates the trajectory data and the run data such that the ball does not move at all or rolls to a point near the original ball position.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In step S<b>49</b>, the CPU <b>31</b> reproduces the shot in the game image on the TV <b>2</b>, by showing how the ball is shot from the original ball position, hits the ground, and rolls to the new ball position, based on the trajectory data and the run data calculated in step S<b>48</b> or S<b>44</b>. Then, the CPU <b>31</b> exits the subroutine of the impact timing determination process.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">While the present exemplary illustrative embodiment has been described with respect to a shot process, the exemplary illustrative embodiment can also be applied to a putt process. In such a case, putt parameters determined by the player's operation of the controller include putt direction data and putt power data. Putt conditions include the character making a putt, the type of the putting green grass (“fast green”, “normal green” or “slow green”), etc. Thus, the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> is changed depending on the character making the putt and the type of the putting green grass.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Specifically, a turning point settings table as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, for example, may be used to define the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> for “green” for each turning point setting. For example, a turning point setting associated with a character that is poorer at putting is defined so that the turning point marker <b>241</b> is displayed farther away from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>. Moreover, a lie-club compatibility table as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> may be used to define the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> for each type of putting green grass. For example, a “fast green”, on which putting is more difficult, may be associated with a value such that the turning point marker <b>241</b> is away from the left end of the power gauge <b>24</b>. Note that only a putter can be selected for a putt. The putt operation is performed in a manner similar to that for the shot operation as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>. However, the impact timing determination operation can be omitted in the putt operation. Thus, the first operation of the A button <b>62</b> is the putt action start operation, which initiates the leftward movement of the cursor. The second operation of the A button <b>62</b> is the power determination operation, which determines the power based on the position of the cursor at the time of this operation. Then, the putt process terminates.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">As described above, with the video game device and the associated video game program of an exemplary illustrative embodiment, the position of the turning point marker (i.e., the position at which the moving direction of the cursor along the power gauge is reversed) is changed depending on the situation in the golf game while the gauge length of the power gauge stays constant. The change in the position of the turning point marker is visualized in the game image, whereby the player can readily see the current situation in the golf game by visually checking the position of the turning point marker with respect to the power gauge. Specifically, a cursor position closer to the left end of the power gauge indicates more power, and the power is decreased at a predetermined rate as the cursor position moves rightward away from the left end of the power gauge. The portion of the power gauge to the left of the turning point marker is not used for setting the power. Therefore, as the position of the turning point marker changes, the player can readily see where the turning point marker is being currently positioned with respect to the left end of the power gauge. Therefore, the player can readily determine how limited the power available is under the current situation as compared with the situation where the maximum power is available, and thus how difficult it is to play the current situation. Moreover, the player can readily estimate the influence of the power limitation on the shot distance, and thus to estimate the shot distance available under the current situation. Moreover, changing the limitation on the power depending on the situation can simply be realized without changing the display of the power gauge itself.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Furthermore, changing the limitation on the power also changes the rhythm of the controller operation using the power gauge, thereby enhancing the playability of the game. The position of the turning point marker is changed according to the difficulty of the shot, and the difficulty of the controller operation increases as the position of the turning point marker shifts more to the right. Thus, the difficulty of a shot can be linked with the difficulty of the controller operation. Since various difficulty levels can be set for the controller operation so as to correspond to those in real golf, the player can enjoy a realistic golf experience with such a variety of difficulty levels.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">While the cursor <b>244</b> reverses its moving direction along the power gauge <b>24</b> at the turning point marker <b>241</b> in the present exemplary illustrative embodiment, the present invention is not limited to such a cursor movement pattern. For example, the cursor <b>244</b>, when it reaches the turning point marker <b>241</b>, may alternatively jump back to the right end of the power gauge <b>24</b> to repeat the leftward movement. Also with such a cursor movement pattern, the rhythm of the controller operation changes as the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b> changes. With such a cursor movement pattern, the term “turning point marker” used herein may be replaced with the term “jump back point marker”. As with the turning point marker, the jump back point marker can also be shifted to the right along the power gauge to increase the difficulty of the controller operation by shortening the interval at which the cursor repeatedly passes a particular point along the gauge. Moreover, while the cursor <b>244</b> reverses its moving direction at the turning point marker <b>241</b> in the present exemplary illustrative embodiment, the cursor <b>244</b> may alternatively reverse its moving direction at the power determination operation. Furthermore, the game may alternatively be played only with the power determination operation and without the impact timing determination operation. Even without the impact timing determination operation, the rhythm and difficulty of the power determination operation can be varied by varying the position of the turning point marker <b>241</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">While the power gauge of the present exemplary illustrative embodiment is in an elongated rectangular shape that extends parallel to the long side of the game image, the shape and the orientation of the power gauge are not limited to those of the present exemplary illustrative embodiment. For example, the power gauge may alternatively extend parallel to the short side of the game image, or may alternatively be in a circular shape. Where a circular power gauge is used, the cursor may move along the circumference of the power gauge, and the angular position of the turning point marker can be shifted according to the marker position data as described above to realize effects similar to those of the exemplary illustrative embodiment described above.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">While the current environmental factor is used as one of the parameters for determining the position of the turning point marker in the present exemplary illustrative embodiment, the environmental parameter may be omitted depending on the player's proficiency in the game, etc. For example, the marker position data values in the environmental factor table may be all set to “1.00”, or the environmental parameter may be ignored in the final calculation of the position of turning point marker, to reduce the shift in the position of the turning point marker. While the cursor speed is varied according to the lie condition in the present exemplary illustrative embodiment, the cursor speed may alternatively be fixed to a constant speed depending on the player's proficiency in the game, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">While the input sections used for setting the pre-shot parameters and the in-shot parameters have been described above with specific examples, the input sections are not limited to those described above. It is understood that any type of input sections may be used as long as the various input operations are appropriately assigned to the input sections provided in the video game device for executing the video game program of the present exemplary illustrative embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">While the video game program executed by the video game device of the present exemplary illustrative embodiment has been described to be a golf game, the present exemplary illustrative embodiment may be applied to other video games. Similar effects to those described above can be expected with any type of a video game in which a gauge is used to represent the power with which to move an object, such as a fishing game, a soccer game, and an object throwing game, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">While a home-console type video game device is used in the video game system described above, the video game device is not limited to those of a home-console type. For example, the present exemplary illustrative embodiment can be used with a portable video game device with a plurality of input sections, or a computer system having a general-purpose display section.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">While a power gauge of a type where a cursor moves along the gauge has been described above, the present exemplary illustrative embodiment can be applied to a power gauge of another type where the inside of the gauge is filled gradually. In such a case, instead of moving a cursor from right to left, the power gauge is gradually filled from right to left so that the filled area gradually extends leftward. After the left end of the filled area reaches the turning point marker <b>241</b>, the filled area may be gradually un-filled from left to right, or the filled area may be gradually re-filled in a different color from left to right.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">While the technology herein has been described in connection with exemplary illustrative non-limiting implementations, the invention is not to be limited by the disclosure. The invention is intended to be defined by the claims and to cover all corresponding and equivalent arrangements whether or not specifically disclosed herein.</p>
