<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is related to application Ser. No. 10/419,415 entitled “Communications Jacks Including Test Circuits And Related Circuits And Methods” and filed concurrently herewith. The disclosure of application Ser. No. 10/419,415 is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to communications, and more particularly to test circuits and related methods.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A residence is conventionally wired for telephone service using twisted wire pairs according to the RJ11 standard. The telephone service provider generally provides service to a network interface device (NID) outside the residence, and service for a telephone line is provided using a communications line including one tip conductor and one ring conductor running from the telephone service provider's central office to the network interface device of the residence. Conventionally, the tip and ring conductors comprise twisted wires. Within the residence, a plurality of communications lines run from the network interface device to respective telephone jacks within the residence. Each of these communications lines within the residence includes a tip conductor and a ring conductor. In addition, one or more communications devices, such as telephones, modems, computers, caller identification units, and/or facsimile machines, may be detachably coupled to one or more telephone jacks.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When a residential customer experiences trouble with phone service, the telephone service provider is generally responsible for repairs required outside the residence, and the residential customer is generally responsible for repairs required inside the residence. More particularly, the network interface device is usually the demarcation point with the telephone service provider being responsible for repairs outside the residence to the network interface device, and with the residential customer being responsible for repairs inside the residence to the network interface device. Moreover, regardless of where a problem may exist, the problem should be isolated before a repair can be performed either inside or outside the residence.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A problem outside the residence can be isolated by decoupling the outside communications line from the network interface device and testing the single pair of (tip and ring) conductors. A problem inside the residence, however, may be more difficult to isolate because there are likely to be a plurality of communications lines and communications devices inside the residence, and a failure of any one communications line or device may result in diminished service and/or service failure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When a problem with service occurs, a technician (either independent or from the telephone service provider) may readily have the skills and tools to effectively diagnose and correct the problem. When relying on a technician, however, the customer may have to wait for an available technician delaying restoration of service and/or the customer may incur expense if the problem is inside the residence. Accordingly, a customer may wish to first attempt to isolate and possibly fix the problem before requesting service from a technician to reduce time without service and/or reduce cost. A customer, however, may not have the skills and/or tools to effectively diagnose or fix the problem.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Regardless of who attempts to fix a service problem, once it is determined that the outside line is functioning properly, the inside communications lines and devices should be isolated and tested separately until the problem line and/or device is isolated. Once the problem line and/or device has been isolated, it can be repaired, replaced, or removed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">If the customer attempts to diagnose and repair the problem, customer service personnel of the telephone service provider may be contacted to guide the customer through the process. First, the customer can take a working telephone to the NID and check for a dial tone there to determine if the problem is inside or outside the residence. If a dial tone can be obtained at the NID, the problem is inside. Then all communications devices inside the residence can be unplugged. If a working telephone can obtain a dial tone at each telephone jack, the problem is with one of the communications devices that has been unplugged. The communications devices can then be plugged in individually to determine which device is not functioning properly. Even if the customer manages all of the steps above, many customers may have difficulty diagnosing and fixing a problem that exists with communications lines inside the residence.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to embodiments of the present invention, a communications device may include first and second input terminals configured to provide coupling with respective first and second conductors of a communications line, and first and second signal conductors respectively coupled with the first and second input terminals. A communications circuit may be coupled to the first and second signal conductors wherein the communications circuit provides a communications interface. In addition, a test switch may be configured to electrically couple the first and second signal conductors responsive to activation thereof, and an indicator circuit may be configured to provide indication of a completed electrical circuit through the test switch. In addition, the indicator circuit can be configured to provide indication of a completed electrical circuit through the test switch while the communications circuit is maintained on-hook.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">More particularly, the test switch can be configured to be manually activated, and the indicator circuit can include a battery and at least one light emitting diode electrically coupled in series with the test switch and the communications circuit. The test switch, the battery, and the at least one light emitting diode can be provided on a bridge between the first and second signal conductors so that electrical couplings between the first and second input terminals and the communications circuit through the first and second signal conductors are free of the test switch, the battery, and the at least one light emitting diode. The at least one diode can be visible from a surface of the communications device. In addition, the at least one light emitting diode comprises two parallel connected light emitting diodes connected in opposing directions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The at least one light emitting diode may include at least a first light emitting diode connected along the first signal conductor in series between the first input terminal and the communications circuit. The at least one light emitting diode may include at least a second light emitting diode connected along the second signal conductor in series between the second input terminal and the communications circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, the first and second input terminals can be configured to be coupled to a communications port, such as a communications port according to the RJ11 standard. Moreover, the first and second input terminals can be configured to provide a detachable electrical coupling with respective first and second conductors of a communications port.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The communications circuit may provide a communications interface for at least one of audio telephone communications, facsimile communications, caller identification communications, computer communications, modem communications, alarm system communications, and/or local area network communications. The communications device may also include an isolation switch on the first signal conductor coupled in series between the first input terminal and the test switch wherein the isolation switch is normally closed and wherein the isolation switch is opened responsive to activation thereof.</p>

It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being “connected” or “coupled” to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly connected” or “directly coupled” to another element, there are no intervening elements present.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, communications for a residence may be provided according to embodiments of the present invention by a telephone service provider at a Network Interface Device (NID) <b>21</b> outside the residence. More particularly, the telephone service provider may provide service from a central office <b>23</b> to the NID <b>21</b> over an outside communications line <b>25</b> including a pair of conductors such as tip and ring conductors according to the RJ11 standard. Inside the residence, a plurality of inside communications lines <b>27</b><i>a</i>-<i>i </i>may provide coupling between respective telephone jacks <b>29</b><i>a</i>-<i>i </i>and the NID <b>21</b>. Moreover, each telephone jack may provide a detachable coupling for a communications device, but a communications device does not have to be coupled to every jack. For example, one or more communications devices such as a computer <b>31</b>, telephones <b>33</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, a facsimile machine <b>35</b>, a modem <b>37</b>, a caller identification unit <b>39</b>, an alarm system <b>41</b>, and/or a local area network <b>43</b> may be coupled to one or more respective jacks <b>29</b><i>a</i>-<i>h</i>, and one or more jacks, such as jack <b>29</b><i>i</i>, may be left uncoupled to any communications device.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Residential communications can be provided according to the RJ11 standard wherein the outside communications line <b>25</b> includes a tip conductor and a ring conductor, and wherein each of the inside communications lines <b>27</b><i>a</i>-<i>i </i>includes respective tip and ring conductors coupled to the tip and ring conductors of the outside line through the NID <b>21</b>. Moreover, the tip and ring conductor of each inside communication line <b>27</b><i>a</i>-<i>i </i>can be provided using a twisted pair of wires. Each of the jacks <b>29</b><i>a</i>-<i>i </i>can be provided using a faceplate assembly that can be mounted to a surface such as a wall within the residence. For example, a faceplate assembly may include input terminals configured to receive the tip and ring conductors of an inside communications line on a back surface thereof. A faceplate assembly may also include a communications port on a front surface thereof providing the detachable electrical coupling for a communications device. More particularly, the detachable electrical coupling may include output terminals electrically coupled with the input terminals of the faceplate assembly and providing detachable coupling according to the RJ11 standard. While embodiments of the present invention are discussed with respect to residential wiring, it will be understood that embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in non-residential communications wirings such as communications wirings for commercial, business, governmental, academic, and/or other organizational/business/personal communications operations.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a communications device <b>2101</b> according to embodiments of the present invention may include a test circuit <b>2110</b> used to detect a fault and/or short circuit within the communications device <b>2101</b> and/or in communications lines coupled with the communications device <b>2101</b> through input terminals <b>2111</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. More particularly, the communications device <b>2101</b> may include signal conductors <b>2113</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, such as tip and ring conductors, coupled between input terminals <b>2111</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and communications circuit <b>2115</b> with the test circuit <b>2110</b> coupled along the signal conductors <b>2113</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>between the input terminals <b>2111</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and the communications circuit <b>2115</b>. The resistances <b>2117</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may represent resistances of signal conductors <b>2113</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>of the communications device <b>2101</b>. While the resistances <b>2117</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are illustrated outside the test circuit <b>2110</b>, the resistances <b>2117</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>could alternately be illustrated within the test circuit and/or between the test circuit and output terminals <b>2111</b><i>a</i>-<i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The communications circuit <b>2115</b> may provide a communications interface for operations such as audio telephone communications, facsimile communications, caller identification communications, computer communications, modem communications, alarm system communications, and/or local area network communications. For example, the communications device <b>2101</b> may be at least one of an audio telephone, a facsimile machine, a caller identification unit, a modem, an alarm system, and/or a local area network. In each of these examples, the communications circuit <b>2115</b> performs the communications operations of the communications device with the test circuit providing additional testing functionality. With an alarm system and/or local area network, for example, the communications circuit <b>2115</b> may provide a communications interface allowing the alarm system and/or local area network to communicate over a telephone communications line such as according to the RJ11 standard with the test circuit <b>2110</b> providing additional testing functionality. With a telephone, a facsimile machine, a caller identification unit, and/or a modem, for example, the communications circuit <b>2115</b> may provide the communications interface allowing telephone, facsimile, caller identification, and/or modem operations with the test circuit <b>2110</b> providing additional testing functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The test circuit <b>2110</b> may include at least one indicator circuit <b>2121</b> and a test switch <b>2123</b> which may be normally open. The test switch may provide electrical coupling between the signal conductors <b>2113</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>of the communications device <b>2101</b> responsive to activation (closing) thereof. If an electrical circuit is completed through the test switch <b>2123</b> upon closing the test switch, the indicator circuit <b>2121</b> may provide indication thereof to indicate the presence of a fault and/or short circuit within the communications device <b>2101</b>, between signal conductors <b>2113</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, within communications circuit <b>2115</b>, and/or within communications lines and/or devices coupled with the input terminals <b>2111</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. With respect to communications lines and/or devices coupled with the input terminals <b>2111</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, the test circuit <b>2110</b> may provide indication of faults and/or short circuits within a jack coupled to the input terminals <b>2111</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, within a communications line coupled to the jack, and/or within other communications lines, jacks, and/or communications coupled to the residential wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When testing the telephone communications device alone, the communications device can be decoupled from any communications jacks, lines, and/or devices, and the test switch <b>2123</b> can be activated. Upon activation of the test switch, a fault and/or short circuit within any jack, line, and or communications device coupled through input terminals <b>2111</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may be indicated at the indicator circuit <b>2121</b>. The communications device can be decoupled/isolated from other communication lines, devices, and jacks and retested to determine if the fault and/or short circuit is within the communications device or outside the communications device. If the fault and/or short circuit is indicated when the communications device is decoupled, the fault and/or short circuit is in the communications device which should not be reused until repaired.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Otherwise, the communications device can be coupled to the residential telephone jack, and the test repeated while successively removing components from the residential wiring. For example, the test can be repeated with the communications device coupled to the jack and a respective inside communication line that has been decoupled from the NID. If the test indicates a fault and/or short circuit, the inside communications line and jack can be maintained decoupled from the NID until the fault and/or short circuit is corrected. If the test is clear, the inside communications line can be recoupled to the NID, and all other communications devices can be decoupled from the residential wiring. If a fault and/or short circuit is indicated, the fault and/or short circuit can be isolated to one of the other inside communications lines or jacks. If no fault and/or short circuit is indicated, the test can be performed again as each of the other communications devices is recoupled to the residential wiring, and a single one of the other communications devices may be identified as the source of the fault and/or short circuit. Accordingly, the test circuit <b>2110</b> within communications device <b>2101</b> can be used to identify/isolate a fault and/or short circuit within the communications device, within a portion of a residential wiring, and/or within another communications device coupled to the residential wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Moreover, the communications device <b>2101</b> can be isolated from a residential wiring by decoupling the input terminals <b>2111</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>from a detachable coupling with a telephone jack, such as a jack according to the RJ11 standard. In an alternative, the test circuit may include a normally closed isolation switch along one or both of the signal conductors <b>2113</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>between the respective input terminal <b>2111</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and the test circuit <b>2110</b>. Accordingly, the communications device can be isolated from the residential wiring for testing without unplugging the communications device from the residential wiring by pressing the isolation switch. The isolation switch can be left closed for tests including the residential wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The indicator circuit <b>2121</b>, for example, may include one or more light emitting elements such as light emitting diodes or conventional filament lights and/or an audible indicator. In addition, the indicator circuit may be defined to include an electrical power source such as a battery that can generate a current through the test switch <b>2123</b> and the indicator circuit <b>2121</b> when an electrical circuit is completed on activation of the test switch.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">While test circuits according to embodiments of the present invention have been discussed as components of communications devices, test circuits according to alternate embodiments of the present invention may be used at locations within a residential wiring such as within a jack, within an NID, between an NID and an inside communications line, between an inside communications line and a jack. For example, one test circuit could be included at the NID of a residence for each inside communications line extending therefrom. Accordingly, an inside communications line and a communications device coupled thereto could be isolated and tested at the NID.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When operating in a normal communication mode, the test switch <b>2123</b> is not activated so that the first and second signal conductors <b>2113</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are not coupled through the normally open test switch <b>2123</b>. If an isolation switch is included in the test circuit <b>2110</b>, the isolation switch is maintained in its normally closed position when operating in a normal communications mode. Accordingly, communications signals can be transmitted from input terminals <b>2111</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>over signal conductors <b>2113</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>to the communications circuit <b>2115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to embodiments of the present invention, the communications device <b>2101</b> can be unplugged from external communications wiring (such as unplugged from a communications port and/or jack) so that the input terminals <b>2111</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are not coupled to external wiring. With the communications device <b>2101</b> unplugged, the test switch <b>2123</b> can be pressed by a customer/user/technician thereby coupling the signal conductors <b>2113</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>to test the isolated communications device <b>2101</b> for faults such as short circuits and/or grounds. If a fault such as a short circuit and/or ground is present within the communications device <b>2101</b> during the test, current through the indicator <b>2121</b> may provide indication thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, the indicator circuit <b>2121</b> may include at least one LED and a battery in series with the test switch <b>2123</b> and the communications circuit <b>2115</b>. As discussed above, the communications device can be isolated by unplugging the communications device from external wiring or by using an isolation switch along one or both of the signal conductors <b>2113</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>between the respective input terminal <b>2111</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and the test circuit <b>2110</b>. When testing the isolated communications device “on-hook”, a fault such as a short circuit and/or ground may result in a current flow through the test switch, battery and LED indicator, so that a lit LED indicator indicates the presence of a fault such as a short circuit or ground in the communications device.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The test circuit <b>2110</b> can also be used to test for continuity (opens) within the isolated communications device by testing the communications device “off-hook”. If the indicator does not provide indication of a closed circuit, there may be a continuity problem (an undesired open circuit) within the communications device. In the case of an indicator circuit <b>2121</b> including a battery and an LED, an unlit LED may indicate the presence of a continuity problem (undesired open) when testing “off-hook”. When testing “off-hook” with an indicator circuit including a battery and at least one LED, a lit LED may indicate the absence of a continuity problem (open).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As discussed herein, the terms “on-hook” and “off-hook” refer to conventional telephone operations, wherein the communications circuit <b>2115</b> provides a relatively high resistance between the signal conductors <b>2113</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>when “on-hook” and wherein the communications circuit <b>2115</b> provides a relatively low resistance between the signal conductors <b>2113</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>when “off-hook”. When providing telephone operations, the communications circuit <b>2115</b> is generally “on-hook” when the handset is resting in its cradle awaiting a call, and the communications circuit <b>2115</b> is generally “off-hook” when the handset is lifted from the cradle to receive or place a call. As will be understood, manual operation (such as lifting a handset) is not required to take a communications circuit “on-hook” and “off-hook”. A modem, for example, may transition between “on-hook” and “off-hook” under electronic control. Moreover, a telephone including caller identification may transition from “on-hook” to “off-hook” to identify the caller before the handset is lifted to answer the call.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The indicator circuit <b>2110</b> of the communications device <b>2101</b> can also be used to test communications wiring and/or other communications devices by plugging the communications device <b>2101</b> including test circuit <b>2110</b> into a communications port so that the input terminals <b>2111</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are coupled to the communications wiring. An entrance bridge network within the NID can be used to decouple all of the inside communications lines from the outside communications line to allow testing of inside wiring. For example, the communications device <b>2101</b> can be plugged into a jack to provide coupling with a first inside communications line, and others of the inside communications lines can be coupled to the first inside communications line through the entrance bridge network. By operating the test circuit <b>2110</b> while the communications device <b>2101</b> is coupled to the communications wiring, the communications wiring can be tested for faults and/or short circuits. Moreover, the first inside communications line coupled to the communications device can be tested separately by decoupling the first inside communications line from the other inside communications lines at the entrance bridge network. In addition, others of the communications lines can be tested by individually coupling others of the inside communications lines to the first inside communications line at the entrance bridge network.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, other communications devices can be tested using the test circuit <b>2110</b> of communications device <b>2101</b> by coupling the two communications devices directly or through inside communications lines. Short circuits can be tested in one or both communications devices by keeping the communications devices “on-hook”. Continuity may be tested by taking one or both communications devices “off-hook”.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a communication circuit <b>601</b> according to additional embodiments of the present invention may include a test circuit <b>610</b> used to detect a fault and/or short circuit within the communications device and/or in communications lines coupled with the communications device through input terminals <b>611</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. More particularly, the communications device may include signal conductors <b>613</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, such as tip and ring conductors, coupled between input terminals <b>611</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and communications interface <b>615</b> with the test circuit <b>610</b> coupled along the signal conductors <b>613</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>between the input terminals <b>611</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and the communications circuit <b>615</b>. The resistances <b>617</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>represent resistances of signal conductors <b>613</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>of the communications device. While the resistances <b>617</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are illustrated outside the test circuit <b>610</b>, the resistances <b>617</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>could alternately be illustrated within the test circuit and/or between the test circuit and output terminals <b>611</b><i>a</i>-<i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The communications circuit <b>615</b> may provide a communications interface for operations such as audio telephone communications, facsimile communications, caller identification communications, computer communications, modem communications, alarm system communications, and/or local area network communications.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">While test circuits according to embodiments of the present invention have been discussed as components of communications devices, test circuits according to alternate embodiments of the present invention may be used at locations within a residential wiring such as within a jack, within an NID, between an NID and an inside communications line, between an inside communications line and a jack. For example, one test circuit could be included at the NID of a residence for each inside communications line extending therefrom. Accordingly, an inside communications line and a communications device coupled thereto could be isolated and tested at the NID.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When operating in a normal communication mode, the test switch <b>623</b> is not activated so that the first and second signal conductors <b>613</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are not coupled through the normally open test switch <b>623</b>. If an isolation switch <b>633</b> is included in the test circuit <b>610</b>, the isolation switch <b>633</b> is maintained in its normally closed position when operating in a normal communications mode. Accordingly, communications signals can be transmitted from input terminals <b>611</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>over signal conductors <b>613</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>to the communications circuit <b>615</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to embodiments of the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the communications device <b>601</b> can be unplugged from external communications wiring (such as unplugged from a communications port and/or jack) so that the input terminals <b>611</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are not coupled to external wiring. With the communications device unplugged, the test switch <b>623</b> can be pressed by a customer/user/technician thereby coupling the signal conductors <b>613</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>to test the isolated communications device for faults such as short circuits and/or grounds. If a fault such as a short circuit and/or ground is present within the communications device during the test, current through one or both of the indicators <b>621</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, the battery <b>631</b>, and the test switch <b>623</b> may provide indication thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, each indicator circuit <b>621</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may include at least one LED in series with the communications circuit <b>615</b>, the test switch <b>623</b>, and the battery <b>631</b>. As discussed above, the communications device can be isolated by unplugging the communications device from external wiring or by using isolation switch <b>633</b>. When testing with the isolated communications circuit <b>615</b> “on-hook”, a fault such as a short circuit and/or ground may result in a current flow through the test switch, battery and indicators <b>621</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, so that a lit indicator indicates the presence of a fault such as a short circuit or ground in the communications device (when the indicators each comprise at least one LED).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The test circuit can also be used to test for continuity (opens) within the communications device by testing with the communications circuit <b>615</b> “off-hook”. If the indicator does not provide indication of a closed circuit, there may be a continuity problem (an undesired open circuit) within the communications device. In the case of an indicator circuit including an LED, an unlit LED may indicate the presence of a continuity problem (undesired open) when testing “off-hook”. When testing “off-hook” with an indicator circuit including at least one LED, a lit LED may indicate the absence of a continuity (open) problem (when the indicators each comprise at least one LED).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The test circuit <b>610</b> of the communications device <b>601</b> can also be used to test communications wiring and/or other communications devices by plugging the communications device into a communications port so that the input terminals <b>611</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are coupled to the communications wiring. An entrance bridge network within the NID can be used to decouple all of the inside communications lines from the outside communications line to allow testing of inside wiring. For example, the communications device <b>601</b> can be plugged into a jack to provide coupling with a first inside communications line, and others of the inside communications lines can be coupled to the first inside communications line through the entrance bridge network. By maintaining the test switch <b>623</b> opened and placing the communications circuit “off-hook” while the communications device <b>601</b> is coupled to the communications wiring, the communications wiring can be tested for faults and/or short circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">More particularly, a short circuit in wiring coupled to the input terminals <b>611</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>while the test switch <b>623</b> is open and the communications circuit <b>615</b> is “off-hook” should result in lighting one or both of the indicator circuits <b>621</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>(where the indicator circuits each comprise one or more LEDs). Moreover, the first inside communications line coupled to the communications device can be tested separately by decoupling the first inside communications line from the other inside communications lines at the entrance bridge network. In addition, others of the communications lines can be tested by individually coupling others of the inside communications lines to the first inside communications line at the entrance bridge network.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition, other communications devices can be tested using the test circuit <b>610</b> of communications device <b>601</b> by coupling the two communications devices directly or through inside communications lines. Short circuits in the communications device not including a test circuit can be tested by keeping the other communications devices “on-hook” and taking communications circuit <b>615</b> “off-hook”. A short circuit and/or ground in the other communications device may result in a lighting of one or both indicator circuits (when the indicator circuits comprise LEDs). Continuity may be tested by taking both communications devices “off-hook” and maintaining the test switch <b>623</b> open. If either indicator does not light (where each indicator comprises at least one LED), there may be a continuity problem in one of the communications devices.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a communication circuit <b>701</b> according to additional embodiments of the present invention may include a test circuit <b>710</b> used to detect a fault and/or short circuit within the communications device and/or in communications lines coupled with the communications device through input terminals <b>711</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>.

In each of these examples, the communications circuit <b>715</b> performs the communications operations of the communications device with the test circuit providing additional testing functionality. With an alarm system and/or local area network, for example, the communications circuit <b>715</b> may provide a communications interface allowing the alarm system and/or local area network to communicate over a telephone communications line such as according to the RJ11 standard with the test circuit <b>710</b> providing additional testing functionality. With a telephone, a facsimile machine, a caller identification unit, and/or a modem, for example, the communications circuit <b>715</b> may provide the communications interface allowing telephone, facsimile, caller identification, and/or modem operations with the test circuit <b>710</b> providing additional testing functionality.</p>

While one indicator circuit is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, two or more indicator circuit may be provided in the communications device <b>701</b>.

By providing the battery <b>731</b> in series with the test switch between the signal conductors <b>713</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, drain of the battery <b>731</b> may be reduced when the test switch <b>723</b> is not closed, and the battery <b>731</b> may be removed from the communications signal path.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When testing the telephone communications device alone, the communications device can be decoupled from any communications jacks, lines, and/or devices, and the test switch <b>723</b> can be activated.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Otherwise, the communications device can be coupled to the residential telephone jack, and the test repeated while successively removing components from the residential wiring.

If the test is clear, the inside communications line can be recoupled to the NID, and all other communications devices can be decoupled from the residential wiring. If a fault and/or short circuit is indicated, the fault and/or short circuit can be isolated to one of the other inside communications lines or jacks.
