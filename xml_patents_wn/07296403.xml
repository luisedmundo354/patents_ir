<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to internal combustion engine exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems and more particularly to EGR systems for internal combustion diesel engines having turbochargers and particulate filters.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As is known in the art, future diesel engines will be required to run a lower feedgas NOx level in order to meet emission requirements. One way in aiding this process would be to introduce Low Pressure Exhaust Gas Recirculation (LPEGR). In order to properly use this LPEGR, a portion of exhaust from downstream of the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) is fed back to the compressor of a turbocharger used with the engine. One way to provide such feedback is to use additional exhaust tubing in order to transport the LPEGR from the tailpipe (after the DPF) to the intake (before the turbo charger).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As is also known in the art, many diesel engine vehicles are fitted with a DPF with dual-walled exhaust pipes for maintaining the exhaust temperatures in the exhaust pipes during critical temperature control fluctuations (regenerations of the DPF in cold weather or in rain conditions).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with the present invention, an internal combustion engine exhaust gas recirculation system is provided for an internal combustion engine. The engine is coupled to a turbocharger. A turbine section of the turbocharger is coupled to an exhaust manifold of the engine. A compressor section has an output coupled to an intake manifold of the engine. The exhaust gas aftertreatment system is coupled to an output of the turbine section. The exhaust gas aftertreatment system includes a particulate filter. The particulate filter includes: a housing having an outer wall and an inner wall; a particulate filtering section disposed within the inner wall of the housing; and a channel formed between the inner wall and the outer wall. The channel includes: an inlet disposed downstream of the filtering section for receiving a portion of exhaust gasses exiting the filtering section, and an outlet coupled to an input of the compressor section of the turbine for feeding the portion of exhaust gasses received by the inlet of the channel to an input of the compressor section.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an internal combustion engine <b>12</b>, here a diesel engine, is shown. The engine <b>12</b> is coupled to a turbocharger <b>14</b>. A low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation (LPEGR) system <b>16</b> is provided for recycling after-treated exhaust gases back to the turbocharger. <b>14</b></p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">More particularly, a turbine section <b>18</b> of the turbocharger <b>14</b> is coupled to an exhaust manifold <b>20</b> of the engine <b>12</b>. A compressor section <b>22</b> has an output coupled to an intake manifold <b>24</b> of the engine <b>12</b>. The exhaust gas aftertreatment system <b>16</b> is coupled to an output of the turbine section <b>18</b>. The exhaust gas aftertreatment system <b>16</b> includes a diesel particulate filter (DPF) <b>26</b>. The particulate filter <b>26</b> includes: a housing <b>28</b> having an outer wall <b>30</b> and an inner wall <b>32</b>; a particulate filtering section <b>34</b> disposed within the inner wall <b>32</b> of the housing <b>28</b>; and a channel <b>36</b> formed between the inner wall <b>32</b> and the outer wall <b>30</b>. The channel <b>36</b> includes: an inlet <b>40</b> disposed downstream of the filtering section <b>34</b> for receiving a portion of exhaust gasses <b>50</b><i>a </i>exiting the filtering section <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>); and, an outlet <b>42</b> coupled to an input of the compressor section <b>22</b> of the turbine <b>14</b>, as shown, for feeding the portion of exhaust gasses <b>50</b><i>a </i>received by the inlet <b>40</b> of the channel <b>36</b> to an input of the compressor section <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">More particularly, the exhaust gasses from the engine <b>12</b> flow from the exhaust manifold <b>20</b>, through the turbine portion <b>18</b> of the turbocharger <b>14</b>, down exhaust pipes, passing through any configuration of catalyst required, such as for example the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and then through the DPF <b>28</b> towards the tailpipe, not shown. In the exit cone of the DPF <b>28</b> are several small inlets where exhaust gasses can enter back into the channel <b>36</b>, here for example, a ⅛-¼″ gap in the dual walled housing of in the entire catalyst-DPF canning or housing. From here the vacuum pressure from the turbocharger compressor <b>16</b>, or an auxiliary air pump <b>62</b> may be used to flow the exhaust from the post DPF region (i.e., the region downstream of the particulate filtering section <b>34</b>, through the double walled pipe, i.e., channel <b>36</b>). It is noted that, if necessary, an EGR cooler, not shown, may to be located prior to the re-introduction of EGR into the intake of fresh air located after the air cleaner <b>66</b>. Thus, the after-treated portion of the exhaust gases at the output of the channel <b>36</b> mixes with fresh air from air cleaner <b>66</b> and such mixture is fed to the compressor section of the turbocharger <b>22</b>, as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">At a point where it is convenient to move the gases closer to the intake and away from the exhaust flow, potentially at the turbo charger flange, a tube is formed at the start of the dual-walled portion as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and allows the LPEGR to flow (in a flexible fitting <b>43</b> if required) up to the intake (pre-Turbo compressor). Here, the clean LPEGR can be introduced before the turbo (compressor side) with a regulating valve if required. This LPEGR can then displace even more air in the intake manifold [<b>2</b>], but with a reduced turbo lag and particulate count due to its clean and compressed nature.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A number of embodiments of the invention have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, by changing the location of the DPF to be upstream of any catalytic converters. Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.</p>
