<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Non-provisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(a) on Patent Application No(s). 2003-204764 and 2004-131712 filed in Japan on Jul. 31, 2003 and Apr. 27, 2004 respectively, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a golf club head, more particularly to a joint structure of a metal part made of a metal material and a FRP part made of a fiber reinforced resin.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, golf club heads made of a metal material and fiber reinforced resin have been proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The laid-open Japanese utility model application JP-U5-51374 discloses a club head made of a metal material or a fiber reinforced resin, wherein the crown portion is cut out to form a window which can be either left opened or closed by a cover made of a lower specific gravity material.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The laid-open Japanese patent application JP-P2003-62130A discloses a club head formed by integrating a face component made of a metal material and having a turnback along the edge thereof, and an aft-body made of a plurality of plies of prepreg. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the turnback (a<b>1</b>) of the face component (a) and the front edge portion (b<b>1</b>) of the aft-body (b) are spliced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a golf club head having such a spliced structure, the spliced portion is subjected to a large sharing force as the face portion receives a large impact force, and the bonded surface is very liable to come unstuck. This is especially true in case of a large-sized hollow golf club head such as wood-type golf club heads because the wall thickness is thin and thus deformation at impact is relatively large.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a golf club head, in which the joint portion is increased in the strength, and thereby the durability of the club head is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present invention, a hollow golf club head is composed of a metal part made of at least one kind of metal material and a FRP part made of a fiber reinforced resin, the metal part having a first lap joint part, and the FRP part having a second lap joint part being lap-jointed with the first lap joint part, wherein one of the first lap joint part and second lap joint part is provided with at least one securing hole, and the other is provided with at least one protrusion engaging with the at least one securing hole.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, the strength of the lap joint is greatly increased by the mechanical engaging force between the securing hole and protrusion in addition to the bonding force which will be generated between the surface of the metal part and the surface of the FRP part by means of an adhesive agent, welding (melting) of the matrix resin or the like. Thus, the durability of the club head can be improved, and a further decrease in the material thickness becomes possible which will lead to not only a weight reduction but also a possibility of a large elastic deformation at impact to improve the rebound performance.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the drawings, club head <b>1</b> according to the present invention is a wood-type club head such as #1 driver and fairway wood. The club head <b>1</b> comprises: a face portion <b>3</b> whose front face defines a club face <b>2</b> for striking a ball; a crown portion <b>4</b> intersecting the club face <b>2</b> at the upper edge <b>2</b><i>a </i>thereof; a sole portion <b>5</b> intersecting the club face <b>2</b> at the lower edge <b>2</b><i>b </i>thereof; a side portion <b>6</b> between the crown portion <b>4</b> and sole portion <b>5</b> which extends from a toe-side edge <b>2</b><i>t </i>to a heel-side edge <b>2</b><i>e </i>of the club face <b>2</b> through the back face of the club head; and a neck portion <b>7</b> to be attached to an end of a club shaft (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The volume of the club head <b>1</b> is set in a range of not less than 300 cc, preferably not less than 350 cc, more preferably 350 to 600 cc, still more preferably 370 to 550 cc. The head <b>1</b> has a cavity (i) immediately behind the face portion <b>3</b>, and in the following embodiments, the cavity (i) is left void although it is also possible to fill it with a light-weight material such as foamed plastic, foamed rubber or the like. The combination of such a large head volume and hollow structure can improve the ball hitting sound because it can enhance high-frequency components of the ball hitting sound, and prolong the reverberation time of such enhanced sound.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, when the head volume of more than 300 cc, the depth GL of the center of gravity is preferably set in the range of not less than 35 mm, preferably not less than 37 mm, more preferably not less than 38 mm, but not more than 43 mm. The height GH of the center of gravity G is preferably set in the range of not less than 25 mm, but not more than 35 mm, preferably not more than 32 mm, more preferably not more than 30 mm. In case of a club head all made of metal material(s), it is very difficult to make a club head having such specifications, while achieving practical durability. However, according to the present invention, it is easy to make such a golf club head. By setting the depth GL of the center of gravity more than 35 mm, the sweet spot area of the head is remarkably increased, and the directionality may be improved. Further, as the height GH of the center of gravity is low, it becomes easer to decrease the backspin and to increase the launching angle of the ball and thereby to obtain an ideal ballistic course.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the depth GL of the center of gravity G is the horizontal distance between the center of gravity G and the leading edge LE of the head <b>1</b> measured in the standard state. The standard state is such that the club head is set on a horizontal plane HP satisfying its lie angle and loft angle. The height GH of the center of gravity G (or sweet spot height) is a vertical height GH measured from the horizontal plane HP to the sweet spot SS in the standard state. The sweet spot SS is defined as a point at which a straight line drawn normally to the club face <b>2</b> from the center of gravity G intersects the club face <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The club head <b>1</b> is composed of a metal part M<b>1</b> and a FRP part M<b>2</b> attached to the metal part M<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The metal part M<b>1</b> comprises a face wall <b>9</b>, a sole wall <b>10</b> and a side wall <b>11</b> forming at least part of the face portion <b>3</b>, sole portion <b>5</b> and side portion <b>6</b>, respectively, and the neck portion <b>7</b>, whereby its top is opened and the metal part M<b>1</b> has an opening O<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The metal part M<b>1</b> is made of at least one kind of metal material having a large specific tensile strength. For example, titanium alloys such as alpha+beta titanium alloys and beta titanium alloys are preferred. Specifically, Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-4.5Al-3V-2Fe-2Mo, Ti-2Mo-1.6V-0.5Fe-4.5Al-0.3Si-0.03C, Ti-15V-3Cr-3Al-3Sn, Ti-15Mo-5Zr-3Al, Ti-15Mo-5Zr-4Al-4V, Ti-15V-6Cr-4Al, Ti-20V-4Al-1Sn and the like can be preferably used. However, aside from titanium alloys, various metal materials, e.g. aluminum alloy, pure titanium, stainless steel and the like can be used. The metal part M<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</figref> is formed as a casting of a metal material, e.g. Ti-6Al-4V, utilizing a lost-wax precision casting method.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The face wall <b>9</b> is to form at least 60% of the club face <b>2</b> in area, also forming the entire thickness from the club face <b>2</b> to the back face <b>2</b>B. In this example, in view of the durability and high-pitched hitting sound, the face wall <b>9</b> forms substantially 100% of the club face <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The thickness of the face wall <b>9</b> or face portion <b>3</b> can be a substantially constant value.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The crown joint part <b>20</b> and side joint part <b>21</b> are sunken from the adjacent outer surface through a step corresponding to the thickness of the FRP part M<b>2</b> so that the outer surface of the FRP part M<b>2</b> becomes flush with the outer surface of the metal part M<b>1</b> at the boundary therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows another example of the metal part M<b>1</b>. In this example, the metal part M<b>1</b> is composed of the above-mentioned face wall <b>9</b> (face portion <b>3</b>), sole wall <b>10</b> (sole portion <b>5</b>), side wall <b>11</b> (side portion <b>6</b>) and neck portion <b>7</b>, and further a periphery part of the crown portion <b>4</b>, whereby this metal part M<b>1</b> has an opening O<b>1</b> within the crown portion <b>4</b>. The first lap joint part F<b>1</b> is circularly formed around the opening O<b>1</b> within the crown portion <b>4</b>, namely, as described above, it is made up of a crown joint part <b>20</b> only.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">If the crown joint part <b>20</b> is too narrow in width, the bonding strength to the FRP part M<b>2</b> becomes insufficient.

Therefore, the width L<b>1</b> is set in the range of not less than 5.0 mm, preferably not less than 8.0 mm, more preferably not less than 12.0 mm, but not more than 25.0 mm, preferably not more than 20.0 mm. Here, the width L<b>1</b> is a minimum distance across the objective part.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-7</figref>, the width L<b>1</b> is almost constant in a part along the face wall <b>9</b>, but, in a part along the side wall <b>11</b>, the width gradually decreases towards the backside as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the width L<b>1</b> is almost constant along the entire circumference.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In order to engage with the undermentioned protrusions <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the FRP part M<b>2</b>, the first lap joint part F<b>1</b> of the metal part M<b>1</b> is provided with a plurality of securing holes <b>8</b><i>a</i>. The securing hole <b>8</b><i>b </i>is preferably a through-hole, and usually a circular hole as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">However, all or some of the securing holes <b>8</b><i>b </i>may be a blind hole having a closed inner end as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In view of securing or engaging force, the depth of such a blind hole is set to be not less than 0.5 mm, preferably more than 0.8 mm. The upper limit therefor depends on the thickness of the first lap joint part F<b>1</b>. Therefore, to prevent thickening of the lap joint, the depth is limited to under about 2.0 mm, preferably under 1.5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In cases of blind hole, it may be formed in a shape of a groove extending continuously or discontinuously along the edge of the opening O<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shown an example wherein relatively narrow grooves (blind holes <b>8</b><i>b</i>) are disposed parallel with each other.</p>

In anyway, by making the securing holes in the first lap joint part of the metal part, the corresponding weight reduction is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As described above, as the face portion is made of a metal material, the ball hitting sound becomes a high-pitched sound, and by the large head volume and hollow structure, the reverberation time thereof is prolonged. Thus the club head can give an impression of good shot to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The above-mentioned FRP part M<b>2</b> is to cover the above-mentioned opening O<b>1</b> of the metal part M<b>1</b>. Thus, the FRP part M<b>2</b> has a crown wall <b>12</b> which forms the almost entirety of the surface of the crown portion <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the FRP part M<b>2</b> is provided with a flange <b>13</b> which forms the surface of an upper part of the side portion <b>6</b>. Thus, the flange <b>13</b> extends downward from the edge of the crown wall <b>12</b> excluding the front edge and neck portion, thus it extends continuously from the toe to the heel. In order to keep out of the neck portion <b>7</b>, the crown wall <b>12</b> is provided with a cutout whose plan view corresponds to about one-third of a circle.</p>

Here, the tensile modulus of elasticity is measured according to Japanese Industrial standard R 7601-1986 “Testing methods for carbon fibers”.
</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The fibers in the FRP part M<b>2</b> may be oriented toward one direction or dispersed in the resin in random orientation. But, in this example, the fibers are oriented toward orthogonal directions. As to the resin, various resins can be used. In this example, a thermosetting resin such as epoxy resin is used.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The thickness Tf of the crown wall <b>12</b> is set in the range of not less than 0.2 mm, preferably not less than 0.5 mm, more preferably not less than 0.8 mm, but not more than 3.0 mm, preferably not more than 2.5 mm, more preferably not more than 2.0 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The thickness Te of the flange <b>13</b> is set in the range of not less than 0.2 mm, preferably not less than 0.5 mm more preferably not less than 0.7 mm, but not more than 2.0 mm, preferably not more than 1.5 mm, more preferably not more than 1.2 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The FRP part M<b>2</b> is provided with a second lap joint part F<b>2</b> which makes a lap joint, together with the first lap joint part F<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-7</figref>, the second lap joint part F<b>2</b> includes a front portion, toe-side portion and heel-side portion of the crown wall <b>12</b> as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in imaginary line, and the flange <b>13</b>. Thus, on the toe-side and heel-side of the head, the lap joint <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> bridges between the crown portion <b>4</b> and side portion <b>6</b>. Such a bridging part can increase the joint strength and the strength of the FRP part.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the second lap joint part F<b>2</b> is a circular periphery portion of the crown wall <b>12</b> as indicated in imaginary line.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The second lap joint part F<b>2</b> is provided with protrusions <b>8</b><i>b</i>. In order that the protrusions <b>8</b><i>b </i>can fit to the above-mentioned securing holes <b>8</b><i>a </i>provided on the first lap joint part F<b>1</b>, the positions and shapes thereof are so determined.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In order to make the FRP part M<b>2</b>, a molding method using prepregs can be employed, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>13</b>(<i>b</i>). Firstly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(</figref><i>a</i>), prepregs P are applied to the outer surface of an inflatable bladder B made of for example rubber or alternatively to the inner surface of the mold Md. The bladder is set in a mold Md, and inflated to press the prepregs onto the inside of the mold. The mold Md is heated to harden the resin. After hardened, the prepregs are demolded, and unnecessary part is trimmed, and according to need, protrusions <b>8</b><i>b </i>and/or holes <b>8</b><i>a </i>are formed in the second lap joint part F<b>2</b> by bonding the protrusions with hot-melt adhesive for example, drilling the holes <b>8</b><i>a </i>and the like. In view of variation of the thickness or an intended change (design change) in the thickness, the use of the bladder B is preferred because of its higher compatibility.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The prepreg P is as well known in the art a combination of continuous reinforcing fibers that are preimpregnated with a thermoset or thermoplastic organic resin matrix. In this example, epoxy resin is used as a matrix resin. The fibers in a prepreg P may be oriented toward one direction or orthogonal directions. The prepreg is cut into a specific shape. By laying predetermined number of prepreg sheets one on top of another to have a required thickness, the prepregs are shaped into a specific shape, and the matrix resin is hardened. In case of unidirectional orientation, prepregs P are arranged such that the fibers in a prepreg cross those in the adjacent prepreg. Preferably, the resin content is set in a range of about 20 to 25%.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Here, the resin content is a percentage of the weight of the resin component to the overall weight of the object. The resin content can be obtained as follows. To separate the fibers, the resin matrix is removed from the measuring object by chemically dissolving the resin matrix only. If the measuring object is uncured prepreg, as the chemical, for example methyl ethyl ketone may be used. If the measuring object is a cured FRP material, for example hot nitric acid may be used. Then by subtracting the weight of the fibers from the total weight of the measuring object, the weight of the resin matrix can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition to the methods using prepregs, an injection molding method using a fluid compound material of short fibers, a resin matrix and additives can be employed to eliminate the need to form the protrusion <b>8</b><i>b </i>in separate operation.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">After the FRP part M<b>2</b> and the metal part M<b>1</b> are made as discrete parts, they are assembled by lap jointing the first and second lap joint parts F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> with applying an adhesive agent to therebetween and inserting the protrusions <b>8</b><i>b </i>into the securing holes <b>8</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">If the holes <b>8</b><i>a </i>and protrusion <b>8</b><i>b </i>are too small, it is difficult to improve the shearing strength of the lap joint. If too large, the bonding area of the lap joint becomes decreased and it is difficult to obtain necessary strength and durability. Therefore, the maximum diameter D of the hole <b>8</b><i>a </i>and protrusion <b>8</b><i>b </i>is preferably set in the range of not less than 2.0 mm, more preferably not less than 3.0 mm, but not more than 8.0 mm, more preferably not more than 5.0 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition to a circle, the holes <b>8</b><i>a </i>and protrusions <b>8</b><i>b </i>can be formed in a shape of an ellipse, elongated circle, polygon and the like. Thus, in case of not round shape, it is preferable to limit the hole in terms of the volume, instead of the diameter D. The volume of a hole <b>8</b><i>a </i>is set in a range of not less than 1.5 cu.mm, preferably not less than 5.6 cu.mm, but not more than 102.0 cu.mm, preferably not more than 30.0 cu.mm. Also it is preferable that the percentage of the total area S<b>1</b> of all the holes <b>8</b><i>a </i>to the overall area S of the lap joint part F<b>1</b> or F<b>2</b> including the total area S<b>1</b> is set in the range of not less than 20%, preferably not less than 30%, but not more than 70%, preferably not more than 60%. As a result, a balance between the adhesion force by the adhesive agent and the mechanical engaging force by the protrusion <b>8</b><i>b </i>and holes <b>8</b><i>a </i>can be achieved, and the strength of the joint can be remarkably increased.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Reversely to the above examples, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, it is possible to form the holes <b>8</b><i>a </i>on the second lap joint part F<b>2</b>, and the protrusions <b>8</b><i>b </i>on the first lap joint part F<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Further, it is possible to form both of the holes <b>8</b><i>a </i>and protrusions <b>8</b><i>b </i>on each of the first and second lap joint parts F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in imaginary line, a retainer <b>8</b><i>c </i>larger than the hole <b>8</b><i>a </i>may be formed at the end of the protrusion <b>8</b><i>b </i>in order to increase the resistance to pulling-out.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a modification of the above-mentioned second lap joint part F<b>2</b> which may be adopted in every type of FRP part M<b>2</b>, but preferably combined with the first lap joint part F<b>1</b> with the through-hole type securing holes <b>8</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this example, the second lap joint part F<b>2</b> is two-forked in the cross section, namely, this part F<b>2</b> is provided with an inner lip F<b>2</b><i>i </i>which is positioned on the inside of the first lap joint part F<b>1</b>, and thus the first lap joint part F<b>1</b> is held between the inner lip F<b>2</b><i>i </i>and the outside part F<b>2</b><i>o </i>on the outside of the first lap joint part F<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When this two-forked type second lap joint part F<b>2</b> is formed on the above-mentioned discrete-type FRP part M<b>2</b>, it is preferable that the outside part F<b>2</b><i>o </i>is provided with downwardly or inwardly protruding outer protrusions <b>8</b><i>bo</i>, and the inner lip F<b>2</b><i>i </i>is provided with upwardly or outwardly protruding inner protrusions <b>8</b><i>bi</i>. In the respective securing holes <b>8</b><i>a</i>, the outer protrusions <b>8</b><i>bo </i>confront with the respective inner protrusions <b>8</b><i>bi</i>, and they are bonded each other.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the above description, the FRP part M<b>2</b> is first formed separately from the metal part M<b>1</b>, and they are integrated by bonding the lap joint parts F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It is however, also possible to do the formation of the FRP part M<b>2</b> and its integration with the metal part M<b>1</b> concurrently within a mold as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Firstly, the metal part M<b>1</b> is made, wherein a through hole O<b>3</b> which is utilized to insert a bladder B into the hollow (i) of the metal part M<b>1</b> is provided in an appropriate position, for example, in the side wall <b>11</b> on the toe side as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> in full line and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> in imaginary line.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Then, an inside prepreg Pi is applied to the inner surface of the first lap joint part F<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. In this example, the inside prepreg Pi is a sheet having such a size and shape being capable of completely covering the opening O<b>1</b>. The peripheral part of the inside prepreg Pi is temporarily fixed to the inside of the first lap joint part F<b>1</b>, using the adhesive agent <b>16</b>. To apply and locate the inside prepreg Pi accurately, a rod, lever or the like inserted in the through hole O<b>3</b> can be used. Instead, an inflatable bladder inserted into the hollow (i) can be used to press the inside prepreg Pi onto the first lap joint part F<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">On the outside of the inside prepreg Pi, an outside prepreg Po is applied to the outer surface of the first lap joint part F<b>1</b> so as to completely cover the opening O<b>1</b>. The outside prepreg Po is a single sheet having a size and shape being capable of completely covering the opening O<b>1</b>. Between the peripheral part of the outside prepreg Pi and the outer surface of the first lap joint part F<b>1</b>, an adhesive agent <b>17</b> is again used to temporarily fix each other.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this example, between the inside prepreg Pi and outside prepreg Po, an adhesive agent is not used. But, if need be, it is possible to use an adhesive agent.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">For the adhesive agents <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, those having superior adhesiveness between the metal material of the metal part M<b>1</b> and the matrix resin in the inside and outside prepreg Pi and Po, for example, heat-hardening adhesive agents such as epoxy resin adhesives are preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the metal part M<b>1</b> and prepreg Pi and Po are set in a split mold <b>18</b> which comprises for example a upper piece <b>18</b><i>a </i>and a lower piece <b>18</b><i>b</i>. In the mold <b>18</b>, the prepregs Po and Pi are heated up to a temperature enough to make plastic deformation, a highly expandable bladder B which is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> put in the hollow (i) through the through hole O<b>3</b> is inflated by a high-pressure high-temperature gas or steam as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Thus, the expanded bladder B compress the inside prepreg Pi and outside prepreg Po between the surface of the bladder B and the molding face <b>19</b> or inner surface of the mold <b>18</b><i>a</i>. AS the matrix resin in the prepregs Pi, Po is in a plasticized state, the resin flows to fit to the first lap joint part F<b>1</b> of the metal part M<b>1</b>, and the resin flows into the securing holes <b>8</b><i>b </i>and is hardened to form the protrusions <b>8</b><i>b</i>. The matrix resins of the directly contacting inside and outside prepreg Pi and Po are merged and hardened. Thus, they are strongly adhered with each other or integrated.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">For that purpose, the content of the resin in each prepreg, namely, that in the FRP part M<b>2</b> is set in the range of not less than 15%, preferably not less than 20%, but not more than 35%, preferably not more than 30%, more preferably not more than 25% when the matrix resins is fully hardened, the bladder B is deflated and pulled out from the hollow (i). The club head <b>1</b> is demolded. The through hole O<b>3</b> is patched to close.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">By the method of molding and integrating a FRP part, the bonding strength between the metal part M<b>1</b> and FRP part M<b>2</b> and the durability can be greatly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">This method can be employed to make the FRP part M<b>2</b> without the inner lip F<b>2</b><i>i </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9 to 12</figref>. In such a case, the inside prepreg Pi is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows another example of the inside prepreg Pi, which is a plurality of relatively short tapes which are applied along the edge of the opening O<b>1</b> so that for example, its half width protrudes into the opening O<b>1</b>. Thus, the opening O<b>1</b> is not closed completely. Accordingly, using the remaining opening part O<b>1</b><i>r</i>, the inside prepreg Pi can be easily applied to the inside of the first lap joint part F<b>1</b>. Aside from the tapes having two ends, the inside prepreg Pi in a form of endless ring may be also used.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the above examples, the metal part M<b>1</b> is made of one kind of a metal material, and formed as an integral part. But, it is possible to use two or more kinds of metal materials, and the metal part M<b>1</b> can be formed by assembling two or more parts which are formed by suitable methods, e.g. casting, forging, pressing, rolling, cutting and the like. As a modification of the above-described metal part M<b>1</b>, it can be made of two or more metal materials having different specific gravity. For example, the sole wall <b>10</b> may be formed of a different metal material having a larger specific gravity than the other portion.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows such a modification of the metal part M<b>1</b> similar to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> example, wherein, in stead of the above-mentioned integrated face wall <b>9</b>, a separate face plate (not shown) is used to form the face portion <b>3</b>, and thus a front opening O<b>4</b> which is closed by the attached face plate is formed. Therefore, this front opening O<b>4</b> can be used to apply the inside prepreg Pi and to insert the bladder B, and thus there is no need to make the above-mentioned opening O<b>3</b>. In this example, the metal part M<b>1</b> is formed as a casting of a metal material similarly to the former examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</figref>. But, the face plate is formed by forging a titanium alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the above embodiments, as described above, as the specific gravity of the FRP part M<b>2</b> is smaller than the metal part, the weight of the club head can be reduced to redistribute the reduced weight to the sole portion <b>5</b> and/or side portion <b>6</b> for example. Accordingly, the design freedom is greatly increased which makes it possible to lower and deepen the center of gravity and to increase the moment of inertia of a relatively large-sized hollow club head.</p>
