<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to French Patent Application No. 04 52405, filed Oct. 22, 2004, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a photoelectric detector that includes a member for emitting a light signal and a member for receiving a reflected light signal. The photoelectric detector outputs information indicative of the presence of a target to be detected or a distance to the target to be detected along a path of the light signal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Photoelectric detection devices are well known and can usually be divided into two categories. The first category includes systems that are called thru-beam type systems. The emit member and the receive member of these devices are placed at two points distanced apart and the target is detected when the target crosses a light signal between these two points. In the second category, the emit member and the receive member of the device are generally placed in the same casing. This second category includes systems that are called reflex systems (which may or may not use polarized light), in which a remote reflector can reflect the emitted light signal to the receive member in the absence of a target. Also, the second category includes systems that are called proximity systems (with or without background elimination) that operate using the diffuse reflection of the emitted light signal off the target to be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the second category, the emit and receive members are therefore very close to each other, in particular in the case of small photoelectric detectors. It is therefore necessary to prevent the phenomenon of crosstalk, i.e., the risk that might arise when the incoming and outgoing light rays become interchanged, which would greatly impair the reliability of the output information from the detector. Moreover, a photoelectric detector often includes lenses placed in front of the emit and receive members in order to improve their sensitivity and their performance and these lenses also increase the risk of crosstalk. Likewise, slight positioning discrepancies between the various members of the detector and a dispersion in the tolerance values from one manufacturing batch to another may increase the crosstalk phenomenon.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one aspect of the present invention a simple and inexpensive photoelectric detector is provided that makes possible for the incoming and outgoing light rays of the photoelectric detector to be satisfactorily isolated from each other within a small space. According to another aspect of the present invention it is possible to position the various elements of the detector with respect to one another to be effective and reliable, and easily reproducible on an industrial scale over time, so as to ensure a correct operation of the manufactured detectors.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One embodiment of the present invention describes a photoelectric detector that includes an electronic card, to which an emit member that emits at least a first light signal and a receive member that receives at least a second light signal reflected by the first light signal are fixed, and a cap that incorporates an emit lens and a receive lens made of translucent material and positioned in front of the emit member and the receive member, respectively. According to the embodiment of the present invention, the card and the cap are fixed to a fixing support made of an opaque material, the support having a protruding central blade that is inserted into a separating slot in the cap, between the emit lens and the receive lens.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another embodiment of the present invention, the support has a transverse base perpendicular to the central blade and includes a unit for fixing the electronic card. The central blade includes snap-fastening elements that cooperate with complementary elements on the cap in order to fix the cap to the support.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another embodiment of the present invention, the detector includes a translucent cover positioned over the emit and receive lenses, and the cover includes polarizing filters for the emitted and received light signals and the cover seals the slot in the cap.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a photoelectric detector, also called a photoelectric cell, includes an emit member <b>12</b> capable of emitting at least a first light signal in a direction approximately parallel to the longitudinal axis X of the detector, and a receive member <b>14</b> capable of receiving at least a second light signal. The received second light signal originates from the reflection of the emitted first light signal off a reflector or off a target (not shown) to be detected, depending on the use of the detector. The receive member <b>14</b> is provided with at least one photoreceptive component that can deliver an electrical signal representative of the second light signal.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The detector can operate either in a reflex detector mode or in a proximity detector mode. It can also operate in both of these modes. To do so, the emit member <b>12</b> may include a photoemissive component capable of emitting a light signal whose wavelength lies within the red spectrum, and a photoemissive component capable of emitting a light signal whose wavelength lies within the infrared spectrum. Likewise, the receive member <b>14</b> may include a photoreceptive component capable of receiving a light signal whose wavelength lies within the red spectrum, and a photoreceptive component capable of receiving a light signal whose wavelength lies within the infrared spectrum. The wavelength lying within the red spectrum is preferably used for operation in the reflex detector mode, and the wavelength lying within the infrared spectrum is preferably used for operation in the proximity detector mode.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The members <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are soldered to an electronic card <b>10</b> of the detector, called a daughtercard, placed perpendicular to the X axis (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>). The daughtercard <b>10</b> is connected to an electronic mothercard <b>5</b> of the detector, which in particular includes a unit for processing and analysing the electrical signal delivered by the receive member <b>14</b>, for the purpose of delivering output information from the detector. The mothercard is placed longitudinally, on the X axis, and the connection between the daughtercard <b>10</b> and the mothercard <b>5</b> is for example provided by a connector <b>19</b> of the SMC type as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</figref>. The connector <b>19</b> provides good electrical connection between the daughtercard <b>10</b> and the mothercard <b>5</b> and also relatively flexible mechanical linkage between the two cards <b>5</b> and <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The detector also includes a cap <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>. The cap <b>20</b> is formed from a single part, including a longitudinal external skirt <b>25</b>, having approximately the shape of a cylindrical tube as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and an emit lens <b>22</b> and a receive lens <b>24</b> that are placed at one end of the cap <b>20</b>, in a plane perpendicular to the X axis (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>). The emit lens <b>22</b> and receive lens <b>24</b> are made of translucent material and are positioned in front of the emit member <b>12</b> and receive member <b>14</b>, respectively, so that the first light signal and the second light signal can pass respectively through them. Since the lenses <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are formed by a single translucent part, the cap <b>20</b> has a separating slot <b>21</b> between the two lenses <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> over a large portion of the diameter of the cap, in order to isolate the light signals emitted and received by the detector.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one embodiment of the present invention, the detector also includes a fixing support <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) to which the card <b>10</b> and the cap <b>20</b> are fixed, thus providing a strong daughtercard <b>10</b>/support <b>30</b>/cap <b>20</b> assembly, while advantageously reducing the dimensions of the detector. This arrangement makes possible for the emit and receive members to be reliably and effectively positioned in all three dimensions relative to the emit and receive lenses, that is to say both in a transverse plane and in a longitudinal direction. In particular, this arrangement ensures that the emit and receive focal lengths remain very stable.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The support <b>30</b> includes a single part made of an opaque material. The support <b>30</b> has an approximately cylindrical longitudinal body <b>35</b> and a transverse base <b>39</b> perpendicular to the X axis (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). The support <b>30</b> also has a protruding central blade <b>31</b> in a plane parallel to the X axis. The purpose of this central separating blade <b>31</b> is to ensure that the emitted and received light rays in the detector are effectively separate so as to avoid the risk of crosstalk between the emitted and received light rays. The central blade <b>31</b> is connected on each side to the inner wall of the cylindrical body <b>35</b>. The central blade <b>31</b> bears at one end on the base <b>39</b>, thus dividing the cap <b>30</b> into two approximately semicylindrical spaces that channel the light rays between the members <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> and the lenses <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At the other end, the blade <b>31</b> advantageously has a protrusion that is inserted into the separating slot <b>21</b> in the cap <b>20</b> when the latter is assembled with the support <b>30</b>, so as to improve the separation between the emitted and received light rays, preventing any light dispersion caused by the lenses <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Thus, according to this embodiment, the separation of the light rays is continuously maintained from the emit/receive members <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> right through to the emit/receive lenses <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">To ensure that the cap <b>20</b> is properly fixed to the support <b>30</b>, according to one embodiment of the present invention a snap-fastening element <b>38</b> is placed on the central blade <b>31</b>, and cooperates with a complementary element on the cap <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>). These resilient snap-fastening elements are, for example, placed on each side of the blade <b>31</b> and cooperate with the corresponding edges of the slot <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Moreover, the cylindrical body <b>35</b> of the support <b>30</b> may have a longitudinal groove <b>37</b> into which a complementary feature on the skirt <b>25</b> of the cap <b>20</b> can be inserted when this cap is being fitted onto the support <b>30</b>, serving as a polarizing slot and making the cap/support assembly more robust.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">To ensure that the electronic card <b>10</b> is properly fixed to the support <b>30</b>, one embodiment of the present invention provides a fixing element on the rear wall of the transverse base <b>39</b>. The fixing element includes, for example, a snap-fastening device including a plurality of blocks <b>36</b><i>a</i>, distributed around the perimeter of the base <b>39</b> so as to ensure that the card <b>10</b> stays stably positioned in a transverse plane perpendicular to the X axis, and snap-fastening prongs <b>36</b><i>b </i>that cooperate with notches <b>16</b> in the card <b>10</b> so as to jam the card against the support <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The element for fixing the card <b>10</b> to the support <b>30</b> also includes a positioning device that prevents the card <b>10</b> from rotating about the X axis. This positioning device ensures that there is a correct alignment between the receive member <b>14</b> and the receive lens <b>24</b>, for a good reception of the second light signal. The positioning device includes, for example, at least one stud <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>b </i>projecting from the external wall of the transverse base <b>39</b> and capable of being inserted into at least one corresponding notch <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>in the receive member <b>14</b> when the card <b>10</b> is fixed against the support <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). In the present embodiment, the device has two studs <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>b </i>that are inserted into two notches <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>located on either side of the receive member <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">This positioning device is particularly advantageous if the pins of the receive member <b>14</b> do not pass through the daughter board <b>10</b> but are only surface-mount soldered to the card <b>10</b>, in which case there may be differences in the positioning of the receive member <b>14</b> depending on the manufacturing batch. Thus, the studs <b>33</b><i>a </i>and <b>33</b><i>b </i>always allow the position of the receive lens <b>24</b> to be dependent on the receive member <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The transverse base <b>39</b> has openings <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> on either side of the protruding blade <b>31</b>, facing the emit <b>12</b> and receive 14 members so as to let through the emitted and received light signals. The base may also have, around the emit member <b>12</b> and receive member <b>14</b>, features that allow a better mutual isolation of the light rays.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to another embodiment of the present invention, the cap <b>20</b> and the support <b>30</b> may include only a single plastic part, which would then be produced by a two-shot injection moulding operation, using a translucent material and an opaque material. The opaque material is in fact needed for the protruding blade <b>31</b> and the body <b>35</b> of the support <b>30</b>, while the translucent material is needed for the lenses <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> of the cap <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The detector also includes a translucent cover <b>29</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) covering the lenses <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and the slot <b>21</b> of the cap <b>20</b>. This cover <b>29</b> is placed over the transverse external face of the cap <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and may include polarizing filters for the emitted and received light signals if the use of the detector so requires. The cover <b>29</b> also has the purpose of improving the sealing of the detector at the slot <b>21</b>. It may also be fixed to the detector by ultrasonic welding onto a shoulder of the cap <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">During manufacture of the detector, the daughtercard <b>10</b> is firstly fixed to the support <b>30</b>. Next, the support <b>30</b>/card <b>10</b> pre-assembly is introduced into the tube formed by the skirt <b>25</b> and is fixed to the cap <b>20</b> by the snap-fastening element <b>38</b>. The mothercard <b>5</b> can then be connected to the daughtercard <b>10</b> by the connector <b>19</b>, since this mothercard <b>5</b> is not involved in the proper positioning of the various elements of the daughtercard <b>10</b>/cap <b>20</b>/support <b>30</b> assembly. An overall outer casing (not shown in the figures) is then attached, in order to form the final detector. A sealing resin may also be introduced between the various elements in order to make the detector more robust.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Of course, it is possible, without departing from the scope of the invention, to conceive of other embodiments and improvements to the detail, and even to envisage the use of equivalent means.</p>
