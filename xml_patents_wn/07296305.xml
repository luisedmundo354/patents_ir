<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A headband for use in a headgear support includes a first end section having a plurality of spaced connectors and a second end section including a fastener attached adjacent the end thereof. The fastener includes a connecting member to which at least one cooperating connector is attached. The connecting member biases the cooperating connector in an engagement position with at least one of the plurality of connectors of the first end section to hold the headband in a selected loop configuration. The fastener further includes at least a first flexible release member. Upon application of a force to the first release member, the first flexible release member is movable to a release position (or range of positions) in which the first release member abuts the connecting member to cause the connecting member to flex to a disengage position (or range of positions) in which the cooperating connector is disengaged from the at least one the plurality of connectors of the first end section to enable increasing the size of the loop of the headband.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/627,635 filed Nov. 12, 2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to adjustable headbands and, particularly, to adjustable headbands for use in headgear, including, for example, personal protective products such as protective helmets, faceshields and welding shields.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most types of protective helmets worn by workers to protect them from falling objects have a suspension system. The suspension system or headgear support, along with the helmet shell, act to absorb the shock of a falling object striking the top of the worker's head. The suspension system also serves as a support that holds the helmet or faceshield on the worker's head.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The suspension is often a web-like support system comprising two or more strips of material that are arranged to cross each other. The ends of the strips are, for example, attached at four or more points around the circumference of the helmet. A headband is then typically attached to the four or more points of the suspension to permit the helmet to be worn by the worker. To securely position the helmet on the worker's head, it is essential that the circumference of the headband be adjustable to fit the appropriate head size. An adjustable napestrap is often attached at one end of the headband to achieve these results. Such a suspension system is available from Mine Safety Appliances Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. under the trademark STAZ-ON® and is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,896,586.</p>

No. 3,500,474, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a headband wherein the napestrap position of the headband is manually adjusted by the wearer to fit the appropriate head size. The two ends of the headband are connected and held in place by a slot-and-projection arrangement. One end of the headband is formed with parallel rows of projections or flanges. The other end of the headband is formed with parallel rows of slots. The size of the headband can be adjusted by inserting the projections of one end of the strap into the slots formed in the other end of the strap at the desired length. While this type of headband is relatively simple to manufacture (in part because separate mechanical fasteners or adjustment mechanisms are generally not required), users of such bands often have difficulty adjusting the band size while wearing the suspension. This inconvenience often results in the use of a different, more expensive type of suspension, such as a ratchet-type suspension system as, for example, described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,942,628.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,896,586, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a headband that is relatively simple to manufacture, while providing a fastening mechanism that is relatively easy to adjust. This headband can be fabricated from an integral or monolithic piece of polymeric material. The headband includes a first end and a second end which overlap. The first end includes a plurality of longitudinally spaced attachment members (for example, depressions, recesses or slots). The second end includes a resilient fastener having an opening or a channel to slidably receive the first end in overlapping engagement with the second end. The fastener also includes a fastener surface having at least one cooperating attachment member to cooperate with the attachment members of the first end of the band. The fastener surface is resiliently bowable in a direction away from the first end upon application of a compressive force to the fastener. Upon application of such compressive force, the attachment member of the first end of the band and the cooperating attachment member of the fastener disconnect so that the first end can be slid relative to the fastener (and thereby the second end). Unfortunately, it can be difficult to operate the bowable fastening mechanism of U.S. Pat. No. 5,896,586 with only one hand.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 6,341,382 also discloses a one-piece adjustable headband which is constructed of lightweight material such as a plastic. The strap is constructed with an integral adjustment or fastening mechanism to adjust the fit of the strap around the head of wearer, purportedly using a single hand. The headband includes a first end, a second end, an interior surface, and an exterior surface. A plurality of ratchet teeth extend from the exterior surface of the headband adjacent the first end thereof. Each of the ratchet teeth has a tapered surface and a locking surface. A clasp is resiliently connected to the exterior surface of the headband adjacent the second end thereof. The clasp includes a pawl which is biased in a locking position wherein the pawl is engageable with the locking surface of one of the ratchet teeth to hold the headband in a selected loop configuration. The clasp is movable to a release position upon application of a force generally normal to the plane of the headband whereby the pawl is moved away from the ratchet teeth to permit the loop configuration of the headband to be increased in size.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although a number of fastening or adjusting mechanisms have been developed for headbands or head straps for use in headgear, and especially in personal protective equipment such as protective helmets, faceshields and welding shields having a headgear support, it remains desirable to develop improved headbands and adjusting mechanism for use therein, and preferably ones which can be adjusted using only one hand, and more preferably which can also be adjusted with one hand while a user is wearing the protective headgear support.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a headband or head strap <b>110</b> of the present invention for use in a headgear support. Headband <b>110</b> is, for example, a flexible member that can be molded from one or more suitable polymeric materials to extend around the head of the user. Headband <b>110</b> can, for example, be formed from an integral or monolithic piece of polymeric material or can, for example, be co-molded or otherwise fabricated from two or more polymeric materials. A first end <b>120</b> and second end <b>160</b> overlap, preferably at the back of the wearer's head (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>). Headband <b>110</b> may be straight from end to end, in which case first end <b>120</b> and second end <b>160</b> will overlap on the head of the user. On the other hand, first end <b>120</b> and second end <b>160</b> may extend downwardly in the rear portion of headband <b>110</b> across the nape of the neck. The latter embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>. Regardless of which type of headband <b>110</b> is used, overlapping ends <b>120</b> and <b>160</b> are connected in the same manner.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">First end <b>120</b> includes a connection mechanism <b>125</b> that, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, comprises a plurality of longitudinally spaced connective elements such as spaced slots <b>130</b>. Second end <b>160</b> includes a cooperating fastener <b>170</b> which includes at least one cooperating connective element that forms an operative connection with at least one of the spaced connective elements of connection mechanism <b>125</b> to form an adjustable overlapping connection between first end <b>120</b> and second end <b>160</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, arrow A<b>1</b> represents a generally latitudinal direction as such term is used herein, whereas arrow A<b>2</b> represents a generally longitudinal direction as such term is used herein.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">First end <b>120</b> is maintained in slidable connection with fastener <b>170</b> and second end <b>160</b> via retaining members <b>172</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) on an interior side thereof (that is, the side closest to the wearer's head while donned) of fastener <b>170</b>. Each of retaining member <b>172</b> also includes a projecting flange or ridge <b>172</b><i>a </i>which abuts the sides of first end section <b>120</b> when first end section <b>120</b> is in operative connection with second end section <b>160</b>. First end section <b>120</b> passes through an opening or notch <b>174</b> formed in fastener <b>170</b>. Retaining members <b>172</b> and opening <b>174</b> form a channel through which first end section <b>120</b> is slidable to adjust the loop formed by headband <b>110</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 5</figref> for an example of the loop configuration). Opening <b>174</b> includes recesses <b>174</b><i>a </i>through which ridges <b>122</b> formed on the lateral sides of first end section <b>120</b> pass. Ridges <b>122</b> can, for example, add strength or stiffness to first end section <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Fastener <b>170</b>, for example, includes a flexible connecting member or arm <b>180</b> having at least one cooperating abutment member or tooth <b>178</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 4C</figref>) attached thereto. Each of abutment members <b>178</b> extends into one of slots <b>130</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>) to form an operative connection between first end section <b>120</b> and second end section <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, abutment members <b>178</b> are in the form of projections or flanges and include a first surface <b>178</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 4D</figref>) that is sloped to facilitate sliding of first end <b>120</b> through fastener <b>170</b> to reduce the size of headband <b>110</b> (thereby tightening the fit thereof). For example, application of an appropriate force to first end <b>120</b> (and/or second end <b>160</b>) to tighten headband <b>110</b> causes sloped surfaces <b>178</b><i>a </i>of projections <b>178</b> to “slide over” or past slots <b>130</b>. Projections <b>178</b> further include a second surface <b>178</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 4D</figref>) that is generally vertical. Surfaces <b>178</b><i>b</i>, in cooperative connection with slots <b>130</b>, provide substantial resistance to movement of first end <b>120</b> away from second end <b>160</b> (which would result in loosening of the fit of headband <b>110</b>). In that regard, loosening of the fit of headband <b>170</b> typically requires placement of flexible connecting member <b>180</b> into a release or bowed state as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> to move projections <b>178</b> out of operative abutting connection with slots <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, fastener <b>170</b> includes a first end <b>170</b><i>a </i>and a second end <b>170</b><i>b</i>. Connecting member <b>180</b> is attached at a first end thereof to first end <b>170</b><i>a </i>of fastener <b>170</b> and at a second end thereof to second end <b>170</b><i>b </i>of fastener <b>170</b>. Flexible connecting member <b>180</b> includes a raised section <b>180</b><i>a </i>generally in the center thereof. Fastener <b>170</b> further includes first and second (or upper and lower, in the orientation of, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) flexible release members <b>184</b><i>a </i>and <b>184</b><i>b</i>, respectively, on each lateral side thereof. First and second flexible release members <b>184</b><i>a </i>and <b>184</b><i>b </i>are attached at a first end thereof to first end <b>170</b><i>a </i>of fastener <b>170</b> and at a second end thereof to second end <b>170</b><i>b </i>of fastener <b>170</b> and can flex about those points of attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">To place connecting member <b>180</b> in its bowed or release position or state as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, the wearer of headband <b>110</b> reaches behind the wearer's head and applies (for example, with a single hand) a generally latitudinal compressing force F (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) to each of flexible release member <b>184</b><i>a </i>and <b>184</b><i>b</i>. For example, the wearer can place the wearer's thumb on lower release member <b>184</b><i>a </i>and the wearer's index finger on the upper release member <b>184</b><i>b </i>and squeeze upper and lower release member <b>184</b><i>a </i>and <b>184</b><i>b </i>toward each other. Each of flexible release members <b>184</b><i>a </i>and <b>184</b><i>b </i>includes a sloped abutment member <b>186</b><i>a </i>and <b>186</b><i>b </i>(see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 4B</figref>), respectively, in operative connection therewith. As release members <b>184</b><i>a </i>and <b>184</b><i>b</i>, and thereby sloped abutment members <b>186</b><i>a </i>and <b>186</b><i>b</i>, are forced toward each other, abutment of sloped abutment members <b>186</b><i>a </i>and <b>186</b><i>b </i>with raised section <b>180</b><i>a </i>of connecting member <b>180</b> forces connecting member <b>180</b> into its release state as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. As abutment members <b>186</b><i>a </i>and <b>186</b><i>b </i>are forced toward each other, inward projecting contact members <b>188</b><i>a </i>and <b>188</b><i>b </i>on an inner side of abutment members <b>186</b><i>a </i>and <b>186</b><i>b </i>contact and slide along the outer surface of first section <b>120</b>, thereby reducing or eliminating bending of abutment member <b>186</b><i>a </i>and <b>186</b><i>b </i>relative to connecting member <b>180</b>. Rearward motion of first section <b>120</b> relative to fastener <b>170</b> and connecting member <b>180</b> is prevented by contact of the inner surface of first section <b>120</b> with retaining members <b>172</b>. In the release state or position of connecting member <b>180</b>, projections <b>178</b> are out of contact with slots <b>130</b>, and first section <b>120</b> can be moved relative to second section <b>160</b> and fastener <b>170</b>. When compressive force as described above is removed from release members <b>184</b><i>a </i>and <b>184</b><i>b</i>, release members <b>184</b><i>a </i>and <b>184</b><i>b </i>(and abutment members <b>186</b><i>a </i>and <b>186</b><i>b</i>) return to their unstressed or locking state as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</figref>, allowing connecting member <b>180</b> to return to its locking or connecting state as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. Even in its locking state, connecting member <b>180</b> can be flexed and not fully relaxed so that it biases projections <b>178</b> in operative connection with slots <b>130</b> of first end <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Actuation of release members <b>184</b><i>a </i>and <b>184</b><i>b </i>is typically required only to loosen or enlarge headband <b>110</b>. In that regard, projections <b>178</b> provide little resistance to motion of first end section <b>110</b> relative to second end section <b>160</b> and fastener <b>170</b> in a tightening direction. To tighten the fit of headband <b>110</b>, the user can readily reach behind his or her head, place the user's fingers in contact with tab <b>150</b> on first end <b>120</b> and with tab <b>190</b> on fastener <b>170</b>, and force tabs <b>150</b> and <b>190</b> toward each other to tighten the fit of headband <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As illustrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, second end section <b>160</b> also includes an extending member <b>188</b> extending from second end <b>170</b><i>b </i>of fastener <b>170</b>. Extending member <b>188</b> contacts first end section <b>120</b> and assists in maintaining that portion of first end section <b>120</b> that projects through fastener <b>170</b> in close proximity to second end section <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As described above, all components of fastener <b>170</b> can, for example, be fabricated as a monolithic unit (via, for example, molding) from a resilient polymeric material wherein connecting member <b>180</b> flexes about its attachment points with first end <b>170</b><i>a </i>and second end <b>170</b><i>b </i>of fastener <b>170</b> and release member <b>184</b><i>a </i>and <b>184</b><i>b </i>flex about their attachment points with first end <b>170</b><i>a </i>and second end <b>170</b><i>b </i>of fastener <b>170</b>. Likewise the entirety of headband <b>110</b> can be fabricated as a monolithic unit from a resilient polymeric material. Alternatively, one or more components of headband <b>110</b> can be fabricated from different materials via, for example, a co-molding process as known in the art. One or more components of headband <b>110</b> can alternatively be fabricated separately and later assembled to form headband <b>110</b>. Resilient polymeric materials suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, polypropylene, high density polyethylene and/or nylon.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A through 6E</figref> illustrate another embodiment of a headband <b>310</b> of the present invention. Like headband <b>110</b>, headband <b>310</b> includes a first end section <b>320</b> and a second end section <b>360</b>. First end section <b>320</b> includes a plurality of slots <b>334</b> formed in an upper or outer surface <b>328</b> thereof. Second end section <b>360</b> includes a fastener <b>370</b>. Fastener <b>370</b> includes tabs or flanges <b>372</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>) on a rearward side thereof and an opening <b>372</b><i>a </i>through which first end <b>320</b> passes to assist in maintaining first end <b>320</b> in operative connection with fastener <b>370</b> and first end <b>360</b>. Fastener <b>370</b> includes a cantilevered connecting member or arm <b>384</b> including a downward oriented abutment member such as a projection <b>386</b> on an end thereof.
