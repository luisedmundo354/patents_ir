No. 6,844,845, titled “WATERPROOF COMBINED GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM RECEIVER AND TWO-WAY RADIO AND METHOD OF WATERPROOF ENCLOSURE FABRICATION”, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a combined global positioning system receiver and radio unit. More specifically, the present invention relates to a combined global positioning system navigation unit and two-way radio communications unit that includes a substantially waterproof enclosure for protection of the electronic components contained therein, and method of fabrication of the substantially waterproof enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. State of the Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A global positioning system (GPS) is an electronic satellite navigation system that permits a user of the system to determine his or her position with respect to the Earth. Global positioning may be accomplished through the use of a handheld GPS receiver device that detects and decodes signals from a number of satellites orbiting the Earth. The signals from each of these satellites indicate the position of the satellite and the time at which the signal was sent. To decode the satellite signals, known as spread spectrum signals, and thereby calculate the desired navigational data, a GPS receiver must first “find” or acquire the signals emitted from a minimum number of satellites. Once the receiver is “locked on” to the spread spectrum signals, continuous real-time calculation and monitoring of the user's global position and other navigational data (e.g., velocity of movement) may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">GPS receivers have clocks that are synchronized with clocks in each of the satellites to determine how long it takes the signals to travel from the satellites to the receiver. In this regard, GPS receivers require a highly accurate internal frequency reference in order to acquire the spread spectrum GPS satellite signals. Specifically, acquiring spread spectrum satellite signals from a sufficient number of satellites to perform calculations requires determining the frequency of oscillation of the crystal oscillator utilized in the GPS receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Once the GPS receiver has acquired and decoded signals from a minimum of three satellites, the GPS receiver can calculate the user's position (e.g., latitude and longitude) by geometric triangulation. Upon acquiring signals from a minimum of four satellites, the GPS receiver can also calculate the user's altitude. In addition, GPS receivers are able to calculate the user's speed and direction of travel by continuously updating the user's position. Accordingly, GPS receivers are highly valuable and widely used in navigational systems because of their ability to accurately compute the user's position on or near the Earth in real-time, even as the user is moving.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition to the growing popularity and demand for GPS navigational devices, portable two-way radios continue to enjoy widespread popularity. In 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) established the Family Radio Service (FRS) so that families and other small groups could communicate with one another over very short distances (typically less than one mile) at no charge and without a FCC license. The FRS, which is one of the Citizens Band Radio Services, includes fourteen channels in the UHF 460 MHz band. There are a number of commercially available two-way radios that are designed for use with the FRS. The increasing use of both portable two-way radios and global positioning systems has led to proposals to incorporate GPS receivers into portable radio devices.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The first combined portable GPS receiver and two-way radio unit that is capable of displaying the location of at least one other such unit (as well as its own location) was recently developed by Garmin International, Inc. of Olathe, Kans. and is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,373,430 (hereinafter “the '430 patent”). The combined global positioning system receiver and two-way radio unit of the '430 patent is capable of communicating with one or more other such units over a wireless radio network, wherein each of the units is adapted to transmit over the network radio signals indicative of that unit's location. The GPS/radio unit includes a GPS receiver for receiving satellite signals from a plurality of satellites, a processor coupled with the GPS receiver for calculating the location of the GPS/radio unit as a function of the received satellite signals, and a radio receiver coupled with the processor for receiving the radio signals transmitted by the other units. The processor is adapted to identify the location of the other units based upon the received radio signals. The GPS/radio unit also includes a display for indicating its own location as well as the location of at least one of the other units. The disclosure of the '430 patent is hereby incorporated herein by this reference as if set forth in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The GPS/radio unit of the '430 patent includes a portable, handheld housing for housing the unit electronic components, e.g., the GPS receiver, the processor, the radio receiver and the display. However, the electronic components contained within the housing are vulnerable to potential harmful effects which may be caused by ingress of water (or other liquid) through the housing. Such ingress is of concern if the GPS/radio unit is dropped into a puddle, pond, river, stream or other body of water, if water or other liquid is splashed onto the GPS/radio unit, or if the user of the GPS/radio unit is caught in inclement weather such as rain or snow.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, the inventors have recognized that it would be advantageous to provide a combined two-way radio communications unit and GPS navigation unit configured for wirelessly communicating with one or more other such units and which includes a substantially waterproof enclosure for protecting the electronic components housed therein from the potentially harmful effects of liquid ingress. It would be further advantageous to provide such substantially waterproof enclosure in a compact, robust yet relatively inexpensive form, the components of which are easy to fabricate and assemble.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention includes a combined global positioning system receiver and two-way radio communications unit (GPS/radio unit) that includes a substantially waterproof enclosure for protection of the electronic components contained therein. The GPS/radio unit is configured for wirelessly communicating with at least one other such GPS/radio unit over a wireless radio network, the at least one other GPS/radio unit being configured for transmitting radio signals indicative of that unit's location. The GPS/radio unit includes a global positioning system receiver for receiving satellite signals from a plurality of satellites, a processor coupled with the global positioning system receiver for calculating the location of the GPS/radio unit as a function of the received satellite signals, and a radio transceiver coupled with the processor for receiving the radio signals transmitted by the at least one other GPS/radio unit and for transmitting a radio signal to the at least one other GPS/radio unit. The transmitted radio signal is indicative of a location of the GPS/radio unit. The processor is configured to identify the location of the at least one other GPS/radio unit based upon the received radio signals. The GPS/radio unit also includes a display for indicating the location of at least one of the other GPS/radio units and a substantially waterproof enclosure for housing the global positioning system receiver, the processor, the radio transceiver and the display.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention is directed to a combined global positioning system receiver and two-way radio communications unit that is configured for wirelessly communicating with one or more other such units and that includes a waterproof enclosure for protection of the electronic components contained therein. The particular embodiments described herein are intended in all respects to be illustrative rather than restrictive. Additional embodiments will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains without departing from its scope.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to the figures in general, and initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in particular, a block diagram of the electronic components of an exemplary combined global positioning system and two-way radio communications unit (GPS/radio unit) is illustrated. The combined GPS/radio unit is denoted generally by reference numeral <b>10</b>, and is sized and configured as a handheld unit. The GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> of the present invention is preferably capable of direct voice and data communications, such as the unit disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,373,430, incorporated herein by specific reference. The GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> includes a GPS receiver <b>12</b>, a GPS antenna <b>14</b>, a radio transceiver <b>16</b> and a radio antenna <b>18</b>. The GPS receiver <b>12</b> and radio transceiver <b>16</b> are electronically coupled with a processor <b>20</b> that has an associated memory <b>22</b> for storing information such as cartographic data (e.g., electronic maps). The cartographic data may be stored on cartridges that can be removably attached and operably coupled to the unit. For example, an electronic map of a particular city or National Park may be stored in a single cartridge. The memory <b>22</b> may also store historical location data for the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> or for other units that have transmitted location data to the unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The combined GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> also includes a microphone <b>24</b>, a speaker <b>26</b>, a user input <b>28</b> and a display <b>30</b>. It is currently preferred that the display <b>30</b> comprises a liquid crystal display (LCD). Further, it is currently preferred that the user input <b>28</b> comprises a five-way cursor for accessing data and navigating within a menu-driven display program. However, it will be understood and appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the user input <b>28</b> may comprise an alphanumeric keypad, such as a telephone keypad, which may be used to select and input a name or other identifier for the unit using any combination of the letters, numbers, or symbols which are available on the keypad. Additionally, the user input <b>28</b> may comprise a microphone/voice recognition input, touch screen, or any other user input <b>28</b> known to those of ordinary skill in the art. All such variations are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention. When the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> is assembled, it is currently preferred that the user input <b>28</b> is generally centrally located within aperture <b>70</b> with respect to the exterior surface <b>48</b> of the front wall <b>40</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the first housing section <b>36</b> of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> to facilitate one-handed user operation, as more fully described below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> of the present invention includes a, waterproof enclosure <b>32</b> for housing the internal components thereof and protecting the same from the potential harmful effects of water ingress. As used herein, the term “water” encompasses and includes not only water per se, but also any other liquid, and is not limited to such substances in a liquid state but also in a vapor state. The illustrated waterproof enclosure <b>32</b> includes a two-section plastic housing <b>34</b> and a flexible elastomeric cover <b>132</b> positioned to cover an uppermost region of the two-section plastic housing <b>34</b>, as more fully described below. The two-section plastic housing <b>34</b> is comprised of a first housing section <b>36</b> and a second housing section <b>38</b>. When the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> is assembled, the first and second housing sections <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> fit together in a water tight, cooperatively mated relationship to define an internal compartment or chamber in which the internal electronic components of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> (e.g., the GPS receiver <b>12</b>, the processor <b>20</b>, the radio transceiver <b>16</b>, the radio antenna <b>18</b>, the GPS antenna <b>14</b> and the display <b>30</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be enclosed and protected. Fabrication of the first and second housing sections <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> and assembly of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> is more fully described below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the first housing section <b>36</b> of the two-section plastic housing <b>34</b> is shown. The first housing section <b>36</b> includes a front wall <b>40</b>, first and second side walls <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, a top wall <b>45</b> and a bottom wall <b>46</b>. An exterior surface <b>48</b> of the front wall <b>40</b> is visible from the front of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> when the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> is assembled. An interior surface <b>50</b> of the front wall <b>40</b>, the side walls <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, the top wall <b>45</b> and the bottom wall <b>46</b> forms an interior cavity <b>52</b> within which a number of the internal electronic components of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> may be positioned. When cooperatively mated with the second housing section <b>38</b>, as more fully described below, the interior cavity <b>52</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> and an interior cavity <b>97</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> cooperate with one another to form a substantially water tight internal compartment wherein the internal components of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> may be enclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">To elaborate on the fabrication of first and second housing sections <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>, each housing section <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is preferably formed as a single-piece rigid plastic component by injection molding, although other suitable molding techniques may be employed. A polycarbonate is currently preferred as the material for first and second housing sections <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. The first, or front, housing section may be formed in a two part molding operation wherein the rigid plastic component formed in a first mold is placed in a second mold and an elastomer is selectively injected to into a cavity defined over peripheral edge <b>202</b> of first housing section <b>36</b> to form an elastomeric gasket <b>200</b> extending along the peripheral edge <b>202</b> of first housing section <b>36</b> which will engage a cooperatively configured peripheral edge <b>204</b> of second, or rear, housing section <b>38</b>. Elastomeric gasket <b>200</b> may best be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>5</b>B. A currently preferred material for elastomeric gasket <b>200</b> is a styrenic thermoplastic elastomer. As shown in enlarged detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, elastomeric gasket <b>200</b> is formed over, and in alignment with, peripheral edge <b>202</b>, which includes a flat <b>206</b> and a protrusion <b>208</b> extending therealong in the center of peripheral edge <b>202</b>. Elastomeric gasket <b>200</b> is formed with a small seal bead <b>210</b> protruding upwardly therefrom. Seal bead <b>210</b> is compressed against, and seals with, a polished, flat surface comprising peripheral edge <b>204</b> of second housing section <b>38</b> upon assembly of the first and second housing sections <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The second part of the molding operation may also be used to form elastomeric covers <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> over apertures <b>85</b> in front housing section <b>36</b>, the elastomeric covers <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> being adhered in place within the outward ends of apertures <b>85</b> during the molding thereof. The second part of the molding operation for first housing section <b>36</b> may further be used to form a portion of optional gripping region <b>176</b> which, as illustrated, may be contiguous with elastomeric gasket <b>200</b> or which may be discrete and separate therefrom. Likewise, another portion of optional gripping region <b>176</b> may be formed on second housing section <b>38</b> in a second of a two part molding operation performed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The top wall <b>45</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> and the portion of each side wall <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> proximate the top wall <b>45</b> include a continuous, upwardly extending ridge <b>54</b> protruding therefrom. The upwardly extending ridge <b>54</b> is molded to be coextensive with the exterior surface <b>48</b> of the front wall <b>40</b> and the side walls <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>. As more fully described below, the second housing section <b>38</b> also includes a continuous ridge <b>93</b> extending upwardly from a top end wall <b>96</b> and side walls <b>92</b>,<b>94</b> thereof. When assembled, the two upwardly extending ridges <b>54</b>,<b>93</b> cooperate with one another to form a cavity <b>99</b> (portions of cavity <b>99</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 9</figref>) in which the body portion <b>134</b> of the flexible elastomeric cover <b>132</b> which protects the GPS and radio antennas <b>14</b> and <b>18</b>, respectively, from impact damage and water ingress may be received, as more fully described below.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, one such component positioned within the interior cavity <b>52</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> is the display <b>30</b>. The front wall <b>40</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> includes an opening <b>55</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) therein sized and shaped to enable viewing of the display <b>30</b> therethrough, the display <b>30</b> typically being slightly recessed from the plane of the exterior surface <b>48</b> of the front wall <b>40</b>. It is currently preferred that the opening <b>55</b> in the front wall <b>40</b> and the display <b>30</b> are positioned with respect to the exterior surface <b>48</b> of the front wall <b>40</b> off center toward an upper region <b>56</b> thereof as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a transparent plastic lens <b>58</b> is positioned over the surface of the display <b>30</b> which is exposed through the opening <b>55</b> in the front wall <b>40</b> proximate the exterior surface <b>48</b> thereof, as well as over the portion <b>57</b> of the exterior surface <b>48</b> of the front wall <b>40</b> which surrounds the display <b>30</b>. The transparent plastic lens <b>58</b> includes a shape similar to that of the display <b>30</b> and is slightly larger than the display <b>30</b>. That is, the transparent plastic lens <b>58</b> extends beyond the display <b>30</b> around an outer periphery thereof and is secured to the portion <b>57</b> of the exterior surface <b>48</b> of the front wall <b>40</b> which surrounds the display <b>30</b> by a double-sided adhesive element <b>53</b>. Suitable adhesive elements include an acrylic foam sheet with adhesive on both sides and offered by 3M as product #4920, and a double-sided adhesive element <b>5000</b>N offered by Nitto-Denko. In this manner, the periphery of the transparent plastic lens <b>58</b> forms a water tight seal with the exterior surface <b>48</b> of the front wall <b>40</b>, substantially preventing water from contacting the display <b>30</b> and thus from entering the internal compartment of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> through the display opening <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Also positioned within the interior cavity <b>52</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> are the microphone <b>24</b> and the speaker <b>26</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) through which a user may communicate with users of other units. To facilitate use of the speaker <b>26</b>, the front wall <b>40</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> includes a number of small openings <b>60</b> therethrough (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>). It is currently preferred that the small openings <b>60</b> through the front wall <b>40</b> are positioned off center toward a lower region <b>62</b> thereof as shown, and the speaker <b>26</b> correspondingly positioned within the interior cavity <b>52</b>. To prevent water from entering the internal compartment of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> through the small openings <b>60</b> in the front wall <b>40</b>, the cone <b>64</b> of speaker <b>26</b> is formed of a suitable waterproof material also well adapted to function as a speaker cone, such as MYLAR® polymer. A sealing element in the form of an 0-ring or gasket <b>66</b> (a foam gasket being currently preferred) is then adhered to an annular protrusion <b>59</b> on the interior surface <b>50</b> of the front wall <b>40</b> and a periphery of the cone of speaker <b>26</b>, which is also mechanically clamped using, e.g., a metal clamp frame <b>68</b>, to the protrusion <b>59</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In this manner, the metal clamp frame <b>68</b> latches over the 0-ring or gasket <b>66</b>, pressing against a periphery of the cone of speaker <b>26</b> and a water tight seal is formed using the material of the speaker cone <b>64</b> as a water-impermeable membrane to prevent water from entering the internal compartment of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b>. Microphone <b>24</b> is mounted to the main printed circuit board (not shown) at a location to be positioned in alignment with, and to be received within, substantially annular skirt <b>220</b> on the interior surface <b>50</b> of front wall <b>40</b> of first housing section <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 5A</figref>). Aperture <b>222</b> extends through the wall of front housing section within annular skirt <b>220</b>, and is covered with an air and sound permeable, and water impermeable, hydrophobic patch <b>224</b> in the form of a membrane comprising a nonwoven fabric such as, by way of example only, VERSAPORE™ V-5000R fabric from Gelman Sciences. Hydrophobic patch <b>224</b> is secured at its periphery over aperture <b>222</b> by a suitable adhesive <b>226</b> such as, by way of example only, a 3M product #468 transfer adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Substantially centrally located with respect to the front wall <b>40</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> is at least one aperture <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) through which at least one user input <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) protrudes toward the exterior surface <b>48</b> of the front wall <b>40</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the user input <b>28</b> comprises a five-way cursor for accessing data and navigating within a menu-driven display program. However, the user input <b>28</b> may comprise an alphanumeric pad, microphone/voice recognition input, or the like, as known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The five-way cursor user input <b>28</b> illustrated enables navigation in four directions (generally up, down and to each side) by appropriately directed lateral pressure, a selection being made and communicated to the processor <b>20</b> by depression of the user input <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, to prevent water from entering the internal compartment of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> through the at least one aperture <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), a flexible elastomeric cover <b>72</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) may be positioned over the user input <b>28</b>. The flexible elastomeric cover <b>72</b> includes a cup-shaped body portion <b>74</b> having a closed top end <b>76</b> and an open bottom end <b>78</b>, the body portion <b>74</b> forming a cavity sized and shaped to receive the user input <b>28</b>. Extending about a periphery of the open bottom end <b>78</b> is a flange <b>80</b>, the terminal end <b>82</b> of which is turned upwardly from the plane of the flange <b>80</b>. Upon assembly, the user input <b>28</b> is fitted into the cavity formed by the body portion <b>74</b> and the upwardly turned terminal end <b>82</b> of the flange <b>80</b> is fitted within a groove <b>84</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) protruding from the interior surface <b>50</b> front wall <b>40</b> in a resilient, compressed interference fit. In this manner, the flexible elastomeric cover <b>72</b> forms a water tight seal with the first housing section <b>36</b>, substantially preventing water from contacting the user input <b>28</b> through the aperture <b>70</b> in the front wall <b>40</b> and thereby preventing water from entering the internal compartment of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> through the aperture <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Optionally, the front wall <b>40</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> may include one or more additional apertures <b>85</b> through which one or more control buttons may protrude toward the exterior surface <b>48</b> of the front wall <b>40</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> includes two control buttons (not shown) protruding through the front wall <b>40</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> and covered by elastomeric covers <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>. The first control button covered by elastomeric cover <b>86</b> may, for instance, be coupled with the processor <b>20</b> so that depressing the first control button causes the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> to immediately transmit a radio signal over the network indicative of the location of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b>. Similarly, the second control button covered by elastomeric cover <b>88</b> may, for instance, be coupled with the processor <b>20</b> so that depressing the second control button causes the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> to immediately transmit a radio signal over the network requesting that users of other units transmit their locations over the network. It will be understood and appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the control buttons may have any number of additional or alternative functions including, but not limited to, power, volume adjustment and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In order to protect the internal compartment of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> from the ingress of water at the locations of the apertures <b>85</b> through which the control buttons may protrude, flexible elastomeric covers <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> may be disposed over the control buttons in a manner similar to that described above with regard to the user input <b>28</b> and the corresponding aperture <b>70</b> in the front wall <b>40</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b>. Alternatively, those portions of the housing section <b>36</b> overlying the control buttons may be made thin-walled and flexible enough to permit depression of the control buttons. However, it is currently preferred, as noted above, that flexible elastomeric covers <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> be molded onto front housing section <b>36</b> in a second part of a two-part injection molding operation used to form front housing section <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 13</figref>, front perspective views of the second housing section <b>38</b> of the two-section plastic housing <b>34</b> are shown, the first housing section <b>36</b> and electronic components being removed from the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b>. The second housing section <b>38</b> is preferably formed as a single molded component and includes a rear wall <b>90</b>, first and second side walls <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, a bottom end wall <b>95</b> and a top end wall <b>96</b>. The top and bottom end walls <b>96</b>, <b>95</b> and the first and second side walls <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> form an interior cavity <b>97</b> within which a number of the internal electronic components of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> may be positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The top end wall <b>96</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> and the portion of each side wall <b>92</b>,<b>94</b> proximate the top end wall <b>96</b> include an upwardly extending ridge <b>93</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) protruding therefrom. The upwardly extending ridge <b>93</b> is molded to be coextensive with the exterior surface <b>150</b> of the rear wall <b>90</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> and the side walls <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>. As more fully described below, when assembled, the upwardly extending ridge <b>93</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> cooperates with the upwardly extending ridge <b>54</b> of the top wall <b>45</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> to form a cavity <b>99</b> (portions of cavity <b>99</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 9</figref>) in which the body portion <b>134</b> of the flexible elastomeric cover <b>132</b> may be received.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The first side wall <b>92</b> includes an extended portion <b>98</b> thereof. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the extended portion <b>98</b> includes a control button <b>100</b> (or “push to talk” button) externally facing therefrom which may be depressed by the user when he or she desires to communicate with the user of another unit. Positioned to correspond with the control button <b>100</b> is an elongated slot <b>102</b> through the first side wall <b>92</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 13</figref>). Upon assembly, a flex circuit <b>103</b> extends from the control button <b>100</b> through the elongated slot <b>102</b> and into the interior cavity <b>97</b>. To prevent water from entering the interior cavity <b>97</b> and thus the internal compartment of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> through the elongated slot <b>102</b>, a bead of room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) sealant is applied at the location of the elongated slot <b>102</b>. The RTV sealant is typically applied in a viscous liquid or gel-like state and cures at room temperature, creating a flexible elastomeric seal at the point of application. Thus, once the applied RTV sealant cures, a water tight seal is formed about the flex circuit <b>103</b> as it passes through the elongated slot <b>102</b>, preventing water from passing therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the second side wall <b>94</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> includes an aperture <b>104</b> therein which is positioned to correspond with an audio jack <b>106</b> secured in a jack compartment <b>107</b> to the rear wall <b>90</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b>. If desired, an audio component (not shown), e.g., a headset, may be operably coupled with the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> by insertion of a male plug adapter thereof through the aperture <b>104</b> in the second side wall <b>94</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a cover <b>108</b> including a flexible elastomeric plug for insertion into the aperture <b>104</b> may be positioned over the aperture <b>104</b> when the audio jack <b>106</b> is not in use. When a user desires to utilize the audio jack <b>106</b>, he or she may simply remove the elastomeric plug from the aperture <b>104</b> and insert the male plug adapter provided by the audio component (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An opening <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) in the wall of jack compartment <b>107</b> permits communication between the audio jack <b>106</b> and the processor <b>20</b> (e.g., one or more wires may extend therethrough). While the cover <b>108</b> and/or the male plug adapter provided by the audio component (not shown) provide a certain amount of protection from water ingress through aperture <b>104</b>, to ensure that water may not leak beyond the audio jack <b>106</b> through the opening <b>110</b> in the wall of the jack compartment <b>107</b> and damage the internal components of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b>, a dot of RTV sealant is applied at the location of the opening <b>110</b> as discussed above with regard to the elongated slot <b>102</b> in the first side wall <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the top end wall <b>96</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> includes at least two apertures <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> therein, the first aperture <b>112</b> having a cross-sectional dimension (e.g., diameter if the apertures are round) greater than the cross-sectional dimension of the second aperture <b>114</b>. Extending from an external surface <b>115</b> of the top end wall <b>96</b> and positioned to correspond with the apertures <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> is a pair of integral tubular structures <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, access to the interior of the tubular structures <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> being permitted from the interior cavity <b>97</b> of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> through the apertures <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, respectively. The interior surface of the first tubular structure <b>116</b> corresponds in cross-sectional dimension to the first aperture <b>112</b> and is shaped to receive the GPS antenna <b>14</b> and the interior surface of the second tubular structure <b>118</b> corresponds in cross-sectional dimension to the second aperture <b>114</b> and is shaped to receive the radio antenna <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a cross-sectional view of the first tubular structure <b>116</b>, taken along line <b>7</b>-<b>7</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is illustrated. It will be understood and appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that, while not depicted, the details depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are equally applicable to the second tubular structure <b>118</b> as well. The first tubular structure <b>116</b> includes an open top end <b>120</b> thereof. Positioned proximate the open top end <b>120</b> is a cap <b>122</b>. The cap <b>122</b> includes a body portion <b>124</b> sized and shaped to fit within the open top end <b>120</b> of the first plastic tubular structure <b>116</b> and a flange <b>126</b>. The flange <b>126</b> extends around the periphery of the body portion <b>124</b> and is of similar shape as the open top end <b>120</b> of the first tubular structure <b>116</b>. However, the flange <b>126</b> has greater peripheral dimensions than the open top end <b>120</b> such that when the cap <b>122</b> is positioned over the open top end <b>120</b> of the first tubular structure <b>116</b>, the body portion <b>124</b> thereof fits within the open top end <b>120</b> and the flange <b>126</b> is prevented from entering the open top end <b>120</b>. Thus, the cap <b>122</b> effectively seals the open top end <b>120</b> of the first tubular structure <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">To prevent the ingress of water into the internal compartment of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> through the first tubular structure <b>116</b>, a flexible elastomeric cover <b>132</b> is positioned over the first tubular structure <b>116</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is currently preferred that the flexible elastomeric cover <b>132</b> be provided as a single element having a body portion <b>134</b>, a first tubular portion <b>136</b>, a second tubular portion <b>138</b> and a connector portion <b>140</b>. The connector portion <b>140</b> extends between the first and second tubular portions <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> and provides structural integrity to the flexible elastomeric cover <b>132</b>. The first tubular portion <b>136</b> is sized and shaped to receive the first tubular structure <b>116</b> and the second tubular portion <b>138</b> is sized and shaped to receive the second tubular structure <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first tubular portion <b>136</b> includes an annular protrusion <b>142</b> extending from an interior surface thereof, the inner diameter of annular protrusion <b>142</b> being sized slightly smaller than the exterior surface the first plastic tubular structure <b>116</b>. Thus, when the first tubular portion <b>136</b> is positioned over the first tubular structure <b>116</b>, the annular protrusion <b>142</b> from the first tubular portion <b>136</b> bears against the exterior surface of the first tubular structure <b>116</b>, forming a flexible elastomeric ring that seals the first tubular structure <b>116</b> from the ingress of water. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that, while not depicted in the drawing figures, a similar flexible elastomeric seal is formed upon positioning the second tubular portion <b>138</b> over the second tubular structure <b>118</b> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Optionally, the top end wall <b>96</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> may include one or more additional integral tubular structures <b>144</b> defining one or more openings i<b>45</b> sized and shaped to receive a power indicator light, a power button, or the like. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, one such additional tubular structure <b>144</b> is shown, tubular structure <b>144</b> providing access to a power button or other switch element (not shown) accessible at the top thereof. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that there would also be a corresponding flexible segment <b>147</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) molded in the body portion <b>134</b> of the flexible elastomeric cover <b>132</b> permitting necessary, tactile access to the indicator button or other switch element. A seal may be effected between flexible elastomeric cover <b>132</b> and plastic tubular structure <b>144</b> in a manner similar to that described with respect to first plastic tubular structure <b>116</b>, e.g., through use of an annular protrusion on an interior portion of elastomeric cover <b>132</b> configured to fit over tubular structure <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 14</figref>, also positioned on the rear wall <b>90</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> is an electrical connector comprising a number of connector pins <b>146</b>, e.g., brass connector pins. The connector pins <b>146</b> are configured to permit, for instance, downloading of additional cartographic data and the like through removable coupling with an external device (not shown). As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 15</figref>, positioned to correspond with the connector pins <b>146</b> is a cavity <b>148</b> in the exterior surface <b>150</b> of the rear wall <b>90</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> (i.e., the surface of the rear wall <b>90</b> which is visible from the backside of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> when the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> is assembled). The bottom surface <b>152</b> of the cavity <b>148</b> includes at least one opening <b>154</b> therein, the number of openings corresponding to the number of connector pins <b>146</b> desired. Fitted into each opening <b>154</b> in an interference fit is a connector pin <b>146</b>. Alternatively, the connector pins <b>146</b> may be molded into the second housing section <b>38</b>. Each connector pin <b>146</b> is positioned such that a portion thereof extends into the internal compartment of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> and a portion thereof extends into the cavity <b>148</b> in the exterior surface <b>150</b> of the rear wall <b>90</b>. The interference fit of the connector pins <b>146</b> within openings <b>154</b> provides a certain degree of protection against ingress of water. However, to further ensure that water may not enter the internal compartment of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> through the opening(s) <b>154</b>, a dot of RTV sealant may be applied at the location of the opening(s) <b>154</b> as discussed above with regard to the elongated slot <b>102</b> in the first side wall <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, when the connector pins <b>146</b> are not coupled with an external device (not shown), a cover <b>156</b> comprising a rubber or plastic plug) may be placed within the cavity <b>148</b> in the exterior surface <b>150</b> of the rear wall <b>90</b>. The plug is primarily for aesthetics and may, incidentally, provide some protection for connector pins <b>146</b> against collection of debris and mechanical damage when the connector pins <b>146</b> are not coupled with an external device (not shown) and an adapter (not shown) for the external device (not shown) provides some protection when coupled with the connector pins <b>146</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 14</figref>, the exterior surface <b>150</b> of the rear wall <b>90</b> also includes two elongated, parallel depressions <b>158</b>, <b>160</b> sized and shaped to receive a pair of batteries (not shown) for powering the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b>. Positioned to correspond with the parallel depressions <b>158</b>, <b>160</b> is a top protruding wall <b>162</b> and a bottom protruding wall <b>164</b> to aid in holding the batteries (not shown) in place within the depressions <b>158</b>, <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). At opposing longitudinal ends of each depression <b>158</b>, <b>160</b> is a pair of battery terminals <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, each battery terminal <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) having associated therewith a corresponding opening <b>170</b>, <b>172</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 12</figref>) into the internal compartment of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b>. To ensure that water may not enter the internal compartment through the battery terminal openings <b>170</b>, <b>172</b>, a dot of RTV sealant is applied at the locations of the openings <b>170</b>, <b>172</b> as discussed above with regard to the elongated slot <b>102</b> in the first side wall <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Once the batteries (not shown) are positioned within the parallel depressions <b>158</b>, <b>160</b>, a battery cover <b>173</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 16</figref>) is positioned over the batteries and the top and bottom protruding walls <b>162</b>, <b>164</b>. Battery covers are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and, accordingly, the structure of the battery cover will not be further discussed herein. To secure the battery cover <b>173</b> in place, the rear wall <b>90</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> includes a slot opening <b>174</b> therein surrounded by an annular ridge <b>175</b>, the slot opening <b>174</b> sized and shaped to receive a corresponding protrusion (not shown) on the battery cover <b>173</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>). To secure the battery cover <b>173</b> in place, the protrusion (not shown) is inserted into the slot opening <b>174</b> and rotated about one-quarter turn (e.g., about 90 degrees). When rotated in this manner, the protrusion (not shown) is prohibited from disengaging the rear wall <b>90</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> and, thus, the battery cover <b>173</b> is held in place. Such locking mechanisms are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and will not be further discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">To prevent water from entering the internal compartment of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> through the slot opening <b>174</b>, a bead of RTV sealant is applied at the location of the slot opening <b>174</b> as discussed above with regard to the elongated slot <b>102</b> in the first side wall <b>92</b> to form a resilient gasket upon curing.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">To assemble the waterproof GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> of the present invention, the first housing section <b>36</b> and the second housing section <b>38</b> are fitted together in a cooperatively mated relationship forming the internal compartment in which the internal electronic components of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> are enclosed. The first side wall <b>42</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> is cooperatively mated with the first side wall <b>92</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b>, the second side wall <b>44</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> is cooperatively mated with the second side wall <b>94</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b>, the bottom wall <b>46</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> is cooperatively mated with the bottom end wall <b>95</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> and the top wall <b>45</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> is cooperatively mated with the top end wall <b>96</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b>. This cooperative mating of the first and second housing sections <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is effected through contact of the elastomeric gasket <b>200</b> formed on the peripheral edge <b>202</b> of first housing section with polished flat comprising the surface of the peripheral edge <b>204</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b>. Compression of elastomeric gasket <b>200</b>, and specifically of seal bead <b>210</b>, creates a water tight seal along the line of contact around the periphery of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> and between first and second housing sections <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>. First housing section <b>36</b> is secured to second housing section <b>38</b>, and elastomeric gasket <b>200</b> compressed therebetween, by the use of six self-threading screws (not shown) extending through apertures <b>212</b> in second housing section <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) and into mutually aligned apertures <b>214</b> in bosses <b>216</b> in front housing section <b>36</b>. When mated in this manner, the upwardly extending ridge <b>54</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> and the upwardly extending ridge <b>93</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> cooperate to form a cavity <b>99</b> into which the body portion <b>134</b> of the flexible elastomeric cover <b>132</b> is received.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Prior to assembly of the first housing section <b>36</b> with the second housing section <b>38</b>, the flexible elastomeric cover <b>132</b> is positioned over the first, second and, optionally, third tubular structures <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>144</b> such that the first tubular structure <b>116</b> is received in the first tubular portion <b>136</b> of the flexible elastomeric cover <b>132</b>, the second tubular structure <b>118</b> is received in the second tubular portion <b>138</b> of the flexible elastomeric cover <b>132</b>, the third tubular structure <b>144</b> is appropriately aligned with flexible elastomeric cover <b>132</b> and the body portion <b>134</b> is received in the cavity <b>99</b>. Flexible cover <b>132</b> is secured to second housing section <b>38</b> using an RTV adhesive, which adhesive also acts as a sealant to further ensure a watertight seal.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> and as previously described, an optional gripping region <b>176</b> may be formed such that it extends over a portion of the exterior surface <b>150</b> of the rear wall <b>90</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b>, over a portion of the battery cover <b>173</b>, over a portion of the exterior surface <b>48</b> of the front wall <b>40</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b>, over a portion of the side walls <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> and over a portion of the side walls <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> as shown. The optional gripping region <b>176</b> may be formed, as previously noted, of an elastomer and may be secured to the first housing section <b>36</b> and the second housing section <b>38</b> as part of the molding thereof on those respective components. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, the material forming the gripping region <b>176</b> is received in a series of depressions <b>177</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) in the exterior surface <b>48</b> of the front wall <b>40</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b>, the exterior surface <b>150</b> of the rear wall <b>90</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b>, in the side walls <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> of the first housing section <b>36</b> and the side walls <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b>. In this embodiment, the gripping region <b>176</b> is slightly recessed from the remainder of the portable, handheld GPS/radio unit <b>10</b>. It will be understood and appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the gripping region <b>176</b> may be flush with the remainder of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> or protrude therefrom and that such alternatives, as well as the complete omission of gripping region <b>176</b>, are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention. The gripping region <b>176</b> may include a number of bumps or protrusions <b>178</b> extending outwardly therefrom to assist a user in grasping the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> without slippage.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The illustrated positioning of the user input <b>28</b>, control buttons <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> and “push to talk” button <b>100</b> is currently preferred as it permits ergonomic handling of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> and one-handed user operation. For example, in use, a user would grasp the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> such that the exterior surface <b>150</b> of the rear wall <b>90</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b> and the battery cover <b>173</b> are adjacent the palm of the user's hand. The user's thumb would then be able to easily access and maneuver the user input <b>28</b> and the control buttons under elastomeric covers <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> while the user's fingers would be positioned proximate the “push to talk” button <b>100</b> located on the first side wall <b>92</b> of the second housing section <b>38</b>. Additionally, the user's hand would be in contact with the each gripping region <b>176</b> of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> and slippage thereof would be diminished.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When assembled as provided herein, the GPS/radio unit <b>110</b> of the present invention is capable of withstanding temporary immersion in water up to one meter deep. That is, ingress of water in quantities causing harmful effects to the internal electronic components of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> shall not be possible when the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> is temporarily immersed in water up to one meter deep under standardized conditions of pressure and time, i.e., about 30 minutes. (The water depth is measured from the bottom of the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> to the top surface of the water and assumes the GPS/radio unit <b>10</b> is in an upright orientation or service position.)</p>
