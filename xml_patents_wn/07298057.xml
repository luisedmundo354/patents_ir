<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a safety system for a power bus in a mobile platform, such as an aircraft, and more particularly to a safety system for a serial passenger power bus in the seating columns of an aircraft.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aircraft passengers are increasingly demanding in-flight entertainment (IFE) and electrical power outlets to operate various personal electronic devices, such as laptop computers, at their seats. To provide the passenger with such features, electrical power and data must be delivered to each seat. Conventionally, power and data are delivered to aircraft passenger seats via numerous cables that, during aircraft assembly, are laid out in position on the floor of the aircraft passenger cabin. A portion of the cables is positioned beneath a covering, such as the seat track cover, and a portion that includes connectors to the seats is left exposed to connect with the yet to be installed seat groups containing each passenger seat.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">During installation of the seat groups, the seat groups must be carried in over the exposed wires. Taking care to avoid the exposed wires increases both the complexity of the operation and the amount of time required to install the seats. Once the seats are installed, installers must crawl along the floor of the aircraft to manually attach each wire to each seat group. This process is cumbersome and time consuming. Further, in order to change the configuration of the seats or to replace the seats, an installer must again crawl along the floor, disconnect the wiring from each group, and maneuver the seats around the exposed wiring. Still further, in order to change the position of the seat groups, the aircraft must be re-wired so that the wiring will reach the seats in their new positions. As would be expected, re-wiring an aircraft is a costly and time consuming process.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One solution is to provide an improved device for delivering power to aircraft passenger seat groups. Such a device includes a power bus and a connector operable to provide a connection between the power bus and the passenger seats. Power and/or data can be transmitted between the power bus and the passenger seats, via the connector, at any point along the power bus, thus eliminating the need to run separate connections between the power and/or data source and each passenger seat.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in running the power current through the power bus and passenger seats, it is possible that an interruption or break within the system may occur. For example, a wire or connector could detach, or a passenger seat may not be properly coupled to the power bus. Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a safety system that switches off the power supply to the power bus system when a break in the circuit is detected.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A safety system for an electrical distribution system that insures voltage sufficient to power devices attached to the distribution system is only provided when the distribution system is intact. Thus, the safety system limits the likelihood that damage will occur due to an impaired electrical distribution system.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the present invention provides for a safety system comprising a power distribution system, a power control module, and a signal generator in electrical communication with the power distribution system. The power distribution system transmits power to access points located throughout the platform. The power control module is electrically coupled to the power generating source that generates a first signal of a first voltage and a second signal of a second voltage for distribution throughout the power distribution system. The first voltage is lower than the second voltage. The signal generator is in electrical communication with the power distribution system that is operable to receive the first voltage and generate a third signal of a third voltage. The third voltage is lower than the second voltage. The power control module communicates the first signal to the signal generator through an entirety of the power distribution system. Upon receipt of the first signal, the signal generator generates the third signal and communicates the third signal to the power control module via the power distribution system. The power control module generates the second signal and communicates the second signal to the power distribution system upon receipt of the first signal. The power control module does not provide the second signal to the power distribution system if the third signal is not received.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the present invention provides for a safety system for a power distribution system in a mobile platform. The safety system comprises a power control module, a signal generator, and a power distribution system electrically coupled between the power control module and the signal generator. The power control module provides a first signal of a first voltage to the signal generator through the power distribution system. The power control module provides a second signal of a second voltage greater than the first voltage to the power distribution system upon receipt of an activation signal from the signal generator. The activation signal is transmitted back to the power control module if the electrical integrity of the power distribution system is intact. The power control module refrains from providing the second voltage to the power distribution system when the activation signal is not transmitted back to the power control module and the electrical integrity of the power distribution system is not intact.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a further embodiment the present invention provides for a method for communicating electrical signals throughout a mobile platform. The method includes the steps of: generating a first electrical signal of a first voltage by a power control module; transmitting the first signal through a power distribution system to a signal generator circuit; generation of a second signal of a second voltage by a circuit activator signal generator in response to receipt of the first signal by the circuit activator signal generator; generation of a third signal of a third voltage by the power control module upon receipt of the second signal by the power control module, the third voltage being greater than the first voltage and the second voltage. The power control module refrains from generating the third electrical signal when the second signal is not received by the power control module from the power distribution system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The features, functions, and advantages can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present inventions or may be combined in yet other embodiments.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a safety system constructed according to the principles of the present invention is generally indicated by reference numeral <b>10</b> and is illustrated associated with an exemplary mobile platform <b>12</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the mobile platform <b>12</b> is in the form of a passenger aircraft. It will be appreciated, however, that the present invention is not limited for use only in a passenger aircraft but rather can be implemented in any form of mobile platform, such as a ship, train, bus, motor craft, etc. Moreover, the invention may also be employed in various non-mobile settings, such as, for example, a conference center. The system <b>10</b> is usable essentially in any environment/application where electrical power or data needs to be communicated to one or more locations. The mobile platform <b>12</b> is equipped with a power distribution system <b>14</b> coupled with the safety system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The aircraft <b>12</b> generally includes a fuselage <b>16</b> which defines a passenger cabin <b>18</b> having a floor <b>20</b>. Coupled to the floor <b>20</b> are numerous passenger seats <b>22</b>. Two or more passenger seats <b>22</b> are grouped together as a seat group <b>24</b>. Two or more seat groups <b>24</b> in turn form a seating column <b>26</b>. A pair of seat tracks <b>28</b> extend along the floor <b>20</b> along the seating column <b>26</b>. Each seat track <b>28</b> is coupled to the floor <b>20</b>. Each seating group <b>24</b> in turn is coupled to the seat track <b>28</b>, thereby securing the passenger seats <b>22</b> to the floor <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The power distribution system <b>14</b> is integrally formed with the seat tracks <b>28</b>. The power distribution system <b>14</b> is coupled to a power source <b>30</b> to provide power to each of the seating groups <b>24</b>. This power may be used in the passenger seats <b>22</b> for various purposes, such as, for example, powering video screens, audio output, lighting controls, phones, or internet connections.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a preferred embodiment of the safety system <b>10</b> employed with the power distribution system will now be described in detail. The safety system <b>10</b> generally includes a circuit activator module or box (CAB) <b>32</b> and a circuit activator signal generator (CASG) <b>34</b>, each coupled to the power distribution system <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The CAB <b>32</b> is an electronic unit operable for providing various signals and power currents through the power distribution system <b>14</b>, as will be described in greater detail below. The CAB <b>32</b> is electrically coupled between the power source <b>30</b> and the seat tracks <b>28</b>. As noted above, the seat tracks <b>28</b> are each integrated with the power distribution system <b>14</b> such that current is capable of passing through cables (not shown) along each seat track <b>28</b> and thereby into each seat group <b>24</b>. The CAB <b>32</b> is also coupled to a master switch <b>36</b>. The power source <b>30</b>, the CAB <b>32</b>, and the master switch <b>36</b> cooperate to form a subsystem referred to as a seat column power control box (PCB) <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The CASG <b>34</b> is an electronic unit for receiving the signals and power from the CAB <b>32</b> and providing a return activation signal, as will be described in greater detail below. The CASG <b>34</b> is coupled downstream of the PCB <b>38</b> to the power distribution system <b>14</b>. In other words, the CASG <b>34</b> is coupled to the power distribution system <b>14</b> after the last seating group <b>24</b> to each of the seat tracks <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The CAB <b>32</b> and the CASG <b>34</b> may be located in various locations within the mobile platform <b>12</b>. For example, the CAB <b>32</b> and CASG <b>34</b> may be located underneath the floor <b>20</b> or located within the seat track <b>28</b>. Moreover, the entire PCB <b>38</b> and the CASG <b>34</b> may be switched in location such that the CASG <b>34</b> is located at the front of a seating column <b>26</b> and the PCB <b>38</b> is located after the seating column <b>26</b> without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3D</figref>, the operation of the safety system <b>10</b> will now be described. Initially, the CAB <b>32</b> is energized by the power supply <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). When the master switch <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is activated, the CAB <b>32</b> will send a low voltage high frequency signal <b>40</b> through the power distribution system <b>14</b>. This low voltage high frequency signal <b>40</b> flows through the power distribution system <b>14</b> in the direction of the arrows. Low pass filters <b>42</b> installed within each seating group <b>24</b> block the low voltage high frequency signal <b>40</b> from passing therethrough. The low voltage high frequency signal <b>40</b> then passes through the CASG <b>34</b> and returns through the power distribution system <b>40</b> back to the PCB <b>38</b>. In this embodiment, the CASG <b>34</b> is comprised of a high resistance, low impedance circuit, although other circuits may be used to pass the low voltage, high frequency signal <b>40</b> therethrough. The low voltage, high frequency signal is preferably approximately 100 kHz,2 VAC, though various other frequencies and voltages may be employed including direct current.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, when the CAB <b>32</b> receives this low voltage signal <b>40</b>, the CAB <b>32</b> through the PCB <b>38</b> activates and sends full current power, indicated by reference numeral <b>44</b>, through the power distribution system <b>14</b>. The full power <b>44</b> is preferably approximately 400 Hz, 115 VAC. The power <b>44</b> passes into each of the seat groups <b>24</b> thereby providing power to any systems located therein (represented by seat loads in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref>). Note again that the low pass filters <b>42</b> within each seat group <b>24</b> prevent the low voltage high frequency signal <b>40</b> from passing through the seat group <b>24</b>. The low voltage high frequency signal <b>40</b> continues to pass through the power distribution system <b>14</b> at the CASG <b>34</b>. The CAB <b>32</b> will continue to send full power <b>44</b> and the low voltage high frequency signal <b>40</b> through the power distribution system <b>14</b> so long as the master switch <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is closed and the low voltage, high frequency signal <b>40</b> is received by the CASG <b>34</b> and/or CAB <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, if a break in the power distribution system <b>14</b> occurs, such as a disconnect <b>48</b> in the seat tracks <b>28</b>, the low voltage high frequency signal <b>40</b> will be interrupted from passing through the CASG <b>34</b> and will not be returned to the CAB <b>32</b>. However, full power <b>44</b> may still be temporarily provided from the PCB <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, once the low voltage high frequency signal <b>40</b> is no longer passing through the CASG <b>34</b> and onto the CAB <b>32</b>, the CAB <b>32</b> will rapidly shut off the full power <b>44</b>. Accordingly, in the event of a break, the safety system <b>10</b> ensures that only a safe low voltage signal is present within the seating column <b>26</b>. Moreover, the CAB <b>32</b> may be coupled to a controller <b>50</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, that notifies and alerts the users of the mobile platform <b>12</b> that a fault has occurred in the power distribution system <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an alternate embodiment, the low voltage signal <b>40</b> is received by the CASG <b>34</b> and powers the CASG <b>34</b>. In this embodiment, the low voltage signal <b>40</b> would be approximately 400 Hz, 30 VAC, although other voltages and frequencies may be used including direct current. When the CASG <b>34</b> receives this signal, it responds with an activation signal powered by the low voltage signal <b>40</b>. The activation signal is preferably approximately 7,000 Hz, 5 VAC, although other voltages and frequencies may be used including direct current. The activation signal follows the same current path as the low voltage signal <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3D</figref> and thus in this alternative embodiment the portion of signal <b>40</b> that extends from the CASG <b>34</b> to the PCB <b>38</b> represents the activation signal. Alternatively, the CASG <b>34</b> could provide the activation signal using an internal rechargeable battery (not shown) located therein. The activation signal is then received by the CAB <b>32</b> and full power is supplied. If the activation signal is interrupted, the CAB <b>32</b> immediately shuts off full power. The activation signal could be superimposed over the full power using communication over power line technology.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">All of the various embodiments assure that in the event of a break or fault within the power distribution system on a mobile platform, full power provided to the power distribution system will be immediately terminated. This ensures that only a safe low voltage signal is present within the seating columns and seating groups during the fault.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While various preferred embodiments have been described, those skilled in the art will recognize modifications or variations which might be made without departing from the inventive concept. The examples illustrate the invention and are not intended to limit it. Therefore, the description and claims should be interpreted liberally with only such limitation as is necessary in view of the pertinent prior art.</p>
