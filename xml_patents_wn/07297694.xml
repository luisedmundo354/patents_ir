<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a §371 national stage filing of PCT/EP02/09945 filed 5 Sep. 2002.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to novel compounds and their use as pharmaceuticals, particularly as Raf kinase inhibitors for the treatment of neurotraumatic diseases, cancer, chronic neurodegeneration, pain, migraine and cardiac hypertrophy.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Raf protein kinases are key components of signal transduction pathways by which specific extracellular stimuli elicit precise cellular responses in mammalian cells. Activated cell surface receptors activate ras/rap proteins at the inner aspect of the plasma-membrane which in turn recruit and activate Raf proteins. Activated Raf proteins phosphorylate and activate the intracellular protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2. In turn, activated MEKs catalyse phosphorylation and activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). A variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates of activated MAPK are known which directly or indirectly contribute to the cellular response to environmental change. Three distinct genes have been identified in mammals that encode Raf proteins; A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf (also known as Raf-1) and isoformnic variants that result from differential splicing of mRNA are known.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Inhibitors of Raf kinases have been suggested for use in disruption of tumor cell growth and hence in the treatment of cancers, e.g. histiocytic lymphoma, lung adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer and pancreatic and breast-carcinoma; also in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders associated with neuronal degeneration resulting from ischemic events, including cerebral ischemia after cardiac arrest, stroke and multi-infarct dementia and also after cerebral ischemic events such as those resulting from head injury, surgery and/or during childbirth; also in chronic neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease; also in the treatment of pain, migraine and cardiac hypertrophy.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">We have now found a group of novel compounds that are inhibitors of Raf kinases, in particular inhibitors of B-Raf kinase.</p>

As used herein “pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives” includes any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or salt of such ester of a compound of formula (I) which, upon administration to the recipient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of formula (I) or an active metabolite or residue thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It will be appreciated that for use in medicine the salts of the compounds of formula (I) should be pharmaceutically acceptable. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include those described in <i>J. Pharm. Sci., </i>1977, 66, 1-19, such as acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric or phosphoric acid; and organic acids e.g. succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric, citric, tartaric, benzoic, p-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acid.

Impure preparations of the compounds may be used for preparing the more pure forms used in the pharmaceutical compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Compounds of formula (I) are furan, pyrrole and thiophene derivatives which may be readily prepared, using procedures well-known to those skilled in the art, from starting materials which are either commercially available or can be prepared from such by analogy with well-known processes. For instance see, W. Friedrichsen (p351, furans), R. J. Sundberg (p119, pyrroles) and J. Nakayama (p607, thiophenes) in <i>Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II</i>, volume 2, series eds. A. R. Katritzky, C. W. Rees and E. F. V. Scriven,</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Typically, compounds of this invention may be prepared by a Paal-Knorr synthesis from a 1,4-dicarbonyl precursor, as outlined in Scheme 1 (where the groups —XR<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>3</sup>, and R<sup>4 </sup>are hydrogen, and Y<sub>1 </sub>and Y<sub>2 </sub>are CH). For example, base (e.g. diethylamine) mediated condensation of an aryl-methyl ketone with pyridine4-carboxaldehyde results in the formation of a chalcone derivative (1, see S. E. deLaszlo et al <i>Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., </i>1999, 9, 641). Subsequent reaction of the chalcone (1) with a suitably protected (e.g. a methoxyimine, PG=MeON) derivative of indan-1-one-5-carboxaldehyde and catalytic sodium cyanide under Stetter conditions (H. Stetter and K. Kuhlmann, <i>Org. React., </i>1991, 40, 407) generates the aforementioned 1,4-dicarbonyl precursor (2). Cyclisation under the appropriate conditions then results in the formation of the desired furan (e.g. phosphorus pentoxide-methanesulphonic acid or concentrated sulphuric acid or HCl/acetone/dioxan), pyrrole (e.g. ammonium acetate, acetic acid) or thiophene (e.g. Lawessons reagent) ring systems (3). Thereafter, any substituents on the groups R<sup>2</sup>, X<sub>1</sub>/X<sub>2 </sub>may be modified using conventional functional group interconversion procedures and the group PG may be converted into an hydroxyimino group as in (4). It will also be appreciated to one skilled in the art, that the aldehyde components could be utilised in reverse order generating the chalcone derivative (5) and subsequently the regioisomeric heterocycles (6).</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Compounds of this invention may also be prepared by sequential transition metal catalysed cross-coupling reactions on a 2,3-dihalo heterocycle, as shown in Scheme 2; this is particularly applicable for furan or thiophene derivatives, i.e. when one of X<sub>1 </sub>or X<sub>2 </sub>are O or S. For example, Suzuki coupling of pyridine4-boronic acid with a 2,3-dibromofuran derivative (7) preferentially results in the formation of the 2-(4-pyridyl)-3-bromo-furan (8). Subsequent Suzuki reaction with an indanone boronic acid derivative (9, wherein PG is O, N—OMe or another ketone protecting group) generates the derivative (10). Subsequently the group PG can also be converted into an hydroxyimino group as in (11). It will also be appreciated, to one skilled in the art, that the above cross-coupling reactions may be carried out in reverse order giving access to the regioisomeric heterocycles (12).</p>

<p id="p-0197" num="0199">Activity of human recombinant B-Raf protein was assessed in vitro by assay of the incorporation of radiolabelled phosphate to recombinant MAP kinase kinase (MEK), a known physiologic substrate of B-Raf. Catalytically active human recombinant B-Raf protein was obtained by purification from Sf9 insect cells infected with a human B-Raf recombinant baculovirus expression vector. To ensure that all substrate phosphorylation resulted from B-Raf activity, a catalytically inactive form of MEK was utilised. This protein was purified from bacterial cells expressing mutant inactive MEK as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase (GST-kdMEK).</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0200">Method: Standard assay conditions of B-Raf catalytic activity utilised 3 ug of GST-kdMEK, 10 uM ATP and 2 uCi <sup>33</sup>P-ATP, 50 mM MOPS, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1M sucrose, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>plus 0.1% dimethylsulphoxide (containing compound where appropriate) in a total reaction volume of 30 ul. Reactions were incubated at 25° C. for 90 minutes and reactions terminated by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 uM. 10 ul of reaction was spotted to P81 phosphocellulose paper and air dried. Following four washes in ice cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, 0.5% phosphoric acid, papers were air dried prior to addition of liquid scintillant and measurement of radioactvity in a scintillation counter.

<p id="h-0103" num="0000">Neuroprotective Properties of B-Raf Inhibitors in Rat Hippocampal Slice Cultures</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0203">Organotypic cultures provide an intermediate between dissociated neuronal cell cultures and in-vivo models of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). The majority of glial-neuronal interactions and neuronal circuitry are maintained in cultured hippocampal slices, so facilitating investigation of the patterns of death among differing cell types in a model that resembles the in vivo situation. These cultures allow the study of delayed cellular damage and death 24 hours, or more, post-insult and permit assessment of the consequences of long-term alterations in culture conditions. A number of laboratories have reported delayed neuronal damage in response to OGD in organotypic cultures of the hippocampus (Vornov et al., Stroke, 1994, 25, 57-465; Newell et al., <i>Brain Res., </i>1995, 676, 3844). Several classes of compounds have been shown to protect in this model, including EAA antagonists (Strasser et al., <i>Brain Res., </i>1995, 687, 167-174), Na channel blockers (Tasker et al., <i>J. Neurosci., </i>1992, 12, 984308) and Ca channel blockers (Pringle et al., <i>Stroke, </i>1996, 7, 2124-2130). To date, relatively little is known of the roles of intracellular kinase mediated signalling pathways in neuronal cell death in this model.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0204">Method: Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared using the method of Stoppini et al., <i>J. Neurosci. Methods, </i>1995, 37, 173-182. Briefly, 400 micron sections prepared from hippocampi of 7-8 day postnatal Sprague Dawley rats are cultured on semiporous membranes for 9-12 days. OGD is then induced by incubation in serum and glucose-free medium in an anaerobic chamber for 45 minutes. Cultures are then returned to the air/CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator for 23 hours before analysis. Propidium iodide (PI) is used as an indicator of cell death. PI is non toxic to neurones and has been used in many studies to ascertain cell viability. In damaged neurons PI enters and binds to nucleic acids. Bound PI shows increased emission at 635 nm when excited at 540 nm. One PI fluorescence image and one white light image are taken and the proportion of cell death analysed. The area of region CA1 is defined from the white light image and superimposed over the PI image. The PI signal is thresholded and area of PI damage expressed as a percentage of the CA1 area. Correlation between PI fluorescence and histologically confirmed cell death has been validated previously by Niss1-staining using cresyl fast violet (Newell et al., <i>J. Neurosci., </i>1995, 15, 7702-7711).

Cells were harvested using 0.25%trypsin/1 mM, EDTA, counted using a haemocytometer, and plated in 100 microliters of the appropriate media, at the following densities, in a 96-well tissue culture plate (Falcon 3075): HFF and A375P, 5,000 cells/well; all other cell lines, 10,000 cells/well. The next day, compounds were diluted in RPMI containing 100 micrograms/ml gentamicin, at twice the final required concentration, from 10 mM stock solutions in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). One hundred microliters per well of these dilutions were added to the 100 microliters of media currently on the cell plates. RPMI containing 0.6% DMSO was added to control wells. Compounds diluted in. The final concentration of DMSO in all wells was 0.3%. Cells were incubated at 37° C., 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 3 days. Medium was removed by aspiration. Cell biomass was estimated by staining cells with 90 μl per well methylene blue (Sigma M9140, 0.5% in 50:50 ethanol:water) and incubation at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Stain was removed, the plates rinsed by immersion in deionized water and air-dried. To release stain from the cells 100 μl of solubilization solution was added (1% N-lauroyl sarcosine, sodium salt, Sigma L5125, in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS)), and plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Optical density at 620 nM was measured on a microplate reader. Percent inhibition of cell growth was calculated relative to vehicle treated control wells. Concentration of compound that inhibits 50% of cell growth (IC<sub>50</sub>) was interpolated using nonlinear regression (Levenberg-Marquardt) and the equation, y=V<sub>max</sub>*(1−(x/(K+x)))+Y2, where “K” was equal to the IC<sub>50</sub>.</p>

Cells plus compound were incubated for an additional 72 hr at 37° C. under normal growth conditions. Cells were then assayed for viability using standard XTT/PMS*. Fifty microliters of XTT/PMS solution was added to each well and plates were incubated for 90 minutes at 37° C. Absorbance at 450 nM was then determined using a 96-well UV plate reader (Molecular Devices). Under these conditions, absorbance of untreated control cells at 450 nm was at least 1.0 optical density unit/ml. Percent viability of cells in each well was calculated from these data (having been corrected for background absorbance). It was equal to
