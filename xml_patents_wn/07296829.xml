<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to door handle assemblies. More particularly, the present invention relates to low-profile door handle assemblies having door handles actuated by a non-rotational motion.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional door handle assemblies typically include a pair of faceplates, a slide bolt, and a pair of door handles. The slide bolt is assembled inside a standard bore of a door so that when the slide bolt extends, it engages the door to an aperture in a wall thereby closing the door and allowing the door to be locked. The standard bore is covered by two opposing faceplates. The door handles protrude from the faceplates.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The height of a conventional door handle is typically 2.25 to 2.50 inches, as measured from a door surface. A conventional door often damages a wall, especially when a door is slammed into a wall. A wall can also be gradually damaged when a conventional door handle often contacts the wall. To minimize wall damage, people use devices, such as doorstops and rubber pads attached to the walls. However, doorstops and rubber pads are not aesthetically pleasing to some people. Doorstops and rubber pads also require additional cost, time, and effort to install. Additionally, doorstops and rubber pads leave permanent marks or holes on the wall when removed. Thus, a door handle that does not cause wall damage is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another problem with a conventional door handle assembly is it requires rotation of the handle to open a door. Rotating a door handle is difficult at times, particularly when carrying an object with both hands, or particularly when the user is elderly, physically challenged, or has wrist problems. Thus, a door handle assembly that allows a user to open a door without having to rotate the door handle is also desired.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A number of door handles and door handle assemblies are available. U.S. Pat. No. 2,260,74 ('74) discloses a low-profile handle assembly designed for automobiles. The handle assembly has a large disk-like plate. The front face of the disk-like plate is recessed and attaches a crossbar spanning across the recess. The crossbar has an offset projection at one of its ends to provide a finger piece for the handle assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A user would use the finger piece as a crank for raising and lowering the glass panels in windows. A user would also use the finger piece as a handhold or grip for use and assistance in closing the vehicle door. The problem with '74 is it only provides a handhold for opening or closing a door. The handhold does not actuate a lock or a slide bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 5,085,474 ('474) discloses a latch opener of the push-pull type. '474 has a base plate secured to a door. A handle is mounted on the base plate to pivot about a first axis. The handle is attached to an actuator. The actuator is mounted on the base plate to pivot about a second axis perpendicular to the first axis. The actuator includes a projecting arm engageable in an opening of a latch bolt housing. When the arm engages a latch bolt, the arm causes the latch bolt to slide and thereby allowing the door to open. The latch bolt housing has a coil spring to continuously bias the latch bolt into a position protruding out of the door thereby allowing the door to close. The problem with '474 is that its handle protrudes in a manner that can cause wall damage. Additionally, its actuator is composed of multiple parts, which makes the actuator susceptible to mechanical malfunction and which makes the actuator expensive to manufacture.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">ADVANTAGES OF ONE OR MORE EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The various embodiments of the present invention may, but do not necessarily, achieve one or more of the following advantages:</p>

Bolt <b>70</b> is preferably unitarily constructed. Bolt <b>70</b> may unitarily be constructed by molding or other techniques known in the art. A unitarily constructed bolt <b>70</b> provides a sturdier and thus more secure lock than a bolt made of multiple components. A lock provided by a bolt made of multiple components may easily be tampered. For example, if one component gives in to the tampering or if the component bends or breaks, the remaining components may lose the support provided by the component that gave in. In contrast, for a lock supported by a unitarily constructed bolt to be tampered, the entire bolt has to be destroyed. Since bolt <b>70</b> is usually positioned inside a standard bore of a door, tampering with bolt <b>70</b> may require destruction of the entire door.</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Door Handle</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Previously described embodiments have described a door handle that is operated by a pulling motion, no matter which direction the door swings when opened. However, it may be beneficial to provide door handle assemblies where the motion used to actuate the door handle also serves to open the door. For example, a pulling motion may be most useful to operate a door handle when a door will swing inward, towards a person opening the door. A pushing motion may be used to operate a door handle when a door is to swing outward, away from a person opening a door. In this way, opening the door requires less force and operates in a more fluid manner. Such an embodiment may be especially useful for the disabled or for those who are not able to apply large amounts of force to operate a door handle and open a door.</p>

Cam assembly <b>105</b> is rotatably supported and mounted between faceplates <b>448</b> and <b>449</b>. Faceplate <b>448</b> has a hole <b>510</b> and faceplate <b>449</b> has a hole <b>512</b>. Cam assembly <b>105</b> has an end <b>105</b>A, an end <b>105</b>B and a raised abutting portion <b>250</b>. End <b>105</b>A extends through hole <b>510</b> and end <b>105</b>B extends through hole <b>512</b>. Further details of cam assembly <b>105</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Can assembly <b>105</b> includes a cam portion <b>240</b> and a cam shaft <b>242</b>. Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, cam assembly <b>105</b> is shaped to fit with bolt <b>476</b> so as to lock the door. Raised abutting portion <b>250</b> is adapted to abut bolt <b>476</b> and prevent the bolt from sliding away from the frame plate <b>502</b> thereby locking the door.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">A cam latch <b>48</b> can be secured to end <b>105</b>A through the use of set screw <b>564</b>. When cam latch <b>48</b> is rotated in one direction, raised abuting portion <b>250</b> prevents movement of bolt <b>476</b>. Cam assembly <b>105</b> can further operate as previously described. An alternate cam access <b>244</b> can be mounted to end <b>105</b>B. Alternate cam access <b>244</b> can be a depression that allows a flathead screwdriver or key to rotate cam assembly <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>. When the door handle assembly <b>400</b> is not being actuated, roller <b>454</b> may rest at a first position <b>464</b> on actuator <b>430</b>. When handle <b>404</b> is pushed, roller <b>454</b> will travel along surface <b>460</b> of actuator <b>430</b>, eventually reaching a second position <b>466</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, during operation, force will be transmitted from handle <b>404</b>, through roller <b>454</b>, to actuator <b>430</b>. As roller <b>454</b> moves, the transmitted force will cause force to be applied to actuator <b>430</b> in different directions, causing actuator <b>430</b> to move. At the same time handle <b>404</b> will pivot about pin <b>419</b> with handle end <b>404</b>A moving toward faceplate <b>449</b>. A projection <b>470</b> of actuator <b>430</b> passes into actuator opening <b>474</b> formed in a bolt <b>476</b>. As roller <b>454</b> moves from first position <b>464</b> to second position <b>466</b>, projection <b>470</b> of actuator <b>430</b> will engage a portion of the interior of bolt <b>476</b> towards the interior of a door (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>), causing bolt <b>470</b> to be retracted away from a wall aperture in a wall (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Bolt <b>470</b> may be biased towards the frame plate by spring <b>78</b>. When force is no longer applied to door handle <b>404</b>, springs <b>78</b> and <b>542</b> will cause bolt <b>470</b> to be biased towards the frame plate <b>502</b>, in turn causing roller <b>454</b> to move from second position <b>466</b> back to first position <b>464</b> and handle <b>404</b> to move away from faceplate <b>449</b> back to an undepressed position.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The present invention is not limited by the position of roller <b>454</b> or curved surface <b>460</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 and 36</figref> another embodiment of a push door handle assembly <b>600</b> is shown. Push door handle assembly <b>600</b> can have a roller <b>454</b> that is mounted on actuator <b>430</b> using pin <b>602</b>. Curved surface <b>620</b> may be on door handle <b>404</b>. Operation of this embodiment is analogous to that of the door handle assembly <b>400</b> previously described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, the door can also be opened by the use of pull handle <b>406</b>. Pull handle <b>406</b> can operate the same as previously described for door handle assembly <b>20</b>. Pull handle <b>406</b> is rotatably mounted to faceplate <b>448</b> by pin <b>438</b>. Actuator <b>550</b> has an end <b>551</b> that extends into bolt aperture <b>476</b>. Pulling on handle <b>406</b> causes bolt <b>476</b> to retract allowing opening of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The components of door handle assembly <b>400</b> may be used with any previously described door handle assemblies, or with other door handle assemblies now existing or later developed, that are within the knowledge of one skilled in the art. In certain embodiments, a door handle assembly may be configured so that it has push handles on both sides of the door handle assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Conclusion</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Although the description above contains many specifications, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but as merely providing illustrations of some of presently preferred embodiments of this invention. Thus, the scope of the invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents rather than by the examples given.</p>
