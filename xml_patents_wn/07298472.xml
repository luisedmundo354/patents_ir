<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to fluid analysis assemblies generally, and more particularly to apparatus for analyzing fluids in analytical chemistry applications such as flow cells for use in spectrophotometry. This invention also relates to methods for fabricating such apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A variety of fluid analysis cell assemblies have been designed and implemented for use in analyzing fluid samples, particularly in analytical chemistry applications. Such fluid cell assemblies may be constructed to statically hold a pre-designated volume of fluid to be analyzed, or may instead be configured as a flow cell, which are typically used to transport fluid samples through an analysis chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In flow cell arrangements, fluid samples are typically transported through a chamber disposed between a radiant energy source and a radiant energy detector, which detector measures the relevant radiant energy wavelength absorption or transmission through the fluid sample. An example of such a detector is a spectrophotometer. Various analytical instruments then utilize the absorbed versus transmitted radiant energy to determine the composition of the associated fluid sample.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To efficiently pass the radiant energy through the fluid sample in the analysis chamber, however, the wall defining the fluid-containing chamber is preferably a material having an index of refraction that is less than that of the fluid sample. Such an index of refraction relationship between the fluid sample and the analysis chamber wall assists in internally reflecting, and thereby propagating the radiant energy waves through the fluid sample analysis chamber. Description of this phenomenon is found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,678,051 and 6,734,961, which are assigned to the same assignee in the present application, and which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to best utilize aqueous fluid samples, therefore, a material having an index of refraction less than that of water is needed to at least form a liner of the fluid analysis chamber wall. One such material is a fluorinated polymer product sold by E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company of Wilmington, Delaware under the trade name Teflon AF®. It is therefore a desired aspect of the fluid analysis cells of the present invention to incorporate a layer of Teflon AF® or other low index of refraction material therewithin to allow efficient radiant energy propagation in spectrophotometry applications.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While various such fluid sample analysis cells and assemblies are currently utilized in the field, certain operational and implementational deficiencies exist. For example, multi-unit flow cell assemblies have found difficulty in being hydraulically sealed to one another when relatively rigid materials such as stainless steel are desired in the fabrication of the bulk cell body parts. In addition, methods for installing radiant energy guiding elements into such flow cells, and particularly those manufactured from stainless steel, have been met with limited success, or are relatively inefficient and expensive to implement.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore a principal object of the present invention to provide an improved fluid sample analysis apparatus having design features enabling the use of a plurality of distinct metallic cell bodies in fluid connection and hydraulically sealed with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is another object of the present invention to provide an assembly methodology for installing a radiant energy guiding member into a fluid analysis cell body.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a further object of the present invention to provide an outer housing for frictionally securing a multi-unit flow cell assembly in axial alignment therewithin.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">By means of the present invention, an improved fluid sample analysis apparatus is provided for simplifying construction and enhancing the reliability of mounting accuracy of radiant energy guiding members therewithin. Such enhanced accuracy and repeatability of fluid analysis cell construction correspondingly enhances the accuracy achievable in spectrophotometry of fluid samples being analyzed within such cells.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a particular embodiment, the fluid analysis apparatus of the present invention includes a cell body assembly having first and second distinct portions in fluid and optical communication with one another, with each of the first and second portions having respective first ends being operably disposed in adjacent facing relationship with one another. In order to enable hydraulic sealing between such distinct first and second portions, a first resilient gasket is interposed therebetween, and preferably is fabricated from a resilient combination of Kapton® or a coated metal substrate, with such metal substrates having a coating material selected from PTFE, fluorourethane, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first resilient gasket preferably includes a first radiant energy aperture that is in operable alignment with a radiant energy inlet of the first portion and a fluid sample analysis chamber of the second portion. The gasket further includes a second fluid sample outlet aperture that is in operable alignment with respective first and second fluid sample outlets of the first and second portions. Additionally, the gasket includes a fluid sample transfer groove extending from a fluid sample inlet portion of the gasket that is in operable alignment with a fluid sample inlet of the first portion to the first radiant energy aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain embodiments of the invention, and particularly in cell body assembly embodiments which are relatively long as measured along a central longitudinal axis, an outer housing is provided for at least partially enclosing the cell body assembly. The outer housing preferably includes a first base portion and a substantially cylindrical side wall that extends therefrom. The side wall preferably at least partially concentrically encloses the cell body assembly with an inner diameter of the side wall being specifically dimensioned to frictionally engage an outer periphery of the cell body assembly.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The objects and advantages enumerated above together with other objects, features, and advances represented by the present invention will now be presented in terms of detailed embodiments described with reference to the attached drawing figures which are intended to be representative of various possible configurations of the invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are recognized as being within the grasp of those having ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With reference now to the drawing figures, and first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a fluid analysis apparatus <b>10</b> of the present invention is shown in cross-section, and includes a cell body assembly <b>12</b> having first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> which are operably disposed in fluid and optical communication with one another. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> are preferably mutually independent units that are disposed in axially adjacent relationship with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">First portion <b>15</b> includes a first end <b>22</b> and a substantially opposed second surface <b>24</b>. In addition, second portion <b>16</b> includes a first end <b>32</b> and a second substantially opposed end <b>34</b>, with first end <b>22</b> of first portion <b>15</b> being operably disposed in facing relationship with first end <b>32</b> of second portion <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As best illustrated in the isolation view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, first portion <b>15</b> includes an inlet bore <b>26</b>, a first outlet bore <b>28</b>, and a radiant energy inlet bore <b>30</b>. Inlet tube <b>42</b> is preferably disposed within inlet bore <b>26</b>. Such tube <b>42</b> is preferably fabricated from an inert material such as PEEK, PTFE, and the like. Inlet tube <b>42</b> extends through an axial length “L<b>1</b>” of first portion <b>15</b> so as to direct fluid flowing therewithin to first end <b>22</b> of first portion <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">First outlet bore <b>28</b> preferably axially extends through length “L<b>1</b>” of first portion <b>15</b>. Preferably, outlet tube <b>44</b> is a unitary piece of tubing extending from second end <b>34</b> of second portion <b>16</b> through first portion <b>15</b> via first outlet bore <b>28</b> and second outlet bore <b>38</b>. Outlet tube <b>44</b> is preferably fabricated from an inert material such as PEEK, PTFE, and the like. Inlet tube <b>42</b> is preferably compressively friction fit within inlet bore <b>26</b> of first portion <b>15</b>. Outlet tube <b>44</b> is preferably compressively friction fit within first outlet bore <b>28</b> at second portion <b>16</b>, while preferably not being friction fit within first outlet bore <b>28</b> at first portion <b>15</b>. Alternatively, however, the frictional fit of inlet and outlet tubes <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> within respective bores of first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> may be enhanced through the utilization of adhesives, spot welds, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, a radiant energy transmitting member <b>31</b> is operably disposed in radiant energy inlet bore <b>30</b> of first portion <b>15</b>. Radiant energy transmitting member <b>31</b> is preferably a substantially transparent element that efficiently propagates radiant energy axially therethrough. Accordingly, radiant energy transmitting member <b>31</b> is preferably a fiber optic element secured within bore <b>30</b> extending axially through first portion <b>15</b> from first end <b>22</b> through second end <b>25</b>. Radiant energy transmitting member <b>31</b> is preferably conventionally secured within such bore <b>30</b>, such as through a friction fit, adhesive securement, combinations thereof, as well as other fixation methods. Radiant energy transmitting member <b>31</b> preferably receives radiant energy from a radiant energy source (not shown) and efficiently transmits such radiant energy axially through first portion <b>15</b>. While a fiber optic element for radiant energy transmitting member <b>31</b> is preferred, other radiant energy transmitting materials may be alternatively utilized, as is recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As best illustrated in the isolation view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, second portion <b>16</b> preferably includes a second outlet bore <b>38</b> that is operably aligned with first outlet bore <b>28</b>. As such, second outlet bore <b>38</b> axially extends through length “L<b>2</b>” of second portion <b>16</b>. In such a manner, outlet tube <b>44</b> axially extends through respective first and second outlet bores <b>28</b>, <b>38</b>. In addition, second portion <b>16</b> preferably includes a fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> which comprises a bore extending axially through second portion <b>16</b>, and in axial operable alignment with radiant energy inlet bore <b>30</b> of first portion <b>15</b>. In particular, a central axis <b>47</b> of fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> is preferably substantially coincident with a central axis of the radiant energy inlet bore <b>30</b> in first portion <b>15</b>. As such, radiant energy being transmitted through first portion <b>15</b> is delivered to first end <b>48</b> of fluid analysis chamber <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Preferably, a radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> is axially disposed within the axial bore defining fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> preferably forms a tube radially disposed about central axis <b>47</b> of fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>. In such a manner, radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> concentrically surrounds an axis of radiant energy travel through radiant energy transmitting member <b>31</b> and through fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>, as defined by central axis <b>47</b>. Radiant energy, therefore, is allowed to enter fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> in a zone defined by inner diameter <b>53</b> of radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As described hereinabove, radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> is preferably fabricated from a material selected for its optical properties, and specifically for radiant energy propagation characteristics. In applications such as those contemplated by the present invention wherein radiant energy is being operably propagated through a fluid field, it is desirable that the material forming the channel wall confining the fluid sample and radiant energy has an index of refraction less than that of the fluid sample being analyzed. Since, in certain applications, the fluid sample being analyzed by the apparatus of the present invention may be aqueous, radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> is preferably fabricated from a material having index of refraction less than that of water. A particularly preferred example of such a material is a fluorinated polymer product manufactured and sold by E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company under the trade name Teflon AF® 2400. Applicants have determined that a radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> being fabricated from Teflon AF® 2400 provides desired radiant energy propagation characteristics in the apparatus of the present invention. Accordingly, radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> may take the form of a tube radially disposed about central axis <b>47</b> and fabricated from Teflon AF® 2400.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments of the present invention, radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> is at least partially coaxially contained within a sleeve member <b>56</b>, which sleeve member <b>56</b> assists in centrally aligning radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> within the bore defining fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>, as well as inserting radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> into fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>. Preferably, sleeve member <b>56</b> is fabricated a relatively resilient polymeric material such as TEFZEL®, FEP, or PTFE. TEFZEL® is available from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company of Wilmington, Del.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As noted above, radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> preferably acts to propagate radiant energy through an internal channel defined by inner wall <b>53</b> thereof. Materials which are currently commercially available for use in radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> are typically substantially transparent. Thus, radiant energy impinging upon, for example, first end <b>48</b> of radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> may pass axially through a sidewall of radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> to second end <b>50</b> thereof. The passage of such radiant energy is considered “stray light”, which can detrimentally affect the accuracy of spectrophoresis fluid analysis due to the fact that a certain portion of the radiant energy passing through fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> has not passed through the fluid sample being analyzed. Accordingly, it is an important aspect of the fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> of the present invention to effectively mask or otherwise prevent radiant energy from passing through fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> without first passing through the fluid sample being analyzed. One method of masking such stray light is in fabricating and installing a physical masking element that is placed at first end <b>48</b> of fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>, with such masking element having an aperture disposed therein, and which aperture is operably aligned with the open channel defined by radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b>, such that radiant energy is not allowed to enter into the sidewall of radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b>. Another method for effectively preventing the transmission of stray light through fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> is to render opaque at least a portion of radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> and sleeve member <b>56</b>. A method for blocking stray light through the use of an opaque radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,734,961, which is assigned to the same assignee as in the present invention, and the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, fluid analysis apparatus <b>10</b> preferably further includes a first resilient gasket <b>62</b> interposed between respective first ends <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> of first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> of cell body assembly <b>12</b>. Resilient gasket <b>62</b> preferably acts to fluidly couple and hydraulically seal first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> to one another. As best illustrated in the isolation top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, resilient gasket <b>62</b> includes a first radiant energy aperture <b>64</b> that is mounted in fluid analysis apparatus <b>10</b> in operable alignment with radiant energy inlet bore <b>30</b> and fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>, and more particularly in operable alignment with radiant energy transmitting member <b>31</b> and the central channel defined by inner wall <b>53</b> of radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b>. As such, radiant energy is allowed to pass through aperture <b>64</b> from radiant energy transmitting member <b>31</b> to within a channel defined by radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b>. As described above, a particular aspect of the present invention is to prevent and otherwise mask radiant energy being delivered by radiant energy transmitting member <b>31</b> to enter into the sidewall of radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b>. As such, first radiant energy aperture <b>64</b> in resilient gasket <b>62</b> may be of a dimensional tolerance allowing for a substantial diametrical match between first radiant energy aperture <b>64</b> and the channel defined by radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b>. In such an embodiment, resilient gasket <b>62</b> is preferably fabricated from a substantially opaque material. Since alignment of resilient gasket <b>62</b> with fluid analysis apparatus <b>10</b> may be difficult where the diametrical size of first radiant energy aperture <b>64</b> is substantially equal to the channel defined by radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b>, certain embodiments of the present invention provide for a first radiant energy aperture <b>64</b> having a diameter somewhat greater than the diameter of the channel defined by radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b>, particularly where radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> is made opaque in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 6,734,961 referenced above so as not to permit passage of radiant energy through the sidewall of guiding member <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Resilient gasket <b>62</b> preferably further includes a second fluid sample outlet aperture <b>66</b> that is preferably installed in fluid analysis apparatus <b>10</b> in operable alignment with respective first and second outlet bores <b>28</b>, <b>38</b> of first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>. As such, fluid sample outlet tube <b>44</b> preferably extends through second fluid sample outlet aperture <b>66</b> of first resilient gasket <b>62</b>. As a consequence of fluid sample outlet tube <b>44</b> being unitary, the diametrical dimension of second fluid sample outlet aperture <b>66</b> may be larger than the respective diameters of the first and second fluid outlet bores <b>28</b>, <b>38</b>. In fact, it is a preferred aspect of the present invention to provide second fluid sample outlet aperture <b>66</b> with a diameter substantially greater than first and second outlet bores <b>28</b>, <b>38</b> so as to facilitate placement and alignment of first resilient gasket <b>62</b> within fluid analysis apparatus <b>10</b>. Second fluid sample aperture <b>66</b> is preferably at least about 0.010 inches in diameter, and more preferably between about 0.010 and 0.060 inches in diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, first resilient gasket <b>62</b> preferably further includes a fluid sample transfer groove <b>68</b> extending from a fluid sample inlet portion <b>70</b> to first radiant energy aperture <b>64</b>. Fluid sample inlet portion <b>70</b> of first resilient gasket <b>62</b> is preferably installed in fluid analysis apparatus <b>10</b> in operable alignment with inlet bore <b>26</b> of first portion <b>15</b>, and particularly in alignment with inlet tube <b>42</b> extending through inlet bore <b>26</b>. As a result, fluid sample exiting from inlet tube <b>42</b> at first end <b>22</b> of first portion <b>15</b> is directed toward and to first radiant energy aperture <b>64</b> via fluid sample transfer groove <b>68</b>. Inlet sample fluid then enters into fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> through radiant energy aperture <b>64</b> of resilient gasket <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In preferred embodiments of the present invention, fluid sample transfer groove <b>68</b> extends only partially through a thickness dimension of first resilient gasket <b>62</b>, as illustrated in the cross-sectional end view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. One purpose for extending groove <b>68</b> only partially through thickness dimension “T” of resilient gasket <b>62</b> is to maintain the opacity of resilient gasket <b>62</b> at all locations except for apertures <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>, such that incoming radiant energy passing from radiant energy transmitting member <b>31</b> does not leak into the sidewall of radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b>. In embodiments utilizing an opaque radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b>, however, fluid sample transfer groove <b>68</b> extends completely through a thickness dimension “T” of first resilient gasket <b>62</b>. Moreover, fluid sample inlet portion <b>70</b> may extend either partially or fully through thickness dimension “T” of first resilient gasket <b>62</b> as desired per application.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In particularly preferred embodiments of the present invention, first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> of cell body assembly <b>12</b> are fabricated from an inert metallic material such as stainless steel. A deficiency in conventional fluid analysis systems that is addressed by the present invention is in the hydraulic sealing of distinct metallic components to one another, such as in the hydraulic sealing of first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> of cell body assembly <b>12</b>. Conventional designs are unable to hydraulically seal metallic components such as first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> to one another in order to prevent fluid leakage when operating under relatively high internal fluid pressures. First resilient gasket <b>62</b>, however, enables the hydraulic sealing of first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> to one another to a sufficient degree so as to maintain a hydraulic seal even under relatively high contemplated operating fluid pressures. In a like manner, second resilient gasket <b>92</b> enables the hydraulic sealing of second portion <b>16</b> to cell window <b>96</b>. In order to enable such a hydraulic seal, gasket <b>62</b> is preferably fabricated from a resilient and compliant material, but which maintains its structural integrity and operational alignment characteristics when press-fit between first and second portions <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. Example materials useful in gaskets <b>62</b> and <b>92</b> of the present invention include Kapton® or coated metal substrates, such as stainless steel metal substrates coated on one or both major surfaces <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> with a resilient material such as PTFE or fluorourethane. Fluorourethane useful in topical coating applications of gaskets <b>62</b>, <b>92</b> of the present invention are available from 21<sup>st </sup>Century Coatings of Vancouver, British Columbia, or by direct synthesis as described in “Fluoropolymers 1, Synthesis” by Hougham et al. 1999.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Gasket <b>62</b> is preferably about 50 μm in thickness dimension “T”. In embodiments wherein gasket <b>62</b> is a coated metal substrate, the metal substrate is about 50 μm thick, while the resilient material coating is between about 1 and 40 μm thick on each major surface <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Where first or second gaskets <b>62</b>, <b>92</b> are fabricated from non-opaque materials, or materials that do not render the finished gasket opaque due to the relatively small thickness thereof, radiant energy aperture <b>64</b> may preferably include, for example, a metalized coating radially disposed about a circumference thereof. Such a metalized coating preferably radially extends about aperture <b>64</b> to an extent sufficient to block stray light entering the sidewall of radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b>. As such, the metalized coating extends between about 100 and 500 μm beyond an outer circumferential dimension of aperture <b>64</b>. Alternatively, opaque coatings of non-metallic materials may be disposed about the perimeter of aperture <b>64</b>. Such opaque coatings, however, are not necessary where radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> includes a radiant energy blocking opaque portion, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a particular aspect of the present invention, the thickness dimension “T” of gaskets <b>62</b>, <b>92</b> result in a known transfer zone length <b>65</b> of aperture <b>64</b> through which the sample fluid and radiant energy concurrently travel. In operation, sample fluid fills aperture <b>64</b> throughout transfer zone length <b>65</b>, thereby resulting in calculatable radiant energy losses as the radiant energy passes through the fluid-filled transfer zone <b>65</b> which is absent radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b>. As a result, radiant energy entering aperture <b>64</b> is allowed to disperse throughout the volume defined by transfer zone <b>65</b>, causing partial diffusion or loss of the radiant energy. Fluids having relatively higher refractive indexes result in a greater degree of radiant energy loss in transfer zone <b>65</b> as compared to fluids having relatively lower refractive indexes. This relationship is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,678,051, which is assigned to the same assignee as in the present application, and is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Using such a relationship, a fabricator of cell body assembly <b>12</b> of the present invention may select an appropriate thickness dimension “T” for one or more of first and second gaskets <b>62</b>, <b>92</b> to thereby define a desired transfer zone dimension <b>65</b> which corresponds to a calculatable amount of radiant energy loss in passing through aperture <b>64</b>. Such a controllable variable allows the fabricator to install one or more gaskets <b>62</b>, <b>92</b> of known thickness dimension “T” that effectively calibrate energy losses through apparatus <b>10</b> when utilized in connection with various fluids having different indexes of refraction. In such a manner, radiant energy losses through apparatus <b>10</b> may be standardized for use with various fluids by assigning gaskets <b>62</b>, <b>92</b> of appropriate calibrating thickness, “T”.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, a relatively high refractive index fluid being operably disposed within aperture <b>64</b> is preferably utilized in combination with one or more gaskets, <b>62</b>, <b>92</b> having a relatively smaller thickness dimension “T” to offset the relatively higher degree of radiant energy loss caused by the relatively high refractive index fluid. Correspondingly, a relatively larger thickness dimension “T” for gasket <b>62</b>, <b>92</b> may be employed where a relatively lower refractive index fluid is being utilized in apparatus <b>10</b>. Through such a methodology, unique gasket combinations may be utilized as appropriate for the respective fluid being operably exposed to the radiant energy transmitted through apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, fluid analysis apparatus <b>10</b> preferably includes an outer housing <b>82</b> having a first base portion <b>84</b> and a substantially cylindrical sidewall <b>86</b> extending from base portion <b>84</b> so as to at least partially concentrically enclose cell body assembly <b>12</b> within a boundary defined by the combination of base portion <b>84</b> and sidewall <b>86</b>. Preferably, inner diameter “D<sub>1</sub>” of sidewall <b>86</b> is specifically dimensioned to allow first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> to be inserted into the chamber defined by base portion <b>84</b> and sidewall <b>86</b> with a circumferential clearance of between about 5 and 20 μm. It has been determined by the Applicants that an operational advantage of accurate axial alignment among a plurality of distinct units making up cell body assembly <b>12</b> is facilitated through the incorporation of a distinct outer housing unit <b>82</b>. As such, at least first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> are accurately axially aligned with one another simply by installing such first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> within the at least partial confines of outer housing <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the past, inefficient manual alignment of multiple distinct parts making up cell body assembly <b>12</b> was required in order to insure correct axial alignment among such distinct elements making up cell body assemblies <b>12</b>. Outer housing <b>82</b> of the present invention eliminates this inefficient procedure by preparing a compartment of predetermined dimensions which closely secures cell body <b>12</b> therewithin. Such a utility is particularly applicable in cell body assemblies <b>12</b> having relatively longer total length “L<b>3</b>” dimensions. Preferably, cell body assembly <b>12</b>, including nut <b>14</b>, has a total length “L<b>3</b>” of between about 2 and about 100 mm, with particularly preferred embodiments of cell body assembly <b>12</b> being 3, 5, 10, 25, and 75 mm in total length “L<b>3</b>”.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments of the present invention, outer housing <b>82</b> includes an anti-rotation member <b>88</b> disposed in sidewall <b>86</b> for operable engagement with a correspondingly-configured notch <b>79</b> in first portion <b>15</b>. Such notch <b>79</b>, however, may instead be located in second portion <b>16</b>. Moreover, more than one anti-rotation member/notch combinations may be incorporated into fluid analysis apparatus <b>10</b> of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a second resilient gasket <b>92</b> is preferably interposed between second end <b>34</b> of second portion <b>16</b> and base portion <b>84</b> of outer housing <b>82</b>. Second resilient gasket <b>92</b> may preferably be identical to first resilient gasket <b>62</b>, but with fluid sample inlet portion <b>70</b> of first resilient gasket <b>62</b> acting as a second fluid sample outlet portion in second resilient gasket <b>92</b>. Accordingly, fluid sample inlet portion <b>70</b> may comprise an aperture extending through thickness dimension “T” for purposes of second resilient gasket <b>92</b>. As so configured, second fluid sample outlet aperture <b>70</b> of second resilient gasket <b>92</b> is installed in fluid analysis apparatus <b>10</b> in operable alignment with second outlet bore <b>38</b> of second portion <b>16</b>. In such a manner, fluid sample exiting from fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> is directed into second outlet bore <b>38</b>, and particularly into fluid sample outlet tube <b>44</b> via second fluid sample outlet aperture <b>70</b> in second resilient gasket <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Second resilient gasket <b>92</b> is preferably provided at second end <b>34</b> of second portion <b>16</b> so as to provide a hydraulic seal between second portion <b>16</b> and a window <b>96</b> disposed in base portion <b>84</b> of outer housing <b>82</b>. As is known in the art, window <b>96</b> may be fabricated from, for example, fused silica, diamond, sapphire, or other inert materials transparent to the radiant energy wavelength being utilized in apparatus <b>10</b>, and is utilized to transmit radiant energy exiting from fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> to a radiant energy detector (not shown). Second resilient gasket <b>92</b> is preferably fabricated from materials as described above with reference to first resilient gasket <b>62</b>. Moreover, second resilient gasket <b>92</b> is preferably oriented such that transfer groove <b>68</b> is in operable facing relationship with window <b>96</b>, thereby reducing fluidically unswept volume.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Preferably, a third gasket <b>99</b> is operably disposed between window <b>96</b> and base portion <b>84</b> to thereby assist in ensuring proper alignment between second surface <b>34</b> of second portion <b>16</b> and window <b>96</b>. Third gasket <b>99</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as having an aperture <b>101</b> of a dimension large enough to avoid blockage or interference of radiant energy exiting from window <b>96</b> through base portion <b>84</b>. Third gasket <b>99</b> is preferably fabricated from a resilient material that operably compresses between window <b>96</b> and base portion <b>84</b> when pressure is applied to window <b>96</b> from second portion <b>16</b> as a result of nut <b>14</b> driving first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> toward base portion <b>84</b>. Such a compressible third gasket <b>99</b> assists in allowing respective substantially planar surfaces, as between window <b>96</b> and second surface <b>34</b> of second portion <b>16</b> to become-parallely aligned with one another through the axial mounting of second portion <b>16</b> against window <b>96</b> via the tightening of nut <b>14</b> within outer body <b>82</b>. Most preferably, third gasket <b>99</b> is fabricated from a transparent inert material such as FEP, TEFZEL®, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the embodiment of second portion <b>16</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a first locking structure <b>112</b> is provided at fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>, and disposed adjacent to first end <b>48</b> of fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>. First locking structure <b>112</b> is preferably a design detail of second portion <b>16</b> of cell body assembly <b>12</b>, and is specifically configured to operably and statically secure radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> within fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>. First locking structure <b>112</b> acts to operably inhibit relative motion between the combination of radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> and sleeve member <b>56</b> with respect to second portion <b>16</b>. Such resistance to movement is developed through only the frictional resistance forces developed at the interface between first locking structure <b>112</b> and sleeve member <b>56</b>, due to the fact that sleeve member <b>56</b> is securely compressively fit in fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> against chamber wall <b>49</b>. In addition, radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> is frictionally secured to sleeve member <b>56</b> through a process described hereinbelow. First locking structure <b>112</b>, therefore, provides a focal point for generating a relatively large degree of frictional resistance to relative motion between sleeve member <b>56</b> and second portion <b>16</b>, thereby lockably retaining radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> within fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Preferably, fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> includes a first diameter dimension D<sub>2 </sub>extending through a first length x<sub>1 </sub>of fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> and a second diameter dimension D<sub>3 </sub>extending through a second length x<sub>2 </sub>of fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, second diameter dimension D<sub>3 </sub>is preferably somewhat larger than first diameter dimension D<sub>2 </sub>by an amount sufficient to provide first locking structure <b>112</b> with an adequate focal point of frictional resistance to relative motion between sleeve member <b>56</b> and second portion <b>16</b>. Preferably, second diameter dimension D<sub>3 </sub>is larger than first diameter dimension D<sub>2 </sub>by about 0.001 inches, with first diameter dimension D<sub>2 </sub>being about 0.03 inches. The change in diameter dimension of fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> at first locking structure <b>112</b> forms a first transition segment <b>118</b> that is preferably angularly oriented to chamber wall <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, second portion <b>16</b> may additionally include a second locking structure <b>114</b> having a second transition segment <b>120</b> formed therewith. The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is representative of a variety of configurations for first and second locking structures <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>. For example, first and second transition segments <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> may alternatively reflect a different configuration altogether. In addition, second diameter dimension D<sub>3 </sub>may alternatively be smaller than first diameter dimension D<sub>2</sub>, or may be alternated among first and second locking structures <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>. Furthermore, one or more of such locking structures <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> may be incorporated into the apparatus of present invention while remaining within the scope contemplated by the Applicants. The embodiments shown and described herein merely represent examples of internal alterations in diameter dimension of fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> so as to create one or more foci of frictional resistance between sleeve member <b>56</b> and chamber wall <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A preferred method for securely installing radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> within fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> includes a sleeved compression technique that utilizes the resilient nature of sleeve member <b>56</b>. Sleeve member <b>56</b>, as described above, is preferably fabricated from a relatively resilient material such as TEFZEL® or the like, and is shaped as a tube having an unstressed outer diameter that is slightly larger than second diameter dimension D<sub>3 </sub>of fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>, and an inner diameter dimension that is substantially equal to but slightly larger than an outer diameter of radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b>. Initially, radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> is inserted into the channel defined by sleeve member <b>56</b>, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Sleeve member <b>56</b> is preferably initially somewhat longer than radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> so as to provide a location at second end <b>51</b> for grasping and pulling sleeve member <b>56</b> into and through fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Sleeve member <b>56</b> is preferably operably elongated along direction “Y”, which elongation reduces both the inner and outer diameter of sleeve member <b>56</b> so as to be small enough to be fed through fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>. Such diameter reduction of sleeve member <b>56</b> further acts to tightly frictionally engage radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> therewithin. However, the elastic limit of sleeve member <b>56</b> should not be exceeded during the installation procedure. Once the combination of sleeve number <b>56</b> and radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> are in place within fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b>, the combination is allowed to relax under its inherent resilient restorative forces to thereby frictionally engage and secure sleeve member <b>56</b> to chamber wall <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">To further enhance and assist the physical relaxation of sleeve number <b>56</b> and radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> into the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, one or more thermal treatment cycles are conducted on the installed combination of sleeve member <b>56</b> and radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> within second portion <b>16</b>. A thermal cycle represents elevating the temperature environment surrounding the combination to between about 80 and 100 degrees Celsius for a period of about 10 minutes. Though the ramp up and ramp down rates are not overly critical to the thermal cycle performance, it has been found that a preferred temperature ramp up rate of 10 degrees Celsius per minute, and a ramp down rate of 20 degrees Celsius per minute is preferred. In a particular embodiment of the invention, 4 cycles between ambient temperature and a maximum thermal treatment temperature of about 80 degrees Celsius are preformed on the combination to fully relax sleeve member <b>56</b> and radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> into frictional engagement with chamber wall <b>49</b> consistent with the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Once the thermal cycles are complete, excess material extending out from fluid sample analysis chamber <b>46</b> is cleaved using, for example, a microtoming procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> is left as a substantially transparent body, sleeve member <b>56</b> may also be manufactured using semitransparent materials, as first gasket <b>62</b> is, in such embodiments, is configured to mask all stray light from entering both sleeve member <b>56</b> and light guiding member <b>52</b>. In the circumstance where in radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> is rendered opaque as described above, first gasket <b>62</b> need not mask stray light, so long as sleeve member <b>56</b> is also fabricated from opaque materials. In embodiments wherein both sleeve member <b>56</b> and radiant energy guiding member <b>52</b> are opaque to an extent necessary to prevent passage of stray light therethrough, first gasket <b>62</b> is merely required to serve as a fluid directing element, a spacing element, and a compliant sealing element between adjacent portions of cell body assembly <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another embodiment of the present invention, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, apparatus <b>210</b> includes a cell body assembly <b>212</b> operably disposed within outer body <b>282</b>. Nut <b>214</b> is preferably threadably insertable within outer body <b>282</b>, and operably presses against spring washers <b>213</b> in order to tightly install first, second, and third portions <b>215</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>217</b> within outer body <b>282</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, cell body assembly <b>212</b> includes first portion <b>215</b>, a second portion <b>216</b>, and third portion <b>217</b>. First portion <b>215</b> includes an inlet bore <b>226</b> in which inlet tubing <b>242</b> is operably disposed, but does not incorporate a first outlet bore as described with reference to numeral <b>28</b> in first portion <b>15</b> of apparatus <b>10</b>. Instead, third portion <b>217</b> includes a fluid outlet bore <b>229</b> and outlet tubing <b>233</b> for operably enabling the removal of sample fluid from apparatus <b>210</b>. Due to the inclusion of outlet bore <b>229</b> and outlet tubing <b>233</b> in third portion <b>217</b>, second portion <b>216</b> preferably does not include an outlet bore disposed therein as described with reference to first outlet bore <b>38</b> in apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Third portion <b>217</b> preferably further includes a radiant energy outlet bore <b>281</b> in which a fiber optic element <b>282</b> is operably disposed for transmitting radiant energy from fluid analysis chamber <b>246</b> to a radiant energy detector (not shown). In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, therefore, third portion <b>217</b> replaces window <b>96</b> of apparatus <b>10</b> in transmitting radiant energy out from apparatus <b>210</b>. Furthermore, cell body assembly <b>212</b> preferably utilizes first and second resilient gaskets <b>262</b>, <b>292</b> as described above with reference to first and second resilient gaskets <b>62</b>, <b>92</b>. However, second resilient gasket <b>292</b> is preferably oriented to align transfer groove <b>268</b> between fluid analysis chamber <b>246</b> and outlet bore <b>229</b> of third portion <b>217</b>, such that fluid exiting fluid analysis chamber <b>246</b> is operably directed to outlet tubing <b>233</b>. A further aspect of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is that both first and third portions <b>215</b>, <b>217</b> may be manufactured as substantially identically components, and need only be positioned within apparatus <b>210</b> in a reverse orientation with respect to one another in order to effectuate input and withdrawal of both fluid sample and radiant energy into and out from cell body assembly <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A further embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, wherein apparatus <b>310</b> includes a first portion <b>315</b> as described above with reference to first portion <b>15</b> of apparatus <b>10</b>, a second portion <b>316</b> configured in accordance with second portion <b>16</b> of apparatus <b>10</b>, and first and second resilient gaskets <b>362</b>, <b>392</b> fabricated and configured in accordance with first and second resilient gaskets <b>62</b>, <b>92</b> of apparatus <b>10</b>. However, apparatus <b>310</b> preferably includes a third portion <b>317</b> functionally positioned in place of window <b>96</b> of apparatus <b>10</b>, wherein third portion <b>317</b> includes a radiant energy outlet bore <b>381</b> having an outlet radiant energy transmitting member <b>383</b> disposed therein for operably transmitting radiant energy from fluid analysis chamber <b>346</b> to a radiant energy detector (not shown). Third portion <b>317</b> is preferably hydraulically sealed to second portion <b>316</b> through a compression fit with second resilient gasket <b>392</b> disposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, cell body assembly <b>12</b> is preferably radialy secured in place by outer housing <b>82</b>. However, the plurality of distinct portions, such as first and second portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> of cell body assembly <b>12</b> may additionally require fasteners, such as nut <b>14</b> for axially coupling first and second distinct portions <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> to one another. Other means of securing respective components of cell body assembly <b>12</b> in place include, for example, clamping devices, adhesives, and the like. As is further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, base portion <b>84</b> is preferably operably secured to sidewall <b>86</b> of outer housing <b>82</b> via screws <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The invention has been described herein in considerable detail in order to comply with the patent statutes, and to provide those skilled in the art with the information needed to apply the novel principles and to construct and use embodiments of the invention as required.
