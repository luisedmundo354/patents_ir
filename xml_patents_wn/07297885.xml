<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A conventional pressure switch <b>9</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and generally includes a push member <b>91</b>, a first plate <b>92</b>, a second plate <b>93</b>, a first contact point <b>94</b>, a second contact point <b>95</b>, a spring member <b>96</b> and a rectangular box <b>97</b> which receives all the parts therein. When the pressure of water is too low, the pump can be automatically activated to maintain a desired pressure in pipes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When the pressure of water is high, the push member <b>91</b> pushes the first plate <b>92</b> which drives the second plate <b>93</b> and the first contact point <b>94</b> is moved by the second plate <b>93</b> to be separated from the second contact point <b>95</b> so as to stop the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the water pressure in pipes is lowered and smaller than the spring force of the spring member <b>96</b> in the pressure switch <b>9</b>, the spring member <b>96</b> drives the two contact points <b>94</b>, <b>95</b> to be in contact with each other to activate the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, when the direction of water flow form the inlet <b>98</b> and the swing direction of the first contact point <b>94</b> need a certain space to work so that the box <b>97</b> has to be large enough to receive all the parts therein. Besides, the inlet <b>98</b> is located off from the center of the box <b>97</b> so that it requires a larger space to install the box <b>97</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention intends to provide a pressure switch wherein the direction of water flow form the inlet and the swing direction of the contact point are the same so that the box can be a cylindrical box and the inlet is located at the central axis of the box. This reduces the manufacturing cost.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention relates to a pressure switch which comprises a box and an outer cover is connected to an open end of the box and an inlet is defined through the outer cover, an inner cover is engaged with the open end and has a central hole. A film is located between the outer cover and the inner cover, and has a push portion which extends through the inner cover. An initializing device has a rod and a first spring which is mounted to the rod and one end of the rod extends through a close end of the box. A first plate has a pivot end pivotably connected to the inner cover and a through hole is defined through the first plate. The first plate is located between the first spring and the push portion. A mounting hole is defined through the first plate so that the rod extends through the mounting hole. A second plate extends through the through hole of the first plate and has a pivotal end which is located opposite to the pivot end of the first plate and connected to the inner cover. An activation device is located above the first and second plates and includes a frame and a pull rod which is connected to a center of the frame. A second spring member is connected between a lug of the second plate and the pull rod. A first contact unit and a second contact unit are located on two sides of the pull rod and connected to the frame. When the pull rod is pulled by the second spring, the first and second contact units are in contact with each other.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In order to reinforce the spring force that is applied to the first plate <b>6</b>, a third spring <b>55</b> is mounted to the rod <b>51</b> and located at inner periphery of the first spring <b>52</b>. Each of the first and second plates <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> has a hook hole <b>65</b>/<b>73</b> so that a fourth spring <b>74</b> is hooked the two respective hook holes <b>65</b>, <b>73</b> in the first and second plates <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first contact unit <b>84</b> has a first upper contact portion <b>841</b> and a first lower contact portion <b>842</b>, a fifth spring <b>86</b> is connected to the first upper contact portion <b>841</b>. The second contact unit <b>85</b> includes a second upper contact portion <b>851</b> and a second lower contact portion <b>852</b>, a sixth spring <b>87</b> is connected to the second upper contact portion <b>851</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When the water pressure is lowered, the pull rod <b>83</b> is pulled downward by the third spring <b>55</b> so that the first and second upper contact portions <b>841</b>, <b>851</b> are in contact with the first and second lower contact portions <b>842</b>, <b>852</b>. The electrical wires <b>88</b> of the first and second contact units <b>84</b>, <b>85</b> are powered so as to activate the pump which is not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">When the water pressure is larger than the force of the first spring <b>52</b>, the push portion <b>41</b> of the film <b>4</b> is pushed inward to push the first plate <b>6</b> and pivots the second plate <b>7</b> upward. The pull rod <b>82</b> connected to the lug <b>72</b> on the second plate <b>7</b> an the second plate <b>7</b> both push the frame <b>81</b> so that the first and second upper contact portions <b>841</b>, <b>851</b> are separated from the first and second lower contact portions <b>842</b>, <b>852</b>. The fifth and sixth springs <b>86</b>, <b>87</b> bounce back to ensure all the contact portions are separated to stop the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The two tip portions <b>811</b>, <b>812</b> are in contact with the two respective centers of the first contact unit <b>84</b> and the second contact unit <b>85</b> so that the first and second contact units <b>84</b> and <b>85</b> apply an even force which prevents the pressure switch from shaking.
