<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A semiconductor device is disclosed that includes an interposer and a semiconductor chip. The interposer includes a Si substrate; multiple through vias provided through an insulating material in corresponding through holes passing through the Si substrate; a thin film capacitor provided on a first main surface of the Si substrate so as to be electrically connected to the through vias; and multiple external connection terminals provided on a second main surface of the Si substrate so as to be electrically connected to the through vias. The second main surface faces away from the first main surface. The semiconductor chip is provided on one of the first main surface and the second main surface so as to be electrically connected to the through vias. The Si substrate has a thickness less than the diameter of the through holes.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is based on Japanese Priority Patent Applications No. 2005-036514, filed on Feb. 14, 2005, and No. 2005-237777, filed on Aug. 18, 2005, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to semiconductor devices, methods of manufacturing the same, capacitor structures, and methods of manufacturing the same, and more particularly to a semiconductor device having a semiconductor chip and an interposer including a capacitor and a through via, a method of manufacturing the same, a capacitor structure, and a method of manufacturing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electronic apparatuses are now becoming more sophisticated with more functions in the fields of personal computers, cellular phones, and other mobile equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to prevent malfunction due to switching noise in a large-scale integrated circuit (LSI) that operates at high frequencies, a method of reducing source impedance by connecting a decoupling capacitor absorbing noise in parallel with a power supply is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Source impedance Z is expressed by:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Z(P)∝V/(nif),  (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where V is supply voltage, n is the number of elements per LSI, i is the switching current of an element, and f is a driving frequency.
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Because of lower LSI voltage, high element integrity, and higher frequencies, there has been a sharp reduction in required impedance. The impedance Z(C) of a decoupling capacitor is given by:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Z</i>(<i>C</i>)=[<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>+{2<i>πfL</i>−(1/2<i>πfC</i>)}<sup>2</sup>]<sup>1/2</sup>,  (2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where R is resistance, L is inductance, and C is capacitance. In order to reduce the impedance of a decoupling capacitor, it is desired to increase capacitance C and reduce inductance L.
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Normally, a multilayer ceramic capacitor is disposed around an LSI as a decoupling capacitor. The multilayer ceramic capacitor has electrode layers and ceramic dielectric layers stacked alternately on each other, and has a pair of surface electrodes formed on corresponding side surfaces thereof so that each surface electrode is connected to every other corresponding electrode layer. A large capacitance can be provided, but it is not easy to reduce inductance because the electrode layers are connected to the surface electrodes on the side surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As the operating frequencies of LSIs become higher, the decoupling capacitor is required to have lower inductance. However, it is difficult to meet this requirement with multilayer ceramic capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, in order to reduce the line length between the LSI and the decoupling capacitor, a method of providing decoupling capacitors <b>505</b> formed of thin film capacitors on the surface of an interposer <b>502</b> in which through vias <b>508</b> are formed in a Si substrate <b>503</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is proposed (for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2004-193614).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">This method is effective in high-performance LSIs. This is because the interposer <b>502</b> employs the Si substrate <b>503</b> formed of the same material as the LSI, so that there is no occurrence of problems resulting from stress due to a difference in thermal expansion. This is also because this method responds to an increase in LSI size, finer pitches, and a decrease in strength due to a low-k LSI interconnection insulating film.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a conventional semiconductor device <b>500</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the semiconductor device <b>500</b> includes a semiconductor chip <b>501</b> that is operated at high frequencies and the interposer <b>502</b> to which the semiconductor chip <b>501</b> is connected.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The interposer <b>502</b> includes the Si substrate <b>503</b>, the decoupling capacitors <b>505</b>, an insulating film <b>507</b>, the through vias <b>508</b>, and external connection terminals <b>509</b>. The decoupling capacitors <b>505</b>, each formed of a lower electrode, a dielectric film, and an upper electrode, are formed on the Si substrate <b>503</b>. The decoupling capacitors <b>505</b> are connected to some of the through vias <b>508</b> connected to the power supply electrode pads of the semiconductor chip <b>501</b> and the other through vias <b>508</b> connected to the ground electrode pads of the semiconductor chip <b>501</b>. The decoupling capacitors <b>505</b> cancel noise generated by the semiconductor chip <b>501</b> operating at high frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Through holes <b>504</b> for forming the through vias <b>508</b> are formed in the Si substrate <b>503</b>. The insulating film <b>507</b> is formed on the through holes <b>504</b>. The insulating film <b>507</b> isolates the through vias <b>508</b> from the Si substrate <b>503</b>. In general, a thermal oxide film is used for the insulating film <b>507</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The through vias <b>508</b> are formed in the through holes <b>504</b>. The external connection terminals <b>509</b> for connection to a circuit board are formed at the lower end part of the through vias <b>508</b> (for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2004-193614).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the case of manufacturing this semiconductor device <b>500</b>, the decoupling capacitors <b>505</b> are formed on the Si substrate <b>503</b> after forming the through holes <b>504</b> and the through vias <b>508</b> in the Si substrate <b>503</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For related art, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Nos. 2000-323845, 2004-71589, 2004-95638, 2003-197463, and 2004-273825 may also be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, the thickness of the Si substrate <b>503</b> of the conventional interposer <b>502</b> is greater than or equal to 0.5 mm. Accordingly, the aspect ratio of the through holes <b>504</b>, that is, the thickness of the Si substrate <b>503</b>/the diameter of the through holes <b>504</b>, is high. In order to form these through holes <b>504</b>, it is necessary to use ICP (Induction Coupling Plasma), which causes the problem of an increasing manufacturing cost of the semiconductor device <b>500</b>. If the pitch of the external connection terminals <b>509</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>501</b> becomes narrower in the future, it becomes more difficult to form the through vias <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, conventionally, the decoupling capacitors <b>505</b> formed of thin film capacitors are formed on the Si substrate <b>503</b> after forming the through holes <b>504</b>. This causes a problem in that the decoupling capacitors <b>505</b> are likely to be poorly isolated, thus resulting in a reduced yield.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, since there is a limit to the capacitance of a thin film capacitor with a single layer structure, it is desirable to increase capacitance by providing a thin film capacitor with a multilayer structure. However, this results in the problem of higher costs because electrodes and a dielectric film are formed and patterned for each layer. Further, since the thin film capacitor is formed on a patterned uneven underlayer, there is a problem in that a poor yield rate due to unevenness of the film thickness of a dielectric film and to dust causes an increase in costs.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device in which the above-described disadvantages are eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A more specific object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device operable at high frequencies and manufacturable at reduced cost.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another more specific object of the present invention is to provide a capacitor structure employed in the semiconductor device, and a method of manufacturing the capacitor structure.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One or more of the above objects of the present invention are achieved by a semiconductor device including: an interposer, the interposer including: a Si substrate; multiple through vias provided through an insulating material in corresponding through holes passing through the Si substrate; a thin film capacitor provided on a first main surface of the Si substrate so as to be electrically connected to the through vias; and a plurality of external connection terminals provided on a second main surface of the Si substrate so as to be electrically connected to the through vias, the second main surface facing away from the first main surface; and a semiconductor chip provided on one of the first main surface and the second main surface so as to be electrically connected to the through vias, wherein the Si substrate has a thickness less than a diameter of the through holes.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to one aspect of the present invention, the thickness of the Si substrate of an interposer is less than or equal to the diameter of a through hole. Accordingly, a semiconductor device that has a through hole of good accuracy and can support a further increase in density can be realized. Further, since a thin film capacitor is provided close to a semiconductor chip, a semiconductor device having equivalent series inductance reduced so as to enable the semiconductor chip to operate at high frequencies can be realized. Furthermore, since it is easy to form the through hole, an inexpensive semiconductor device manufacturable at reduced cost can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">One or more of the above objects of the present invention are also achieved by a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, the semiconductor device including an interposer and a semiconductor chip, the interposer including a Si substrate; multiple through vias provided through an insulating material in corresponding through holes passing through the Si substrate; a thin film capacitor provided on a first main surface of the Si substrate so as to be electrically connected to the through vias; and multiple external connection terminals provided on a second main surface of the Si substrate so as to be electrically connected to the through vias, the second main surface facing away from the first main surface, the semiconductor chip being electrically connected to the through vias, the method including the steps of: (a) forming the thin film capacitor; (b) thinning down the Si substrate; and (c) forming the through holes in the thinned Si substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to one aspect of the present invention, by performing the step of thinning down a Si substrate, the aspect ratio of a through hole (Si substrate thickness/through hole diameter) can be reduced, so that the through hole can be formed easily in the Si substrate. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the cost of manufacturing a semiconductor device. Further, since the step of forming a thin film capacitor is performed before the step of forming the through hole, it is possible to form the dielectric film of the thin film capacitor at high temperature. Accordingly, it is possible to form a thin film capacitor having a high dielectric constant, large capacitance, and high reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">One or more of the above objects of the present invention are also achieved by a semiconductor device including a circuit board and a semiconductor chip, wherein the circuit board includes a multilayer interconnection structure; a capacitor structure including a thin film capacitor on the multilayer interconnection structure; an insulating film covering the capacitor structure; through vias passing through the capacitor structure so as to be electrically connected to the thin film capacitor and the multilayer interconnection structure; the semiconductor chip is electrically connected to the through vias on the circuit board; and the capacitor structure includes a Si substrate on the multilayer interconnection structure; through holes in which the through vias are formed, through holes passing through the Si substrate; and the thin film capacitor formed on the Si substrate, the Si substrate having a thickness less than a diameter of the through holes.</p>

Further, since a thin film capacitor is provided close to a semiconductor chip, it is possible to realize a semiconductor device having reduced equivalent series inductance so as to enable the semiconductor chip to operate at high frequencies.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to one aspect of the present invention, by performing the process of thinning down a Si substrate, it is possible to reduce the aspect ratio (Si substrate thickness/through hole diameter) of through holes, thus making it easy to form the through holes in the Si substrate.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A description is given below, with reference to the accompanying drawings, of embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an electronic device <b>10</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the electronic device according to this embodiment includes a semiconductor device <b>11</b> and a circuit board <b>12</b> on which the semiconductor device <b>11</b> is mounted. Multiple external connection terminals <b>44</b> of the semiconductor device <b>11</b> are electrically connected to corresponding connection pads <b>13</b> provided on the circuit board <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The semiconductor device <b>11</b> includes a semiconductor chip <b>20</b> and an interposer <b>30</b>. The semiconductor chip <b>20</b> includes at least one connection pad <b>32</b>A and at least one connection pad <b>32</b>B. The connection pad <b>32</b>A, which is an electrode pad for power supply (a power supply electrode pad), is connected to a corresponding internal connection terminal <b>56</b>A provided on the first main surface side of the interposer <b>30</b>. The connection pad <b>32</b>B, which is an electrode pad for ground (a ground electrode pad), is connected to a corresponding internal connection terminal <b>56</b>B provided on the first main surface side of the interposer <b>30</b>. For example, a semiconductor chip that is driven at high frequencies may be used as the semiconductor chip <b>20</b> employed in this embodiment. This semiconductor chip <b>20</b> has semiconductor circuits such as a CPU, a ROM, and a RAM formed on a Si substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The interposer <b>30</b> includes a Si substrate <b>36</b>, insulating material <b>39</b>, metal films <b>41</b> and <b>55</b>, through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B, the external connection terminals <b>44</b>, insulating films <b>45</b> and <b>52</b>, at least one thin film capacitor <b>46</b>, a protection film <b>51</b>, and the internal connection terminals <b>56</b>A and <b>56</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The Si substrate <b>36</b> is a thinned plate. Through holes <b>38</b> of a diameter R<b>1</b> are formed in the Si substrate <b>36</b> at positions corresponding to the positions of formation of the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B. The through holes <b>38</b> are formed so that their diameter R<b>1</b> is greater than the diameter of the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Thus, forming the through holes <b>38</b> so that their diameter R<b>1</b> is greater than the diameter of the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B makes it possible to form a layer of the insulating material <b>39</b> easily between the Si substrate <b>36</b> and the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Further, the thickness M<b>1</b> of the thin Si substrate <b>36</b> is less than the diameter R<b>1</b> of the through holes <b>38</b>. Thus, forming the through holes <b>38</b> having the diameter R<b>1</b> greater than that of the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B in the thin Si substrate <b>36</b> makes it possible to form good through holes <b>38</b> with a reduced aspect ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The diameter R<b>1</b> of the through holes <b>38</b> may be, for example, 100 μm. The pitch in forming the through holes <b>38</b> may be, for example, 150 μm to 250 μm. The diameter R<b>1</b> and the pitch of the through holes <b>38</b> are not limited to the above-described numerical values.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, preferably, the thickness M<b>1</b> of the Si substrate <b>36</b> is within the range of 30 μm to 100 μm. The Si substrate <b>36</b> has insufficient strength with the thickness M<b>1</b> being less than 30 μm. If the thickness M<b>1</b> is greater than 100 μm, the aspect ratio (M<b>1</b>/R<b>1</b>) of the through holes <b>38</b> becomes high, so that it is difficult to form the through holes <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The insulating material <b>39</b> is formed so as to fill in the space between the Si substrate <b>36</b> and the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B, which space corresponds to the through holes <b>38</b>, and to cover a lower surface <b>36</b>B of the Si substrate <b>36</b>. Through holes <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B are formed in the insulating material <b>39</b> at positions corresponding to the through holes <b>38</b>. The through hole <b>40</b>A passes through the insulating material <b>39</b> and the insulating film <b>45</b>. The through hole <b>40</b>B passes through the insulating material <b>39</b>, the insulating film <b>45</b>, and a lower electrode <b>47</b> of the thin film capacitor <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The thickness L of the insulating material <b>39</b> between the Si substrate <b>36</b> and the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B may be, for example, 0.05 μm to 50 μm. Further, the thickness N of the insulating material <b>39</b> on the lower surface <b>36</b>B of the Si substrate <b>36</b> may be, for example, 0.05 μm to 10 μm. A low-dielectric-constant (low-k) resin, a heat-resistant resin, or a photosensitive resin may be employed as the material of the insulating material <b>39</b>. It is preferable to employ a material having a dielectric constant of 1.0 to 3.5 as the low-k resin. Examples of the low-k resin include fluororesins such as polyfluoroethylene, fluorinated epoxy, and fluorinated polyimide. Examples of the heat-resistant resin include epoxy resins, polyimide resins, and polyphenyl ether resins. Examples of the photosensitive resin include photosensitive polyimide resins.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the case of using the above-described low-k resin as the insulating material <b>39</b>, it is possible to prevent signal degradation of the semiconductor device <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The metal film <b>41</b>, which is, for example, 20 nm in thickness, is formed over a surface <b>39</b>A of the insulating material <b>39</b> at positions corresponding to the positions of formation of the external connection terminals <b>44</b> and the surface of the through holes <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B. The metal film <b>41</b> is electrically connected to the metal film <b>55</b> formed on the first main surface side of the interposer <b>30</b>. In forming the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B and the external connection terminals <b>44</b> by electroplating, the metal film <b>41</b> serves as a power supply layer. A multilayer film formed by stacking, for example, a Ti film, a Cu film, and a Ni film in this order may be employed as the metal film <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B, which are, for example, 70 μm in diameter, are formed in the through holes <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B, respectively, on which the metal film <b>41</b> is formed. The through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B are integrated with the corresponding external connection terminals <b>44</b>. The through via <b>43</b>A electrically connects the internal connection terminal <b>56</b>A and the corresponding external connection terminal <b>44</b>. The through via <b>43</b>B electrically connects the internal connection terminal <b>56</b>B and the corresponding external connection terminal <b>44</b>. A conductive material may be employed as the material of the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B. Specifically, for example, Sn—Ag solder is employable.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The external connection terminals <b>44</b> are formed on the metal film <b>41</b> provided on the surface <b>39</b>A of the insulating material <b>39</b>. The external connection terminals <b>44</b> electrically connect the connection pads <b>13</b> provided on the circuit board <b>12</b> and the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B. A conductive material may be employed as the material of the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B. For example, Sn—Ag solder may be employed as the conductive material.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The insulating film <b>45</b>, which is, for example, 50 nm in thickness, is formed on an upper surface <b>36</b>A of the Si substrate <b>36</b>. The insulating film <b>45</b> is the adhesion layer of the thin film capacitor <b>46</b>. An insulating film having excellent moisture resistance may be employed as the insulating film <b>45</b>. For example, a SiO<sub>2 </sub>film or an alumina film is employable as the insulating film <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The thin film capacitor <b>46</b> includes a dielectric film <b>48</b>, the lower electrode <b>47</b>, and an upper electrode <b>49</b>. The dielectric film <b>48</b> is sandwiched between the lower electrode <b>47</b> and the upper electrode <b>49</b>. The lower electrode <b>47</b>, the dielectric film <b>48</b>, and the upper electrode <b>49</b> are stacked in the order described.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The thin film capacitor <b>46</b> is formed on the insulating film <b>45</b> at the position between the internal connection terminal <b>56</b>A, connected to the power supply electrode pad <b>32</b>A of the semiconductor chip <b>20</b>, and the internal connection terminal <b>56</b>B, connected to the ground electrode pad <b>32</b>B of the semiconductor chip <b>20</b>. The upper electrode <b>49</b> is electrically connected to the internal connection terminal <b>56</b>A. The lower electrode <b>47</b> is electrically connected to the internal connection terminal <b>56</b>B. By thus connecting the thin film capacitor <b>46</b> electrically, the thin film capacitor <b>46</b> functions as a decoupling capacitor so as to absorb noise generated by the semiconductor chip <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">For example, Au, Al, Pt, Ag, Pd, Cu, and their alloys are employable as the material of the lower electrode <b>47</b>, which may be 100 nm in thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The material of the dielectric film <b>48</b>, which is, for example, 100 nm in thickness, is not limited in particular as long as it is a dielectric material. Preferably, the dielectric film <b>48</b> is formed of a metal oxide material having a perovskite crystal structure having a high dielectric constant. Examples of such a material include (Ba,Sr)TiO<sub>3</sub>(BST), SrTiO<sub>3</sub>(ST), BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, Ba(Zr,Ti)O<sub>3</sub>, Ba(Ti,Sn)O<sub>3</sub>, Pb(Zr,Ti)O<sub>3</sub>(PZT), (Pb,La) (Zr,Ti)O<sub>3</sub>(PLZT), Pb(Mn,Nb)O<sub>3</sub>—PbTiO<sub>3</sub>(PMN-PT), and Pb(Ni,Nb)O<sub>3</sub>—PbTiO<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the case of using a metal oxide material having a perovskite crystal structure as the dielectric film <b>48</b>, it is preferable to employ Pt as the material of the lower electrode <b>47</b>. Employment of Pt enables the dielectric film <b>48</b> to grow epitaxially, so that the dielectric constant of the dielectric film <b>48</b> increases.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As the material of the upper electrode <b>49</b>, Au, Al, Pt, Ag, Pd, Cu, and their alloys are employable, for example. The above-described metals or their alloys may be stacked on IrOx. The upper electrode <b>49</b> may be, for example, 100 nm in thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The protection film <b>51</b>, which is, for example, 0.1 μm in thickness, is provided so as to cover the thin film capacitor <b>46</b>. The protection film <b>51</b> is formed of an insulating material, which is not limited in particular, but is preferably Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, or alumina, which has excellent moisture resistance. Employment of such a material makes it possible to prevent degradation of the dielectric film <b>48</b> having a perovskite crystal structure.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The insulating film <b>52</b>, which is, for example, 2 μm in thickness, is provided so as to cover the protection film <b>51</b>. An opening part (hole) <b>53</b>A exposing the insulating film <b>45</b>, an opening part (hole) <b>53</b>B exposing the lower electrode <b>47</b>, and opening parts (holes) <b>54</b> positioned close to the opening part <b>53</b>A and exposing the upper electrode <b>49</b> are formed in the insulating film <b>52</b>. The insulating film <b>52</b> is formed of the same material as the above-described insulating material <b>39</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3L</figref> are diagrams illustrating a semiconductor device manufacturing process according to the first embodiment of the present invention. A description is given below, with reference to the drawings, of a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device <b>11</b> according to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">First, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, by sputtering, the insulating film <b>45</b> serving as an adhesion film is formed, and further, a lower electrode film <b>47</b>A, a dielectric film <b>48</b>A, and an upper electrode film <b>49</b>A are successively formed on a surface of the Si substrate <b>36</b> having a thermal oxide film (a SiO<sub>2 </sub>film) formed on the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Specifically, for example, using a multi-target DC-RF magnetron sputtering device, an amorphous alumina film (50 nm in thickness) is formed as the insulating film <b>45</b> on the Si substrate <b>36</b> on which a thermal oxide film (a SiO<sub>2 </sub>film) is formed with the substrate temperature being 200° C. Next, with the substrate temperature being 200° C., a Pt film (100 nm in thickness) is formed as the lower electrode film <b>47</b>A. Next, with the substrate temperature being 600° C., a BST film (100 nm in thickness) is formed as the dielectric film <b>48</b>A. Next, with the substrate temperature being 25° C., an IrOx film and a Au film (100 nm in thickness) are successively formed as the upper electrode film <b>49</b>A. These multilayer films <b>45</b>, <b>47</b>A, <b>48</b>A, and <b>49</b>A may be formed by a method other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the stacked upper electrode film <b>49</b>A, dielectric film <b>48</b>A, and lower electrode film <b>47</b>A are patterned by ion milling, so that the thin film capacitor <b>46</b> is formed. Next, the thin film capacitor <b>46</b> is subjected to heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere so as to remove thermal distortion and supply oxygen atoms to oxygen deficient parts in the dielectric film <b>48</b> and the IrO<sub>x </sub>film. The lower electrode <b>47</b>, the dielectric film <b>48</b>, and the upper electrode <b>49</b> of the thin film capacitor <b>46</b> are formed by patterning the lower electrode film <b>47</b>A, the dielectric film <b>48</b>A, and the upper electrode film <b>49</b>A, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the protection film <b>51</b> covering the thin film capacitor <b>46</b> and the insulating film <b>45</b> is formed. Next, an opening part (hole) <b>51</b>A exposing the upper electrode <b>49</b> is formed in the protection film <b>51</b> by ion milling. Next, the protection film <b>51</b> is subjected to post-annealing in an oxygen atmosphere. Specifically, for example, an amorphous alumina film (0.1 μm in thickness) is formed as the protection film <b>51</b> by sputtering using an RF magnetron sputtering device. The protection film <b>51</b> may be formed by a method other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Thus, forming the thin film capacitor <b>46</b> before a through hole formation process makes it possible to form the dielectric film <b>48</b> at high temperature, so that the thin film capacitor <b>46</b> having large capacitance, high reliability, and a high dielectric constant can be formed. Further, the thin film capacitor <b>46</b> is formed by stacking the lower electrode film <b>47</b>A, the dielectric film <b>48</b>A, and the upper electrode film <b>49</b>A successively on the even planar insulating film <b>45</b>, and patterning the lower electrode film <b>47</b>A, the dielectric film <b>48</b>A, and the upper electrode film <b>49</b>A. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the yield of the thin film capacitor <b>46</b>. Further, foreign materials generated in forming the through holes <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>A, and <b>40</b>B and the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B are prevented from adhering to the area of formation of the thin film capacitor <b>46</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the yield of the thin film capacitor <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, the insulating film <b>52</b> is formed so as to cover the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. Next, the opening part <b>53</b>A exposing the insulating film <b>45</b>, the opening part <b>53</b>B exposing the lower electrode <b>47</b>, and the opening parts <b>54</b> exposing the upper electrode <b>49</b> are formed. Specifically, for example, a photosensitive polyimide resin (2 μm in thickness) is formed as the insulating film <b>52</b> by spin coating. The opening parts <b>53</b>A, <b>53</b>B, and <b>54</b> are formed by exposing the photosensitive polyimide resin to light and developing the photosensitive polyimide resin. The insulating film <b>52</b> may also be formed by a method other than spin coating, such as spraying or dipping.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Next in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the metal film <b>55</b> serving as a plating seed layer is formed on the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. Specifically, for example, a Ti film, a Cu film, and a Ni film are successively formed by sputtering so as to serve as the metal film <b>55</b>. The metal film <b>55</b> may be formed by a method-other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>, a resist layer <b>66</b> exposing part of the metal film <b>55</b> corresponding to the area of formation of the internal connection terminals <b>56</b>A and <b>56</b>B is formed on the metal film <b>55</b>. Next, the opening parts <b>53</b>A, <b>53</b>B, and <b>54</b> are filled with a conductive material <b>68</b>. The conductive material <b>68</b> is later reflowed so as to serve as the internal connection terminals <b>56</b>A and <b>56</b>B. Specifically, the conductive material <b>68</b> is formed by causing Sn—Ag solder to be deposited by electroplating with the metal film <b>55</b> serving as a power supply layer.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref>, an unnecessary part of the metal film <b>55</b> not covered with the conductive material <b>68</b> is removed. Thereafter, the conductive material <b>68</b> is reflowed by heating, so that the internal connection terminals <b>56</b>A and <b>56</b>B of Sn—Ag solder bumps are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</figref>, a holding substrate <b>70</b> is adhered through an adhesive tape <b>69</b> to the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref> on its first main surface side (the side on which the internal connection terminals <b>56</b>A and <b>56</b>B are formed), and the Si substrate <b>36</b> is thinned from the second main surface side. Specifically, for example, the Si substrate <b>36</b> is thinned down to 50 μm in thickness with a grinder. After thinning down the Si substrate <b>36</b>, the adhesive tape <b>69</b> is removed. For example, a UV tape, whose adhesiveness is reduced by ultraviolet ray irradiation, may be employed as the adhesive tape <b>69</b>. For example, grinding or etching may be employed to thin down the Si substrate <b>36</b>. As grinding methods, polishing such as buffing and CMP and cutting are employable, for example. As etching methods, wet etching and plasma etching are employable, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Thus, thinning down the Si substrate <b>36</b> before forming the through holes <b>38</b> makes it possible to reduce the aspect ratio of the through holes <b>38</b> and form the through holes <b>38</b> using plasma etching or wet etching lower in cost than ICP (Induction Coupling Plasma). Accordingly, it is possible to manufacture the semiconductor device <b>11</b> at lower cost.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3I</figref>, the through holes <b>38</b> of the diameter R<b>1</b> are formed in the Si substrate <b>36</b> from its second main surface side. Specifically, for example, the through holes <b>38</b> may be formed by wet etching using a liquid mixture of hydrogen fluoride and a nitric acid as etching liquid. Wet etching using other etching liquids or plasma etching may also be employed. The diameter R<b>1</b> of the through holes <b>38</b> may be, for example, 100 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3J</figref>, the insulating material <b>39</b> is applied to fill in the through holes <b>38</b> and to cover the lower surface <b>36</b>B of the Si substrate <b>36</b>, and next, the insulating material <b>39</b> is hardened. Specifically, for example, an epoxy resin, which is a heat-resistant resin, is applied as the insulating material <b>39</b> by spin coating, and thereafter, the epoxy resin is thermoset at a temperature of 200° C. The insulating material <b>39</b> may also be applied by a method other than spin coating, such as spraying or dipping.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Thus, forming the insulating material <b>39</b> so that the insulating material <b>39</b> simultaneously covers the lower surface <b>36</b>B of the Si substrate <b>36</b> and fills in the through holes <b>38</b> makes it possible to simplify the manufacturing process of the semiconductor device <b>11</b> compared with the case of forming an insulating material provided on the lower surface <b>36</b>B of the Si substrate <b>36</b> and an insulating material filling in the through holes <b>38</b> separately.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Employment of a resin material such as a low-k resin, a heat-resistant resin, or a photosensitive resin as the insulating material <b>39</b> filling in the through holes <b>38</b> makes it possible to form the through holes <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B for forming the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B with ease, so that it is possible to manufacture the semiconductor device <b>11</b> at reduced cost. An insulating material on the lower surface <b>36</b>B of the Si substrate <b>36</b> and an insulating material filling in the through holes <b>38</b> may be provided separately. In this case, the insulating material provided on the lower surface <b>36</b>B of the Si substrate <b>36</b> may be different from the insulating material filling in the through holes <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3K</figref>, the through holes <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B of 70 μm in diameter exposing the metal film <b>55</b> are formed in the insulating material <b>39</b> filling in the through holes <b>38</b>. Specifically, the through holes <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B are formed by ArF excimer laser processing using a heat-resistant resin or a low-k resin as the insulating material <b>39</b>. The through holes <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B may also be formed using a laser processing method other than ArF excimer laser processing, or plasma etching. In the case of using a photosensitive resin as the insulating material <b>39</b>, the through holes <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B may be formed by exposing and developing part of the insulating material <b>39</b> corresponding to the through holes <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3L</figref>, the metal film <b>41</b>, the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B, and the external connection terminals <b>44</b> are formed by the same method as illustrated in the processes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3E through 3G</figref>. At this point, the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B and the external connection terminals <b>44</b> are formed simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Thus, forming the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B and the external connection terminals <b>44</b> simultaneously makes it possible to simplify the manufacturing process of the semiconductor device <b>11</b> and reduce its manufacturing cost. Further, forming the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B after thinning down the Si substrate <b>36</b> reduces the length of the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B connecting the semiconductor chip <b>20</b> and the circuit board <b>12</b>. This makes it possible to transmit a high-frequency signal at high speed between the semiconductor chip <b>20</b> and the circuit board <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) connected to the external connection terminals <b>44</b>. Further, the through holes <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B are formed in the thinned Si substrate <b>36</b>. This reduces time for processing the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B, so that it is possible to reduce manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Next, the Si substrate <b>36</b> is cut using, for example, a dicer, so that the interposer <b>30</b> is formed. Thereafter, the connection pads <b>32</b>A and <b>32</b>B of the semiconductor chip <b>20</b> are connected to the internal connection terminals <b>56</b>A and <b>56</b>B, respectively, of the interposer <b>30</b>, so that the semiconductor device <b>11</b> is manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">According to the manufacturing method according to this embodiment, since the Si substrate <b>36</b> is thinned down, the amount of processing in the direction of thickness is reduced in forming the through holes <b>38</b>. Accordingly, the through holes <b>38</b> can be formed with ease, and the processing time can be reduced. Further, it is possible to form the through holes <b>38</b> by wet etching or plasma etching. Accordingly, it is possible to form the through holes <b>38</b> at far lower cost than by conventional ICP. Further, the through holes <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B for the through vias <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B are formed by laser via processing with the through holes <b>38</b> being filled with an insulating material such as a low-k resin, a heat-resistant resin, or a photosensitive resin, thus resulting in low processing cost. For these reasons, the semiconductor device <b>11</b> can be manufactured at lower cost than conventionally.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Further, according to the manufacturing method according to this embodiment, the thin film capacitor <b>46</b> is formed before forming the through holes <b>38</b> in the Si substrate <b>36</b>. This facilitates formation of the thin film capacitor <b>46</b>. Compared with the conventional manufacturing method by which the through holes <b>38</b> are formed before the thin film capacitor <b>46</b>, the yield of the thin film capacitor <b>46</b> can be increased because it is possible to prevent dust and foreign materials generated in forming the through holes <b>38</b> from having an adverse effect such as poor isolation on the thin film capacitor <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The electric characteristics and the reliability of an interposer made by the above-described manufacturing process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3L</figref> were evaluated.

Further, the lower electrode film <b>47</b>A, the dielectric film <b>48</b>A, and the upper electrode film <b>49</b>A are successively formed as a thin film capacitor multilayer body. The insulating film <b>45</b> serves as an adhesion layer.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Specifically, for example, using a multi-target DC-RF magnetron sputtering device, an amorphous alumina film (50 nm in thickness) is formed as the insulating film <b>45</b> on the Si substrate <b>36</b> on which a SiO<sub>2 </sub>film is formed with the substrate temperature being 200° C. Next, with the substrate temperature being 200° C., a Pt film (100 nm in thickness) is formed as the lower electrode film <b>47</b>A. Next, with the substrate temperature being 600° C., a BST film (100 nm in thickness) is formed as the dielectric film <b>48</b>A. Next, with the substrate temperature being 25° C., an IrOx film and a Au film (100 nm in thickness) are successively formed as the upper electrode film <b>49</b>A. These multilayer films <b>45</b>, <b>47</b>A, <b>48</b>A, and <b>49</b>A may be formed by a method other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the stacked upper electrode film <b>49</b>A, dielectric film <b>48</b>A, and lower electrode film <b>47</b>A are patterned together by ion milling, so that the thin film capacitors <b>46</b> each of the lower electrode <b>47</b>, the dielectric film <b>48</b>, and the upper electrode <b>49</b> are formed. Next, the thin film capacitors <b>46</b> are subjected to heat treatment in an oxygen atmosphere so as to remove thermal distortion and supply oxygen atoms to oxygen deficient parts in the dielectric film <b>48</b> and the IrO<sub>x </sub>film. The lower electrode <b>47</b>, the dielectric film <b>48</b>, and the upper electrode <b>49</b> of each thin film capacitor <b>46</b> are formed by patterning the lower electrode film <b>47</b>A, the dielectric film <b>48</b>A, and the upper electrode film <b>49</b>A, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Thus, forming the thin film capacitors <b>46</b> before forming the through holes <b>124</b> in the Si substrate <b>36</b> makes it possible to form the dielectric film <b>48</b> at temperatures as high as 300° C to 1000° C., so that the thin film capacitors <b>46</b> having a high dielectric constant, large capacitance, and high reliability can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Further, each thin film capacitor <b>46</b> is formed by stacking the lower electrode film <b>47</b>A, the dielectric film <b>48</b>A, and the upper electrode film <b>49</b>A successively on the even planar insulating film <b>45</b>, and thereafter, patterning the lower electrode film <b>47</b>A, the dielectric film <b>48</b>A, and the upper electrode film <b>49</b>A. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the yield of the thin film capacitors <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Further, dust and foreign materials generated in forming opening parts (holes) <b>145</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>), the through holes <b>124</b> and <b>143</b>, and the through vias <b>133</b>A through <b>133</b>C are prevented from adhering to part of the insulating film <b>45</b> corresponding to the area of formation of the thin film capacitors <b>46</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the yield of the thin film capacitors <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, the protection film <b>125</b> is formed so as to cover the thin film capacitors <b>46</b> and the insulating film <b>45</b>. At this point, opening parts (holes) <b>125</b>A exposing the corresponding lower electrodes <b>47</b>, opening parts (holes) <b>125</b>B exposing the corresponding upper electrodes <b>49</b>, and opening parts (holes) <b>125</b>C exposing the insulating film <b>45</b> are formed in the protection film <b>125</b>. Specifically, for example, a photosensitive polyimide resin (2 μm in thickness) is applied as the protection film <b>125</b> by spin coating. The opening parts <b>125</b>A through <b>125</b>C are formed by exposing the photosensitive polyimide resin to light and developing the photosensitive polyimide resin. The insulating film <b>125</b> may also be formed by a method other than spin coating, such as spraying or dipping.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">A Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>film, a SiO<sub>2 </sub>film, or an alumina film may be used as the protection film <b>125</b>. In this case, for example, the protection film <b>125</b> is formed using an RF magnetron sputtering device, and then, the opening parts <b>125</b>A through <b>125</b>C are formed by ion milling. Then, the protection film <b>125</b> is subjected to post-annealing in an oxygen atmosphere. In this case, the protection film <b>125</b> may be formed by a method other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>, the vertical interconnection lines <b>126</b> in the corresponding opening parts <b>125</b>A, the vertical interconnection lines <b>127</b> in the corresponding opening parts <b>125</b>B, and the pad electrodes <b>128</b> and <b>129</b> are simultaneously formed. Specifically, for example, a Ti film and a Cu film are successively formed on the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref> as a plating seed layer by sputtering. Thereafter, a resist layer is formed on the plating seed layer so as to have opening parts (holes) exposing an area in which the pad electrodes <b>128</b> and <b>129</b> are formed, and a plating film is deposited on the plating seed layer by electroplating. After the formation of the vertical interconnection lines <b>126</b> and <b>127</b> and the pad electrodes <b>128</b> and <b>129</b>, the resist layer is removed. Next, an unnecessary part of the plating seed layer on which the plating film is not formed is removed. For example, a Cu plating film may be employed as the plating film. The plating seed layer may be formed by a method other than sputtering, such as vapor deposition or CVD.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>, part of the insulating film <b>45</b> exposed from the opening parts <b>125</b>C and part of the Si substrate <b>36</b> corresponding to the opening parts <b>125</b>C are etched from the first main surface side of the Si substrate <b>36</b> so that the opening parts <b>145</b> of the diameter R<b>2</b> are formed in the Si substrate <b>36</b>. The opening parts <b>145</b> have substantially the same depth (vertical dimension) as the through holes <b>124</b>, and become the through holes <b>124</b> when the thickness of the Si substrate <b>36</b> is reduced. For example, wet etching and plasma etching may be employed as etching methods. A liquid mixture of hydrogen fluoride and nitric acid may be employed as etching liquid used for wet etching.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11F</figref>, the holding substrate <b>70</b> is adhered through the adhesive tape <b>69</b> to the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref> on its first main surface side, and the Si substrate <b>36</b> is thinned from the second main surface side. As a result, the opening parts <b>145</b> are exposed on the second main surface of the Si substrate <b>36</b> so that the through holes <b>124</b> are formed. Thereby, the capacitor structure <b>123</b> having the thin film capacitors <b>46</b> on the Si substrate <b>36</b> is manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Specifically, for example, the Si substrate <b>36</b> is thinned down to 50 μm in thickness with a grinder. After thinning down the Si substrate <b>36</b>, the adhesive tape <b>69</b> is removed. For example, a UV tape, whose adhesiveness is reduced by ultraviolet ray irradiation, may be employed as the adhesive tape <b>69</b>. For example, grinding or etching may be employed to thin down the Si substrate <b>36</b>. As grinding methods, polishing such as buffing and CMP and cutting are employable, for example. As etching methods, wet etching and plasma etching are employable, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">Thus, by forming the through holes <b>124</b> by thinning down the Si substrate <b>36</b> until the opening parts <b>145</b> are exposed after forming the opening parts <b>145</b> having substantially the same depth as the through holes <b>124</b> from the first main surface side of the Si substrate <b>36</b>, the aspect ration (M<b>1</b>/R<b>2</b>) can be reduced. This makes it possible to form the through holes <b>124</b> in the Si substrate <b>36</b> with ease, thus making it possible to reduce the manufacturing costs of the semiconductor device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Further, by forming the opening parts <b>145</b> by plasma etching or wet etching at a lower cost than ICP, it is possible to reduce the manufacturing costs of the semiconductor device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11G</figref>, the capacitor structure <b>123</b> is adhered to the multilayer interconnection structure <b>122</b> so that the through holes <b>124</b> expose the pads <b>142</b>. The capacitor structure <b>123</b> is adhered to the multilayer interconnection structure <b>122</b> with, for example, an epoxy-based adhesive agent.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11H</figref>, the insulating film <b>132</b> is formed so as to cover the capacitor structure <b>123</b> and to fill in the through holes <b>124</b>. Then, the insulating film <b>132</b> is hardened. Specifically, for example, an epoxy resin, which is a heat-resistant resin, is applied as the insulating film <b>132</b> by spin coating, and thereafter, the epoxy resin is thermoset at a temperature of 200° C. The insulating film <b>132</b> may also be applied by a method other than spin coating, such as spraying or dipping. Further, a film-like resin layer may also be used as the insulating film <b>132</b>. The same material as that of the insulating material <b>39</b> described in the first embodiment may be employed as the material of the insulating film <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11I</figref>, an opening part (hole) <b>132</b>A exposing the pad electrode <b>128</b>, an opening part (hole) <b>132</b>B exposing the pad electrode <b>129</b>, and the through holes <b>143</b> exposing the pads <b>142</b> are formed in the insulating film <b>132</b>. Specifically, the opening parts <b>132</b>A and <b>132</b>B and the through holes <b>143</b> are formed by ArF excimer laser processing using a heat-resistant resin or a low-k resin as the insulating film <b>132</b>. The opening parts <b>132</b>A and <b>132</b>B and the through holes <b>143</b> may also be formed using a laser processing method other than ArF excimer laser processing, or plasma etching. In the case of using a photosensitive resin as the insulating film <b>132</b>, the opening parts <b>132</b>A and <b>132</b>B and the through holes <b>143</b> may be formed by exposing and developing part of the insulating film <b>132</b> corresponding to the opening parts <b>132</b>A and <b>132</b>B and the through holes <b>143</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Thus, the manufacturing costs are reduced by filling the through holes <b>124</b> with an insulating material such as a low-k resin, a heat-resistant resin, or a photosensitive resin, and forming the through holes <b>143</b> for the through vias <b>133</b>A through <b>133</b>C by laser via processing.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11J</figref>, by the same method as in the above-described process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>, the through vias <b>133</b>A through <b>133</b>C and the internal connection terminals <b>136</b>A through <b>136</b>C are simultaneously formed. As a result, the circuit board <b>121</b> having the capacitor structure <b>123</b> is manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Thus, by forming the through vias <b>133</b>A through <b>133</b>C and the internal connection terminals <b>136</b>A through <b>136</b>C simultaneously, it is possible to simplify the manufacturing process and reduce the manufacturing costs of the semiconductor device <b>120</b>. Further, forming the through vias <b>133</b>A through <b>133</b>C after thinning down the Si substrate <b>36</b> reduces the depth (vertical dimension) of the through vias <b>133</b>A through <b>133</b>C. Therefore, it is possible to transmit a high-frequency signal at high speed between the semiconductor chip <b>20</b> connected to the internal connection terminals <b>136</b>A through <b>136</b>C and another circuit board (not graphically illustrated) connected to the external connection terminals <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Further, by reducing the aspect ratio (M<b>1</b>/R<b>2</b>) of the through holes <b>124</b>, it is possible to reduce time for formation of the through vias <b>133</b>A through <b>133</b>C and thus improve productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Thereafter, the internal connection terminals <b>136</b>A through <b>136</b>C of the circuit board <b>121</b> are connected to the connection pads <b>32</b>A through <b>32</b>C, respectively, of the semiconductor chip <b>20</b>. Thereby, the semiconductor device <b>120</b> is manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">According to the semiconductor device manufacturing method of this embodiment, the opening parts <b>145</b> having substantially the same depth as the through holes <b>124</b> are formed in the Si substrate <b>36</b> on the side on which the thin film capacitors <b>46</b> are formed, and thereafter, the through holes <b>124</b> are formed by reducing the thickness of the Si substrate <b>36</b> until the opening parts <b>145</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>) are exposed. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the aspect ratio of the through holes <b>124</b>. This makes it possible to form the through holes <b>124</b> in the Si substrate <b>36</b> with ease, thus making it possible to reduce the manufacturing costs of the semiconductor device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Further, since the thin film capacitors <b>46</b> are formed before forming opening parts, it is possible to form the dielectric film <b>48</b> of each thin film capacitor <b>46</b> at high temperature, thus making it possible to form the thin film capacitors <b>46</b> having a high dielectric constant, large capacitance, and high reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Further, dust and foreign materials generated in forming the through holes <b>124</b> are prevented from adhering to the thin film capacitors <b>46</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the yield of the thin film capacitors <b>46</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0222" num="0221">In the above-described semiconductor device manufacturing method according to this embodiment, the opening parts <b>145</b> are formed in the Si substrate <b>36</b> before the Si substrate <b>36</b> is thinned down, and thereafter, the Si substrate <b>36</b> is thinned down until the opening parts <b>145</b> are exposed, thereby forming the through holes <b>124</b>. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the holding substrate <b>70</b> may be adhered through the adhesive tape <b>69</b> to the Si substrate <b>36</b> of the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref> on the upper surface <b>36</b>A side of the Si substrate <b>36</b>, and the Si substrate <b>36</b> may be thinned down from its lower surface <b>36</b>B side (a substrate thinning process). Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, the through holes <b>124</b> may be formed in the Si substrate <b>36</b> (a through hole formation process). The through holes <b>124</b> may be formed from either the upper surface <b>36</b>A side or the lower surface <b>36</b>B side of the Si substrate <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The electric characteristics and the reliability of a circuit board including a capacitor structure made by the above-described manufacturing process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A through 11J</figref> were evaluated. The circuit board was made using the conditions specified in the manufacturing process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A through 11J</figref>. With respect to the electric characteristics, the results were a capacitance density of 4 μF/cm<sup>2</sup>, an ESR (equivalent series resistance) of 0.01 Ω, an ESL (equivalent series inductance) of 10 pH, and a withstand voltage of 20 V or over. These results confirmed that it is possible to form a circuit board having a capacitor structure with large capacitance and reduced ESL.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">A high temperature and humidity load test was conducted as a reliability evaluation under the conditions of a temperature of 121° C., a relative humidity of 85%, an applied voltage of 3 V, and a test time of 48 hours. The insulation resistance after the test was higher than or equal to 10 MΩ, which confirmed that the circuit board having the capacitor structure also has sufficient reliability at high temperature and high humidity.</p>

<p id="p-0323" num="0322">Further, thin film capacitors of a single-layer structure of the lower electrode <b>47</b>, the dielectric film <b>48</b>, and the upper electrode <b>49</b> formed by the same method as the above-described processes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref> according to this embodiment (examples) and conventional thin film capacitors of a single-layer structure formed by performing patterning every time each of the films <b>47</b>, <b>48</b>, and <b>49</b> is formed (comparative examples) were prepared, and evaluation of the defect rates of both types of thin film capacitors (of the example and the comparative example) having a withstand voltage of 10 V or over was performed. The example thin film capacitors were formed using the conditions specified in the processes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a graph showing the relationship between electrode area and defect rate of each type of thin film capacitor.

<p id="p-0325" num="0324">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, as the area of the upper electrode <b>49</b> increases, the defect rate of the comparative example thin film capacitor increases sharply. On the other hand, the defect rate of the example thin film capacitor hardly increases as the area of the upper electrode <b>49</b> increases. Specifically, for example, when the area of the upper electrode <b>49</b> is 1 cm<sup>2</sup>, the yield of the comparative example is 32% (the defect rate is 68%) while the yield of the example is 92% (the defect rate is 8%).</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">These results confirmed that the example thin film capacitor can have a better yield than the comparative example thin film capacitor. Further, since the above-described results have been obtained for the single-layer thin film capacitor according to this embodiment, the difference in yield is presumed to be more remarkable for a multilayer thin film capacitor formed by the same method.</p>

As grinding methods, polishing such as buffing and CMP and cutting are employable, for example. As etching methods, wet etching and plasma etching are employable, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401">Thus, thinning down the Si substrate <b>241</b> before forming the through holes <b>242</b> makes it possible to reduce the aspect ratio of the through holes <b>242</b> and form the through holes <b>242</b> using plasma etching or wet etching lower in cost than ICP (Induction Coupling Plasma). Accordingly, it is possible to manufacture the semiconductor device <b>240</b> at lower cost.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32J</figref>, the through holes <b>242</b> of the diameter R<b>3</b> are formed in the Si substrate <b>241</b> from its lower surface <b>241</b>B. Specifically, for example, the through holes <b>242</b> of the diameter R<b>3</b> may be formed with a disposition pitch of 250 μm by wet etching using a liquid mixture of hydrogen fluoride and a nitric acid as etching liquid. Plasma etching or wet etching using other etching liquids may also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32K</figref>, the insulating material <b>243</b> is applied so as to fill in the through holes <b>242</b> and to cover the lower surface <b>241</b>B of the Si substrate <b>241</b>, and thereafter, the insulating material <b>243</b> is hardened. Specifically, for example, an epoxy resin, which is a heat-resistant resin, is applied as the insulating material <b>243</b> by spin coating, and thereafter, the epoxy resin is thermoset at a temperature of 200° C. The insulating material <b>243</b> may also be applied by a method other than spin coating, such as spraying or dipping.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">By thus forming the insulating material <b>243</b> so that the insulating material <b>243</b> simultaneously covers the lower surface <b>241</b>B of the Si substrate <b>241</b> and fills in the through holes <b>242</b>, it is possible to simplify the manufacturing process of the semiconductor device <b>240</b> compared with the case of providing an insulating material on the lower surface <b>241</b>B of the Si substrate <b>241</b> and an insulating material filling in the through holes <b>242</b> separately.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">Employment of a resin material such as a low-k resin, a heat-resistant resin, or a photosensitive resin as the insulating material <b>243</b> filling in the through holes <b>242</b> makes it possible to form the through holes <b>313</b>A through <b>313</b>C for forming the through vias <b>244</b>A through <b>244</b>C with ease, so that it is possible to manufacture the semiconductor device <b>240</b> at reduced cost.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0406">An insulating material on the lower surface <b>241</b>B of the Si substrate <b>241</b> and an insulating material filling in the through holes <b>242</b> may be provided separately. In this case, the insulating material provided on the lower surface <b>241</b>B of the Si substrate <b>241</b> may be different from the insulating material filling in the through holes <b>242</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32L</figref>, the through holes <b>313</b>A through <b>313</b>C of 70 μm in diameter exposing the vias <b>251</b>A through <b>251</b>C, respectively, are formed in the insulating material <b>243</b> filling in the through holes <b>242</b>. Specifically, the through holes <b>313</b>A through <b>313</b>C are formed by processing the insulating material <b>243</b> by ArF excimer laser processing using a heat-resistant resin or a low-k resin as the insulating material <b>243</b>. The through holes <b>313</b>A through <b>313</b>C may also be formed using a laser processing method other than ArF excimer laser processing, or plasma etching. In the case of using a photosensitive resin as the insulating material <b>243</b>, the through holes <b>313</b>A through <b>313</b>C may be formed by exposing and developing part of the insulating material <b>243</b> corresponding to the through holes <b>313</b>A through <b>313</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32M</figref>, a metal film <b>315</b> to serve as a plating seed layer is formed so as to cover the lower surface side of the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32L</figref>. Next, a resist layer <b>316</b> having opening parts (holes) <b>316</b> is formed on the metal film <b>315</b>. The opening parts <b>316</b>A correspond to the positions of formation of the pad electrodes <b>246</b>A through <b>246</b>C, and expose the metal film <b>315</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32N</figref>, the through vias <b>244</b>A through <b>244</b>C are formed in the through holes <b>313</b>A through <b>313</b>C. Next, the pad electrodes <b>246</b>A through <b>246</b>C are formed on part of the metal film <b>315</b> and the through vias <b>244</b>A through <b>244</b>C exposed in the resist layer <b>316</b>. Specifically, a Cu film is deposited by electroplating on the through holes <b>313</b>A through <b>313</b>C, thereby forming the through vias <b>244</b>A through <b>244</b>C. Thereafter, a Ni film to serve as the pad electrodes <b>246</b>A through <b>246</b>C is formed by electroplating.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 320</figref>, a conductive material is provided on the pad electrodes <b>246</b>A through <b>246</b>C. Specifically, the conductive material formed of Sn—Ag solder is provided on the pad electrodes <b>246</b>A through <b>246</b>C. The conductive material <b>318</b> is later reflowed so as to serve as the external connection terminals <b>247</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411">Next, in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32P</figref>, an unnecessary part of the metal film <b>315</b> not covered with the pad electrodes <b>246</b>A through <b>246</b>C is removed. Next, the conductive material <b>318</b> is reflowed by heating, so that the external connection terminals <b>247</b> are formed. Thereafter, the Si substrate <b>214</b> is cut by dicing, so that the semiconductor device <b>240</b> is manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">According to the semiconductor device manufacturing method of this embodiment, since the Si substrate <b>241</b> is thinned down, the amount of processing the Si substrate <b>241</b> in the direction of thickness is reduced in forming the through holes <b>242</b>. Accordingly, the through holes <b>242</b> can be formed with ease. Further, the reduction in the amount of processing the Si substrate <b>241</b> in the direction of thickness makes it possible to form the through holes <b>242</b> by wet etching or plasma etching. Accordingly, it is possible to form the through holes <b>242</b> at far lower cost than by conventional ICP. Further, the through holes <b>242</b> are filled with the insulating material <b>243</b> of a low-k resin, a heat-resistant resin, or a photosensitive resin, and the through holes <b>313</b>A through <b>313</b>C are formed in the insulating material <b>243</b> by laser via processing. Accordingly, it is possible to form the through holes <b>313</b>A through <b>313</b>C with ease. For these reasons, it is possible to manufacture the semiconductor device <b>240</b> at lower cost than conventionally.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0413">Further, the thin film capacitors <b>248</b> are formed before forming the through holes <b>242</b>. This facilitates processing for the thin film capacitors <b>248</b>, and prevents dust and foreign materials generated in forming the through holes <b>242</b> from adhering to the thin film capacitors <b>248</b>, thereby making it possible to increase the yield of the thin film capacitors <b>248</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414">The electric characteristics of a semiconductor device formed by the above-described manufacturing process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32A through 32P</figref> were evaluated. The semiconductor device was made using the conditions specified in each process of the manufacturing. With respect to the electric characteristics, the results were a capacitance density of 12 μF/cm<sup>2</sup>, an ESR (equivalent series resistance) of 0.02 Ω, an ESL (equivalent series inductance) of 10 pH, and a withstand voltage of 30 V or over. These results confirmed that it is possible to form a semiconductor device having a thin film capacitor with large capacitance and reduced ESL.</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0415">Further, a semiconductor device serving as a comparative example was formed by forming a thin film capacitor by performing patterning every time each of the thin films <b>47</b>A, <b>48</b>-<b>1</b>A, <b>167</b>-<b>1</b>A, <b>48</b>-<b>2</b>A, <b>167</b>-<b>2</b>A, <b>48</b>-<b>3</b>A, and <b>49</b>A was formed on the Si substrate <b>241</b> that was not thinned down, and then forming through holes by ICP in the Si substrate <b>241</b> that was not thinned down and forming through vias in the corresponding through holes. Examination of this comparative example semiconductor device revealed the occurrence of short-circuiting, and it was not possible to obtain an acceptable thin film capacitor.</p>
