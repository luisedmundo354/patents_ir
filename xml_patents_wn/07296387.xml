<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates in general to the field of architectural building products and in particular to apparatus comprising high density rigid urethane products or trim having a decorative appearance and an architectural shape such as, but not limited to, columns, wainscots, arches, moldings, and wall panels, and methods for making and installing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Architecturally shaped and decorative building products include moldings around the inside and outside of windows, walls, fireplaces, ceilings, and doors. Additionally, such architectural products include columns, wainscots, arches, capitals, bases and caps, pilasters, balustrades, quoins, keystones and other like decoratively shaped objects associated generally with building and other structures. In the trade, these decorative and, in some instances, functional objects are referred to as “trim.” In the recent past, these decorative building products or architectural “trim” products were made from materials such as concrete, stone, or plaster. Because of the inherent properties of such materials, the resulting product or object weighed a considerable amount and was subject to breaking from brittle fractures. In turn, the finished product was usually heavy, large and oddly shaped. With some shapes and products, reinforcing materials were used to prevent breakage during handling, transportation, installation and use. But, the reinforcing necessitated more complexity, time, effort, and costs in manufacturing. On-site fabrication was possible for some trim products which minimized handling and breakage problems, but created other manufacturing problems. Thus, regardless of whether the prior art concrete architectural trim products were reinforced, numerous manufacturing problems existed. Handling and installing the prior art concrete architectural trims were yet other problems fraught with difficulties. The heavy weight of the products required substantial supports during installation or attachment to the building structure. Maintaining exact positioning of the prior art concrete trims onto the building structure during installation was also difficult and time consuming because of the heavy weight of the concrete and the sometimes odd configuration of the architectural trims. Moreover, positioning and installation of the prior art concrete trim products most often required hand labor in that specialized machinery was generally not available. Therefore, and in general, architectural building and decorative trim products made from concrete and plaster have been problematic, to say the least.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many of the above-stated problems and difficulties were resolved by the use of expanded polystyrene for the architectural shapes in place of the prior art use of concrete. Expanded polystyrene can be fabricated using inexpensive and easily fabricated molds. Expanded polystyrene is lightweight and therefore relatively easily handled; it is soft and therefore relatively easily cut. Expanded polystyrene is readily attachable to typical building surfaces using an appropriate adhesive. Of course, expanded polystyrene architectural trims cannot normally be used as supporting structures, and its softness makes the foam subject to damage by conditions that would not affect concrete. Still, expanded polystyrene has sufficient advantages over concrete such that it is being used in the prior art for non-structural, decorative and architectural trims in the building trade.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The light weight of expanded polystyrene is an advantage that makes installation onto a building less difficult than concrete (or stone, or plaster, or metal, or any other hard and dense material). In the prior art, a typical installation of a expanded polystyrene architectural trim included attaching the trim to a wall by a construction adhesive or by mechanical fasteners or by a combination of the two. Further finishing and or attachment of the prior art expanded polystyrene trims may then occur by use of a mesh material applied over the attached trim, by use of a sprayed material that thereafter becomes hardened, or left as applied in its uncoated condition, with final finishing being accomplished by painting or by the application of a stucco finish and then painted. The desired final appearance in the existing prior art is usually, but not necessarily, different from that of the building structure in order to accent the architectural shape and distinguish it from the rest of the building or for accent purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The use of expanded polystyrene has shown the viability of replacing architectural trim that typically was made from a concrete or stone, with a lightweight plastic. Still, expanded polystyrene is not without its own problems—due mainly to its inherent properties. Expanded polystyrene is time consuming to manufacture and install and is not durable. It is not subject to fine detailing; and, therefore, results in a rather coarse appearing decorative trim. The finishing procedure is both difficult and time consuming and at times, the resulting appearance is undesirably distinguishable from the building structure and not as intended. Once installed, the expanded polystyrene trim is subject to impact damage and weathering. Because of its tendency to be damaged, expanded polystyrene cannot be used for any application where impact accidents are expected to occur or where frictional contact with another object is common. Moreover, repair of damaged expanded polystyrene is difficult and often the repaired results are not satisfactory in that the repair is readily visible. As a result, its use is rather limited.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, while expanded polystyrene provided advances to the prior art of architectural shapes and trims, it did not provide a complete solution. What is needed are apparatus and methods that allow the use of lightweight plastic for architectural shapes, trims and even walls, that have the capability of providing fine details, that allow for finishes that accent or distinguish the architectural shapes from the rest of the building, or that match the building, that provide finishes that are virtually identical to the finishes and appearances of products found in nature, that resist damage even when subject to abuse, that are durable over a long period of time, that are not adversely affected by weather, that give the appearance of concrete or other like material, that give the appearance of being an integral part of the building, that can be used internally and externally, and are easy to install and finish.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention accomplishes these objectives.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The above-stated objects as well as other objects which, although not specifically stated, but are intended to be included within the scope the present invention, are accomplished by the present invention and will become apparent from the hereinafter set forth Detailed Description of the Invention, Drawings and Claims, appended herewith.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention comprises architectural building products or “trim” and methods for making, installing and finishing the same. The architectural trim comprises a rigid urethane having a mesh material and or tabs imbedded within the body of the architectural trim product and extending out from the sides thereof for purposes of aiding in the attachment of the architectural trim product to the surface of a building. The architectural trim is provided with any one of a virtually unlimited number of surface finishes or textures, natural and unnatural, at the time it is manufactured. The configurational shape of the trim is likewise unlimited. A combination of the density of the rigid urethane and in some instances, the thickness of the surface finish, provides for trim products that can be tailored to function in accordance with their end use, environment, and desired appearance. The architectural trim is adhesively attached to the surface of the building structure with the mesh material extending from the sides thereof and flat against the building surface. Mechanical fasteners can also be used to temporarily support the weight of the trim while the adhesive fully sets up. To further attach the architectural trim to the building surface, a mixture of cement and polymer is placed under the mesh such that the mesh can thereafter be imbedded in the cement based mixture and allowed to harden. A finishing material, such as plaster or stucco is applied over the imbedded mesh at the same time as the stucco is applied to the building structure. The use of the architectural trim products provided by the present invention is not limited to new buildings. Indeed, updating, refurbishing, or redecorating previously existing buildings can benefit for the use of the present invention</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with the above, there has been summarized the more important features of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention as it appears in the below detailed description of the same, may be better understood.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A mesh material <b>11</b>, made for example from fiberglass and having a plurality of openings, in the approximate range of ⅛ to ¼ inches square, through the material, is embedded within the architectural trim <b>10</b> and extends an appropriate distance from either side thereof. Mesh material <b>11</b> can extend the full length and width of the architectural trim <b>10</b>, or it can consist of a plurality of discrete strips spaced along the length of the architectural trim <b>10</b>. The distance that the mesh material <b>11</b> extends from either side of the architectural trim <b>10</b> is variable but should be such that sufficient support is provided to the installed trim and such that it can be blended onto the structure surface. Additionally, if desired, the mesh material <b>11</b> can extend from one side <b>12</b> or <b>13</b> only of trim <b>10</b>, can alternating from one side <b>12</b> to the other side <b>13</b> of trim <b>10</b>, or extend from all both sides <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> and both ends <b>14</b> and <b>15</b> of the architectural trim <b>10</b>. Moreover, the mesh material can be a single piece imbedded across the entire width of the trim <b>10</b>, on can be separate pieces, each being placed on opposite sides of the architectural trim <b>10</b> along the length thereof, or the mesh material can be spaced along the length of trim <b>10</b> with or without spaces therebetween. The placement of the portion of the mesh material <b>11</b> within the body of the architectural trim <b>10</b> is also not fixed. The main consideration being that the mesh material is securely imbedded and, therefore, fixedly attached to the architectural trim <b>10</b>. For example, all or a portion of the mesh material <b>11</b> contained within the body of the architectural trim <b>10</b> can be biased, in any amount, toward the top surface <b>16</b> or toward the bottom surface <b>17</b> of the architectural trim <b>10</b>, provided that the mesh material <b>11</b> does not show through the top surface <b>16</b>. Yet another consideration of the placement of the mesh material <b>11</b> is that it extend substantially from the underside surfaces <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> of the architectural trim <b>10</b> so as to allow the extending portions <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> of the mesh material <b>11</b> to fit flat up against the surface of the building structure. Accordingly, the imbedded mesh material <b>11</b> can exit from the body portion of the architectural trim <b>10</b> in close proximity to the outside corners of the underside surfaces <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>. Although somewhat less desirable, the mesh material <b>11</b> can even exit from the body of the architectural trim <b>10</b> at a location along the side surfaces <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> in close proximity to the corner formed by the intersection of side <b>12</b> with underside surface <b>18</b> and the corner formed by the intersection of underside surface <b>19</b> and side surface <b>13</b>. All of these considerations are well within the knowledge and capability of one skilled in the art and essentially no experimentation is required.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another variation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one or more tabs <b>23</b>, made from an appropriate strip of metal or plastic, can be imbedded within the body of the architectural trim <b>10</b> and extend from the sides thereof <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> an appropriate distance so as to allow a mechanical fastener to be used to attach the tabs <b>23</b> to the surface of the structure. If desired, a combination of tabs <b>23</b> and mesh material <b>11</b> can be used to attach the architectural trim <b>10</b> to the surface of a building structure. The location and spacing of the tabs <b>23</b> are optional. The tabs <b>12</b> can serve a useful role to support the weight of the architectural trim while the adhesive applied to the back of the architectural trim sufficiently sets to support the weight.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates the architectural trim <b>10</b> using only tabs <b>23</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates the architectural trim <b>10</b> using only the mesh material <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The outside surface <b>16</b> of the architectural trim <b>10</b> can be configured to resemble virtually any texture that is desired by the building designer. For example, it may have a stucco finish, a plain smooth finish, a concrete-like finish, etc., and, if desired, can be sculpted or embossed with geometric or other decorative designs. All of such surface finishes can be obtained by appropriately configuring the inside surface of the mold used to form the trim <b>10</b>. The underside surface <b>17</b> can also be shaped as desired but without a decorative finish inasmuch as the under surface <b>17</b> is not exposed to view when the architectural trim <b>10</b> is installed. Thus, the underside surface <b>17</b> can be flat across the entire width and length of the trim <b>10</b>, or can be provided with cutouts, hollow depressions, or grooves. One consideration being the amount and type of surface area needed to provide a permanent attachment to the building structure in conjunction with the support provided by the extending mesh material <b>11</b> and or tabs <b>23</b>. Other considerations include the desired rigidity of the trim <b>10</b>, the size and weight of the trim <b>10</b> and even the type of trim <b>10</b> to be used. The ability of the present invention to vary in density and to vary in the treatment of the back surface provides for a finished product that allows an architect virtually limitless design choices in the type of trim <b>10</b> to be incorporated in the design of a new building or refurbishing of an older building. Moreover, all of the aforementioned architectural and structural considerations are known in the prior art and consistent with known industry practices.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention contemplates the following process for manufacturing the architectural trim <b>10</b>. A female mold is made having an internal shape corresponding to the finished outside shape <b>16</b> of a particular architectural trim <b>10</b>. The mold may be made from silicon using standard prior art techniques. A cover is made having the finished shape of the underside <b>17</b> of the architectural trim <b>10</b>. The mold is brought up to an appropriate temperature consistent with the plastic material such as urethane, from which the architectural trim <b>10</b> is to be fabricated. A predetermined amount of plastic material is introduced into the mold <b>11</b>. The determination of the predetermined amount of urethane being calculated in accordance with industry standards for the particular architectural trim <b>10</b> being made and the desired density of the finished product. The urethane is then wetted out in accordance with industry standards. The mesh material <b>11</b> is positioned within the mold with an appropriate portion extending out from the side edges of the mold. The mesh <b>11</b> being in accordance with the above description. If used, tabs <b>23</b> are positioned and the cover or lid is then placed on the mold. Pressure is applied while the plastic material is expanding and curing. The pressure also contributes to the finished density of the architectural trim <b>10</b>. It is preferable that the mesh material <b>11</b> be positioned such that it is directed away from any flashing that may occur from the combination of amount of applied pressure and the clearance between the lid and the mold in order to keep the openings in the mesh free of the plastic material. After the plastic material is fully cured, and the temperature is reduced, the finished product having the mesh material <b>11</b> and tabs <b>12</b>, if used, imbedded therewithin can be removed from the mold. Forming a suitable plastic material for trim <b>10</b> such as foamed rigid urethane is well known in the art and therefore the described procedure is not intended to comprise a detailed step by step description.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates another embodiment of an architectural trim <b>30</b> as it may assume in the practice of the invention. The outside surface <b>31</b> of trim <b>30</b> is provided with a relatively hard coating such that it is not adversely affected by heavy traffic, occasional hard impacts, and or weather conditions. The interior <b>32</b> of trim <b>30</b> comprises a plastic such as rigid urethane having a relatively low density as compared to the density of trim <b>10</b>. The back surface <b>33</b> can be full and without the need to include voids or formed as previously described. The combination of a hard outer surface <b>31</b> and a low density foamed interior <b>32</b> provides trim <b>30</b> with an overall light weight but a very hard outer surface <b>31</b>. Trim <b>30</b>, is therefore suitable for wall panels and even moldings that are subject to impact loads e.g. chair rails. Such suggested uses, of course, are not intended to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The architectural trim <b>30</b> is manufactured in a manner somewhat similar to the prior embodiment comprising architectural trim <b>10</b>, that is, it is cast using an appropriate mold, temperature and pressure. In this embodiment, the surface coating <b>31</b> comprising, for example, a rigid urethane plastic having a density of twenty, or more, pounds per cubic foot is applied to the interior of the mold to achieve a finished thickness in the range of approximately ⅛ to ½ of an inch. A lesser or a greater thickness is also satisfactory; the object being to provide trim <b>30</b> with a hard, weather resistant, impact resistant, and long lasting outer surface. A rigid urethane plastic having a density of approximately 4 to 6 pounds per cubic foot is applied to the hard coating and allowed to cure. In this embodiment, the back surface <b>33</b> can also be solid or provided with cutouts or voids.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Mesh material <b>11</b> is imbedded within the rigid urethane during the molding process as in the previous embodiment. In prototype testing, an open weaved treated glass fiber mesh having a weight of 4.3 ounces per square yard and a tensile strength of 150 PLI was determined to work satisfactorily. In the same testing, imbedding the mesh a distance of approximately four (4) inches into the rigid urethane and extending out a similar distance of four (4) inches from the edges of the trim proved to be satisfactory. Of course, these distances are approximate and may be increased or even decreased depending, for example, on the width and weight of the architectural trim <b>30</b>. The location and amount of mesh material <b>11</b> and the tabs <b>23</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may vary as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The primary difference between the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> being the make up of the plastic material used to make the body of the architectural trims.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates the architectural trim <b>10</b> using only tabs <b>23</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates the architectural trim <b>10</b> using only the mesh material <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows one method used to secure the architectural trim <b>10</b> or <b>30</b> to a surface of a building structure <b>40</b>. A conventional construction adhesive <b>41</b> is applied to the under surface of the architectural trim <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> which is then placed in position on the building structure <b>40</b>. Mechanical fasteners can be used at this time to secure the tabs <b>23</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) to the building surface <b>40</b>. Care is taken to assure that the mesh material <b>11</b> extends from the sides thereof and is not otherwise folded under the underside of the architectural trim <b>10</b>, <b>30</b>. Trimming of any excess mesh <b>11</b> may be accomplished at this time and the remaining mesh <b>11</b> may be checked to assure that it otherwise follows the contours of the structure. When the adhesive applied to the back of trim <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> has cured, the mechanical fasteners can be removed. A cementitious material <b>42</b> (a mixture of cement and a liquid polymer, for example) is applied on the structure <b>40</b> and under the mesh <b>11</b>. The mesh <b>11</b> is pressed into the layer of the cementitious material <b>42</b> and troweled over to cover any exposed portions of the mesh <b>11</b> and to feather in the edges of the cementitious material <b>42</b>. Finally, a finishing material <b>43</b>, such as plaster or stucco is applied over the mesh <b>11</b> and trim <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> to blend the attachment of the architectural trim <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> with the surface <b>40</b> of the building and to give the appearance that the architectural product <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> is part of the building and not just glued thereon. A coat of paint completes the installation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Attachment of the back of the architectural trim <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> to the surface <b>40</b> of the structure was successfully accomplished using a premium polyurethane adhesive <b>41</b>. The type and class of sealant however, is a necessary element of the invention. Once the adhesive <b>41</b> is applied, the architectural trim <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> is pressed against the surface <b>40</b> of the structure and held in place until such time as the adhesive has sufficiently hardened to support the weight of the architectural trim <b>10</b>, <b>30</b>. Any type of known temporary support may be used to hold the shape or trim in place while the adhesive is curing, for example, an appropriate tape applied to the mesh <b>11</b> or a removable mechanical fastener in conjunction with tabs <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A resulting thickness of the cement based mixture <b>42</b> of approximately ¼ inch works satisfactory. Depending upon the finish, texture and color chosen for the finished architectural trim <b>10</b>, <b>30</b>, it may not be necessary to apply any finish other than paint, to the installed architectural trim <b>10</b>, <b>30</b>. For example, where the trim <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> comprises wall tiles having the appearance of coral, no additional finish is necessary. In this instance, the interior surface of the molds used to make the tiles would be exact mirror images of quarried, sliced and polished coral and the color of the hard surface would be off-white.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In accordance with the above, there is disclosed and described a unique and novel architectural trim product and the method of making installing the same that significantly advances the art of architectural embellishments or trim pieces to building structures.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, the trim product provided by the invention: can comprise a medium to high density rigid urethane having a normally resulting smooth surface; can comprise a low-density rigid urethane having a hard and textured surface finish; can comprise a high-density rigid urethane having a smooth or textured surface; or, any combination of the same in an unlimited array of shapes and sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the invention has been described, disclosed, illustrated and shown in certain terms or certain embodiments or modifications which it has assumed in practice, the scope of the invention is not intended to be nor should it be deemed to be limited thereby and such other modifications or embodiments as may be suggested by the teachings herein are particularly reserved especially as they fall within the breath and scope of the drawings and description provided herein.</p>
