<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The inventive concepts relate generally to programmable or configurable circuitry and, more particularly, to apparatus and methods for configuring programmable logic devices (PLDs).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">PLDs allow circuit designers to prototype relatively complex designs before finalizing the design. Compared to application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), PLDs provide designers the flexibility of revising or refining their designs in their laboratories without having a full-blown fabrication of each iteration or revision to the design.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field, end-users can program PLDs to readily implement a desired circuit. Should the user have a desire to modify the functionality of the circuit, the user can simply change the functionality and, hence, the circuitry, that the PLD implements. Although several approaches exist for configuring or programming PLDs, they suffer from various disadvantages, for example, shortcomings that can lead to errors in, or even malfunction or failure of, the user's circuit in the field.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One aspect of the invention relates to apparatus for configuring PLDs. In one embodiment, a PLD includes a non-volatile configuration memory. The non-volatile configuration memory is adapted to configure programmable resources within the PLD.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another embodiment, a memory circuit includes two floating-gate transistors coupled to each other, and a transistor. The transistor has a gate terminal and two current-carrying terminals. The gate terminal couples to a decode line. One of the current-carrying terminals couples to a bit line, and the other current-carrying terminal couples to the floating-gate transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a third embodiment, a PLD includes a configuration memory array, an interface circuit, programmable logic, and programmable interconnect. The configuration memory array includes non-volatile memory circuitry. The interface circuit couples to the configuration memory array, the programmable logic, and the programmable interconnect.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a fourth embodiment, a memory array for configuring a PLD includes a plurality of configuration elements, and a plurality of transistors. Each configuration element includes two memory elements that couple to an output node of the configuration element. Each of the transistors couples to a respective one of the configuration elements. Furthermore, each transistor has a control terminal and two current-carrying terminals. The control terminal couples to a decode line. One current-carrying terminal couples to a bit line, and the other current-carrying terminal couples to the output node of a respective configuration element.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the invention relates to methods of configuring PLDs. In one embodiment, a method of operating a non-volatile configuration memory in a PLD includes writing configuration data for the PLD to the non-volatile configuration memory, and configuring programmable resources within the PLD by using the configuration data.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The inventive concepts contemplate apparatus and associated methods for configuring or programming PLDs. Apparatus and methods according to the invention provide a way of configuring PLDs in a flexible, reliable manner by using a memory array. If desired, one may use a non-volatile type of memory (as one example, a flash memory) to program or configure PLDs according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The disclosed PLD configuration apparatus and associated methods have several advantages over conventional approaches. First, one may provide non-volatile configuration of PLDs. In conventional approaches, the PLD's configuration memory typically uses static random access memory (SRAM) circuitry. The configuration memory loses some or all of its contents upon removal of power or even a power disturbance. As a consequence, the PLD may lose some or all of its configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In contrast, disclosed configuration memories use non-volatile memory circuitry that do not lose their contents in the event of a power disruption, failure, or disturbance. As a result, PLDs using those configuration memories retain their configurations, thus providing increased convenience, reliability, and utility to the PLD's user.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Second, the non-volatile nature of the configuration memories allows the user to avoid repeated configuration or programming the PLD. The user may configure or program the memory once and then use it repeatedly in the field. As another benefit, the non-volatile configuration memories provide an “instant-ON” capability. In other words, upon power-up or reset, the configuration memories can provide configuration data within a relatively short amount of time.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The non-volatile memories of course still provide the user with the option of re-configuring the PLD in the field, as desired, similar to conventional PLDs. The user may simply apply any desired source of configuration data (e.g., external memory, host, data or programming cable, etc.) to the PLD and re-configure or re-program the configuration memory and, hence, the PLD's functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Third, configuration memories according to the invention are less prone to radiation errors. Conventional configuration memories often use memory circuits that occupy relatively large areas within a PLD. The relatively large area tends to make the memory susceptible to errors as a result of radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The radiation may originate from a variety of sources, such as cosmic rays, background radiation, radioactive sources, etc. Regardless of the source, the radiation can cause soft errors, and sometimes hard errors, in the memory and, hence, in the PLD itself. In contrast, the disclosed configuration memories have less susceptibility to such errors.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a general block diagram of a PLD <b>103</b> according to an illustrative embodiment of the invention that includes the disclosed configuration memory. PLD <b>103</b> includes configuration circuitry <b>130</b>, configuration memory <b>133</b> (also known as configuration random-access memory, or CRAM), control circuitry <b>136</b>, programmable logic <b>106</b>, and programmable interconnect <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition, PLD <b>103</b> may include one or more processors <b>118</b>, one or more communication circuitry <b>121</b>, one or more memories <b>124</b>, one or more controllers <b>127</b>, as desired. The user may implement a design using the various resources of the PLD, such as programmable logic <b>106</b>, programmable interconnect <b>109</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a simplified block diagram of PLD <b>103</b>. Thus, PLD <b>103</b> may include other blocks and circuitry, as persons of ordinary skill in the art understand. Examples of such circuitry include clock generation and distribution circuits, redundancy circuits, test/debug circuits, and the like. Furthermore, PLD <b>103</b> may include, analog circuitry, other digital circuitry, and/or mixed-mode circuitry, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Programmable logic <b>106</b> includes blocks of configurable or programmable logic circuitry, such as look-up tables (LUTs), product-term logic, multiplexers, logic gates, registers, memory, and the like. The programmable logic circuitry may implement arbitrary logic functions, arithmetic functions, or both, as desired. Persons of ordinary skill in the art may recognize the blocks of configurable or programmable logic by various names, such as logic elements (LEs).</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Memory elements (e.g., <b>303</b>A-<b>303</b>H) couple to various signal lines in memory array <b>203</b>.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Transistors <b>308</b> facilitate the programming and verification of memory array <b>203</b>.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The circuit arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> operates as follows.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Bias lines <b>325</b> allow the application of a selected or desired bias level (such as a voltage level) to respective memory elements <b>303</b>A-<b>303</b>H.

Ground lines <b>330</b> couple to the circuit ground potential (denoted as “V<sub>SS</sub>” for the embodiments using field-effect transistors (FETs), as the figures illustrate).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Each pair of memory elements <b>303</b>A-<b>303</b>H provide one bit of configuration memory for the PLD.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, transistor <b>308</b>A allows writing or placing the programming data on bit line <b>310</b> into the desired pair of memory elements (in this example, memory elements <b>303</b>E and <b>303</b>G). More specifically, transistor <b>308</b>A isolates memory elements <b>303</b>A and <b>303</b>C (and all other memory elements not shown explicitly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) from bit line <b>310</b>.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Two memory elements with a common output (e.g., memory elements <b>303</b>E and <b>303</b>G) form a configuration element. One programs configuration elements with complementary data so as to supply a full-rail logic level at the output of each pair of memory elements.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Transistors <b>308</b>A-<b>308</b>D also allow sequential verification of respective configuration or memory elements by coupling desired memory elements to a corresponding one of bit line <b>310</b>.

Some examples of alternative circuitry and memory types include erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable read-only memory (EEPROM), anti-fuse, MNOS, EAROM, nanomems, carbon nanotube structures, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Configuration memories according to the disclosed concepts have several modes, including a write mode, a verification mode, and a operational or read mode.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For embodiments using flash cells (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), one performs an erase operation before commencing a write operation. In the write mode of operation, decode lines <b>320</b> have a logic-high level. The logic-high level turns ON transistors <b>308</b>A-<b>308</b>D (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), thus coupling the respective memory element outputs and bit lines <b>310</b>.

For example, one may generate word bias-signal <b>410</b> such that its level depends on one or more desired semiconductor process parameters for a particular PLD, or device characteristics for a particular PLD, wafer, or batch of PLDs.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As another example, one may generate word bias signal <b>410</b> such that it takes into account the PLD's operating and/or environmental conditions, such as temperature (e.g., temperature of a particular circuit, or the entire die), voltage levels, such as supply voltages, and the like, as desired. By providing word bias signal <b>410</b> based on the operating or environmental conditions, one may adjust the voltage level of word bias signal <b>410</b> in a dynamic or time-varying manner.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">More specifically, one store within the PLD particular characteristics of a particular device, die, or circuit. In other words, during or after manufacture of the particular device (e.g., PLD, batch of PLDs, or a wafer), one may measure particular characteristics, for example, threshold voltage of one or more transistors. One may then store some or all of those characteristics within the PLD.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">To do so, one may encode and store the desired information by using programmable fuses <b>450</b>. As persons of ordinary skill in the art who have the benefit of the description of the invention understand, depending on factors such as design and performance specifications and available or desired technology, one may use other techniques for storing the information.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">During operation, word bias generator <b>403</b> uses the encoded/stored information to generate appropriate levels of word bias signal <b>410</b>. In other words, word bias generator <b>403</b> decodes or extracts the encoded/stored information in order to obtain information about the particular characteristics of the PLD in which it resigns. Using that information, word bias generator <b>403</b> generates appropriate bias levels for word lines <b>315</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As noted above, in addition, or instead of taking into account the PLD's characteristics to generate word bias signal <b>410</b>, one may also use one or more of the PLD's operating and/or environmental conditions. To do so, sensor <b>453</b> senses the operating and/or environmental condition(s) and generates signal <b>456</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Summing circuit <b>465</b> receives signal <b>456</b>, compares it to reference signal <b>460</b>, and provides the resulting signal (an error signal) to amplifier <b>468</b>. The output signal of summing circuit <b>465</b> constitutes a difference signal, i.e., the difference between reference signal <b>460</b> and output signal <b>456</b> of sensor <b>453</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Amplifier <b>468</b> amplifies the output signal of summing circuit <b>465</b> and generates signal <b>472</b>. Word bias generator <b>403</b> generates word bias signal <b>410</b> based at least in part on signal <b>472</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Persons of ordinary skill in the art who have the benefit of the description of the invention recognize that amplifier <b>468</b> may constitute an optional circuit block, based on factors such as the gain of summing circuit <b>465</b>, the characteristics of the particular circuitry within word bias generator <b>403</b>, or both. Furthermore, one may omit summing circuit <b>468</b> (and reference signal <b>460</b>) and use signal <b>456</b> as the input signal of amplifier <b>468</b> (or word bias generator <b>403</b>), as desired. In such a situation, word bias signal <b>410</b> depends on the sensed signal <b>456</b>, rather than on the difference between sensed signal <b>456</b> and reference signal <b>460</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Generally, note that one may apply the inventive concepts effectively to various programmable logic circuitry or ICs known by other names in the art, as desired, and as persons skilled in the art with the benefit of the description of the invention understand. Such circuitry includes devices known as field-programmable gate array (FPGA), complex programmable logic device (CPLD), and programmable gate array (PGA).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring to the figures, persons of ordinary skill in the art will note that the various blocks shown may depict mainly the conceptual functions and signal flow. The actual circuit implementation may or may not contain separately identifiable hardware for the various functional blocks and may or may not use the particular circuitry shown.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">For example, one may combine the functionality of various blocks into one circuit block, as desired. Furthermore, one may realize the functionality of a single block in several circuit blocks, as desired. The choice of circuit implementation depends on various factors, such as particular design and performance specifications for a given implementation, as persons of ordinary skill in the art who have the benefit of the description of the invention understand.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Other modifications and alternative embodiments of the invention in addition to those described here will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art who have the benefit of the description of the invention. Accordingly, this description teaches those skilled in the art the manner of carrying out the invention and are to be construed as illustrative only.</p>
