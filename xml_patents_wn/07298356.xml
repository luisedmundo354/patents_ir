<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to the technical field of electro-optic devices, such as active matrix-type liquid crystal devices, electrophoresis devices, e.g., electronic paper, and electroluminescent display devices. The invention also relates to the technical field of electronic equipment including, such electro-optic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An electro-optic device driven by an active matrix can include a substrate having pixel electrodes arranged in a matrix, thin film transistors (TFTs) that are connected to each of the electrodes, and data lines and scanning lines both of which are connected to each of the TFTs and disposed in the directions parallel to a row direction and to a column direction, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The electro-optic device can further include a counter substrate facing the substrate. The counter substrate includes, for example, a counter electrode thereon facing the pixel electrodes. Furthermore, the electro-optic device can include, for example, a liquid crystal layer disposed between the pixel electrodes and the counter electrode. This structure of the electro-optic device allows image display. A predetermined potential difference between the pixel electrodes and the counter electrode appropriately changes the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer, thereby changing the transmission factor of the light that is transmitted through the liquid crystal layer. Thus, the electro-optic device can display images.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The substrate in the electro-optic device can include an image display area and a peripheral area. The image display area includes, for example, the scanning lines, the data lines, and the pixel electrodes. The peripheral area includes, for example, scanning line-driving circuits, a data line-driving circuit, and external circuit-connecting terminals that supply these circuits with predetermined signals.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Problems exist in known electro-optic devices. For example, a sealing member is generally used in the peripheral area so as to combine the substrate with the counter substrate. In terms of, for example, ease of handling and the relatively strong adhesive force, photo-curable resins are preferably used as the sealing member. In this case, in order to cure the sealing member, light must be radiated on the sealing member sandwiched between the substrate and the counter substrate. On the other hand, various wiring lines must be formed in the image display area and the peripheral area. Examples of the wiring lines include wiring lines that connect the scanning lines with the scanning line-driving circuits, wiring lines that connect data lines with the data line-driving circuit, wiring lines for a sampling circuit to preferably supply the data lines with image signals, and image signal lines that supply the image signals themselves. Accordingly, both the sealing member and the various wiring lines must be formed in the predetermined area of the peripheral area. Therefore, in order to cure the sealing member, a light path must be secured, for example, with predetermined clearances provided in the predetermined area.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Unfortunately, in the practical use of the completed electro-optic device having the structure, the light unintentionally leaks through, for example, the predetermined clearances provided as the light path. When the electro-optic device is used as a light valve of a projection display, such as a liquid crystal projector, light is radiated on the light valve and the light passing through the light valve is then projected, while being magnified onto a screen to display an image. However, if the predetermined clearances are provided in the predetermined area, the light leaking through the clearances becomes mixed with the light passing through the light valve. In this case, an image of the pattern, for example, of the various wiring lines is shown at the periphery of the image on the screen. This phenomenon deteriorates the quality of the image.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the known electro-optic device, storage capacitors are formed in the image display area in order to improve the holding property of the electrical potential at the pixel electrodes. Since one electrode (hereinafter may be referred to as capacitor electrode) that forms a storage capacitor preferably has a constant electrical potential, the capacitor electrode is connected to an external circuit-connecting terminal formed at the peripheral area. In this case, however, when the capacitor electrode and the external circuit-connecting terminal are connected through a contact hole, the contact hole often causes a high resistance. In addition, the properties vary depending on the contact holes. This structure increases the time constant of the capacitor electrode or that of the wiring line that extends from the capacitor electrode. Unfortunately, crosstalk is generated on the image. When the wiring is formed across the image display area, the crosstalk is observed as horizontal crosstalk.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an object of the invention to provide an electro-optic device that displays a high quality image. According to the electro-optic device of the invention, an unnecessary image caused by light leakage is not generated at the periphery of the image, and a predetermined electrical potential is adequately supplied to the capacitor electrodes. Furthermore, it is an object of the present invention to provide electronic equipment including the electro-optic device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to solve the above problems, an electro-optic device according to a first aspect of the invention can include a substrate, data lines extending in one direction above the substrate, scanning lines extending in the direction orthogonal to the data lines above the substrate, switching elements to which scanning signals are supplied from the scanning lines, the switching elements being disposed above the substrate, pixel electrodes to which image signals are supplied from the data lines through the switching elements, the pixel electrodes being disposed above the substrate. In addition, the substrate has an image display area including the pixel electrodes and the switching elements, and a peripheral area at the periphery of the image display area. The electro-optic device according to the first aspect of the invention can further include storage capacitors holding an electrical potential at the pixel electrodes for a predetermined time, the storage capacitors being disposed above the image display area, first wiring that supplies capacitor electrodes of the storage capacitors with a predetermined electrical potential, the first wiring being disposed above the image display area, and a frame (i.e., frame-shaped pattern) formed as the same film as the first wiring, the frame being disposed at least a part of a frame area between the image display area and the peripheral area.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the electro-optic device of the invention, scanning signals are supplied to thin film transistors, which are an example of a switching element, through scanning lines to control the on and off state of the transistors. On the other hand, image signals are supplied to pixel electrodes through data lines. In response to the on/off control in the thin film transistor, the application/non-application of the image signals to the pixel electrodes is controlled. This control system provides the electro-optic device of the present invention with an active matrix driving system. The electro-optic device of the present invention further includes storage capacitors that maintain an electrical potential at the pixel electrodes for a predetermined time so as to improve the holding property of the electrical potential in the pixel electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the invention, in particular, the substrate includes an image display area and a peripheral area. The image display area includes the pixel electrodes, the switching elements, the storage capacitors, and a first wiring. In addition, a frame (i.e., frame-shaped pattern) is disposed at least a part of the peripheral area or a frame area disposed between the image display area and the peripheral area. A frame is formed as the same film as the first wiring. For example, when the image display area has a rectangular shape, the frame area is defined as a peripheral area of a rectangle having a predetermined width. In this case, the frame area has a rectangular shape in plan view. Viewed from the center of the image display area, the peripheral area is defined as an area outside the outer edge of this frame area having the rectangular shape. The above phrase formed as the same film means that in the manufacturing process of the electro-optic device, a common precursor film of the frame and the first wiring is formed at the same time; in addition, predetermined patterning processes, such as photolithography and etching, are performed on the precursor film at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The frame is disposed on at least a part of the frame area. The frame blocks light incident on the frame area. According to the invention, light leakage described in the above related art can be prevented in an area corresponding to the frame area. Consequently, the electro-optic device of the present invention can display higher quality images because the device prevents an image of a pattern of, for example, various wiring lines from showing at the periphery of the image.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the invention, the frame may be formed so as to electrically connect with the first wiring disposed above the image display area. Alternatively, the frame may be formed separately from the first wiring in the pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the invention, the first wiring supplies the capacitor electrodes with a predetermined electrical potential. For this purpose, the first wiring is preferably, for example, connected to or continuous with the capacitor electrodes. The above phrase connected to the capacitor electrodes can mean that, for example, when the capacitor electrodes and the first wiring are formed as separate layers in a layered structure on the substrate, the capacitor electrodes may be electrically connected with the first wiring through contact holes. The above phrase continuous with the capacitor electrodes can mean, for example, a pattern having a continuous shape may be formed as the same layer of the capacitor electrodes. In other words, this pattern includes both a first wiring part and a capacitor electrode part in the plane to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, the term frame (i.e., frame-shaped pattern) in the invention is a term used simply for the sake of convenience. Although the frame is disposed on the frame area, this does not always mean that the frame has a frame shape. In other words, the frame may be disposed on at least a part of the frame area. Furthermore, the frame may be disposed over the frame area and may reach on the peripheral area.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a second aspect of the present invention, the electro-optic device may further include a counter substrate opposing the substrate, and a sealing member for bonding the substrate with the counter substrate, wherein the frame is disposed on at least a part of a sealing area where the sealing member is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this case, the substrate is bonded to the counter substrate with a sealing member composed of, for example, a photo-curable resin. If the frame area has the rectangular shape described above, the sealing area is disposed outside of the outer edge of the frame area. In this case, the sealing area may include the entirety or a part of the rectangular shape of the frame area. Alternatively, the sealing area need not include the rectangular shape of the frame area. In addition, the sealing area has a rectangular shape slightly larger than the rectangular shape of the frame area. In other words, the peripheral area includes at least a part of the sealing area.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, the frame disposed even outside of the frame area blocks light incident on the sealing area. Consequently, the electro-optic device of the invention can display higher quality images because the device more effectively prevents an image of a pattern of, for example, various wiring lines from showing at the periphery of the image.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a third aspect of the electro-optic device of the invention, the electro-optic device may further include a counter substrate opposing the substrate, and a counter electrode disposed above the counter substrate. The frame has a connecting portion electrically connected with the counter electrode. In this case, the frame includes a connecting portion electrically connected with the counter electrode. Since the frame is electrically connected with the counter electrode, both the frame and the counter electrode always have the same electrical potential. Thus, the frame has two functions, i.e., a function for preventing light leakage and a function for supplying the counter electrode with an electrical potential. The device structure can be simplified due to the functions of the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a fourth aspect of the electro-optic device of the present invention, the frame may be formed so as to electrically connect with the first wiring. In this case, the frame and the first wiring always have the same electrical potential. Thus, the frame has two functions, i.e., a function for preventing light leakage and a function for supplying the first wiring with an electrical potential. The device structure can be simplified due to the functions of the frame. As described above, the frame and the first wiring are formed as the same film. The above phrase the frame may be formed so as to electrically connect with the first wiring typically includes the meaning that a common precursor film of the frame and the first wiring is formed and patterned without separating the frame from the first wiring. In other words, this pattern includes both a frame part and a first wiring part in a continuous plane.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition to the fourth aspect, when the frame is electrically connected with the counter electrode as described in the third aspect, the frame, the counter electrode, and the first wiring always have the same electrical potential. Obviously, according to this structure, the device structure can be simplified more readily.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the third aspect in which the frame includes the connecting portion, the connecting portion may be disposed at a corner of the counter substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to this structure, for example, when the image display area has a rectangular shape, the connecting portion can be disposed at four corners of the image display area, at four corners of the frame area disposed at the periphery of the image display area, or at four corners of the sealing area disposed outside of the frame area. This structure reliably allows the frame to be electrically connected with the counter electrode, while advantageously preventing an adverse effect in the image display.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The above term corner may include four corners of the counter substrate itself. The corners may further include a certain amount of extending portion from each of the corners, for example, a concentric portion having the corner as the center. The above phrase may be disposed at a corner can include the meaning that the connecting portion may be disposed at all the four corners or may be disposed at three corners or less of the image display area.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a fifth aspect of the electro-optic device of the present invention, the frame may surround the entire periphery of the image display area. In this case, since the frame surrounds the entire periphery of the image display area, this structure completely blocks light incident on the frame area or the sealing area. The electro-optic device of the present invention effectively prevents light leakage and displays higher quality images.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, when the frame surrounding the entire periphery of the image display area has the connecting portion connecting to the counter electrode, the frame can be electrically connected with the counter electrode more reliably. This can be advantageous because the entire area of the frame is electrically connected, in other words, the frame is disposed as a continuous pattern. In addition, as described above, a plurality of the connecting portions can be disposed at the four corners of the image display area, i.e., the four corners of the frame or the sealing area. Accordingly, even if a part of the frame or some of the connecting portion is not electrically connected for some reason, the other portions can satisfactorily achieve electrical connection. In other words, the frame and the connecting portions on the frame form a sufficiently large connecting area. In this case, the counter electrode maintains a significantly stable electrical potential. Therefore, the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer, which is an example of electro-optic material, disposed between the counter electrode and the pixel electrodes, can be preferably adjusted. Accordingly, the electro-optic device displays a high quality image.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the third aspect in which the frame has a connecting portion electrically connected with the counter electrode, the image display area may have a rectangular shape in plan view, the frame may have a first pattern along three continuous sides of the rectangle and a second pattern along the remaining side of the rectangle and separate from the first pattern, and the connecting portion may be disposed on the first pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to this structure, the frame includes a first pattern disposed along three continuous sides of the rectangular image display area. In addition, the connecting portion is disposed on the first pattern. The frame is electrically connected with the counter electrode more reliably, as in the above-described case where the frame surrounds the entire periphery of the image display area. In this case, the counter electrode maintains a significantly stable electrical potential.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to this structure, in addition to the first pattern, the frame further includes a second pattern along the remaining side of the rectangular image display area, the second pattern being disposed separately from the first pattern. This structure can have the following advantage, for example, when the second pattern is disposed on an area corresponding to an area where a data line-driving circuit is disposed, capacitive coupling may be generated between image signal lines and the counter electrode disposed on the counter substrate. The image signal lines are connected to a sampling circuit controlled by a data line-driving circuit. When capacitive coupling occurs, the electrical connection to one component unintentionally changes the electrical potential at the other component. Therefore, unfortunately, it is difficult to display the desired images. According to the above structure, the second pattern is disposed on the area described above. That is, the second pattern disposed between the image signal lines and the counter electrode suppresses the generation of capacitive coupling. Accordingly, desired images can be displayed preferably.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Needless to say that this advantage can be achieved as well in the fifth aspect, in which the frame surrounds the entire periphery of the image display area.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The above terms first pattern, second pattern, and terms third pattern to sixth pattern to be described later simply represent patterns that are individually defined in a semiconductor manufacturing process. (In other words, terms “A” to “F” used as reference numerals in embodiments to be described later just represent these names.)</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The image display area may have a rectangular shape in plan view, the frame may have a third pattern along two opposing sides of the rectangle and a fourth pattern along the remaining two sides of the rectangle and separate from the third pattern, and the connecting portion may be disposed on the third pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to this structure, the frame includes the third pattern disposed along two opposing sides of the rectangular image display area; in addition, the connecting portion is disposed on the third pattern. Referring to the above description, the third pattern generally includes two linear wiring lines formed separately. In this case, each of the two linear wiring lines includes at least two connecting portions. Accordingly, the frame is electrically connected with the counter electrode more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to this structure, in addition to the third pattern, the frame may further include a fourth pattern along the remaining two sides of the rectangular image display area, the fourth pattern being disposed separately from the third pattern. As in the case of the second pattern, for example, when the fourth pattern is disposed on an area corresponding to an area where the data line-driving circuit is disposed, this structure prevents capacitive coupling from generating between image signal lines and the counter electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The image display area may have a rectangular shape in plan view, the frame may have a fifth pattern continuously formed around the rectangle except for a corner of the rectangle and a sixth pattern disposed at the corner and separate from the fifth pattern, and the connecting portion may be disposed on at least one of the fifth pattern and the sixth pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to this structure, the frame includes a fifth pattern continuously disposed along the rectangular image display area except for a corner of the rectangular image display area; in addition, the connecting portion may be disposed on the fifth pattern. Accordingly, the fifth pattern typically includes three connecting portions thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to the third aspect of the invention, in addition to the fifth pattern, the frame further includes a sixth pattern disposed at the corner, the sixth pattern being disposed separately from the fifth pattern. In addition, the connecting portion may be disposed on the sixth pattern. Accordingly, the sixth pattern typically includes a single connecting portion thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Accordingly, the advantages described above can be achieved: The frame is electrically connected with the counter electrode reliably and the generation of capacitive coupling between image signal lines and the counter electrode is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Obviously, the various modifications of the frame described in the above aspects increase the allowable variation in forming the frame. These modifications readily arrange various wiring (or patterning) for connecting external circuit-connecting terminals with a data line-driving circuit, a scanning line-driving circuit, or the connecting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to a sixth aspect of the electro-optic device of the invention, the electro-optic device may further include external circuit-connecting terminals along an edge of the substrate, the external circuit-connecting terminals being disposed above the peripheral area; and second wiring being continuous with the external circuit-connecting terminals, the second wiring being disposed above the peripheral area. At least a part of the second wiring may be formed as the same film as the first wiring and may be formed so as to electrically connect with the first wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to this structure, external circuit-connecting terminals and the second wiring are disposed above the peripheral area. In addition, at least a part of the second wiring is formed as the same film as the first wiring and is formed so as to electrically connect with the first wiring. The above phrase formed as the same film has the same meaning, as in the frame and the first wiring. Accordingly, at least a part of the second wiring and the first wiring are formed in the same layer in a layered structure including, for example, the data lines, the scanning lines, and the pixel electrodes, and are composed of the same materials. Since the first wiring and the frame are formed as the same film in the invention, the first wiring, the frame, and the second wiring are formed as the same film.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">First, since the external circuit-connecting terminals, the second wiring, and the first wiring can be formed as the same layer, electrical resistances between these components can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a known art, the above components are formed on separate layers and are electrically connected through, for example, contact holes. Unfortunately, the contact holes often cause a high resistance. In addition, properties vary depending on the contact holes. These phenomena increase the time constant of the capacitor electrode or that of the wiring extending from the capacitor electrode and consequently generate crosstalk in an image. When the wiring is formed across the image display area, the crosstalk is observed as horizontal crosstalk.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, according to this structure, the above problems are prevented because the external circuit-connecting terminals, the second wiring, and the first wiring can be formed on the same layer.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Secondly, an electro-optic device including the sixth aspect, the third aspect in which the frame includes a connecting portion, the fifth aspect in which the frame surrounds the entire periphery of the image display area, and the third aspect in which the frame includes the first pattern, the second pattern, the third pattern, the fourth pattern, the fifth pattern, and the sixth pattern has the following special advantage. (Such an aspect of the above electro-optic device is hereinafter referred to as a combined aspect.) According to the electro-optic device of the combined aspect, since the frame includes a connecting portion disposed between the frame and the counter electrode, the frame has two functions, i.e., a function for preventing light leakage and a function as wiring for supplying the counter electrode with a predetermined electrical potential. According to the combined aspect, the frame, the second wiring, and the first wiring are formed as the same film, thereby decreasing the electrical resistance between these components and the external circuit-connecting terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The electro-optic device according to the combined aspect has a low electrical resistance from the external circuit-connecting terminals to the second wiring and the frame. Therefore, the electro-optic device can maintain a stable electrical potential of the frame. In addition, the electro-optic device can maintain a stable electrical potential of the counter electrode. Furthermore, since the first wiring can be electrically connected with the frame, the electro-optic device can maintain a stable electrical potential of the first wiring; in addition, the electro-optic device can maintain a stable electrical potential of the capacitor electrodes connected to or continuous with the first wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to the combined aspect of the present invention, the frame, the second wiring, and the first wiring are formed as the same film and are formed so as to electrically connect with each other. In addition, the frame includes the connecting portion. Consequently, the electro-optic device according to the combined aspect includes two more effective advantages, i.e., the advantage according to the sixth aspect (i.e., decreasing the electrical resistance) and the advantage due to the connecting portion (i.e., the function for supplying the counter electrode with an electrical potential).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The first wiring may be disposed above the data lines with a first insulating interlayer disposed therebetween. According to this structure, a layered structure having, for example, scanning lines, data lines, pixel electrodes, and external circuit-connecting terminals can be adequately formed on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The external circuit-connecting terminals are preferably formed as a relatively upper layer in the layered structure because the external circuit-connecting terminals include externally exposed electrodes. Otherwise, deep contact holes must be formed so as to connect the top layer in the layered structure with the electrodes. According to this structure, since the first wiring is disposed on the data lines, the second wiring being formed as the same film as the first wiring and connected to or continuous with the external circuit-connecting terminals is also formed on the data lines. Therefore, the second wiring is formed as a relatively upper layer in the layered structure.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, even if the external circuit-connecting terminals are formed as the relatively upper layer, the second wiring connected to or continuous with the external circuit-connecting terminals is also formed as a relatively upper layer. Thus, the two components can be electrically connected without difficulty. This structure allows the layered structure to be adequately formed on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first wiring may be disposed directly under a layer having the pixel electrodes. According to this structure, the external circuit-connecting terminals and the second wiring can be electrically connected more satisfactorily. The pixel electrodes must be facing an electro-optic material layer. In this point of view, when the first wiring is directly disposed under the layer having the pixel electrodes, typically, a single insulating layer is disposed between the first wiring and the pixel electrodes, viewed from the electro-optic material layer. In this case, since the second wiring, which is formed as the same film as the first wiring, is also formed directly under the layer having the pixel electrodes, only the insulating layer is generally disposed on the second wiring. This is because, in general, the surface of the insulating layer disposed directly under the pixel electrodes is externally exposed in the peripheral area.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Accordingly, the electrodes of the external circuit-connecting terminals are externally exposed very readily. The electrodes may be electrically connected with the second wiring by extending the second wiring from the electrodes. Thus, the external circuit-connecting terminals can be electrically connected with the second wiring without difficulty.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, according to the sixth aspect in which the electro-optic device includes the second wiring, the first wiring need not electrically connected with the frame, a first portion of the second wiring may be electrically connected with the first wiring, a second portion of the second wiring may be electrically connected with the frame, the first portion may be connected with a first portion of the external circuit-connecting terminals, and the second portion may be connected with a second portion of the external circuit-connecting terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to this structure, the frame and the first wiring maintain different electrical potentials. In this case, the first wiring has a function to supply capacitor electrodes with a predetermined electrical potential, and the counter electrode is connected with the frame. From this point of view, the fact that the frame and the first wiring maintain different electrical potentials is equivalent to the fact that the capacitor electrodes and the counter electrode maintain different electrical potentials. The reason is that when a first electrical potential is supplied to the first portion of the external circuit-connecting terminals, the capacitor electrodes maintain the first electrical potential because the first portion is connected with the first portion of the second wiring, the first wiring, and the capacitor electrodes. When a second electrical potential, which is different from the first electrical potential, is supplied to the second portion of the external circuit-connecting terminals, the counter electrode maintains the second electrical potential because the second portion is connected with the second portion of the second wiring, the frame, and the counter electrode. The embodiment of these concepts will be described later in a fifth embodiment in the detailed description of the preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The electro-optic device according to this structure can suitably adjust various electrical effects.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to a seventh aspect of the invention, the first wiring may be composed of a light-shielding material. The first wiring is connected to or continuous with the capacitor electrodes, and is formed in the image display area. Accordingly, light incident on an area corresponding to the first wiring can be shielded in the image display area. This structure prevents unintentional light incidence on a semiconductor layer (active layer) of thin film transistors, which are examples of the switching elements. Consequently, this structure suppresses the generation of photo leakage current in the semiconductor layer, and prevents the generation of, for example, flickering on the image.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The second wiring, which is formed as the same film as the first wiring, is also composed of the light-shielding material. Accordingly, thin film transistors, i.e., the switching elements, disposed above the peripheral area also have the same advantage described above. This structure allows accurate operation of the thin film transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, the frame, which is formed as the same film as the first wiring, is also composed of the light-shielding material. Consequently, this structure provides the light-shielding effect more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Examples of the light-shielding material include aluminum (Al) having a relatively large optical reflectance, at least one high melting point metal selected from the group consisting of titanium (Ti), chromium (Cr), tungsten (W), tantalum (Ta), and molybdenum (Mo), an alloy thereof; a metal silicide thereof; a polysilicide thereof, and a layered structure thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to an eighth aspect of the present invention, the first wiring may have a layered structure composed of different materials. For example, the first wiring includes two films, i.e., a lower aluminum film and an upper titanium nitride film. The lower aluminum film provides a light-shielding property due to a high electrical conductivity and a relatively high optical reflectance. The function of the upper titanium nitride film is that when a precursor film of, such as, an insulating interlayer is patterned on a first wiring, or when contact holes are formed through the insulation interlayer, the upper titanium nitride film prevents overetching. In other words, the upper titanium nitride film functions as an etch stop.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Since the first wiring has a layered structure, in addition to a function to supply capacitor electrodes with an electrical potential, a new function can be added to the first wiring to provide high performance.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In addition to the layered structure described above, the layered structure in this aspect of the invention includes various modifications. Accordingly, the second wiring and the frame, both of which are formed as the same film as the first wiring, are also have a layered structure composed of different materials. The materials in the layered structure are adequately selected so as to add a new function, in view of the functions of the second wiring and the frame (i.e., a function of the second wiring for connecting external circuit-connecting terminals with a scanning line-driving circuit and a data line-driving circuit, and a function of the frame for relaying an electrical potential supplying from the second wiring to the first wiring). The above two-layered structure including aluminum, which is an example of a low resistance material, is preferable from this point of view.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to a ninth aspect of the invention, the electro-optic device may further include a counter substrate opposing the substrate; and a light-shielding film above the counter substrate, wherein the frame is disposed below the light-shielding film.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to this structure, for example, in the frame area, light incident from the counter substrate to the substrate is blocked, at first, by the light-shielding film, and subsequently, by the frame. This structure provides a double light-shielding effect, and provides the light-shielding effect more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The light-shielding film may include a frame-shaped light-shielding film disposed around the periphery of the counter substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to this structure, the double light-shielding effect can be achieved more reliably because the light-shielding film includes the frame-shaped light-shielding film.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In order to solve the above problems, electronic equipment of the present invention includes the above electro-optic device of the present invention. (The electro-optic device includes the above various modifications.)</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The electronic equipment of the invention includes the electro-optic device of the present invention. Accordingly, the electronic equipment of the present invention prevents an image of a pattern of, for example, the various wiring lines from being shown at the periphery of the image. The invention provides electronic equipment that can display high quality images. Examples of the electronic equipment include projectors, liquid crystal televisions, cell phones, electronic notebooks, word processors, video cameras having a viewfinder or a direct-view monitor, workstations, videophones, POS terminals, and touch panels.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">These functions and other benefits of the invention are clarified by embodiments described below.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. In the following embodiments, an electro-optic device of the invention is applied to a liquid crystal device.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The overall structure of a first embodiment according to an electro-optic device of the invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view of the electro-optic device including a TFT array substrate and components formed thereon, viewed from a direction of a counter substrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view taken along line H-H′ of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this embodiment, a liquid crystal device driven by a TFT active matrix driving system and having a built-in driving circuit is used as an example of the electro-optic device.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a TFT array substrate <b>10</b> and a counter substrate <b>20</b> are disposed facing each other. A liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> is filled between the TFT array substrate <b>10</b> and the counter substrate <b>20</b>. The TFT array substrate <b>10</b> and the counter substrate <b>20</b> are bonded each other by a sealing member <b>52</b> in a sealing area disposed around an image display area <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The sealing member <b>52</b> is composed of, for example, an ultraviolet (UV) curable resin or a thermosetting resin for bonding both of the substrates together.

<p id="p-0125" num="0124">A fourth layer formed on the third layer includes data lines <b>6</b><i>a</i>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a data line <b>6</b><i>a </i>includes three films, i.e., from the bottom, an aluminum film (see reference numeral <b>41</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), a titanium nitride film (see reference numeral <b>41</b>TN in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), and a silicon nitride film (see reference numeral <b>401</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The silicon nitride film is patterned so that the aluminum film and the titanium nitride film formed thereunder are covered with the silicon nitride film having slightly larger dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">A capacitor wiring-relay layer <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and a second relay electrode <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, both of which are composed of the same film as the data line <b>6</b><i>a</i>, are formed on the fourth layer. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in plan view, the planar shapes of the capacitor wiring-relay layer <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and the second relay electrode <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> are not continuous with the data line <b>6</b><i>a</i>, but are separated from each other in the pattern. For example, in a data line <b>6</b><i>a </i>disposed at the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a capacitor wiring-relay layer <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> having a substantially rectangular shape is disposed at the right side of the data line <b>6</b><i>a</i>, and in addition, a second relay electrode <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> having a substantially rectangular shape slightly larger than that of the capacitor wiring-relay layer <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> is disposed at the right side of the capacitor wiring-relay layer <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">A second insulating interlayer <b>42</b> is formed between the storage capacitor <b>70</b> and the data line <b>6</b><i>a</i>. The second insulating interlayer <b>42</b> is composed of a silicate glass, such as NSG, PSG, BSG, and BPSG; silicon nitride; or silicon oxide. The second insulating interlayer <b>42</b> is preferably formed by plasma chemical vapor deposition with tetraethyl orthosilicate gas. As described above, the contact hole <b>81</b> is formed through the second insulating interlayer <b>42</b>. The heavily doped source region <b>1</b><i>d </i>of the TFT <b>30</b> is electrically connected with a data line <b>6</b><i>a </i>through the contact hole <b>81</b>. A contact hole <b>801</b> is formed through the second insulating interlayer <b>42</b>. The contact hole <b>801</b> electronically connects the capacitor wiring-relay layer <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> with the capacitor electrode <b>300</b>, which is an upper electrode of the storage capacitor <b>70</b>. Furthermore, the contact hole <b>882</b> is formed through the second insulating interlayer <b>42</b>. The contact hole <b>882</b> electrically connects the second relay electrode <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> with the relay electrode <b>719</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">A fifth layer formed on the fourth layer includes capacitor wiring <b>400</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in plan view, the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> is formed in grid shape and extends in the X direction and in the Y direction in the figure. Each part of the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> extending in the Y direction is formed such that the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> particularly covers each of the data lines <b>6</b><i>a</i>. The capacitor wiring <b>400</b> has a width larger than that of the data lines <b>6</b><i>a</i>. Each part of the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> extending in the X direction has a cut portion around the center of one side of each of the pixel electrodes <b>9</b><i>a </i>in order to provide a space where a third relay electrode <b>402</b>, to be described later, is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Furthermore, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, roughly triangular areas are formed at the corners of intersections formed by each of the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> extending in the X direction and the Y direction such that the triangular areas fill the corners. These triangular areas of the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> can effectively shield light incident on the semiconductor layer <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the TFT <b>30</b>. Light obliquely incident on the semiconductor layer <b>1</b><i>a </i>is reflected or absorbed at the triangular areas and does not reach the semiconductor layer <b>1</b><i>a</i>. Consequently, this structure suppresses the generation of photo leakage current, and provides high quality images without, for example, flickering.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The capacitor wiring <b>400</b> is extended from the image display area <b>10</b><i>a </i>including arranged pixel electrodes <b>9</b><i>a </i>and the surrounding part of the image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The capacitor wiring <b>400</b> is electrically connected with the electrical potential of the counter electrode and a constant electrical potential source of a driving circuit or other peripheral circuits. Accordingly, the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> has a fixed electrical potential (see a later description relating to the wiring <b>404</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As described above, the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> covers the entirety of each data lines <b>6</b><i>a </i>and has a fixed electrical potential. Accordingly, the influence of capacitive coupling generated between the data lines <b>6</b><i>a </i>and pixel electrodes <b>9</b><i>a </i>can be removed. The change of electrical potential in the pixel electrodes <b>9</b><i>a </i>caused by the electrical connection to the data lines <b>6</b><i>a </i>can be prevented. Therefore, unevenness of the display, generated along the data lines <b>6</b><i>a</i>, can be suppressed in the image. In particular, according to the first embodiment, since the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> is formed in a grid shape, unnecessary capacitive coupling can be suppressed in areas formed by extending the scanning lines <b>11</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Third relay electrodes <b>402</b> that are composed of the same film as the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> are formed on the fifth layer.

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The capacitor wiring <b>400</b> and the third relay electrodes <b>402</b> include two films, i.e., a lower aluminum film and an upper titanium nitride film. The capacitor wiring <b>400</b> and the third relay electrodes <b>402</b> function as a light-shielding layer because aluminum has relatively superior light-reflection properties and titanium nitride has relatively superior light-absorption properties. This structure can block the light (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) incident on the semiconductor layer <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the TFT <b>30</b> at the upper side.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">According to the first embodiment, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>7</b>(<i>b</i>), layout wiring extended from the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> is formed at an area other than the image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>.

The layout wiring will now be described with reference to the figures cited above and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and clearly shows the arrangement of the layout wiring, which includes the wiring <b>404</b> and the frame <b>406</b>, and the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for the purpose described above, for example, the reduction scale of the wiring <b>404</b>, and the reduction scale, the planar shape, and the array pitch of the frame <b>406</b> are modified so that the components can be appropriately recognized. Some components shown in other figures (for example a data line-driving circuit <b>101</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and third relay electrodes <b>402</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5)</figref> are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>8</b>, the wiring <b>404</b>, which is extended from the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> through the frame <b>406</b>, is formed in the peripheral area. The wiring <b>404</b> is formed as the same film as the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> and the third relay electrodes <b>402</b> (hereinafter may be referred to as capacitor wiring <b>400</b> etc.) on the third insulating interlayer <b>43</b>. The wiring <b>404</b> includes two films, i.e., a lower aluminum film and an upper titanium nitride film, as in the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> and the third relay electrodes <b>402</b>.</p>

The contact hole <b>44</b>H<b>1</b> reaches the wiring <b>404</b>, and the upper surface of the wiring <b>404</b> is exposed. Thus, the external circuit-connecting terminal <b>102</b>Q is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In the formation of the contact hole <b>44</b>H<b>1</b>, the upper titanium nitride film of the wiring <b>404</b> may be removed.

If the upper titanium nitride film of the wiring <b>404</b> remains, inspection of the electro-optic device through the external circuit-connecting terminal <b>102</b>Q is difficult to achieve.

<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in plan view, the frame <b>406</b> is formed at the frame area that distinguishes the image display area <b>10</b><i>a </i>from the peripheral area (i.e., the area where the frame-shaped light-shielding film <b>53</b> is disposed) and an area where the sealing member <b>52</b> surrounding the frame area is formed. Alternatively, the frame <b>406</b> is formed around the entire periphery of the image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The frame <b>406</b> has a rectangular shape as a whole.

<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>), a part of the frame <b>406</b> is exposed by the contact hole <b>44</b>H<b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0142" num="0141">According to the first embodiment, the wiring <b>404</b>, the frame <b>406</b>, the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>, and the counter electrode <b>21</b>, all of which are connected with the specific external circuit-connecting terminal <b>102</b>Q, always have the same electrical potential.</p>

<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a first level adjusting film <b>11</b><i>a</i>P is formed as the same film as the scanning line <b>11</b><i>a </i>formed in the image display area.

<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a third insulating interlayer <b>43</b> is formed between the data line <b>6</b><i>a </i>and the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>. The third insulating interlayer <b>43</b> can be composed of a silicate glass, such as NSG, PSG, BSG, and BPSG; silicon nitride; or silicon oxide. The third insulating interlayer <b>43</b> is preferably formed by plasma chemical vapor deposition with tetraethyl orthosilicate gas. A contact hole <b>803</b> that electrically connects the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> with the capacitor wiring-relay layer <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> is formed through the third insulating interlayer <b>43</b>.

<p id="p-0146" num="0145">As described above, a sixth layer includes the pixel electrodes <b>9</b><i>a </i>formed in a matrix, and the alignment film <b>16</b> formed on the pixel electrodes <b>9</b><i>a</i>. A fourth insulating interlayer <b>44</b> is formed under the pixel electrodes <b>9</b><i>a</i>. The fourth insulating interlayer <b>44</b> is composed of a silicate glass, such as NSG, PSG, BSG, and BPSG; silicon nitride; or silicon oxide. The fourth insulating interlayer <b>44</b> is preferably composed of NSG. A contact hole <b>89</b> that electrically connects the pixel electrode <b>9</b><i>a </i>with the third relay electrode <b>402</b> is formed through the fourth insulating interlayer <b>44</b>. The pixel electrodes <b>9</b><i>a </i>is electrically connected with the TFT <b>30</b> through the contact hole <b>89</b>, the third relay electrode <b>402</b>, the contact hole <b>804</b>, the second relay electrode <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, the contact hole <b>882</b>, the relay electrode <b>719</b>, the contact hole <b>881</b>, the lower electrode <b>71</b>, and the contact hole <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">According to the first embodiment, the surface of the fourth insulating interlayer <b>44</b> is planarized by, for example, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Accordingly, alignment defects of the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b> due to a difference in level between the various wiring lines and components disposed under the fourth insulating interlayer <b>44</b> can be prevented. Instead of or in addition to the planarizing process on the fourth insulating interlayer <b>44</b>, a groove may be formed on at least one of the TFT array substrate <b>10</b>, the insulation underlayer <b>12</b>, the first insulating interlayer <b>41</b>, the second insulating interlayer <b>42</b>, and the third insulating interlayer <b>43</b>, and then components such as wiring lines, e.g., the data lines <b>6</b><i>a</i>, and the TFTs <b>30</b> may be embedded in the groove to planarize the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As described in the structure of the fifth layer, the electro-optic device of the first embodiment includes, in particular, the layout wiring having the wiring <b>404</b> and the frame <b>406</b>. Accordingly, the electro-optic device has the following advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">First, according to the first embodiment, the frame <b>406</b> is formed at the frame area and the sealing area. As shown by arrow L<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>), light leakage can be prevented in the area where the frame <b>406</b> is formed. Therefore, an image of, for example, various wiring patterns is not generated at the periphery of the image. Thus, the electro-optic device of the first embodiment displays a high quality image.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In particular, according to the first embodiment, since the frame <b>406</b> surrounds the entire periphery of the image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>, light transmitted to the frame area or the sealing area can be completely shielded. The frame <b>406</b> includes two films, i.e., the lower aluminum film and the upper titanium nitride film (both films are an example of the “light-shielding material” in the present invention). This frame <b>406</b> provides a reliable light-shielding effect. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, since the frame <b>406</b> is not overlapped with the image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the frame <b>406</b> does not interfere with the light that is transmitted through the image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the image can be displayed as desired. If the sealing member <b>52</b> is composed of, for example, a photo-curable resin, the light is preferably irradiated from the upper direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>), that is, from the direction adjacent to the counter substrate <b>20</b> in order to cure the resin.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In addition, according to the first embodiment, since the frame-shaped light-shielding film <b>53</b> is disposed on the counter substrate <b>20</b>, the light shielding shown by arrow L<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>) can be achieved. Even if light is transmitted through the frame-shaped light-shielding film <b>53</b>, the light is reflected or absorbed by the frame <b>406</b>, i.e., the second light-shielding film. Thus, the first embodiment provides a double light-shielding effect.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Secondly, the frame <b>406</b> according to the first embodiment is electrically connected with the counter electrode <b>21</b> through the conductive member <b>106</b>. The frame <b>406</b> is also electrically connected with the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>. In addition to the light-shielding effect, the frame <b>406</b> has a function to supply the counter electrode <b>21</b>, the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>, and the capacitor electrode <b>300</b> with an electrical potential. (The electrical potential supply is performed through the contact holes <b>801</b> and <b>803</b>, and the capacitor wiring-relay layer <b>6</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.) Consequently, the structure of the device can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 1</figref>, the conductive member <b>106</b> is disposed at the four corners of the image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Preferably, the frame <b>406</b> is electrically connected with the counter electrode <b>21</b> through the conductive member <b>106</b>; however the conductive member <b>106</b> does not disturb the image display. Furthermore, since the frame <b>406</b> surrounds the entire periphery of the image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the frame <b>406</b> is electrically connected with the counter electrode <b>21</b> more reliably. The reason is as follows: The entire area of the frame <b>406</b> is electrically connected (in other words, the frame <b>406</b> is a continuous pattern). In addition, a plurality of the connecting portions <b>406</b>C is formed at the four corners of the image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>, i.e., the four corners of the frame <b>406</b>. Even if a part of the frame <b>406</b>, or some of the four conductive members <b>106</b>, is not electrically connected for some reason, the electrical connection can be satisfactorily achieved by the other parts.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">As described above, according to the first embodiment, the counter electrode <b>21</b> maintains a significantly stable electrical potential. Therefore, the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer <b>50</b>, which is disposed between the counter electrode <b>21</b> and the pixel electrodes <b>9</b><i>a</i>, can be preferably adjusted. Thus, the electro-optic device of the first embodiment displays a high quality image.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">According to the first embodiment, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, two external circuit-connecting terminals <b>102</b>Q connected with the frame <b>406</b> are disposed at both the right and the left sides in the figure. The arrangement of the external circuit-connecting terminals <b>102</b>Q of the present invention is not limited. For example, an external circuit-connecting terminal <b>102</b>Q connected with the frame <b>406</b> may be disposed at only one side, either the left or the right, in the figure.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">According to the first embodiment, as described above, the frame <b>406</b> that supplies the counter electrode <b>21</b> and the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> with an electrical potential is formed as a part of the wiring <b>404</b>. That is, the frame <b>406</b> is formed as the same film as the wiring <b>404</b> connected with the specific external circuit-connecting terminals <b>102</b>Q, and is electrically connected with the wiring <b>404</b>. This structure can decrease the electrical resistance between the above components compared with a structure in which, for example, the components are individually formed on separated films and are electrically connected through contact holes. Consequently, this structure supplies the counter electrode <b>21</b> with a stable electrical potential, and in addition, prevents the generation of crosstalk due to the high resistance of, for example, the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In the first embodiment, the third insulating interlayer <b>43</b> is formed on the data line <b>6</b><i>a</i>. The wiring <b>404</b> and the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> are formed on the third insulating interlayer <b>43</b>. According to the first embodiment, the following requirements can be achieved relatively easily (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>)). The wiring <b>404</b> and the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> are formed as the same film; the external circuit-connecting terminals <b>102</b> must be externally exposed; and the wiring <b>404</b> must be electrically connected with the external circuit-connecting terminals <b>102</b>. In particular, the wiring <b>404</b> and the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> are formed directly under the sixth layer having the pixel electrodes <b>9</b><i>a</i>. That is, the wiring <b>404</b> and the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> are formed under the pixel electrodes <b>9</b><i>a </i>with only the fourth insulating interlayer <b>44</b> formed therebetween. Therefore, the advantages described above are performed more effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In this structure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>), the contact hole <b>44</b>H<b>1</b> in which the external circuit-connecting terminal <b>102</b> is formed is formed only through the fourth insulating interlayer <b>44</b>. As a result, the contact hole <b>44</b>H<b>1</b> has a relatively small depth, and can be readily formed.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The second embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and shows an electro-optic device having a different frame. Unlike <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> does not show the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> are explanatory enlarged views showing the vicinity of an area represented by symbol D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and showing, for example, the circuit structure in the relevant part. The electro-optic device of the second embodiment has almost the same structure, for example, the overall structure and the pixel structure, as in the first embodiment. The common parts will not be described, and the features of the second embodiment will now be mainly described.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a frame <b>461</b> includes a first frame <b>461</b>A and a second frame <b>461</b>B. The first frame <b>461</b>A corresponds to an example of first pattern in the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the first frame <b>461</b>A is disposed along three continuous sides (the upper side, the left side, and the right side in the figure) of a rectangular image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The second frame <b>461</b>B corresponds to an example of second pattern in the invention. The second frame <b>461</b>B is disposed along the remaining side (the lower side in the figure) of the image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>, and is disposed separately from the first frame <b>461</b>A (see the reference numeral <b>461</b>G in the figure). Conductive members <b>106</b> are disposed on the first frame <b>461</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">According to the second embodiment, the first frame <b>461</b>A and the four conductive members <b>106</b> formed thereon form a sufficiently large connecting area. Consequently, the frame <b>461</b> is electrically connected with the counter electrode <b>21</b> reliably, as in the first embodiment. Thus, the counter electrode <b>21</b> can maintain a significantly stable electrical potential. The first frame <b>461</b>A and the second frame <b>461</b>B provide the light-shielding effect, as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In particular, according to the second embodiment, the second frame <b>461</b>B provides an advantage in that the second frame <b>461</b>B is formed on an area corresponding to the data line-driving circuit <b>101</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the vicinity of the data line-driving circuit <b>101</b>. Control lines <b>114</b> extending from the data line-driving circuit <b>101</b> are connected with gates of switching elements <b>202</b> in a sampling circuit <b>118</b>. The sources of the switching elements <b>202</b> are connected with image signal lines <b>115</b> through extending lines <b>116</b>. The drains of the switching elements <b>202</b> are connected with data lines <b>6</b><i>a</i>. The data line-driving circuit <b>101</b> controls the on and off state of the switching elements <b>202</b>, thereby controlling the supply of image signals from the image signal lines <b>115</b> to the data lines <b>6</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Unfortunately, according to the above structure having the data line-driving circuit <b>101</b> and the periphery, capacitive coupling may be generated between the extending lines <b>116</b> and the counter electrode <b>21</b> disposed on the counter substrate <b>20</b>. When capacitive coupling occurs, the electrical connection to one component unintentionally changes the electrical potential at the other component. Therefore, unfortunately, it is difficult to display the desired images.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">According to the second embodiment, the second frame <b>461</b>B is disposed at this area as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In other words, the second frame <b>461</b>B is disposed between the image signal lines <b>115</b> and the counter electrode <b>21</b>. The second frame <b>461</b>B prevents the generation of capacitive coupling. The electro-optic device of the second embodiment can preferably display desired images. In order to achieve this advantage more effectively, the second frame <b>461</b>B preferably maintains a fixed electrical potential. For this purpose, the second frame <b>461</b>B is preferably connected with capacitor wiring <b>400</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">This advantage is also provided in an embodiment where the frame <b>406</b> surrounds the entire periphery of the image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>, as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">According to the second embodiment, the second frame <b>461</b>B covers almost all parts of the sampling circuit <b>118</b> and the extending lines <b>116</b> extending from the sampling circuit <b>118</b>. According to the invention, the arrangement of the second frame <b>461</b>B is not limited to the above. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, strip-shaped second frames <b>461</b>BB may be separately formed. In this case, unlike the case in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the strip-shaped second frames <b>461</b>BB need not maintain a fixed electrical potential. Instead, the second frames <b>461</b>BB may maintain a floating potential.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The third embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and shows an electro-optic device having a different frame. Unlike <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> does not show the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>. The electro-optic device of the third embodiment has almost the same structure, for example, the overall structure and the pixel structure, as in the first embodiment. The common parts will not be described, and the features of the third embodiment will now be mainly described.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a frame <b>462</b> includes third frames <b>462</b>C and fourth frames <b>462</b>D. The third frames <b>462</b>C correspond to an example of third pattern in the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the third frames <b>462</b>C are disposed along two opposing sides (the left side and the right side in the figure) of a rectangular image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The fourth frames <b>462</b>D correspond to an example of “fourth pattern” in the present invention. The fourth frames <b>462</b>D are disposed along the remaining two sides (the upper side and the lower side in the figure) of the image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>, and are disposed separately from the third frames <b>462</b>C (see the reference numeral <b>462</b>G in the figure). Conductive members <b>106</b> are disposed on the third frames <b>462</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the third frames <b>462</b>C are two linear patterns disposed along the left side and the right side of the image display area <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Each of the third frames <b>462</b>C includes two conductive members <b>106</b>. The third frames <b>462</b>C and the conductive members <b>106</b> form a sufficiently large connecting area, as in the first embodiment. Therefore, the frame <b>462</b> is electrically connected with the counter electrode <b>21</b> reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The fourth frames <b>462</b>D prevent the generation of capacitive coupling between the extending lines <b>116</b> and the counter electrode <b>21</b>, as in the second frame <b>461</b>B in the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The third frames <b>462</b>C and the fourth frames <b>462</b>D also provide the light-shielding effect, as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The fourth embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and shows an electro-optic device having a different frame. Unlike <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> does not show the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>. The electro-optic device of the fourth embodiment has almost the same structure, for example, the overall structure and the pixel structure, as in the first embodiment. The common parts will not be described, and the features of the fourth embodiment will now be mainly described.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a frame <b>463</b> includes a fifth frame <b>463</b>E and a sixth frame <b>463</b>F. The fifth frame <b>463</b>E corresponds to an example of fifth pattern in the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the fifth frame <b>463</b>E is disposed along a rectangular image display area <b>10</b><i>a </i>except for a corner of the rectangle. The sixth frame <b>463</b>F corresponds to an example of sixth pattern in the invention. The sixth frame <b>463</b>F is disposed at the corner, and is disposed separately from the fifth frames <b>463</b>E (see the reference numeral <b>463</b>G in the figure). Conductive members <b>106</b> are disposed both on the fifth frame <b>463</b>E and the sixth frame <b>463</b>F.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">According to the fourth embodiment, the following advantages can be obviously achieved, as in the first embodiment to the third embodiment. The frame <b>463</b> is electrically connected with the counter electrode <b>21</b> reliably. The generation of capacitive coupling between the extending lines <b>116</b> and the counter electrode <b>21</b> is prevented. Furthermore, light leakage can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The fifth embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and shows an electro-optic device having a different frame and so on. The electro-optic device of the fifth embodiment has almost the same structure, for example, the overall structure and the pixel structure, as in the first embodiment. The common parts will not be described, and the features of the fifth embodiment will now be mainly described.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a frame <b>464</b> having a pattern substantially similar to the fourth embodiment is disposed. The frame <b>464</b> includes a fifth frame <b>464</b>E formed around a rectangular image display area <b>10</b><i>a </i>except for a corner of the rectangle and a sixth frame <b>464</b>F disposed at the corner. As in the fourth embodiment, three conductive members <b>106</b> are disposed on the fifth frame <b>464</b>E, and a conductive member <b>106</b> is disposed on the sixth frame <b>464</b>F. As in the fourth embodiment, wiring <b>404</b> for supplying an electrical potential to the conductive members <b>106</b> is disposed on a substrate. As in the fourth embodiment, a part of the wiring <b>404</b> is connected with specific external circuit-connecting terminals <b>102</b>Q. In particular, however, the wiring <b>404</b> according to the fifth embodiment corresponds to an example of first portion of a second wiring in the invention, and the specific external circuit-connecting terminals <b>102</b>Q corresponds to an example of first portion of external circuit-connecting terminals in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">According to the fifth embodiment, the fifth frame <b>464</b>E and the sixth frame <b>464</b>F are not electrically connected with capacitor wiring. Although the frame <b>464</b> and capacitor wiring <b>400</b>′ are formed as the same film, the frame <b>464</b> is disposed separately from the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>′ in the pattern (see the reference numeral <b>46</b>G in the figure). Wiring <b>408</b> is extended to the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>′ to which an electrical potential is not supplied from the frame <b>464</b>. The wiring <b>408</b> corresponds to an example of second portion of the second wiring in the invention. The wiring <b>408</b> is disposed through a gap <b>464</b>G disposed between the fifth frame <b>464</b>E and sixth frame <b>464</b>F, and is connected with a specific external circuit-connecting terminal <b>102</b>R, which corresponds to an example of second portion of external circuit-connecting terminals in the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">As described above, in the fifth embodiment, the wiring <b>404</b>, the frame <b>464</b>, the wiring <b>408</b>, and the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>′ are formed as the same film. (Of course, the film further includes a third relay electrode <b>402</b>.) The wiring <b>404</b> is electrically connected with the frame <b>464</b> (this connected group is referred to as a first group). The wiring <b>408</b> is electrically connected with the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>′ (this connected group is referred to as a second group). On the other hand, the first group is not electrically connected with the second group.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">According to this embodiment, the counter electrode <b>21</b>, the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>′, and capacitor electrodes <b>300</b> individually can have different electrical potential. The counter electrode <b>21</b> is connected with the frame <b>464</b>, the wiring <b>404</b>, and the specific external circuit-connecting terminals <b>102</b>Q through the conductive members <b>106</b>. Accordingly, supplying the external circuit-connecting terminals <b>102</b>Q with an electrical potential for the counter electrode <b>21</b> allows the electrical potential to be held at the counter electrode <b>21</b>. On the other hand, the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>′ and capacitor electrodes <b>300</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that is electrically connected with the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>′ are electrically connected with the wiring <b>408</b> and the specific external circuit-connecting terminal <b>102</b>R. Accordingly, supplying the external circuit-connecting terminal <b>102</b>R with an electrical potential, which is different from that for the counter electrode <b>21</b>, for the capacitor electrodes <b>300</b> allows the electrical potential to be held at the capacitor electrodes <b>300</b>. According to the fifth embodiment, various electrical effects generated in the electro-optic device can be adequately adjusted because the counter electrode <b>21</b> and the capacitor electrodes <b>300</b> have different electrical potential.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">According to the fifth embodiment, the following advantages can be achieved, as in the first embodiment to the fourth embodiment. The frame <b>464</b> is electrically connected with the counter electrode <b>21</b> reliably. The generation of capacitive coupling between the image signal lines <b>115</b> and the counter electrode <b>21</b> is prevented. Furthermore, light leakage can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In the second, the third, and the fourth embodiments, each of the frames <b>461</b>, <b>462</b>, and <b>463</b> is electrically connected with the conductive members <b>106</b>, the counter electrode <b>21</b>, and the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>. Therefore, an electrical potential that is common to the counter electrode <b>21</b>, the capacitor wiring <b>400</b>, and the capacitor electrodes <b>300</b> must be supplied to the specific external circuit-connecting terminals <b>102</b>Q.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">It should be understood that the invention is not limited to the above embodiments. In the second, the third, and the fourth embodiments, an electrical potential of the capacitor wiring <b>400</b> and the capacitor electrodes <b>300</b> may be supplied separately from another electrical potential of the counter electrode <b>21</b>, as in the fifth embodiment, by using gaps <b>461</b>G, <b>462</b>G, and <b>463</b>G in the frames <b>461</b>, <b>462</b>, and <b>463</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In the first embodiment to the fifth embodiment, an electrical potential supplied to the specific external circuit-connecting terminals <b>102</b>Q or the specific external circuit-connecting terminal <b>102</b>R may be used as a constant potential at a low voltage, the constant potential being supplied to a scanning line-driving circuits <b>104</b>. In this case, the counter electrode <b>21</b> and the capacitor electrodes <b>300</b> have the same electrical potential as the constant potential. Alternatively, the electrical potential supplied to the specific external circuit-connecting terminals <b>102</b>Q or the specific external circuit-connecting terminal <b>102</b>R may be used as a constant potential being supplied to a data line-driving circuit <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">An embodiment of a projection color display will now be described. The projection color display is an example of electronic equipment in which the electro-optic device described above in detail is used as a light valve. The overall structure, in particular, the optical structure of the projection color display will now be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a schematic sectional view of the projection color display.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a liquid crystal projector <b>1100</b> is an example of the projection color display according to the present embodiment. The liquid crystal projector <b>1100</b> includes three liquid crystal modules used as light valves <b>100</b>R, <b>100</b>G, and <b>100</b>B. The light valves <b>100</b>R, <b>100</b>G, and <b>100</b>B are used for red light, green light, and blue light, respectively. Each of the liquid crystal modules includes a liquid crystal device in which a driving circuit is installed on a TFT array substrate. A lamp unit <b>1102</b>, which is a source of white light such as a metal halide lamp, irradiates light. The incident light is divided into a red (R) light component, a green (G) light component, and a blue (B) light component, which correspond to three primary colors, by three mirrors <b>1106</b> and two dichroic mirrors <b>1108</b>. Each of the light components is incident on corresponding light valves <b>100</b>R, <b>100</b>G, and <b>100</b>B. In order to prevent optical loss due to a long optical path, the blue light component is particularly incident through a relay lens system <b>1121</b> having an incident lens <b>1122</b>, a relay lens <b>1123</b>, and an exit lens <b>1124</b>. The light components corresponding to the three primary colors, which are modulated by the light valves <b>100</b>R, <b>100</b>G, and <b>100</b>B, are combined again by a dichroic prism <b>1112</b>. Then, the light is projected as a color image on a screen <b>1120</b> through a projection lens <b>1114</b>.</p>
