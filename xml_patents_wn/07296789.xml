<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Nonprovisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(a) on Patent Application No. 2003-190650 filed in Japan on Jul. 2, 2003, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a sheet feeder which is equipped with an image reading apparatus such as a copying machine or a scanner or an image forming apparatus such as a printer or a facsimile machine and which sequentially takes out sheets of document contained in a sheet container in a stacked manner to feed and carry the sheets to a carrier path. The present invention also relates to an image reading apparatus and an image forming apparatus that comprise this sheet feeder.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, an image forming apparatus or the like has been provided with an apparatus for reading an image of the sheet while automatically and sequentially taking and carrying the sheets of document one by one, so that the image is efficiently read and formed. On the other hand, due to progress of a digital technology, a speed of reading an image from the document, a speed of converting the read data into the electronic data and a speed of forming an image from the electronic data rise, and this makes it possible to process more documents at a high speed. Such a reading apparatus can contain a large number of sheets in a tray (a sheet container), namely, about 100 to 200 sheets. In addition, in accordance with progress of a document carrier of the image reading apparatus, various kinds of sheets can be carried.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, if the number of contained sheets is increased, in the configuration such that the height of the tray is fixed, it is difficult to make a taking-out condition of each sheet from the tray even, so that an apparatus has been known, which enables to move up and down the tray by an elevating mechanism and maintains the uppermost face of the sheet contained in the tray at a predetermined height (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.11-199065 (1999), referred as a prior apparatus below). The prior apparatus intends to acquire an advantage of improving a convenience of the containing operation of the sheet by automatically moving down the tray when feeding of the sheet is initiated and the apparatus is brought to an emergency stop in midstream of carrier path due to a carriage error such as carrying jam or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the image reading apparatus for reading the image of the sheet while containing a large number of sheets such as documents in the tray and feeding and carrying them, there is a problem such that it takes a long time from the tray is moved up till the sheet can be fed to a carrier path so as to make a total reading time till reading of the sheet is completed longer when putting a tray having a large capacity for mounting the sheet on standby, moving up the tray by a signal with respect to the key operation or the like for initiating reading of the sheet, and initiating the operation for feeding the sheet to the carrier path for carrying the sheet to a reader.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the prior apparatus, in the case of detecting occurrence of the carrying jam of the sheet, the tray is moved down to the lowest position. Accordingly, in the case of completing the jam handling and restarting the reading operation of the image of the sheet, it is necessary to move up the tray again. When the carrying jam is caused and the image is in the middle of being read or when no image has been read and the sheet should be returned to the tray while feeding the sheet from the tray again, the tray should be moved up again. However, when it is no need to return the sheet to the tray, there is no problem if the sheet is fed without moving down the tray. The prior apparatus, since the tray is always moved down to the lowest position when the carrying jam of the sheet occurs, the tray should be moved up to a height capable of feeding the sheet therefrom upon restarting feeding of the sheet for reading, and this involves a problem such that it takes a long time.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made taking the foregoing problems into consideration and an object of which is to provide a sheet feeder capable of making a time for processing of a sheet shorter by maintaining a height of a tray without moving down when there is no need to return the sheet taken out from a carrier path to the tray if the apparatus is brought to an emergency stop due to carrying jam as well as an image reading apparatus and an image forming apparatus that are provided with this sheet feeder.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The sheet feeder according to the present invention may include a sheet container for containing a plurality of sheets in a stacked manner, an elevator for moving up/down the sheet container, a sheet carrier for carrying an abutted sheet to a carrier path when the sheet container is moved up by the elevator, a carriage detector for detecting a carriage state of the sheet to be carried in the carrier path, a determination unit for determining, when a carriage error of a sheet is caused within the carrier path, whether or not the sheet suffering from the carriage error is removed from the carrier path and necessarily returned to the sheet container, and a controller for controlling whether or not the sheet container is moved down on the basis of a result of determination by the determination unit.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the sheet feeder according to the present invention stops due to a carrying error (carrying jam) of the sheet, a sheet container may be controlled to be maintained at that position or to be moved down in accordance with a carriage state of the jammed sheet. Therefore, it is possible to avoid the wasteful operation to the sheet container, to perform efficient processing, and to reduce the processing time.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The sheet feeder according to the present invention remains the sheet container at a height as it is when the determination unit determines that the sheet is not necessarily returned to the sheet container.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the sheet feeder according to the present invention, when it is not necessary to return the jammed sheet to the sheet container, the sheet container is maintained at that position and when it is necessary to return the jammed sheet to the sheet container, the sheet container is moved down. Therefore, in the case of restarting the sheet feeder when the carrying jam is removed, there is no need to perform the wasteful operation, and this makes it possible to efficiently perform the processing and to reduce the processing time.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The sheet feeder according to the present invention further includes a receiver for receiving a predetermined operation from the outside, and the determination unit determines whether or not the sheet is necessarily returned to the sheet container based on whether or not the receiver receives the predetermined operation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the sheet feeder according to the present invention, when a user performs a predetermined operation such as returning the sheet to the sheet container, the sheet container is moved down, and when the user does not perform the predetermined operation, the sheet container is maintained at that position. Therefore, as compared to the apparatus for performing the same operation (moving-down processing), the wasteful operation is not required in any case, so that it is possible to reduce the processing time and the sheet feeder can perform the efficient processing.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the sheet feeder according to the present invention, the receiver is an elevation operation receiver for receiving an elevation operation of the sheet container, and the determination unit determines that the sheet is necessarily returned to the sheet container when the elevation operation receiver receives the elevation operation, and determines that the sheet is not necessarily returned to the sheet container when the elevation operation receiver does not receive the elevation operation.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the sheet feeder according to the present invention, the user operates an elevation operation receiver for moving up/down the sheet container (for example, an elevation operation key) because the user thinks that the sheet should be returned to the sheet container. Therefore, when the elevation operation receiver is operated, determining that the sheet is necessarily returned to the sheet container, the sheet container is moved down. As a result, the processing of returning the sheet can be easily performed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the sheet feeder according to the present invention, the sheet carrier has a cover member that can be freely opened/closed and covers the carrier path and an opening/closing detector for detecting opening/closing of the cover member, and the determination unit determines whether or not the sheet is necessarily returned to the sheet container on the basis of a result of detection by the opening/closing detector.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the sheet feeder according to the present invention, the cover member of the carrier path is necessarily opened when taking out the sheet staying on the carrier path. Therefore, when detecting that the cover member is opened, it is determined that the sheet should be returned to the sheet container, and when not detecting that the cover member is opened, it is determined that the sheet should not be returned to the sheet container. Therefore, it is possible to easily determine whether or not the sheet should be returned to the sheet container. If the cover member is opened, determining that the sheet should be returned to the sheet container, the sheet container is moved down, and if the cover member is not opened, determining that the sheet is not necessarily returned to the sheet container, the sheet container is maintained at that position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the sheet feeder according to the present invention, the carriage detector has a plurality of carriage detectors arranged from the upstream side to the downstream side within the carrier path, and the determination unit determines whether or not the sheet is necessarily returned to the sheet container based on whether or not a carriage detector arranged at the uppermost stream side among the plural carriage detectors detects a sheet to be carried.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the sheet feeder according to the present invention, if the sheet reaches a carriage detector located at the most upstream side of the carrier path, determining that the sheet should be returned to the sheet container, the sheet container is moved down. If the sheet does not reach the carriage detector, determining that the sheet is not necessarily returned to the sheet container, the sheet container is maintained at that position. Thus, efficiency of the processing is intended by preventing the wasteful operation (moving-down operation).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The sheet feeder according to the present invention includes a sheet container for containing a plurality of sheets in a stacked manner, an elevator for moving up/down the sheet container, a sheet carrier for carrying an abutted sheet to a carrier path when the sheet container is moved up by the elevator, a carriage detector for detecting a carriage state of the sheet to be carried in the carrier path, and an allowing unit for allowing the moving-down operation of the sheet container by the elevator when a carriage error of a sheet is caused.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When the sheet feeder according to the present invention stops due to the carrying jam of the sheet, the sheet container may be controlled so that moving-down operation is allowed. Generally, when a trouble such as the carrying jam or the like occurs, the user is prohibited from the electronic operation; however, in the sheet feeder mounting the sheets on the sheet container and taking out the sheets from the uppermost portion of the sheet, the operation to move down the sheet container has no bad effect on the sheet, so that if making the operation to move down the sheet container available, it is possible to easily check the sheet mounted state or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An image reading apparatus according to the present invention includes the sheet feeder and an image reader for reading an image on the sheet carried by the sheet carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the image reading apparatus of the present invention, it is possible to reduce the processing time by reducing the wasteful operation when the apparatus stops due to the carrying jam and it is possible to read the image on the sheet carried by the sheet carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An image forming apparatus according to the present invention includes the sheet feeder, an image reader for reading an image of the sheet carried by the sheet carrier, and an image forming unit for forming the image read by the image reader on paper.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the image forming apparatus of the present invention, it is possible to reduce the processing time by reducing the wasteful operation when the apparatus stops due to the carrying jam and it is possible to form the image that is read by the image reading apparatus on paper.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The above and further objects and features of the invention will more fully be apparent from the following detailed description with accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings below.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a longitudinal sectional view showing an entire structure of an image reading apparatus <b>1</b> of an embodiment according to the present invention. This image reading apparatus <b>1</b> is briefly structured by an optical system <b>2</b> and an ADF (Automatic Document Feeder) <b>3</b> that is arranged above the optical system <b>2</b>, and this image reading apparatus <b>1</b> is used as a scanner apparatus (an image reading apparatus) capable of reading images on the opposite faces of a document for a copying machine and a facsimile machine the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The optical system <b>2</b> is provided with a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) reading unit <b>11</b> as a first reader, a light source unit <b>13</b>, and a mirror unit <b>14</b>. By using the light source unit <b>13</b> and the mirror unit <b>14</b>, the image of the document mounted on a document table (platen glass) <b>12</b> and is supported on a plain is made to be read by the CCD reading unit <b>11</b> that is provided on a predetermined position. The CCD reading unit <b>11</b> is provided with an image formation lens <b>11</b><i>a </i>and a CCD <b>11</b><i>b</i>, and focuses a reflection light from the document passing through respective parts (to be described later) on the CCD <b>11</b><i>b </i>via the image formation lens <b>11</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The light source unit <b>13</b> is provided with an exposure lamp <b>13</b><i>a</i>, a reflector <b>13</b><i>b </i>of a concave side condensing illumination light for reading to be irradiated from this exposure lamp <b>13</b><i>a </i>on a predetermined reading position on the document table <b>12</b>, a slit <b>13</b><i>c </i>only passing a reflection light from the document, and a mirror <b>13</b><i>d </i>that is arranged with its reflection side at 45° against the side of the document table <b>12</b> in order to change an optical path of the light passed through the slit <b>13</b><i>c </i>by 90°. A mirror unit <b>14</b> is provided with a pair of mirrors <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>arranged in such a manner that their reflection sides are at right angles to each other in order to further change the optical path of the light by 180°, of which optical path is changed by 90° with the mirror <b>13</b><i>d </i>of the light source unit <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The light source unit <b>13</b>, as shown by reference numerals <b>13</b><i>e</i>, <b>13</b><i>f </i>and the like, moves in an arrow direction <b>15</b> (a sub-scanning direction) in parallel with the side of the document table <b>12</b>, and in the same way, the mirror unit <b>14</b> moves in the arrow direction <b>15</b> (a sub-scanning direction) in parallel with the side of the document table <b>12</b>. This makes it possible to read the image of the document mounted on the document table <b>12</b>. In this case, assuming that a moving rate of the light source unit <b>13</b> is V, it is necessary to make a moving rate of the mirror unit <b>14</b> V/2. In addition, the light source unit <b>13</b> and the mirror unit <b>14</b> are moved by a stepping motor <b>42</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the meantime, the CCD reading unit <b>11</b> may focus the reflection light of the irradiated from the exposure lamp <b>13</b><i>a </i>from the document on the CCD <b>11</b><i>b </i>via the image formation lens <b>11</b><i>a </i>while scanning a unit of a reduced reading optical system or a unit of an equally multiplied reading optical system at a rate V, in which at least CCD <b>11</b><i>b</i>, the image formation lens <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the exposure lamp <b>13</b><i>a </i>are configured into one unit (not illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, this optical system <b>2</b> is provided with a document table <b>16</b> at a position separated in a direction of sub-scanning differently from the document table <b>12</b>. The light source unit <b>13</b> can read the image of one side of the document (hereinafter, this side is referred to as a front side) carried on the document table <b>16</b> with resting below this document table <b>16</b>. In the vicinity of an outlet of the document carried on this document table <b>16</b>, a discharge tray <b>17</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">On the other hand, the ADF <b>3</b> is provided with a CIS (Contact Image Sensor) <b>21</b> as a second reader at a position opposed to the document table <b>16</b>. The ADF <b>3</b> may make the image of the other side of the document (hereinafter, referred to as a rear side) to be read by the CIS <b>21</b> while taking out the documents contained on a document tray <b>22</b> as a sheet container in a stacked state one by one. Therefore, the ADF <b>3</b> is further provided with various rollers R<b>1</b> to R<b>10</b>, various detectors S<b>0</b> to S<b>7</b>, a curved carrier path <b>23</b>, and a resist skewing correction area <b>24</b>. In the meantime, the CIS <b>21</b> is provided with, for example, an image sensor shaped in an array, light guiding means shaped in an array (a lens array such as a Selfoc lens) and a light source (an LED array light source or a fluorescent lamp) and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the meantime, various rollers R<b>1</b> to R<b>10</b> are driven by a document carrier motor <b>43</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). A drawing roller clutch <b>44</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is connected to a drawing roller R<b>1</b> as a sheet carrier and a separation roller R<b>2</b> that is coupled in conjunction with this drawing roller clutch <b>44</b> by transmission means such as a belt, and a resist roller clutch <b>45</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is connected to one of the resist rollers R<b>8</b> and R<b>9</b>, respectively. If these clutches <b>44</b> and <b>45</b> are blocked off by control of a controller <b>41</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), a driving force of the document carrier motor <b>43</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is transmitted to or blocked off the drawing roller R<b>1</b>, the separation roller R<b>2</b>, and the resist rollers R<b>8</b> and R<b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A document tray <b>22</b> of an electric motor-driven type is made into a standby state with a start key lighted when an optical document detector S<b>1</b> having an actuator S<b>1</b><i>a </i>and a sensor body S<b>1</b><i>b </i>detects that the document is set. Further, when the document tray <b>22</b> starts to rise at a predetermined timing, the document on the uppermost layer of the mounted document bundle pushes up the drawing roller R<b>1</b> supported by an arm <b>25</b> freely elevating, and a drawing roller position detector S<b>2</b> detects displacement of this drawing roller R<b>1</b>, specifically detects that the drawing roller R<b>1</b> is pushed up, the document tray <b>22</b> may stop rising and in this state, the document tray <b>22</b> may be put on standby with maintained at this height.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the meantime, in the case of setting the document in the document tray <b>22</b> and rising the document tray <b>22</b> on standby, if the document tray <b>22</b> is left for predetermined hours with no signal to start reading inputted therein, the document tray <b>22</b> may be remained on a standby as it is. However, it is preferable that the document tray <b>22</b> moves down at a predetermined height once on standby so as to prevent transformation of the drawing roller R<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">If a document feeding start signal is inputted, when the document tray <b>22</b> is put on standby down below, rising the document tray <b>22</b> is performed till the drawing roller position detector S<b>2</b> detects the drawing roller R<b>1</b> and, then, the drawing roller R<b>1</b> is rotationally driven and the documents on the uppermost layer of the document bundle are sequentially fed. At a downstream side of the drawing roller R<b>1</b>, the separation rollers R<b>2</b> and R<b>2</b><i>a </i>are arranged. The drawing roller R<b>1</b> is supported by the arm <b>25</b> which is supported rotatably around a rotation shaft of the separation roller R<b>2</b>. Then, the drawing roller R<b>1</b> may contact the document on the uppermost layer that is set on the document tray <b>22</b> by its own weight or an energization force. In addition, the drawing roller R<b>1</b> is prevented from being moved down more than necessary by a stopper (not illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A convex portion is formed on a side of the arm <b>25</b>. By detecting this convex portion by the drawing roller position detector S<b>2</b> including an optical sensor or the like, it is possible to detect the height of the drawing roller R<b>1</b> from a swing angle of the arm <b>25</b>. In the meantime, according to the preset embodiment, providing the convex portion on the arm <b>25</b> and providing the drawing roller position detector S<b>2</b> thereon, this drawing roller position detector S<b>2</b> may directly detect the height of the drawing roller R<b>1</b> in the present embodiment; however, the drawing roller position detector S<b>2</b> may be provided separated from the arm <b>25</b>. In this case, by using movable coupling means, the height of the arm <b>25</b> may be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">On the separation roller R<b>2</b>, the separation roller R<b>2</b><i>a </i>provided with a torque limiter (in place of this, a friction pat is available) is provided opposed therewith. Accordingly, even if a plurality of documents is fed by the drawing roller R<b>1</b>, the document on the uppermost layer contacting the drawing roller R<b>1</b> is only fed by the separation rollers R<b>2</b> and R<b>2</b><i>a </i>so as to prevent the document from being doubly fed, and this makes one document to be separated reliably. In the meantime, a feeding detector S<b>3</b> may detect whether or not the documents are reliably separated and fed by the separation rollers R<b>2</b> and R<b>2</b><i>a</i>, which feeding detector S<b>3</b> is defined as a carrier detector (a carriage detector at the uppermost side) having an actuator S<b>3</b><i>a </i>and a sensor body S<b>3</b><i>b</i>. Then, the documents are carried to the curved carrier path <b>23</b> at the downstream side at a predetermined timing.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the curved carrier path <b>23</b>, a feeding detector S<b>4</b> that has an actuator S<b>4</b><i>a </i>and a sensor body S<b>4</b><i>b </i>and detects discharge of the document from the curved carrier path <b>23</b> may detect whether or not the documents are carried by carrier rollers R<b>3</b> to R<b>7</b> reasonably. The curved carrier path <b>23</b> has a curvature capable of carrying any kinds of document stably. Specifically, the curved carrier path <b>23</b> is configured with a curvature capable of smoothly carrying the most thick, namely, most elastic document from among the readable documents.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An outer cover <b>26</b> is provided as a cover member so as to cover the separation rollers R<b>2</b> and R<b>2</b><i>a</i>, the carrier rollers R<b>3</b> and R<b>4</b>, and the curved carrier path <b>23</b>. The outer cover <b>26</b> is freely opened/closed, and when the carrying jam is caused to stay the document within the curved carrier path <b>23</b>, the user may open this outer cover <b>26</b> (see a broken line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and may take out the document staying within the curved carrier path <b>23</b>. An opening/closing state of the outer cover <b>26</b> is detected by an outer cover opening/closing detector <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Then, the document discharged from the curved carrier path <b>23</b> is carried to the resist skewing correction area <b>24</b>. When a front end of the document is detected by a feeding detector S<b>5</b> that is arranged before the resist rollers R<b>8</b> and R<b>9</b> set in the vicinity of the outlet of the resist skewing correction area <b>24</b>, the front end of the document is crashed against a seam of the resist rollers R<b>8</b> and R<b>9</b> by a carriage force from the upstream side over a predetermined time with the resist rollers R<b>8</b> and R<b>9</b> stopped, and thereby, resist and skewing correction of the document are carried out. In the meantime, the feeding detector S<b>5</b> includes an actuator S<b>5</b><i>a </i>and a sensor body S<b>5</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The resist skewing correction area <b>24</b> is a segment from the last carrier roller pair R<b>6</b>, R<b>7</b> of the curved carrier path <b>23</b> to the resist roller pair R<b>8</b>, R<b>9</b>. In this resist skewing correction area <b>24</b>, a document S becomes approximately a straight line between these carrier rollers R<b>6</b>, R<b>7</b> and the resist rollers R<b>8</b>, R<b>9</b> and the document becomes free as much as possible from a guide surface of the carrier path so as to perform the above-described resist and skewing correction of the document. In the meantime, a distance between the carrier rollers R<b>6</b>, R<b>7</b> and the resist rollers R<b>8</b>, R<b>9</b> may secure at least a length in a carrier direction of the smallest document among the documents that can be processed by the document feeder. In other words, the more a rear end portion of the document staying within the curved carrier path <b>23</b> is shorter, the more the resist and the skewing correction of the document can be performed smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The document applied with the resist and the skewing correction in the resist skewing correction area <b>24</b> restarts to be carried at a predetermined timing; this document is carried to a first reading position Pos<b>1</b> for exposure-scanning a front side of the document, and then, the document passes through a second reading position Pos<b>2</b> for exposure-scanning a rear side of the document. The light source unit <b>13</b> and the CIS <b>21</b> face to the first reading position Pos<b>1</b> and the second reading position Pos<b>2</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Thus, the document having read its front side or both front and rear sides may be discharged on the discharge tray <b>17</b> that is supported lower than a document discharge position of a side of the document reading apparatus <b>1</b> by the discharge rollers R<b>10</b> and R<b>11</b> (however, the discharge roller R<b>11</b> is provided at the side of the optical system <b>2</b>). A discharging detector S<b>6</b> having an actuator S<b>6</b><i>a </i>and a sensor body S<b>6</b><i>b </i>may detect whether or not the discharge operation of the document to this discharge tray <b>17</b> is checked.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Sequentially repeating the above-described operations till the documents set on the document tray <b>22</b> are all removed, all of the completely read documents are sequentially discharged on the discharge tray <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the meantime, since the height of the document bundle is gradually lowered when the documents on the document tray <b>22</b> are sequentially fed, by rising the document tray <b>22</b> for a moving down position of the drawing roller R<b>1</b>, the document tray <b>22</b> is controlled so that the uppermost side of the document bundle and the drawing roller R<b>1</b> can always maintain a predetermined height. Therefore, the document tray <b>22</b> can be swung around a supporting point <b>22</b><i>a</i>; however, the document tray <b>22</b> can rise by pushing up a rib <b>22</b><i>b </i>that is provided at an end at the opposite side of the supporting point <b>22</b><i>a </i>by an elevation plate <b>31</b> and, in addition, a rib <b>22</b><i>b</i>, namely, the document tray <b>22</b> falls down by moving down the elevation plate <b>31</b> on the contrary. The end at the opposite side of the rib <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the elevation plate <b>31</b> is secured to a plate supporting shaft <b>32</b>, and this plate supporting shaft <b>32</b> is rotatably driven by an elevation motor <b>33</b> via an elevation mechanism <b>34</b> having a transmission member (gear) row. An elevator for moving up/down the sheet container (the document tray <b>22</b>) is configured by these elevation motor <b>33</b>, elevation mechanism <b>34</b> and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A position of the document tray <b>22</b> on standby is maintained by controlling the driving of the elevation motor <b>33</b> of the elevation mechanism <b>34</b> by a controller <b>41</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) on the basis of a detection signal of the drawing roller position detector S<b>2</b>. This position of the document tray <b>22</b> on standby can be optionally set by the operation of an operation unit <b>46</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in accordance with the number of the documents frequently set in the document tray <b>22</b> in a daily general usage state, and a service person or the user can set it in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, as described above, the document tray <b>22</b> can be elevated and displaced in the range between a height position at the inlet side of the curved carrier path <b>23</b> to be naturally formed by the curved carrier path <b>23</b> set capable of securing the stable carriage of the document and a height position at the outlet side thereof. In the case that the document tray <b>22</b> moves in a lower direction, an interval between the document tray <b>22</b> and the drawing roller R<b>1</b> is made larger, so that it is possible to mount a large amount of documents and, further, it is possible to sequentially feed the document by rising one sheet on the uppermost layer of a large amount of document bundles that are mounted on the document tray <b>22</b> to a position capable of being fed to the inlet of the curved carrier path <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, the document tray <b>22</b> is provided with a document regulatory plate <b>30</b> for regulating and aligning the side of the document bundle, and the position of this document regulatory plate <b>30</b> is detected by a first document size detector S<b>0</b> for detecting a wide (a length in a direction orthogonal to a direction of feeding a document) of the document. In the meantime, the document tray <b>22</b> is also provided with a second document size detector S<b>7</b> having an actuator S<b>7</b><i>a </i>and a sensor body S<b>7</b><i>b </i>for detecting a length of the document (a length of a direction of feeding a document). By these first and second document size detector S<b>0</b> and S<b>7</b>, the size of the document mounted on the document tray <b>22</b> is detected and, on the basis of this detection result, a printer sheet upon forming an image or the like is performed and this detection result is also used for controlling a height of the document tray <b>22</b> by the controller <b>41</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">On the other hand, upon reading the document on the document table <b>12</b>, the light source unit <b>13</b> may move a certain distance in accordance with the document size that is detected by a third document size detector S<b>9</b> for detecting the size of the document that is mounted on the document table <b>12</b> in a direction from a position Pos<b>3</b> (a start position of the light source unit <b>13</b> upon reading the static document, hereinafter, referred to as a third position) to a position Pos<b>4</b> (a return position of the light source unit <b>13</b> upon reading the largest document, hereinafter, referred to as a fourth position) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">On the contrary, upon reading the carried document, the light source unit <b>13</b> stops at the first reading position Pos<b>1</b> (at a position of the light source unit <b>13</b> upon reading a traveling document). In addition, the light source unit <b>13</b> defines one of a middle position between the third position Pos<b>3</b> and the fourth position Pos<b>4</b> and a middle position between the third position Pos<b>3</b> and the first reading position Pos<b>1</b> as a home position on the basis of the detection result of a light source unit detector S<b>8</b> for detecting the position of the light source unit <b>13</b>. Accordingly, when the light source unit <b>13</b> is not used, namely, on standby, the light source unit <b>13</b> stops at this home position.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the meantime, in order to read the document mounted on the document table <b>12</b>, in the ADF <b>3</b>, a portion at a back side of the image reading apparatus <b>1</b> (a back side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is rotatably supported by a hinge (not illustrated) that is provided between the ADF <b>3</b> and the optical system <b>2</b>. The ADF <b>3</b> rotates upward against the document table <b>12</b> and opens around this hinge as a rotation supporting point. In other words, rotating upward and opening the ADF<b>3</b>, the upper side of the document table <b>12</b> of the image reading apparatus <b>1</b> can be released from a front side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and this makes it possible to set a document that is not a sheet type and cannot be carried by the ADF <b>3</b>, for example, a document such as a book type or the like on the document table <b>12</b>. In the meantime, on a bottom surface of the ADF <b>3</b>, namely, on a surface contacting the document table <b>12</b>, a document mat <b>25</b> that is made of an elastic material is provided opposed to the document table <b>12</b>. In addition, this opening/closing state of the ADF <b>3</b> may be detected by an ADF opening/closing detector <b>28</b> that is provided at the side of the optical system <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The image reading apparatus <b>1</b> that is configured as described above can read the document in three modes, namely, a static reading mode, a traveling reading mode, and a double-sided reading mode. The static reading mode serves to read the document such as a book and, in this mode, the image reading apparatus <b>1</b> may read the document mounted on the document table <b>12</b> by means of the CCD reading unit <b>11</b> while scanning the light source unit <b>13</b> and the mirror unit <b>14</b> in a direction indicated by the arrow <b>15</b>. In addition, both of the traveling reading mode and the double-sided reading mode serve to read the documents set on the document tray <b>22</b> while feeding them automatically by the ADF <b>3</b> one by one. In the meantime, in the traveling reading mode, by using the CCD reading unit <b>11</b>, and in the double-sided reading mode, by using both of the CCD reading unit <b>11</b> and the CIS <b>21</b>, the documents are read respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Here, the processing upon occurrence of the carrying jam of the document will be described below. When the carrying jam is caused, the image reading apparatus <b>1</b> may be brought to an emergency stop. In this case, whether or not the document carried for reading has been completely read and whether or not the document stays in the carrier path between the reader (the light source unit <b>13</b>, the CIS <b>21</b>) and the document tray <b>22</b> are displayed on an operation panel P of the operation unit <b>46</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), and on the basis of the displayed contents, the user may perform the jam processing on the basis of his or her judgment.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The completely read documents are removed from the carrier path at the upstream side of the reader and they cause the carrying jam at the downstream side of the reader. In this case, by releasing the ADF <b>3</b> upward, the staying documents are removed therefrom. The removed documents are not necessarily returned to the document tray <b>22</b> since they have been completely read. Then, it is detected by the ADF opening/closing detector <b>28</b> that the ADF <b>3</b> has been opened/closed, and if it is detected by the discharging detector S<b>6</b> that there is no document staying on the carrier path, an emergency stop state due to the carrying jam is released.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the case that the document is staying within the carrier path at the upstream side of the reader, releasing the outer cover <b>26</b> as shown by a broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the document is taken out. If it is detected that the document is staying by the feeding detectors S<b>3</b>, S<b>4</b> and S<b>5</b>, guidance for opening the outer cover <b>26</b> is displayed on the operation panel P (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). As a result, the user removes the staying document by releasing the outer cover <b>26</b> in accordance with this guidance to perform the jam processing. In addition, when it is detected that the document is staying by the feeding detectors S<b>3</b>, S<b>4</b> and S<b>5</b> after the emergency stopping, the document tray <b>22</b> is allowed to move down and stop by a predetermined amount (for example, a preset amount, or an amount capable of returning the removed document to the document tray <b>22</b>). According to the present embodiment, taking its cues from detecting. that the outer cover <b>26</b> opens and closes by the outer cover opening/closing detector <b>27</b>, the moving down operation of this document tray <b>22</b> is performed. This intends to strongly appeal to the user that he or she should return the document by moving down the document tray <b>22</b> after the user sees the guidance for releasing the outer cover <b>26</b> and taking out the document so as to return the document to the document tray <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the document does not reach the feeding detector S<b>3</b> located at the most upstream side among the detectors for detecting the carriage state of the document and the carrying jam is caused, the drawing roller R<b>1</b> and the separation roller R<b>2</b> are slipped in many cases, and in such a case, as maintaining a position of the document tray <b>22</b>, it is displayed on the operation panel P (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to check the document tray <b>22</b>.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">On a screen of the operation panel P, various screens are displayed with changed over, and various guidance and warning for the operation are also displayed on the screen of this operation panel P. Among these screens, various software keys for setting various conditions are arranged. According to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the up/down key K<b>0</b> for adjusting the height of the document tray <b>22</b> is displayed on the operation panel P. If this up down key K<b>0</b> is operated on standby, driving the elevation motor <b>33</b>, the controller <b>41</b> may elevate and displace the document tray <b>22</b> as described above, and this enables the height of the document tray <b>22</b> to be adjusted. The elevation and the displacement of the document tray <b>22</b> are carried out step by step by a predetermined height for each operation of the up/down key K<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition, on the operation panel P, a release key K<b>9</b> for releasing the emergency stop state by the carrying jam when the jam processing is completed is displayed.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the meantime, according to the present embodiment, the up/down key K<b>0</b> and the release key K<b>9</b> are provided on the operation panel P shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>; however, for example, the up/down key K<b>0</b> and the release key K<b>9</b> may be provided as a push button type switch at an appropriate position in the vicinity of the document tray <b>22</b> on the ADF <b>3</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Under such a state, moving upward the document tray <b>22</b>, the document tray <b>22</b> is stopped under the state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> such that the douser <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the arm <b>25</b> does not intervene between the pair of the light-emission element S<b>2</b><i>a </i>and the light-sensitive element S<b>2</b><i>b </i>of the drawing roller position detector S<b>2</b> and the light path between two elements S<b>2</b><i>a </i>and S<b>2</b><i>b </i>is formed, namely, the drawing roller position detector S<b>2</b> is turned on. Under such state, the drawing roller R<b>1</b> may contact the uppermost layer of the document bundle by its own weight or an energization force of the drawing roller R<b>1</b> and the arm <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The document tray <b>22</b> is held at a height in accordance with the number of the documents with the highest frequency of usage, and when the document is set on the document tray <b>22</b> at this height, the front end of the document may abut against the drawing roller R<b>1</b> so that the document cannot be set correctly. In such a case, the user may operate the up/down key K<b>0</b>. By the operation of the up/down key K<b>0</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for each operation, the document tray <b>22</b> moves down step by step, and when the operation of the up/down key K<b>0</b> is performed after the document tray <b>22</b> reaches the lowest position, the document tray <b>22</b> will return to the height in accordance with the number of the documents with the highest frequency of usage. Depending on such operation, it is possible to set the document tray <b>22</b> at the height in accordance with the number of the documents to be set.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the meantime, the document tray <b>22</b> may be moved down step by step by a predetermined height for each operation, however, differently from this, during the operation of the up/down key K<b>0</b> (for example, the up/down key has been continuously pushed down), the document tray <b>22</b> may be moved down in a single step. In such a case, it is possible to set the height of the document tray <b>22</b> in accordance with the number of the documents with a high degree of accuracy. In addition, the document tray <b>22</b> may be moved down to the lowest position by one operation of the up/down key K<b>0</b>. Further, the key to operate elevation of the document tray <b>22</b> is not limited to the up/down key K<b>0</b> and for example, this elevation operation function may be provided to the all release key K<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The operation of the image reading apparatus <b>1</b> having the above-described structure will be described below with reference to a flowchart. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart showing a control procedure of the controller <b>41</b> from a power switch of the document tray <b>22</b> is turned on till it becomes on standby.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">At first, when the power switch (not illustrated) is turned on (step S<b>1</b>), the controller <b>41</b> may determine whether or not the output of the drawing roller position detector S<b>2</b> is ON, namely, the light path is formed between the elements S<b>2</b><i>a </i>and S<b>2</b><i>b </i>(step S<b>2</b>). In the case that the output of the drawing roller position detector S<b>2</b> is OFF (S<b>2</b>: NO), the controller <b>41</b> may drive the elevation motor <b>33</b> to move up the document tray <b>22</b> (step S<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the case that the output of the drawing roller position detector S<b>2</b> is ON (S<b>2</b>: YES), the controller <b>41</b> may drive the elevation motor <b>33</b> to move down the document tray <b>22</b> (step S<b>4</b>). Then, when the output of the drawing roller position detector S<b>2</b> is OFF (step S<b>5</b>: YES), the controller <b>41</b> may drive the elevation motor <b>33</b> and it may stop after moving down the document tray <b>22</b> by a predetermined amount (step S<b>6</b>) and then, it may become on standby (step S<b>7</b>). If the output of the drawing roller position detector S<b>2</b> is not OFF (step S<b>5</b>: NO), the operation will return to S<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The height of the document tray <b>22</b> on standby is set in advance through the operation unit <b>46</b> by a service person or the user at the height selected from among plural heights or at an arbitrary height in accordance with the number of the documents with the highest frequency of setting as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>

For example, providing the detector for detecting the lowest position in the range of elevation of the document tray <b>22</b>, the position of the document tray <b>22</b> may be set by moving the document tray <b>22</b> in a direction represented by a broken line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> so that the document tray <b>22</b> is located at the height of an initial state (a standby state) thereof that is set in advance on the basis of a detection signal of the detector. Alternatively, providing the detector for detecting the highest position in the range of elevation of the document tray <b>22</b>, the document tray <b>22</b> may be moved in a direction represented by a solid line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Generally, the height of the document tray <b>22</b> at the initial state (the standby state) is the lowest position capable of mounting the largest volume of documents, however, it is also possible to set the document tray <b>22</b> at an arbitrary height.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The feeding unit <b>270</b> arranged on the lower part of the image forming unit <b>210</b> is provided with a plurality of paper cassettes <b>252</b> and <b>253</b> connected to the paper carrier <b>250</b> of the image forming unit <b>210</b> to contain a large amount of paper having different sizes. On the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, a controller <b>230</b> is mounted, which operates the above-described respective parts in liaison with each other, in order to form an image on the paper fed from the feeding unit <b>270</b> to the image forming unit <b>210</b> on the basis of the image of the document that is read by the image reading apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As described above, in the sheet feeder according to the present invention, when this sheet feeder stops by the carrying jam of the sheet, in accordance with the carriage state of the jammed sheet, the sheet container is controlled so as to be maintained at a position as it is or to be moved down, so that it is possible to evade wasteful operation to the sheet container and to shorten a processing time by performing efficient processing.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In addition, in the sheet feeder according to the present invention, when the jammed sheet is not necessarily returned to the sheet container, the sheet is maintained at a position as it is, and when the jammed sheet should be returned to the sheet container, the sheet container is moved down. Therefore, in the case that the carrying jam is released to start the sheet feeder again, the wasteful operation is not necessarily performed and it is possible to perform the processing efficiently and to shorten the processing time.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In addition, in the sheet feeder according to the present invention, since it is decided that the sheet container is moved down or the sheet container is remained as it is based on whether or not the sheet feeder receives the predetermined operation, as compared to the apparatus for performing the same operation (the moving-down processing) in any case, this sheet feeder is not needed to perform the waste operation, so that the present sheet feeder can evade wasteful operation to the sheet container, can shorten a processing time, and can perform the efficient processing.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In addition, in the sheet feeder according to the present invention, the elevation operation receiver determines that the sheet is necessarily returned to the sheet container when it is operated by the user to move down the sheet container, so that it is possible to easily perform the processing to return the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In addition, in the sheet feeder according to the present invention, since it is determined whether or not the sheet is necessarily returned to the sheet container on the basis of the detection result of the opening/closing detector of the cover member of the carrier path, it is possible to easily determine whether or not the sheet should be returned to the sheet container.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In addition, in the sheet feeder according to the present invention, in the case that the detector located at the uppermost stream side of the carrier path does not detect the sheet, it is determined that the sheet is not fed and carried within the carrier path due to slip of the sheet carrier (the drawing roller, the separation roller) or the like, so that particularly, determining that there is no need to return the sheet to the sheet container, the sheet container is maintained at a position as it is and this evades the wasteful operation (the moving-down operation) so as to make the processing efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In addition, in the sheet feeder according to the present invention, since the sheet container is controlled to allow the moving-down operation when the sheet feeder stops due to the occurrence of the carrying jam of the sheet, it is possible to easily check the mounted state of the sheet in the sheet container.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Since the image reading apparatus and the image forming apparatus according to the present invention are provided with the above-described sheet feeder, avoiding the wasteful operation when the sheet feeder stops due to the carrying jam, it is possible to shorten the processing time and it is possible to read the image on the sheet that is carried by the sheet carrier and to form an image that is read by the image reader.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As this invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit of essential characteristics thereof, the present embodiment is therefore illustrative and not restrictive, since the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims rather than by the description preceding them, and all changes that fall within metes and bound of the claims, or equivalence of such metes and bounds thereof are therefore intended to be embraced by the claims.</p>
