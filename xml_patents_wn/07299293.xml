<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A data sending apparatus, on sending data to a receiving apparatus, searches its storage for a transmission method to the receiving apparatus. After sending data to the receiving apparatus, the sending apparatus receives from the receiving apparatus a transmission result including a transmission condition and capabilities of the receiving apparatus. When an error occurs during the data transmission, the sending apparatus reads the communication and processing capabilities of the receiving apparatus from the transmission result, and resends the data by a transmission method in accordance with the receiving apparatus. It then acquires the transmission result and stores the same in the storage.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on Japanese Patent Applications Nos. 2002-103855 and 2003-036927, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to recording mediums, and more particularly to a recording medium which records a program causing a computer to perform data transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In data transfer through a network, an error may occur, in which case data sent from a sending apparatus would not be received by a receiving apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a way of dealing with such a situation, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2001-197152 discloses a serving device which senses an error, automatically handles the same, and further notifies of occurrence of the error.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As another way of dealing with the situation, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2000-32184 discloses an image processor which can automatically switch a transmission method upon occurrence of an error to another transmission method for retransmission.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the server device disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2001-197152 is employed, however, a sending apparatus would not be able to acquire states and capabilities of a receiving apparatus, and thus, it cannot select an alternative transmission method if any.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the image processor disclosed in Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2000-32184 is employed, again, the sending apparatus cannot confirm the capabilities of the receiving apparatus. The receiving apparatus may not be able to receive data with the switched other transmission method, causing another error to occur.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Based on the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to provide a recording medium that records a program causing a computer to perform data transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The object of the present invention is accomplished by a recording medium that records a data transfer program causing a computer to execute a data transfer method including the following steps. That is, the recording medium records the data transfer program that causes a computer to perform: a sending step of sending data to a receiving apparatus by a first transmission method; a receiving step of receiving from the receiving apparatus information including a reception result to the effect that the data sent by the first transmission method cannot be processed appropriately and capability of the receiving apparatus; and an outputting step of outputting a second transmission method for replacement of the first transmission method to a prescribed destination based on the information received from the receiving apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the data transfer program causes the computer to perform a resending step of resending the data to the receiving apparatus by the second transmission method.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Still preferably, the data transfer program causes the computer to perform a storing step of storing the information received from the receiving apparatus in a storage device, and a selecting step of selecting, when sending data to the receiving apparatus after receiving the information, the second transmission method based on the information stored in the storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Still preferably, the data transfer program causes the computer to perform a transferring step of transferring the information received from the receiving apparatus to and from another apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The first and second transmission methods are preferably determined by communication protocols</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Alternatively, the first and second transmission methods are preferably determined by communication attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the second transmission method is transmission to another apparatus other than the receiving apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another aspect of the present invention, a recording medium records a data transfer program causing a computer to execute a data transfer method including: a detecting step of detecting that data is sent from a sender source to the computer by a first transmission method; and a reporting step of reporting to the sender source by a second transmission method replacing the first transmission method when it is determined that the computer cannot process the data sent by the first transmission method appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first and second transmission methods are preferably determined by communication protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Alternatively, the first and second transmission methods are preferably determined by communication attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the reporting step includes the step of reporting information about a transmission method with which the computer can process the received data.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Still preferably, the information reported in the reporting step is information about a plurality of kinds of transmission methods.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a further aspect of the present invention, a recording medium records a communication program causing a computer to execute communication methods including: a sending step of sending data to a receiving apparatus by a first communication method; a receiving step of receiving from the receiving apparatus information about a usable communication method in the receiving apparatus when the receiving apparatus cannot normally receive the data by the first communication method; and a resending step of resending the data by a second communication method different from the first communication method based on the information received from the receiving apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first and second communication methods preferably have different communication protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Alternatively, the first and second communication methods preferably have different communication paths.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Still alternatively, the first and second communication methods preferably have different receiving apparatuses as destinations of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to yet another aspect of the present invention, an information processing apparatus includes: a sending portion sending data to a receiving apparatus by a first communication method; and a receiving portion receiving from the receiving apparatus information about a usable communication method in the receiving apparatus when the receiving apparatus cannot normally receive the data by the first communication method.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to still another aspect of the present invention, an information processing apparatus includes: a communication portion communicable by a first communication method and a second communication method; and a control portion controlling the communication portion such that it sends information about a communication method of the information processing apparatus to a sender source by the second communication method when it is determined that the information processing apparatus cannot normally perform a reception process on data sent from the sender source by the first communication method.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Here, sender mail server <b>31</b> and receiver mail server <b>32</b> are collectively referred to as a mail server <b>3</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a specific example of a configuration of mail server <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, mail server <b>3</b> includes a controller <b>301</b> which is formed of a CPU or the like and performs an entire control of mail server <b>3</b>, a storage device <b>302</b> which stores programs executed by controller <b>301</b> and various kinds of information, an input device <b>303</b> formed of a setting button or the like, and a network I/F <b>305</b> for sending/receiving information through network <b>4</b>.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Mail server <b>3</b> is structured with a common computer or the like whose configuration is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by way of example. The configuration of mail server <b>3</b> is not limited to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Although the case where separate mail servers <b>3</b> are provided for the sender side (sender mail server <b>31</b>) and for the receiver side (receiver mail server <b>32</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is described in the following, a configuration where the sender side and the receiver side use one and the same mail server <b>3</b> may also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the data transfer system including sending apparatus <b>1</b> and receiving apparatus <b>2</b> described above, data is transferred from sending apparatus <b>1</b> to receiving apparatus <b>2</b>. There are three paths for use in the data transfer. The first transfer path is for transferring data through telephone line <b>5</b>. The second transfer path is for transferring data directly from sending apparatus <b>1</b> to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> through network <b>4</b>. The third transfer path is for transferring data through network <b>4</b> by way of sender mail server <b>31</b> and receiver mail server <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Hereinafter, a data transferring process in the data transfer system of the present embodiment is described.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Firstly, the data transmitting process in sending apparatus <b>1</b> is described with reference to a flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The process illustrated in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is implemented as controller <b>101</b> of sending apparatus <b>1</b> reads and executes a program stored in storage device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, firstly, data transmission setting is input from input device <b>103</b> (S<b>101</b>). Specifically, settings regarding selection of data to be sent, selection of receiving apparatus <b>2</b> as a destination of data and others are input in step S<b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, storage device <b>102</b> is searched to see if a transmission method has been registered therein for the receiving apparatus <b>2</b> as the destination input in step S<b>101</b> (S<b>103</b>). The registration of the transmission method searched in step S<b>103</b> includes registration of communication capabilities including information on the first through third transfer paths described above, and registration of processing capabilities including information on attributes. The details will be described later giving specific examples.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">If the transmission method registered for the relevant receiving apparatus <b>2</b> is extracted from storage device <b>102</b> in step S<b>103</b> (YES in S<b>103</b>), then data is sent using the extracted transmission method (S<b>105</b>). If the transmission method registered for the relevant receiving apparatus <b>2</b> is not extracted from storage device <b>102</b> in step S<b>103</b>, i.e., if the transmission method has not been registered (NO in S<b>103</b>), then data is sent using an arbitrary transmission method designated by a user (S<b>107</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Sending apparatus <b>1</b>, after sending data to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> in either step S<b>105</b> or step S<b>107</b>, receives a transmission result from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> (S<b>108</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the transmission result received from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> in step S<b>108</b> is one reporting that the data transmission was completed normally (NORMAL TERMINATION in S<b>109</b>), sending apparatus <b>1</b> ends the relevant program.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">On the contrary, if an error occurs in receiving apparatus <b>2</b> upon reception of data, a transmission result is sent from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> to sending apparatus <b>1</b> by a transmission method that is different from the one used for the data transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When sending apparatus <b>1</b> receives the transmission result from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> (S<b>108</b>) and when the received transmission result is one reporting that an error occurred in the data transmission (ERROR in S<b>109</b>), and when an alternative transmission method for replacement of the failed transmission method is included in the received transmission result (YES in S<b>111</b>), then the alternative transmission method is read out of the transmission result. The alternative transmission method obtained in step S<b>111</b> is used to resend data to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> (S<b>113</b>). On the other hand, when the transmission result received from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> in step S<b>108</b> does not include an alternative transmission method for replacement of the failed transmission method (NO in S<b>111</b>), then the relevant program is aborted determining that there is no appropriate transmission method from the relevant sending apparatus <b>1</b> to receiving apparatus <b>2</b>. The transmission method of the transmission result from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> to sending apparatus <b>1</b> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The above-described steps S<b>111</b> and S<b>113</b> are repeated until a transmission result about the data retransmission in step S<b>113</b> is received from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> and it is confirmed that the data transmission was completed normally (NORMAL TERMINATION in S<b>115</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">When the data transmission is completed normally in step S<b>115</b> (NORMAL TERMINATION in S<b>115</b>), the alternative transmission method (capability of receiving apparatus <b>2</b>) at that time and the transmission result are registered, and stored in storage device <b>102</b> (S<b>117</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The information stored in storage device <b>102</b> in step S<b>117</b> is extracted later for data transmission in step S<b>103</b>, and data is sent in step S<b>105</b> using the extracted transmission method suitable for the data transmission to receiving apparatus <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The data transmitting process of sending apparatus <b>1</b> is thus completed.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Now, the data receiving process in receiving apparatus <b>2</b> is explained with reference to a flow chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The process illustrated in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is implemented as controller <b>201</b> of receiving apparatus <b>2</b> reads and executes a program stored in storage device <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, receiving apparatus <b>2</b>, when detecting that data was sent out from sending apparatus <b>1</b> to the relevant receiving apparatus <b>2</b> (YES in S<b>201</b>), analyzes the data transmission method (S<b>203</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As a result of analysis in step S<b>203</b>, if the data transmission method is appropriate and receiving apparatus <b>2</b> can receive the data normally (NORMAL TERMINATION in S<b>205</b>), then it sends a transmission result to that effect to sending apparatus <b>1</b> (S<b>207</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">If the data transmission method is inappropriate and receiving apparatus <b>2</b> cannot receive the data (ERROR in S<b>205</b>) and there is an alternative transmission method for replacement of the relevant transmission method (YES in S<b>209</b>), then receiving apparatus <b>2</b> sends as a transmission result the report that the data was not received and the alternative transmission method to sending apparatus <b>1</b>, by a transmission method different from that used by sending apparatus <b>1</b> for sending data (S<b>211</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The alternative transmission method is determined according to capabilities of the relevant receiving apparatus <b>2</b>, which include its communication capabilities and processing capabilities regarding various attributes. In other words, it is determined by a communication protocol or the like of receiving apparatus <b>2</b>. Thus, in step S<b>211</b>, capabilities of the relevant receiving apparatus <b>2</b> may be reported as the alternative transmission method. The capabilities of receiving apparatus <b>2</b> to be reported in such a case will be described later giving specific examples.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Further, in step S<b>211</b>, the transmission result may be reported to an apparatus other than sending apparatus <b>1</b>. Specifically, it may be reported to a personal computer (not shown) of a user having performed data transmission setting, to a network administrator, or to a personal computer (not shown) of a user in charge of receiving apparatus <b>2</b>. Based on the reported transmission result, an error display reporting the occurrence of error may be displayed on display device <b>104</b> of sending apparatus <b>1</b>, a display device (not shown) of the personal computer of the user having performed data transmission setting or the like. Still further, when retransmission is conducted automatically based on the transmission result, a retransmission report display to that effect may be displayed. The error display and the retransmission report display will be described later giving specific examples. Although the error display and the retransmission report display are described to be displayed on display device <b>104</b> of sending apparatus <b>1</b> in the following, they may be displayed on a display device (not shown) of the personal computer of the user having performed data transmission setting or the like when the transmission result is reported to an apparatus other than sending apparatus <b>1</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The report may be sent through any of the above-described first through third transfer paths. When the third transfer path is being used for reporting, i.e., when the report is sent via sender mail server <b>31</b> and receiver mail server <b>32</b>, header information of the data being sent from sending apparatus <b>1</b> preferably includes mail address information of sending apparatus <b>1</b>, of the user having performed data transmission setting or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The transmission result sent to sending apparatus <b>1</b> in step S<b>207</b> or step S<b>211</b> is received in step S<b>109</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as described above, and it is determined whether the data transmission was executed normally or not. The alternative transmission method sent to sending apparatus <b>1</b> in step S<b>211</b> is read in step S<b>111</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and data is resent to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> by the relevant alternative transmission method in step S<b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The data receiving process in receiving apparatus <b>2</b> is thus completed. When data is being sent using the third transfer path by way of sender mail server <b>31</b> and receiver mail server <b>32</b>, sender mail server <b>31</b> and receiver mail server <b>32</b> also perform data transferring processes. The processes in sender mail server <b>31</b> and receiver mail server <b>32</b> in such a case will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart illustrating the data transferring process in sender mail server <b>31</b>. The process illustrated in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is implemented as controller <b>301</b> of sender mail server <b>31</b> reads and executes a program stored in storage device <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, sender mail server <b>31</b>, when receiving a data transmission request from sending apparatus <b>1</b> through network <b>4</b> (YES in S<b>301</b>), receives data from sending apparatus <b>1</b> (S<b>303</b>). It then sends the data received in step S<b>303</b> to receiver mail server <b>32</b> (S<b>305</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Sender mail server <b>31</b> receives a result of the transmission from receiver mail server <b>32</b> to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> (S<b>307</b>). The relevant program is completed when the transmission result reports that the data transmission was completed normally (NORMAL TERMINATION in S<b>307</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">When the transmission result reports that there occurred an error during the data transmission (ERROR in S<b>307</b>) and when the received transmission result includes an alternative transmission method for replacement of the transmission method using the third transfer path (YES in S<b>309</b>), then sender mail server <b>31</b> reads the alternative transmission method out of the transmission result and reports the same to sending apparatus <b>1</b> (S<b>311</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The data transferring process in sender mail server <b>31</b> is thus completed.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow chart illustrating the data transferring process in receiver mail server <b>32</b>. The process illustrated in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is implemented as controller <b>301</b> of receiver mail server <b>32</b> reads and executes a program stored in storage device <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, receiver mail server <b>32</b>, in receipt of data from sender mail server <b>31</b> (YES in S<b>401</b>), sends the data to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> (S<b>403</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">It then receives a transmission result from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> reporting that the data was received normally or that the data transmission was failed (S<b>405</b>). The transmission result reporting the data transmission error may include an alternative transmission method for replacement of the transmission method using the third transfer path.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Receiver mail server <b>32</b> sends the transmission result received in step S<b>405</b> to sender mail server <b>31</b> (S<b>407</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The data transferring process in receiver mail server <b>32</b> is thus completed.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The present embodiment is characterized in that, as an alternative transmission method, a protocol is changed to switch a data transfer path for retransmission. Processes in sending apparatus <b>1</b> and receiving apparatus <b>2</b> of the present embodiment are now explained specifically with reference to flow charts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the present embodiment, referring to the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, sending apparatus <b>1</b> accepts an input of data transmission setting from input device <b>103</b> in step S<b>501</b>, as in the above-described step S<b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Next, storage device <b>102</b> is searched in step S<b>503</b> to see if a protocol determining a transmission method has been registered for the destination receiving apparatus <b>2</b> input in step S<b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">When the protocol registered for the relevant receiving apparatus <b>2</b> is extracted from storage device <b>102</b> in step S<b>503</b> (YES in S<b>503</b>), data is sent according to the extracted protocol (S<b>505</b>). If a protocol registered for the receiving apparatus <b>2</b> is not extracted from storage device <b>102</b> in step S<b>503</b>, i.e., if a protocol determining a transmission method has not been registered therefore (NO in S<b>503</b>), then data is sent according to a protocol designated by a user (S<b>507</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Sending apparatus <b>1</b>, after sending data to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> in step S<b>505</b> or step S<b>507</b>, receives a transmission result from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> in step S<b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">When the transmission result received from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> in step S<b>508</b> is one reporting that the data transmission was completed normally (NORMAL TERMINATION in S<b>509</b>), then sending apparatus <b>1</b> completes the relevant program.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">If an error occurred in receiving apparatus <b>2</b> during reception of data, the transmission result is sent from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> to sending apparatus <b>1</b> according to a protocol that is different from the one used for the data transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">When sending apparatus <b>1</b> receives the transmission result from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> (S<b>508</b>) and when the received transmission result is the one reporting that the data transmission was failed (ERROR in S<b>509</b>), and further when the received transmission result includes an alternative protocol for replacement of the failed protocol (YES in S<b>511</b>), then sending apparatus <b>1</b> reads the alternative protocol out of the transmission result. Sending apparatus <b>1</b> then resends the data to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> according to the alternative protocol obtained in step S<b>511</b> (S<b>513</b>). When the transmission result received from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> in step S<b>508</b> does not include an alternative protocol for replacement of the failed protocol (NO in S<b>511</b>), then sending apparatus <b>1</b> aborts the relevant program considering that there is no protocol determining a transmission method suitable for sending data from the relevant sending apparatus <b>1</b> to receiving apparatus <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Sending apparatus <b>1</b> receives from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> a transmission result about the data retransmission in step S<b>513</b>, and repeats steps S<b>511</b> and S<b>513</b> until the data transmission is completed normally (NORMAL TERMINATION in S<b>515</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">When the data transmission is completed normally in step S<b>515</b> (NORMAL TERMINATION in S<b>515</b>), sending apparatus <b>1</b> registers the alternative protocol at that time and the transmission result, and stores the same in storage device <b>102</b> (S<b>517</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The information stored in storage device <b>102</b> in step S<b>517</b> is extracted later in step S<b>503</b> when data transmission is performed, and the data transmission is executed in step S<b>505</b> according to the extracted protocol suitable for receiving apparatus <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The data transmitting process in sending apparatus <b>1</b> of the present embodiment is thus completed.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Now, the data receiving process in receiving apparatus <b>2</b> is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In the present embodiment, referring to the flow chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, receiving apparatus <b>2</b>, when detecting that data has been sent from sending apparatus <b>1</b> to the relevant receiving apparatus <b>2</b> (YES in S<b>601</b>), analyzes the receiving method (S<b>603</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As a result of analysis in step S<b>603</b>, when the protocol determining the data transmission method is an appropriate protocol and thus receiving apparatus <b>2</b> can receive data normally (NORMAL TERMINATION in S<b>605</b>), receiving apparatus <b>2</b> reports the same to sending apparatus <b>1</b> as a transmission result (S<b>607</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">When the protocol determining the data transmission method is an inappropriate one and thus receiving apparatus <b>2</b> cannot receive data (ERROR in S<b>605</b>) and when there is an alternative protocol for replacement of the relevant protocol (YES in S<b>609</b>), then receiving apparatus <b>2</b> sends a report that the data was not received and the alternative protocol to sending apparatus <b>1</b> as a transmission result, according to a protocol other than the one with which data was send from sending apparatus <b>1</b> (S<b>611</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The data receiving process in receiving apparatus <b>2</b> of the present embodiment is thus completed.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As a first specific example of the present embodiment, sending apparatus <b>1</b> sends data to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> in step S<b>505</b> or step S<b>507</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, from telephone line I/F <b>106</b> through the first transfer path by way of telephone line <b>5</b>. When an error occurs at this time, receiving apparatus <b>2</b> analyzes the receiving condition in step S<b>603</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and, in step S<b>611</b>, it sends a transmission result to sending apparatus <b>1</b> via network I/F <b>206</b>. Specifically, it reports the fact that the data was not received and a protocol which determines an alternative transmission method using either the second transfer path with which data is transmitted directly through network <b>4</b> or the third transfer path with which data is transmitted by way of sender mail server <b>31</b> and receiver mail server <b>32</b>. The relevant report is sent to sending apparatus <b>1</b> using a path that is different from the path used for sending data from sending apparatus <b>1</b> to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> (the first transfer path by way of telephone line <b>5</b> in this specific example), which may be the same path as the alternative transmission method, or another path available for transmission at this time.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Here, if there is only one transfer path as the alternative transmission method, use of the relevant path for sending the transmission result to sending apparatus <b>1</b> in itself can be regarded as the report of the alternative transmission method. Thus, it is preferable that receiving apparatus <b>2</b> sends the transmission result to sending apparatus <b>1</b> using the alternative transmission method and that the transmission result includes therein a destination (telephone number when the alternative transmission method corresponds to the first transfer path through telephone line <b>5</b>, or mail address when the alternative transmission method corresponds to the third transfer path by way of sender mail server <b>31</b> and receiver mail server <b>32</b>) for performing data transmission to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> using the relevant alternative transmission method.</p>

<p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a specific example of the transmission result reported from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> to sending apparatus <b>1</b>. It corresponds to the case where receiving apparatus <b>2</b>, which is an MFP, is provided with a fast facsimile function called “G3 facsimile” for a analog communication line, a fast facsimile function called “G4 facsimile” assuming the use of a digital communication line, an internet facsimile function utilizing an internet line, and an IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) print function using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for transfer of print data.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The transmission result as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is reported from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> to sending apparatus <b>1</b> when data is sent from sending apparatus <b>1</b> to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> using the first transfer path (first protocol) through telephone line <b>5</b>. That is, when sending apparatus <b>1</b> sends data to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> through the first transfer path by way of telephone line <b>5</b>, if receiving apparatus <b>2</b> cannot receive the data with the G3 facsimile function for analog communication line due to communication trouble occurring in the analog communication line, or with the G4 facsimile function for digital communication line due to service interruption of the relevant function, then receiving apparatus <b>2</b> reports the transmission result shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> to sending apparatus <b>1</b> through a transfer path (protocol) different from the first transfer path by way of telephone line <b>5</b>. The transmission result shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> indicates that the G3 facsimile function for analog communication line failed to receive data due to communication trouble and that the G4 facsimile function for digital communication line failed to receive data because it was out of service. The transmission result shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> further indicates that data reception can be done by alternative transmission methods via other paths, with an internet facsimile function utilizing an internet line and an IPP print function using HTTP to transfer print data, by reporting access methods of mail address and IP address or the like as the communicable transfer paths (protocols). At this time, as further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, processing capabilities and attributes such as available resolution of the relevant receiving apparatus <b>2</b> can be reported along with the transmission result. Further, in the case where data can be received through a plurality of transfer paths as described above, information indicating priorities of the transfer paths may also be reported as the transmission result to sending apparatus <b>1</b>. Still further, receiving apparatus <b>2</b> can report an alternative transmission method to sending apparatus <b>1</b> by using the relevant method when sending the transmission result to the effect that the data reception was failed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Sending apparatus <b>1</b> (or sender mail server <b>31</b> when the third transfer path described above is employed) can confirm whether data transmission was terminated normally or encountered an error, by acquiring the transmission result as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> by way of example. When the data transmission is failed, sending apparatus <b>1</b> can further detect an available transfer path (protocol) being an access method such as a telephone number, a mail address or the like from the transmission result, and automatically switch the transfer path (protocol) to resend data to receiving apparatus <b>2</b>. Alternatively, it can automatically switch the transfer path to the path through which it received the transmission result reporting the data transmission error, to resend data to receiving apparatus <b>2</b>. When sending apparatus <b>1</b> automatically resends data in these manners, a retransmission report display like “data was resent by switching the protocol for receiving apparatus <b>2</b> from the first protocol to the second protocol” can be provided on display device <b>104</b> of sending apparatus <b>1</b> or the like. Alternatively, the transmission result received from receiving apparatus <b>2</b> may be displayed on display device <b>104</b> of sending apparatus <b>1</b> or printed by a printer (not shown) to report the transmission result and/or the alternative protocol included therein to the user. Sending apparatus <b>1</b> may accept a retransmission designation of the relevant data from the user, and may display an error message as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> in response to the designation.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Although the case where different protocols correspond to different transfer paths has been described in the present embodiment, the transmission method of the present invention is not limited thereto.

<p id="p-0125" num="0124">First Modification</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The first modification of the present embodiment is characterized in that, as an alternative transmission method, sending apparatus <b>1</b> switches one or more attributes of data for retransmission. The first modification is explained specifically in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the first modification, sending apparatus <b>1</b> sends data designated as paper size “A<b>3</b>”, resolution “200×200 dpi” and color information “color binary” by G3 facsimile standards, for example, to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> in step S<b>105</b> or step S<b>107</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">At this time, the G3 facsimile function of receiving apparatus <b>2</b> has capabilities and others as in the transmission result shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> by way of example, which do not support the paper size nor the color information described above. It means that receiving apparatus <b>2</b> cannot receive the relevant data normally with the G3 facsimile function. Thus, receiving apparatus <b>2</b> reports to sending apparatus <b>1</b> in step S<b>211</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> the transmission result as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, using attributes other than those (paper size “A3”, color information “color binary”) which sending apparatus <b>1</b> sent to receiving apparatus <b>2</b>. More specifically, the fact that the data reception was failed and the attributes supported by receiving apparatus <b>2</b> as alternative transmission method as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are reported as the transmission result to sending apparatus <b>1</b>. If receiving apparatus <b>2</b> is an MFP, it may send only the G3 facsimile information as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> as the transmission result.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Alternatively, if receiving apparatus <b>2</b> is a so-called G3 facsimile machine provided only with the G3 facsimile function whose capabilities and others are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> as a specific example of the transmission result, again, it cannot receive the above-described data normally. Thus, it reports the transmission result as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to sending apparatus <b>1</b> in step S<b>211</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The transmission method used here for sending the report to sending apparatus <b>1</b> has an attribute different from that sent from sending apparatus <b>1</b> to receiving apparatus <b>2</b>, as in the present embodiment, which attribute may be the same as that of the alternative transmission method or another attribute available for data transmission at that time. Further, when receiving apparatus <b>2</b> can receive data with a plurality of attributes, it may report the plurality of data-receivable attributes (in this specific example, both attributes of resolution “200×100 dpi” and color information “monochrome binary”) to sending apparatus <b>1</b> as the alternative transmission methods, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> or <b>13</b>. In such a case, receiving apparatus <b>2</b> may send the plurality of attributes with priorities assigned thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">When sending apparatus <b>1</b> receives the transmission result as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> or <b>13</b> in step S<b>109</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it reads processing capabilities and attributes supported by the G3 facsimile function of receiving apparatus <b>2</b> from the transmission result in step S<b>111</b> to convert the data to be sent. More specifically, it converts the paper size and color information designated with respect to the data to paper size “A4” and color information “monochrome binary” supported by receiving apparatus <b>2</b>. It then resends the data converted to conform to the processing capabilities and attributes supported by receiving apparatus <b>2</b>, to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> in step S<b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Similarly, in the case where receiving apparatus <b>2</b> receives G4 facsimile data, internet facsimile data or IPP print data, when it cannot support the data sent from sending apparatus <b>1</b> with the relevant function, then receiving apparatus <b>2</b> reports the transmission result as shown in FIG. <b>11</b> by way of example to sending apparatus <b>1</b> in step S<b>211</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">If receiving apparatus <b>2</b> is an MFP, it may report only the relevant transmission protocol information, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-16</figref>.</p>

Still further, in the case where receiving apparatus <b>2</b> is an IPP printer provided only with the IPP print function whose capabilities and others are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> as a specific example of the transmission result, when data not supported by the relevant function is sent from sending apparatus <b>1</b>, it reports the transmission result as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> by way of example to sending apparatus <b>1</b> in step S<b>211</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The attributes and processing capabilities of receiving apparatus <b>2</b> may include, as shown in a specific example of the transmission result in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, data color information (color/monochrome), file format, paper feed tray condition (empty) and available time period, or they may include other information. When a transmission result is obtained indicating that these attributes and/or processing capabilities are not supported by receiving apparatus <b>2</b>, color conversion, file format conversion, paper size conversion and/or others may be performed as an alternative transmission method for retransmission of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Step S<b>111</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> where data is converted to an attribute corresponding to an alternative transmission method may be replaced with a step of providing an error display on display device <b>104</b> of sending apparatus <b>1</b> or the like based on the transmission result to output a data attribute as the alternative transmission method, in which case an input of the data conversion as described above may be accepted from a user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a first specific example of the error display, which is displayed on display device <b>104</b> of sending apparatus <b>1</b> or the like when the paper size or color information of the data transmitted from sending apparatus <b>1</b> is not supported by receiving apparatus <b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0158" num="0157">If such registration does not exist in storage device <b>102</b> of sending apparatus <b>1</b><i>a</i>, sending apparatus <b>1</b><i>a </i>searches storage devices of other sending apparatuses <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>via network I/F <b>105</b> through network <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As a result, if there is such registration in other sending apparatus <b>1</b><i>b </i>or <b>1</b><i>c</i>, it can read the registration of previous transmission result and transmission method for receiving apparatus <b>2</b>, or it can receive the registered information sent from other sending apparatus <b>1</b><i>b </i>or <b>1</b><i>c</i>. More specifically, in the case where receiving apparatus <b>2</b> is the G3 facsimile whose capabilities and others are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> as the transmission result, sending apparatus <b>1</b><i>a </i>obtains information read (or sent) from other sending apparatus <b>1</b><i>b </i>or <b>1</b><i>c </i>that the above-described paper size and color information are not supported. Thus, it converts the data to paper size “A4”, color information “monochrome binary” to conform to the attributes supported by receiving apparatus <b>2</b>, and then sends the converted data to receiving apparatus <b>2</b> in step S<b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Although the method of resending data by changing a data attribute based on a transmission result has been described in the third modification, data can of course be resent by changing a communication path (protocol) based on the transmission result, as in the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In the data transfer systems of the present embodiment and the first through third modifications thereof, the above-described processes are carried out to allow a sending apparatus to acquire state and capabilities of a receiving apparatus and to switch a transmission method. This can reduce errors, and thus, efficient and reliable data transfer becomes possible.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Further, since information of transmission results acquired are accumulated, in a later data transfer to the relevant receiving apparatus, a transmission method highly likely to succeed can be selected from among the accumulated transmission results for use in the data transmission. Thus, the probability of occurrence of an error can be reduced, and efficient and reliable data transfer is ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Still further, the data transfer method employed by the sending apparatus, the data receiving method employed by the receiving apparatus, and the data transfer method employed by the mail server of any of the data transfer systems described above, can be provided as programs. Each program may be provided as a program product that is recorded on any computer readable recording medium such as a flexible disk, CD-ROM, ROM, RAM or memory card attached to a computer, or a hard disk built in the computer. The program may also be provided by downloading through a network. The program product provided is installed in a hard disk, and read out to a RAM for execution. The program product may include the program itself and the recording medium recorded with the program.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims.</p>
