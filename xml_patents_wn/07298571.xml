<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the present invention relate to manufacturing disk drives. More specifically, embodiments of the present invention relate to maintaining an acceptable level of relative humidity inside of a disk drive.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Disk drives are manufactured in clean rooms in order to prevent damage to the disk drives from particles getting inside of the disk drives. Disk drives are also subject to being damaged from electrostatic discharge (ESD), which is the discharge of electrostatic charge between components that have different potentials, during the manufacturing process. In order to minimize the possibility of ESD, the relative humidity inside of a clean room is typically maintained at approximately 55 percent.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, it is desirable that the relative humidity inside of a disk drive after it has been manufactured is approximately 25 percent to 30 percent in order to avoid the failure of disk drive components, such as the magnetic read write heads, due to corrosion of the components. Desiccants are typically placed inside of disk drives in order to maintain a relative humidity of approximately 25 percent to 30 percent inside of the disk drive. However, since the clean room typically has a relative humidity of approximately 55 percent much of the life span of the desiccant is used up while the disk drive is being manufactured. Thus, the life of the disk drive is shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a plan view of a prior art disk drive in order to facilitate the discussion of using desiccants inside of disk drives. The disk drive <b>110</b> includes a base casting <b>113</b>, a motor hub assembly <b>130</b>, a disk <b>112</b>, actuator shaft <b>132</b>, actuator arm <b>134</b>, suspension assembly <b>137</b>, a hub <b>140</b>, voice coil motor <b>150</b>, a magnetic read write head <b>156</b>, a slider <b>155</b>, and desiccant <b>160</b>.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in conjunction with these embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to these embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Furthermore, in the following description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">OVERVIEW</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Various attempts have been made to solve the problem of the life span of a desiccant <b>160</b> ending prematurely. One solution has been to put a larger desiccant <b>160</b> inside of the disk drive <b>110</b>. However, this has a couple of problems. One problem is that the amount of space inside of a disk drive <b>110</b> is limited and a larger desiccant <b>160</b> takes up space. A second problem is the additional expense involved in paying for more desiccants. A second solution has been to change the manufacturing process so that the desiccant <b>160</b> is placed in the disk drive <b>110</b> later in the manufacturing process. However, it was found that changing the manufacturing process was difficult and costly.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Circular track position information (CTPI) is typically written permanently to disks, for example at the manufacturers, to facilitate reading data from and writing data to the disks. The CTPI can include a pattern of radial positioning information. The radial position information is common referred to as “servo bursts” and the pattern of the radial position information is commonly referred to as a “servo pattern.” The CTPI is used during operation of the disk drive <b>110</b> to ensure that the head <b>156</b> of the disk drive <b>110</b> is positioned over the desired track of data <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">To avoid errors while reading or writing data, it is desirable that each track of data <b>136</b> be as close to a perfect circle that is centered on the disk as possible. Since the disk drive <b>110</b> uses the CTPI to determine where to write data to and/or to read data from, the placement of the CTPI on the disk <b>112</b> directly affects the placement of the tracks of data <b>136</b> on the disk <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The CTPI is written to a disk <b>112</b> using what is commonly known as a servo write process. A “pin” is used for moving the actuator <b>134</b> while writing the servo pattern the desired locations on a disk. The cover of a disk drive <b>110</b> has a slot which the pin can be inserted into. The “pin” is commonly known as a “servo write pin” and the slot is commonly known as the “servo write slot.”</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Typically, a desiccant <b>160</b> is removed from a sealed container and placed into a disk drive <b>110</b> prior to performing the servo write process. Typically, the servo write process takes 1 to 1.5 hours. As the servo write process is being performed, the desiccant <b>160</b> is absorbing the humidity in the clean room thus reducing the life span of the desiccant <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to one embodiment, clean dry air is blown over the cover of the disk drive <b>110</b> while the servo write process is being performed. The spinning of the disk during the servo write process causes a portion of the clean dry air to be introduced into the disk drive <b>110</b>. For example, the spinning of a disk <b>112</b> can cause clean dry air to be pulled into the disk drive <b>110</b>. The clean dry air not only prevents the desiccant <b>160</b> from absorbing more humidity from the clean room servo write but also removes moisture from the desiccant <b>160</b>, thus, extending the life span of the desiccant <b>160</b> as well as the disk drive <b>110</b>. According to yet another embodiment, the clean dry air is also cleaner than the air in the clean room, which as will become more evident helps to reduce the probability of damage to the disk drive <b>110</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">A Relative Humidity Maintenance System</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a relative humidity maintenance system <b>200</b> for a disk drive <b>110</b>, according to one embodiment. The relative humidity maintenance system <b>200</b> includes a flow meter <b>202</b> and a clean dry air delivery system <b>204</b>. A disk drive <b>110</b> is positioned up side down over the clean dry air delivery system <b>204</b>. The clean dry air delivery system <b>204</b> delivers clean dry air <b>210</b> over the cover <b>280</b> of the disk drive <b>110</b>. The cover <b>280</b> includes an unsealed servo write slot, according to one embodiment. A servo write pin <b>220</b> that is proximate to the clean dry air delivery system <b>204</b> can be inserted into the unsealed servo write slot for the purpose of performing the servo write process. The flow meter <b>202</b> regulates the amount of clean dry air <b>210</b> that is blown over the cover <b>280</b> while the servo write process is being performed. The spinning of the disk inside of the disk drive <b>110</b> causes a portion of the clean dry air <b>210</b> to be introduced into the disk drive <b>100</b>, for example by exchanging the air in the disk drive <b>110</b> with the clean dry air. For example, the spinning of a disk during the servo write process can cause clean dry air <b>210</b> to be pulled into the disk drive <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The disk drive <b>110</b> is associated with the servo write process by being placed in a servo write cell. The disk drive <b>110</b> is typically almost entirely assembled and has a cover <b>280</b> on before the servo write process begins. Further, the disk drive <b>110</b> is grounded while the disk drive <b>110</b> is in the servo write cell. Therefore, the disk drive <b>110</b> is much less likely to be subjected to unwanted ESD, thus, clean dry air <b>210</b> can be blown on the disk drive <b>110</b> without risking unwanted ESD.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to one embodiment, the relative humidity of the clean dry air <b>210</b> is approximately 0. According to another embodiment, the distance between the dry air delivery system <b>204</b> and the disk drive <b>110</b> is approximately 2 millimeters (mm). According to yet another embodiment, the flow meter <b>202</b> uses a volumetric flow rate of approximately 0.7 liter atmospheres per minute as a part of regulating the amount of clean dry air <b>210</b>. Too low a flow rate could reduce the effectiveness of the relative humidity maintenance system <b>200</b>, however, too high a flow rate could reduce the effectiveness of the servo write process due to vibrations inside of the disk drive <b>110</b>. An acceptable level of relative humidity inside of a disk drive <b>110</b> is approximately 25 percent to 30 percent, according to one embodiment. According to another embodiment, an acceptable level of relative humidity inside of a disk drive <b>110</b> is below 30 percent.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a top down view of a dry air delivery system <b>204</b> that has been dropped into a servo write cell, according to one embodiment. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the clean dry air delivery system <b>204</b> is a purge ring <b>300</b>. Clean dry air <b>210</b> can be introduced into the purge ring <b>300</b> at the end of the handle <b>304</b>. The clean dry air <b>210</b> can come out of the holes <b>302</b> associated with the purge ring <b>300</b>. According to one embodiment, the purge ring <b>300</b> may have approximately 20 holes. According to another embodiment, the purge ring <b>300</b> can be dropped into a servo write cell. When dropped into a servo write cell a part of a servo write system <b>310</b> is positioned inside of the purge ring <b>300</b>. The part of the servo write system <b>310</b> includes a servo write pin <b>220</b> that can be used for positioning the actuator <b>134</b> at the appropriate locations on the disk <b>112</b> in order to write the servo pattern onto the disk <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts another relative humidity maintenance system <b>200</b> that has been added to a legacy servo write system, according to another embodiment. The relative humidity maintenance system <b>400</b> includes a carbon filter <b>409</b>, pilot valve <b>418</b>, a flow meter <b>202</b>, another filter <b>422</b>, a purge manifold <b>424</b>, and a dry air delivery system <b>204</b>. A servo write system typically supports <b>16</b> servo write cells. The servo write process can be performed asynchronously on disk drives associated with the plurality of servo write cells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a part of a legacy servo write system for the first servo write cell. The depicted part of the legacy servo write system, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, includes two regulators <b>404</b> and <b>416</b>, two filters <b>408</b>, a cell manifold <b>412</b>, a clamp solenoid <b>414</b>, and a tray solenoid <b>428</b>. The clean dry air input <b>402</b> comes from a legacy system, such as a dry air solenoid. The carbon filter <b>409</b> can be used to filter vapors such as hydrocarbons. Then the air can go to a cell manifold <b>412</b> for servo write cell <b>1</b> and to servo write cells <b>2</b>-<b>16</b> as indicated by reference number <b>410</b>. The clamp solenoid <b>414</b> can be used to clamp the disk drive <b>110</b> into place.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to the relative humidity maintenance system <b>400</b>, the pilot valve <b>418</b> can be used to turn the clean dry air <b>210</b> on or off. The pilot valve <b>418</b> can be a pipe fitted valve. According to one embodiment, a dry purge solenoid is used to implement the pilot valve <b>418</b>. According to one embodiment, the pilot valve <b>418</b> is on only while a disk drive <b>110</b> is in servo write cell <b>1</b>. Disk drives that are in various stages of assembly are in the clean room are still subject to unwanted ESD. Continuously purging clean dry air <b>210</b> could ultimately reduce the relative humidity inside of the clean room. The pilot valve <b>418</b> can reduce the exposure of the clean room to the clean dry air <b>210</b> used by the relative humidity maintenance system <b>400</b> since the pilot valve <b>418</b> can be used to turn the clean dry air <b>210</b> on and off.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The flow meter <b>202</b> can be used to regulate the amount of clean dry air <b>210</b> blown over a disk drive <b>110</b>'s cover <b>280</b>. The filter <b>422</b> can be used to filter particles out of the clean dry air <b>210</b>. According to one embodiment, the filter <b>422</b> is a 0.003 micron filter for filtering particles that are larger than 0.003 out of the clean dry air <b>210</b>. The purge manifold can be used for adding another gaseous species, such as helium, to the clean dry air <b>210</b> that will ultimately be blown over a disk drive <b>110</b>'s cover <b>280</b> using a clean dry air delivery system <b>204</b>, such as a purge ring. Blowing clean dry air <b>210</b> that includes helium over a disk drive <b>110</b>'s cover <b>280</b> results in fewer vibrations inside of the disk drive <b>110</b> during the servo write process, thus, the servo pattern is less likely to deviate from a perfect circle.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, deviation of a track of data from a perfect circle or off center can cause a track of data to come close to an adjacent track of data resulting in a loss of data during a write process. For example, assume that two tracks of data A and B are adjacent to each other on the disk and data has already been written to track of data A. At a particular point, while writing data to track of data B, the data on track of data A may be overwrite when the data for track B is written at a particular point, referred to as a “squeeze point,” where the two adjacent tracks of data A and B are close together.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As already stated, the relative humidity maintenance system <b>400</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> has been added to a legacy servo write system, according to one embodiment. Further the relative humidity maintenance system <b>400</b> includes various filters <b>409</b>, <b>422</b> for providing air that is cleaner than the air found in a conventional class 100 clean room. Particles and vapors can, among other things, result in lose of data or permanent damage to a disk drive <b>110</b>. For example, particles or vapors that come between the read write head and the surface <b>135</b> of the disk <b>112</b> can cause permanent damage to the disk's surface and/or loss of data. By using cleaner air, the disk drive <b>110</b> is subjected to fewer particles or vapors, thus the reliability of the disk drive <b>110</b> is increased and the life span of the disk drive <b>110</b> can be extended.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">RESULTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Typically the relative humidity inside of a clean room ranges from approximately 42 percent to 55 percent. Tests have shown that after the conventional servo write process approximately 55 percent of a desiccant <b>160</b>'s life span has been exhausted. Tests have also shown that the relative humidity inside of a disk drive <b>110</b> is approximately 25 percent to 30 percent when using a relative humidity maintenance system <b>200</b>, according to various embodiments of the present invention. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts test results of the relative humidity inside of a disk drive over time using a relative humidity maintenance system, according to one embodiment of the present invention. The x axis for graphs <b>500</b>A and <b>500</b>B represents time. The y axis for graphs <b>500</b>A and <b>500</b>B represents the relative humidity inside of the disk drive <b>110</b>. As can be seen at time <b>0</b> the relative humidity is approximately 40 percent. However, the relative humidity quickly drops to approximately 20 percent. Typically the servo write process takes 1 hour to 1.5 hours. According to one embodiment, the servo write slot is usually sealed at approximately 70-80 minutes after the servo write process has been completed. Referring to graph <b>500</b>A the relative humidity starts to stabilize at approximately 73 minutes. Referring to graph <b>500</b>B, the relative humidity stabilizes at approximately 25 percent.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a bar graph indicating the relative humidity inside of a disk drive <b>110</b> before using a relative humidity maintenance system and after the relative humidity maintenance system had been used during the servo write process, according to one embodiment. Before and after results are depicted for two disk drives <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. The relative humidity inside of disk drive <b>1</b> before using the relative humidity maintenance system <b>200</b>, <b>400</b> is approximately 47 percent. After using the relative humidity maintenance system <b>200</b>, <b>400</b> the relative humidity inside of disk drive <b>1</b> is approximately 26 percent. The relative humidity inside of disk drive <b>2</b> before using the relative humidity maintenance system <b>200</b>, <b>400</b> is approximately 50 percent. However, after using the relative humidity maintenance system <b>200</b>, <b>400</b> the relative humidity inside of disk drive <b>2</b> is approximately 26 percent. Not only would a relative humidity maintenance system <b>200</b>, <b>400</b> prevent a desiccant <b>160</b> from absorbing moisture in the first place, but the relative humidity maintenance system <b>200</b>, <b>400</b> can remove moisture that the desiccant <b>160</b> has already absorbed. By reducing the amount of moisture in the desiccant <b>160</b>, various embodiments of the present invention can be used to proactively prevent moisture related failures of disk drive <b>110</b> components, such as disk drive head failures.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As stated before, an acceptable level of relative humidity inside of a disk drive <b>110</b> is approximately 25 percent to 30 percent, according to one embodiment. According to another embodiment, an acceptable level of relative humidity inside of a disk drive <b>110</b> is below 30 percent. As can be seen from the graphs depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, a relative humidity maintenance system <b>200</b>, <b>400</b> is very effective in reducing the relative humidity to an acceptable level inside of a disk drive <b>110</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a flowchart <b>700</b> describing a method of maintaining an acceptable level of relative humidity inside of a disk drive, according to one embodiment of the present invention. Although specific steps are disclosed in flowchart <b>700</b>, such steps are exemplary. That is, embodiments of the present invention are well suited to performing various other steps or variations of the steps recited in flowchart <b>700</b>. It is appreciated that the steps in flowchart <b>700</b> may be performed in an order different than presented, and that not all of the steps in flowchart <b>700</b> may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">All of, or a portion of, the embodiments described by flowchart <b>700</b> can be implemented using computer-readable and computer-executable instructions which reside, for example, in computer-usable media of a computer system or like device. As described above, certain processes and steps of the present invention are realized, in one embodiment, as a series of instructions (e.g., software program) that reside within computer readable memory of a computer system and are executed by the of the computer system. When executed, the instructions cause the computer system to implement the functionality of the present invention as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The hard disk drive assembly process up to the servo write process has been performed in preparation for maintaining an acceptable level of relative humidity inside of a disk drive <b>110</b> as depicted in flowchart <b>700</b>, for example during the servo write process.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At <b>710</b>, the process begins.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At step <b>720</b>, clean dry air is blown over a cover of a disk drive. For example, a relative humidity maintenance system <b>200</b>, <b>400</b> could be used to blow clean dry air <b>210</b> over a cover <b>280</b> of a disk drive <b>110</b>. The cover <b>280</b> includes an unsealed servo write slot into which the clean dry air <b>210</b> can be introduced. The disk drive <b>110</b> could be positioned upside down over a clean dry air delivery system <b>204</b>. Clean dry air <b>210</b> could come out of a clean dry air delivery system <b>204</b>, such as a purge ring <b>300</b>, so that the clean dry air <b>210</b> is blown over the disk drive <b>110</b>'s cover <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At step <b>730</b>, an amount of clean dry air that is blown over the cover is regulated. For example, a flow meter <b>202</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> could be used to regulate the amount of clean dry air <b>210</b> that is blown over the cover <b>280</b>. The clean dry air <b>210</b> is blown over the cover <b>280</b> while performing a servo write process so that a portion of the clean dry air <b>210</b> is introduced into the disk drive <b>110</b>. The flow meter <b>202</b> regulates the amount of clean dry air <b>210</b> that is blown over the cover <b>280</b> while the servo write process is being performed. The spinning of the disk <b>112</b> inside of the disk drive <b>110</b> causes a portion of the clean dry air <b>210</b> to be introduced into the disk drive <b>110</b>. For example, the spinning of a disk <b>112</b> during the servo write process can cause clean dry air <b>210</b> to be pulled into the disk drive <b>110</b> and exchanged with the air inside of the disk drive enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At <b>740</b>, the process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">After the servo write process is completed, an operator selects the cell to unload the disk drive <b>110</b> from, according to one embodiment. In the conventional servo write process, the disk drive <b>110</b> was automatically unloaded from a cell. However, this caused a delay in the amount of time before a manufacturing employee could seal the servo write slot, thus, exposing the desiccant <b>160</b> to the high humidity in the clean room. However, by having the operator select the cell to unload the disk drive <b>110</b>, the servo write slot can be sealed much more quickly. For example, it may take only 5-10 minutes before the servo write slot could be sealed due to an operator selecting a cell for unloading the disk drive <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">After the servo write slot is sealed, a particle count is typically taken through a particle count hole in the cover <b>280</b> of the disk drive <b>110</b>. According to one embodiment, clean dry air <b>210</b> can also be introduced into the disk drive <b>110</b> through the unsealed particle count hole as well as the servo write slot, for example during step <b>730</b>. The disk may be spun and the actuator <b>134</b> moved back in forth in order to loosen any particles inside of the disk drive <b>110</b> as a part of performing a particle count. Then the particle count hole is sealed and a leak test is performed on the disk drive <b>110</b>. As a part of the leak test, air may be pumped into a make up filter in order to determine whether the disk drive <b>110</b> leaks. Then typically the disk drive manufacturing process is complete.</p>
