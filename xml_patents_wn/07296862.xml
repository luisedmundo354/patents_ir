<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A track frame or undercarriage is made to support a rubber track on suitable guide rollers. A tensioning roller is provided as one of the guide rollers on the interior of the track and is mounted on a pivoting bracket. The pivoting bracket moves the tensioning roller to a working position for creating tension in the track. An actuator provides a known force on the pivoting bracket to move the tensioning roller to its working position, using a controlled pressure applied to the actuator. Drive sprockets for the track are mounted onto a drive case that is mounted to the frame through pivoting linkages such that the drive case and the drive sprocket can be held in a working position and retracted away from the track. The position of the tensioning roller is maintained within set limits of retractions during use, by providing a stop to limit the amount that the tensioning roller can retract.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a mounting system for an endless drive track used in a crawler type vehicle, such as a loader, tractor or the like. The mounting system comprises an undercarriage that includes pivotally moveable track rollers that support the track under tension in one position and loosen the track in another position so that the track can be taken off the support rollers and re-installed, and then, when desired, the rollers are pivoted back to a position to maintain a desired tension in the track.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the prior art, the use of track drives for various vehicles including tractors and self propelled loaders has been expanding. Track laying vehicles have been well known for years, and generally do include guide rollers or sprockets that will guide the track in a path of movement as it is driven. Tension in the track is provided by various adjustment devices including springs, threaded adjusters, pressure actuators and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Rubber or elastomeric tracks require tension to prevent the track from derailing from the drive sprockets, guide rollers, and idlers or bogie wheels. Typical track tensioning mechanisms use screws or grease filled cylinders acting against heavy springs to move the front or rear idler rollers longitudinally to provide the track tension. The longitudinal movement is nearly parallel to the fore and aft direction of vehicle movement. A moveable idler is generally mounted in a telescoping support structure, and the springs maintain the tension when the track stretches. The springs also compress a limited amount when objects get between the track and the support wheels or undercarriage, or when there is some other large, sudden load on the track. Due to the large wrap angle of the track that spans over the adjustable front or rear idlers in prior art systems, large tensioning forces are required. The magnitude of prior tension forces approaches twice the desired track tension force. Hydraulic cylinders have been used to tension tracks but the needed high tensioning forces require large cylinder bores or high hydraulic pressure, and when space is restricted, as in the support frames for a track undercarriage, this becomes a problem.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to a track tensioning system that includes moveable components or members that mount track tensioning sprockets or to provide tension in a track with a low wrap angle on the roller to reduce the needed loading force. The tensioning sprockets or rollers can be moved with hydraulic actuators or other actuators between a track tensioning position and a collapsed position. The tensioning sprockets or rollers can be moved sufficiently when in the collapsed position so that the track is slack enough to be taken off the drive sprockets and guide rollers for service, and then replaced. After replacement, the actuators are operated to move the track tensioning sprockets or rollers into position where they will maintain a tension on the track. The moveable roller mountings are supported so the loading forces are reduced while still obtaining adequate track tension.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Two forms of moveable supports for providing a track tension control are illustrated. A chain case or power drive case is utilized for driving sprockets that in turn drive lugs in the track, and the chain case is mounted on a four bar linkage that will permit movement of the gear box and the drive sprockets between a track tensioning and usable position, and a retracted position. The chain case can be locked in place with suitable latches, for use, and then released and retracted for creating slack in the track.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, an idler roller for the interior of the track is mounted on a pivoting bracket that is controlled with a hydraulic actuator that can be maintained under a set uniform pressure during use to insure that the track tension will be maintained even under extraordinary conditions, but also insures that the track will not be overstressed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The tracks used in this invention generally are rubber tracks, as opposed to steel tracks. However, the concept of the invention will work on either type of track.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention uses a roller wheel assembly located between the undercarriage frame and the upper track portion, with tensioning wheels that are mounted on pivoting brackets or linkages and which rotate or pivot to tension the track at locations selected so the wrap angle of the track around the sprocket or roller is reduced. Tensioning forces are thus also reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The idler roller wheel support has one end pivoted on the track frame and a hydraulic cylinder is connected to the pivoting support. A low-pressure charge oil system is used for providing pressure to the cylinder. The charge oil system is used for other purposes on the vehicle and provides a lower limit for track tension forces. When the vehicle, such as a loader is started, the track tension-loading cylinder is extended and tensions the track until charge system pressure is reached. The forward driving forces on the track will cause the track to stretch and further cylinder extension follows the additional track length with a tension load. Further cylinder extension is automatically provided with the use of the hydraulic cylinder loading systems of the present invention. When the track relaxes or the track is driven backwards, track tension forces cause the cylinder to retract, under a maintained uniform pressure. The displaced oil will open a relief valve, so that the relief valve setting provides a pressure that is an upper limit for track tension force.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The relief valve pressure allows an almost stable, maximum track tension than the tension provided by the hydraulic system charge pressure. Objects that are trapped between the track and support rollers also will cause the tension cylinder to retract with the maximum track tension controlled by the relief valve setting.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The hydraulic system has a manual override valve to allow collapsing the cylinders loading the tension rollers collapsing and moving the track support sprockets or rollers for track replacement.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a compact loader shown at <b>7</b> is illustrated only schematically, and is of a conventional design. The loader is powered with an engine <b>8</b>, to provide power to a hydraulic system <b>8</b>A including a pump <b>8</b>B, suitable valves <b>8</b>C, and various hydraulic controls that would be connected along lines <b>8</b>D. The valves <b>8</b>C control motors <b>56</b> that are used for driving the input shafts of suitable drive chain cases or gear drives for driving tracks <b>10</b>, as shown, a rubber track on each side of the frame <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown with the track on one side of the loader in a working or operating position. The track frame or undercarriage <b>12</b> is attached in a suitable manner to the loader body or frame <b>7</b>. The track frame <b>12</b> supports bogie wheels <b>13</b>, that are mounted on the frame <b>12</b> for supporting the lower length of the track <b>10</b>. The track frame <b>12</b> also supports a rotatable, but fixed position, front idler roller <b>14</b>, and a rear idler roller <b>16</b>. The front upper portion of the track <b>10</b> is held in working position with a retractable, tensioning multi-wheel roller <b>18</b>, that, as will be explained, is mounted on a pivoting bracket so the tensioning roller <b>18</b> is collapsible or pivotable to release tension in the track.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A chain case <b>20</b>, (or power drive box) is driven by a hydraulic motor <b>56</b>, and includes an output shaft <b>19</b>A that drives a set of rubber track drive sprockets <b>19</b>. The output shaft <b>19</b>A is driven from internal drives in the chain case <b>20</b> by the motor <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Also, as will be explained, the chain case <b>20</b>, and thus the drive sprockets <b>19</b>, can be retracted from the working position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Pivoting support linkages <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are used to mount the chain case <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The position of track tensioning roller <b>18</b> is controlled in a suitable manner so that the tensioning roller can be retracted or collapsed to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and the chain case <b>20</b> also can be retracted to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for providing slack in the track <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The track <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is shown in its original drive position, but with the roller <b>18</b>, and the chain case <b>20</b> retracted from their working positions. The bracket <b>24</b>, which supports the tensioning roller <b>18</b> is mounted on a pivot pin <b>21</b> to a support bracket <b>30</b> that is fixed relative to the track frame <b>12</b>. It can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> that the bracket <b>24</b> has a pair of side plates <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B that provide stability, and the pivot pin <b>21</b> extends across the bracket <b>30</b> and supports both the side plates <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> it can be seen that the roller <b>18</b> comprises three side by side and spaced apart wheels <b>18</b>B mounted on a common shaft <b>18</b>A that is mounted for rotation on the bracket <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The pivotal position of the bracket <b>24</b> about the pivot pin <b>21</b>, and thus the position of the tension roller <b>18</b>, is controlled by a hydraulic cylinder <b>22</b>. The base end of hydraulic cylinder <b>22</b> is mounted with a pin onto a suitable bracket <b>44</b>A. The cylinder <b>22</b> has an extendable and retractable rod, the end of which is mounted with a pin <b>22</b>B to the bracket <b>24</b>. This can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">There are track frames <b>12</b> and tracks <b>10</b> on both sides of the vehicle <b>7</b>, so that there will be two of the cylinders <b>22</b> used on a vehicle. Only one side is shown, in that the track frame on the other side is a mirror image of the one shown.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the cylinder or actuator <b>22</b> is extended under hydraulic pressure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, as well as other detailed figures, the bracket <b>24</b> is pivoted to a position wherein the roller <b>18</b> engages the inner surface of the track along smooth surfaces, to tension the track <b>10</b>. It can be seen that the tension force is from movement of the roller <b>18</b> in an arcuate path about the pivot pin <b>21</b>. The amount of wrap of the track <b>10</b> around the tension creating roller <b>18</b> is kept low, that is less than 90°. The force provided by the cylinder <b>22</b> does not have to be as great as that force needed when tension is provided by a horizontally acting spring, grease cylinder or a hydraulic actuator of conventional track tensioning devices that have almost 180° of wrap on the tensioning roller.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The cylinder <b>22</b> can be retracted, utilizing suitable valves from the hydraulic system along lines <b>8</b>D. Preferably the cylinder <b>22</b> will be controlled with a hydraulic circuit arrangement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In the retracted position of the cylinder rod, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, tension creating roller <b>18</b> is moved away from the track path so that the track <b>10</b> is very slack and can be easily removed and replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the track <b>10</b> is to be again in place and is to be tensioned, the actuator or cylinder <b>22</b> is extended, to return the pivoting bracket <b>24</b> to a typical working position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The rod of cylinder <b>22</b> has adequate movement to move the tension roller <b>18</b> between the positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, which are perspective views of the track.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Thus, by selecting the position of the tension roller <b>18</b>, the track tension can be controlled and maintained, as well as being releasable for track replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A stop limit on the amount of track slack permitted during use is provided. The stop insures that tension roller <b>18</b> will not retract excessively if an object gets in between a track roller and the track, or if sudden high loads occur for some other reason.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> &amp; <b>8</b>, the pivoting of the bracket <b>24</b> can be limited by use of a stop pin <b>32</b>. The stop pin <b>32</b> is mounted on and moves with the bracket <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The pin <b>32</b> spans across the support bracket <b>30</b> for the bracket <b>24</b>. Bracket <b>30</b> is shown in perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, and it can be seen that the pin <b>32</b> will engage an edge on the bracket <b>30</b> at the point <b>32</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref> to provide the stopped position. When the track is to be removed, stop pin <b>32</b> is removed and the bracket <b>24</b> can be pivoted to its fully retracted position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The pin <b>32</b> is left in place on bracket <b>24</b> during use so that the track will not become excessively slack during use.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic drawing of a hydraulic circuit <b>37</b>. The pump <b>8</b>B provides flow to a hydraulic charge flow system <b>35</b>, which typically provides about a 400 psi supply flow to the hydraulic circuit <b>37</b> that provides pressure to the base ends of actuators <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the two actuators <b>22</b>, one for each of the track frames <b>12</b> on the opposite sides of the loader. The cylinders <b>22</b> are connected in parallel so that pistons <b>22</b>A of both cylinders will be subjected to the same pressure for either extending or retracting the cylinder rods <b>22</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The pressure input line <b>35</b>A is provided to the base of the cylinders or actuators <b>22</b>, to act on the pistons <b>22</b>A and extend the rods <b>22</b>B under pressure from the 400-psi source. A return line <b>35</b>B is connected from the rod ends back to a hydraulic reservoir <b>35</b>D. A 600 psi relief valve <b>36</b> is connected across the lines <b>35</b>A and <b>35</b>B, as shown. A manual cylinder retract valve <b>38</b> is also connected across these lines.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The relief valve <b>36</b> is set so that the cylinders <b>22</b> will be provided with a maximum limiting pressure to limit the force that can be reacted by the rods of cylinders <b>22</b>, and thus limit the track tension. If the track tension exceeds a certain set level because of loads on the tension roller <b>18</b>, the pressure on the base end of the cylinders raises and the relief valve <b>36</b> opens. The track tension is at a maximum at this set pressure level. If the pressure on the base ends of the cylinders drops, the relief valve will close.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The manual valve <b>38</b> permits manually retracting the cylinders <b>22</b>. The valve <b>38</b> can be moved to bleed the pressure from the line <b>35</b>A to the reservoir <b>35</b>D so the cylinders retract.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition to the movable tension roller <b>18</b>, as previously mentioned, the chain case or power drive case <b>20</b> can be retracted away from the inner surface of the track <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The chain case or power drive case <b>20</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref> with the track removed. The track drive sprocket <b>19</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>, and the mounting links <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are separately illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Mounting links <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are pivotally mounted at first ends to the track frame <b>12</b>, using suitable pivot pins <b>40</b>A and <b>44</b>B, respectively, that are attached to suitable brackets <b>44</b>A and <b>42</b>A supported on the track frame <b>12</b>. The bracket <b>42</b>A can be used for mounting cylinder <b>22</b> as well. The second end of link <b>40</b> is pivotally mounted to the chain case <b>20</b> with pivot pins <b>46</b> on opposite sides of the chain case. The second end of mounting link <b>42</b> is pivotally mounted to the chain case <b>20</b> with pivot pins <b>48</b> on opposite sides of the chain case. The mounting links <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> each have two arms, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>. The mounting link <b>42</b> has suitable hubs <b>49</b> that pivot on the pins <b>48</b> on the chain case <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The links <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> pivot to guide and support the chain case. The chain case <b>20</b> is moved manually when it is desired to collapse or move the drive sprockets <b>19</b> away from their working position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It can be seen that there are sprockets <b>19</b> on each side of the chain case <b>20</b>. The sprockets <b>19</b> are driven by the hydraulic motor <b>56</b>, that connects into the hydraulic system <b>8</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An internal chain in the chain case <b>20</b> drives internal sprockets to rotate the output shaft <b>19</b>A and drive the sprockets <b>19</b>. The drive lugs <b>58</b> on the sprockets engage lugs <b>57</b> that are formed on the interior of the track <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The link <b>42</b> has a cross member <b>51</b>, that holds a mounting bracket <b>52</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, specifically, and also in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>. Bracket <b>52</b> is fixed to move with the link <b>42</b>, and has a slot <b>53</b> in the center, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. A bolt <b>54</b> is threaded into or otherwise fixed to the track frame <b>12</b>, and it aligns with the slot <b>53</b>. When the chain case <b>20</b> is in the working or track drive position, the bolt <b>54</b> extends through the slot <b>53</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>12</b>, as well as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The chain case <b>20</b> and the sprockets <b>19</b> are held in working position with the bracket <b>52</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>. The center portion of the bracket <b>52</b> is clamped against the top of the track frame <b>12</b>, and held with a suitable nut and washer on the bolt <b>54</b>, or in some other manner retained in its position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the chain case <b>20</b> is to be retracted, the nut on the bolt <b>54</b> is removed, and the chain case <b>20</b> can be moved to its position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as guided by the links <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A stop bracket <b>60</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) is provided on the frame <b>12</b>, and aligns to support the chain case or power drive case <b>20</b> in its working position, when the nut on the bolt <b>54</b> is tightened down. The nut on bolt <b>54</b> can be tightened securely so that it will not shake loose. In the working position of the chain case the sprockets <b>19</b> and the lugs <b>58</b> are held against the track to support the track and provide a track drive.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It can be seen that the links <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> support opposite sides of the chain case, on suitable pivot pins, to provide stability for the chain case <b>20</b> and adequate support and tension in the track.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The movement of tension roller <b>18</b> in an arc provides a force that is vectored at an angle relative to the fore and aft axis of the vehicle. The stop pin <b>32</b> limits the movement of the tensioning rollers <b>18</b> to insure that the track will not be forced to become slack enough to come off the track rollers during use, if something should get between the track rollers and the track. When the stop pin <b>32</b> is removed, the tension roller <b>18</b> can be retracted so that the track <b>10</b> is slack (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), and the chain case <b>20</b> or other support for the drive sprockets <b>19</b> also can be retracted for increasing the amount of track slack available. The actuators or cylinders <b>22</b> are arranged with a hydraulic system to maintain a desired tension in the track because of a controlled pressure source. A maximum pressure is set by a relief valve that will ensure that the rubber track <b>10</b> will not be excessively tensioned.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
