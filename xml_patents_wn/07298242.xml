<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an input device which can input operation signals to host equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Electronic Data Interchanges (commercial dealings) carried out through a network such as the Internet, etc. are carried out by information processing apparatus such as personal computers, mobile telephones or PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), etc. In Electronic Data Interchanges, in order to realize the safety of dealings, there are instances in which a fingerprint, which is one form of bio-identification information, is collated with fingerprints registered in advance to thereby carry out certification with respect to the opponents in the dealings. This fingerprint collation is carried out by ordinarily connecting a fingerprint collating device to an information processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Moreover, a mouse for specifying an operating position on a computer screen, a keyboard for inputting characters and/or symbols, etc., and a drive unit for loading an external memory device, such as a memory card, etc., are connected to the information processing apparatus as peripheral equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, since there ordinarily are only several connecting portions for connecting peripheral equipment provided in the information processing apparatus, there are instances where a fingerprint collating unit cannot be newly connected. Further, in order to connect a fingerprint collating device, it is difficult to carry out connection/exchange with respect to peripheral equipment already connected to the information processing apparatus. In addition, the peripheral equipment which has been detached from the information processing apparatus could not be used for that time.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, in general, fingerprint detection methods for realizing the fingerprint collation function include an optical detection method of picking up the image of a fingertip using an image pick-up device, and an electrostatic capacity detection method of forming a capacitor to detect differences in capacitance depending on the fingerprint. Further, in order to connect to the information processing apparatus as a peripheral device, the electrostatic capacity type is advantageous for the purpose of suppressing enlargement of the equipment. In the fingerprint detection method of the electrostatic capacity type, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a barrier metal <b>102</b> consisting of Ti, etc. is formed on a substrate <b>101</b> where there are formed elements such as transistors, etc. which constitute a fingerprint sensor <b>100</b>. At the upper surface of the barrier metal <b>102</b>, metallic wiring (Al wiring) <b>103</b> is formed. A passivation film <b>105</b> consisting of silicon nitride film or silicon oxide film is formed at the uppermost layer of the substrate <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At the fingerprint sensor <b>100</b>, as the result of a finger touching the passivation film <b>105</b>, a capacitor is formed between the Al wiring <b>103</b> and the finger. The distance d between each Al wire <b>103</b> and the finger changes in accordance with the uneven state of the finger resulting from the fingerprint. Accordingly, at respective capacitors constituting the fingerprint sensor <b>100</b>, differences in capacitance occur in accordance with individual fingerprints. By detecting such differences, fingerprint recognition can be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, when the finger of the user is charged with static electricity, the fingerprint sensor <b>100</b> cannot precisely detect differences in the capacitance of the respective capacitors produced by the presence or absence of the fingerprint, thus failing to precisely detect the fingerprint.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, when dust, etc. is deposited on the passivation film <b>105</b> of the fingerprint sensor <b>100</b>, it is impossible to precisely detect the differences in capacitance of the respective capacitors, thus failing to precisely detect the fingerprint.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also, in fingerprint detection by the optical detection method, when dust, etc. is deposited on the image pick-up unit, such as a CCD or line sensor, etc., it is impossible to precisely pick up the image of an upheaval (rising) line of a fingerprint, thus failing to precisely detect the fingerprint.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the above, an object of the present invention is to provide an input device adapted so that an IC card having a fingerprint detection/collation function can be loaded therein to thereby have the ability to easily add a fingerprint detection/collation function to an information processing apparatus having a limited number of connecting portions for peripheral equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, an object of the present invention is to enable an IC card having a fingerprint detection/collation function to be loaded in a mouse or keyboard, etc. that a user of an information processing apparatus frequently uses with his hand, thereby making it possible to easily carry out fingerprint detection/collation work.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, an object of the present invention is to provide an input device having a fingerprint detection/collation function which removes an electric charge on the fingertip of the user at the time of fingerprint detection to thereby have the ability to precisely detect fingerprints.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, an object of the present invention is to provide an input device having a fingerprint detection/collation function which prevents dust, etc. from depositing thereon during times of non-use to thereby permit a sensor unit which detects fingerprints to be kept clean.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to attain the above-described objects, an input device according to the present invention includes a device body having an operating unit operatively connected to a host device for carrying out operations of the host device; an opening portion in the device body; and a fingerprint detecting portion assembled in the device body so as to be exposed externally of the device body through the opening portion, the fingerprint detecting portion serving to detect a fingerprint of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the input device according to the present invention constituted as described above, even in the case the host device has a limited number of connecting portions, an IC card having a fingerprint detection/collation function may be loaded with respect to a loading portion of the input device, thereby making it possible to easily add a fingerprint detection/collation function to the host device. Further, since this input device is a device that a user handles frequently during use of the host device, it is easy to press a fingertip onto the fingerprint detecting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, the input device according to the present invention includes an opening portion arranged so that the fingerprint detecting portion is exposed externally of the device body, and a shutter member assembled to the device body and movable between a first position in which the opening portion is open, exposing the fingerprint detecting portion for use, and a second position in which the opening portion is closed so that fingerprint detection is not carried out. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent dust, etc. from being admitted and depositing on the fingerprint detecting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, in accordance with the input device of the present invention, the shutter member may be metallic, thereby making it possible to remove static electricity charged on the finger of the user before the detection of fingerprints. Accordingly, the fingerprint detecting portion can precisely detect the fingerprint of the user.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the mouse <b>5</b> is used in an information processing apparatus <b>1</b>, such as a personal computer, mobile telephone and/or PDA, etc. The information processing apparatus comprises an apparatus body <b>2</b> which includes a hard disk, a CPU (Central Processing Unit), and a RAM (Random Access Memory), etc.; a keyboard <b>3</b> for inputting characters and/or symbols, etc.; a display unit <b>4</b> comprised of a CRT (Cathode-Ray Tube), a Liquid Crystal panel, etc. on which data, etc. processed by a computer are displayed; and the mouse <b>5</b> serving as a position input device (unit) for specifying an operating position on the screen of the display unit <b>4</b>. The apparatus body <b>2</b> and the keyboard <b>3</b> are connected through a connection cable <b>6</b>, the apparatus body <b>2</b> and the display unit <b>4</b> are connected through a connection cable <b>7</b>, and the apparatus body <b>2</b> and the mouse <b>5</b> are connected through a connection cable <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the mouse <b>5</b> is formed from a resin material having rigidity, such as ABS resin, etc., and includes a casing <b>11</b> formed so that the upper portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the casing is curved so as to be easily grasped by the palm of the hand. At the front side of the casing <b>11</b> where fingertips are positioned when the mouse is grasped by the palm of the hand, there are provided a first operating portion <b>12</b> caused to undergo a pressing operation by a forefinger, etc., and a second operating portion <b>13</b> caused to undergo a pressing operation by a middle finger, etc. When the first operating portion <b>12</b> and the second operating portion <b>13</b> are pressed by the user, they respectively press a first switch element and a second switch element mounted on a printed circuit board disposed within the casing <b>11</b>. Moreover, the connection cable <b>8</b> for carrying out the connection to the apparatus body <b>2</b> protrudes from a front end <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the casing where the first operating portion <b>12</b> and the second operating portion <b>13</b> are provided. This connection cable <b>8</b> is connected to the printed circuit board within the casing <b>11</b>. Moreover, in order to carry out transmission of data to and reception of data from the apparatus body <b>2</b> of the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> by a serial interface, signal lines for a serial protocol bus state signal BS, a serial protocol data signal SDIO, and a serial clock signal SCLK, etc., and a power supply voltage VCC line and ground line, etc. are disposed in the connection cable <b>8</b>. The ground line is connected to a shutter member <b>20</b> which will be described later. As a result of the fact that a finger comes into contact with the shutter member <b>20</b>, static electricity charged on the finger of the user is removed from the fingertip, thus making it possible to precisely detect the fingerprint of the finger. By the connection cable <b>8</b>, the mouse <b>5</b> and the apparatus body <b>2</b> are connected by an interface specification, e.g., USB (Universal Serial Bus), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A detecting portion <b>14</b> for detecting the movement direction and movement quantity of a pointer indicating the operating position displayed on the screen of the display unit <b>4</b> is provided at substantially the central portion of the bottom surface of the casing <b>11</b>. The detecting portion <b>14</b> is composed of a spherical body rotating in accordance with the operating direction imparted by a user, a first detection element for detecting a first rotation direction of the spherical body and the amount of rotation in the first rotation direction, and a second detection element for detecting a second rotation direction perpendicular to the first rotation direction and the amount of rotation in the second rotation direction. Further, when the first and second detection elements detect rotation of the spherical body, the detecting portion <b>14</b> moves the pointer displayed on the display unit <b>4</b> in the X-axis direction and in the Y-axis direction on the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, the upper portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the casing <b>11</b> is provided with a loading portion <b>15</b> for loading the IC card for carrying out fingerprint collation. The loading portion <b>15</b> is continuous with an insertion hole <b>16</b> for the IC card provided in the upper portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the casing <b>11</b>. The loading portion <b>15</b> is formed so as to be substantially the same size as the IC card. A bottom surface <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the loading portion <b>15</b> functions as a guide portion for carrying out insertion/withdrawal of the IC card. Further, a connector <b>18</b>, serving as a connecting portion for realizing an electrical connection to the IC card, is provided at the innermost end of the loading portion <b>15</b>. Further, a guide recessed portion <b>19</b> for guiding the insertion/withdrawal of the IC card and for limiting the loading position thereof is formed at the side surfaces of the loading portion <b>15</b>, parallel to the insertion direction of the IC card.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The upper portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the casing <b>11</b> is also provided with a substantially rectangular opening portion <b>17</b> for allowing the fingerprint detecting portion of the IC card loaded with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b> to be exposed to the exterior. A side surface <b>17</b><i>a </i>of the opening portion <b>17</b> includes a curve protruding toward the exterior, and is adapted so that a fingertip is easily inserted in carrying out fingerprint collation and the user does not become tired in view of human-engineering. It is to be noted that the opening portion <b>17</b> is provided so that the connector <b>18</b> does not face the exterior, so the outward appearance of the mouse <b>5</b> is not negatively affected.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A shutter member <b>20</b> is disposed in the opening portion <b>17</b> so that it can open or close the opening portion. The shutter member <b>20</b> ordinarily closes the opening portion <b>17</b> to thereby prevent dust, etc. from infiltrating into the loading portion <b>15</b> and depositing on the connector <b>18</b> or the fingerprint detecting portion of the IC card. The shutter member <b>20</b> is formed from a conductive material such as a metallic plate, etc. grounded to the earth. The finger of a user comes into contact with the shutter member <b>20</b> before fingerprint detection is carried out to thereby enable the removal of static electricity charged on the finger. Thus, it is possible to precisely detect the fingerprint.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The shutter member <b>20</b> is formed with a substantially rectangular shape having substantially the same dimensions as the opening portion <b>17</b> which faces the fingerprint detecting portion of the IC card. As the opening portion <b>17</b> is opened, the fingerprint detecting portion is exposed to the exterior. A projecting portion <b>21</b> for opening/closing the shutter member <b>20</b> is formed at the end of the shutter member closest to the front end <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the casing <b>11</b>. Accordingly, the user moves the projecting portion <b>21</b> toward the rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the casing <b>11</b> using a finger, thereby making it possible to open the opening portion <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The engagement of a longitudinal side edge of the shutter member <b>20</b> with a guide portion <b>22</b> formed in the opening portion <b>17</b> in the movement direction of the shutter member <b>20</b> guides the opening/closing of the opening portion. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, one end of a biasing member <b>24</b>, such as a torsion coil spring or a compression coil spring, etc., is provided at the end of the loading portion <b>15</b> closest to the rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>and serves to bias the shutter member <b>20</b> in a direction to close the opening portion <b>17</b>. Thus, the shutter member <b>20</b> is always biased in the closed direction indicated by arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A holding piece <b>25</b> is formed on one longitudinal side edge of the shutter member <b>20</b>. A holding member <b>26</b>, to be descried later, holds the holding piece <b>25</b> in a position in which the shutter member opens the opening portion <b>17</b>. A substantially L-shaped holding surface <b>28</b> is formed in the holding piece <b>25</b> in a direction facing the front end <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the casing <b>11</b>, and an inclined surface <b>29</b> having a tapered shape is formed in the holding piece <b>25</b> in a direction facing the rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the casing <b>11</b>. When the shutter member <b>20</b> is moved in the direction opposite the direction indicated by arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to open the opening portion <b>17</b>, the inclined surface <b>29</b> comes into contact with a projecting portion <b>27</b> on holding member <b>26</b> to pivot the holding member <b>26</b> in an upward direction. Continued movement of the shutter member <b>20</b> in the direction opposite the direction indicated by arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> causes the projecting portion <b>27</b> of the holding member <b>26</b> to engage the holding surface <b>28</b> of the holding piece <b>25</b>. Accordingly, the shutter member <b>20</b>, biased in the direction indicated by arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by the biasing member <b>24</b>, is held closer to the rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the casing <b>11</b> in the state in which the opening portion <b>17</b> has been opened.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The holding member <b>26</b> which holds the holding piece <b>25</b> closer to the rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the casing <b>11</b> comprises a projecting portion <b>27</b> which engages the holding surface <b>28</b> of the holding piece <b>25</b>, a rotational arm <b>31</b> provided with the projecting portion <b>27</b> at the front end thereof, an extension coil spring <b>32</b> for biasing the rotational arm <b>31</b> in the direction indicated by arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to hold the holding piece <b>25</b>, and a holding release button <b>33</b> adapted to press the rotational arm <b>31</b> to thereby move the projecting portion <b>27</b> in an upward direction and thereby release it from the holding state.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The projecting portion <b>27</b> projects from the lower surface of end portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the rotational arm <b>31</b>. When the shutter member <b>20</b> is moved in the direction opposite to the direction indicated by arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to open the opening portion <b>17</b>, the projecting portion <b>27</b> comes into contact with the holding piece <b>25</b> formed on the side edge of the shutter member <b>20</b>, and is caused to ride onto the upper surface of the holding piece <b>25</b> by the inclined surface <b>29</b> formed with a substantially tapered shape. Further, as the result of the fact that the shutter member <b>20</b> is moved, the projecting portion <b>27</b> engages the holding surface <b>28</b> to hold the shutter member <b>20</b> closer to the rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the casing <b>11</b> in the state in which the opening portion <b>17</b> is open.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The rotational arm <b>31</b> is formed by bending a plate-shaped body, and is adapted so that the projecting portion <b>27</b> is formed at one end portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>bent upwardly and the holding release button <b>33</b> which releases the holding state of the projecting portion <b>27</b> is disposed at the other end portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>bent downwardly. A supporting member (not shown) is inserted through a supporting portion <b>35</b> provided substantially at the center of the rotational arm <b>31</b>, and the rotational arm <b>31</b> is rotatably supported by the supporting member. The extension coil spring <b>32</b> which biases the rotational arm <b>31</b> in the direction indicated by arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is held at the projecting portion <b>27</b> side by the supporting portion <b>35</b>. Accordingly, the end portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the rotational arm <b>31</b> is always biased in the direction indicated by arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by the extension coil spring <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The holding release button <b>33</b> disposed at the other end portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the rotational arm <b>31</b> projects externally from the casing <b>11</b>, and is adapted so that the user can operate it from outside the casing. When the holding release button <b>33</b> is pressed from the outside, it rotates the rotational arm <b>31</b> in the direction opposite to that indicated by arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with the supporting portion <b>35</b> being a pivot point. Namely, as a result of the end portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>being pressed by the holding release button <b>33</b>, the rotational arm <b>31</b> is rotated in the direction opposite to that indicated by the arrow B against the biasing force of the extension coil spring <b>32</b>. Thus, the projecting portion <b>27</b> projecting from the end <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the rotational arm <b>31</b> is moved in the direction opposite to that indicated by arrow B to release the holding state of the holding piece <b>25</b> and thereby move the shutter member <b>20</b> in the direction indicated by arrow A.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The shutter member <b>20</b> and the holding member <b>26</b> as described above operate as follows. First, the shutter member <b>20</b> is biased by the biasing member <b>24</b> in the normal state so that it is at the position where the opening portion <b>17</b> is closed. At this time, the holding member <b>26</b> is positioned at the side of holding piece <b>25</b> closest to the rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the casing <b>11</b> so that the end portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the rotational arm <b>31</b> from which the projecting portion <b>27</b> projects is biased by the extension coil spring <b>32</b> in the direction indicated by arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Then, in order to open the opening portion <b>17</b> to expose the fingerprint detecting portion of the IC card, the shutter member <b>20</b> is moved toward the rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the casing <b>11</b>. When the shutter member <b>20</b> is moved toward the rear end <b>11</b><i>c</i>, the projecting portion <b>27</b> comes into contact with the substantially taper-shaped inclined surface <b>29</b> formed at the side of the holding piece <b>25</b> facing the rear end <b>11</b><i>c</i>, and is caused to ride onto the upper surface of the holding piece <b>25</b>. Further, when the shutter member <b>20</b> is moved toward the rear end <b>11</b><i>c</i>, the projecting portion <b>27</b> engages the holding surface <b>28</b> of the holding piece <b>25</b> as the result of the fact that the end portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the rotational arm <b>31</b> is biased by the extension coil spring <b>32</b>. Thus, the shutter member <b>20</b> is held closer to the rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the casing <b>11</b> as the result of the fact that the holding piece <b>25</b> is held by the projecting portion <b>27</b> against the biasing force of the biasing member <b>24</b>. Accordingly, the opening portion <b>17</b> is opened so that the fingerprint detecting portion of the IC card loaded in the loading portion <b>15</b> is exposed. As a result, the user can easily carry out collation of his or her fingerprint.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Then, when fingerprint collation has been completed, the shutter member <b>20</b> is moved in the direction indicated by arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to close the opening portion <b>17</b> in order to protect the fingerprint detecting portion and the connector <b>18</b> from dust, etc. At this time, when the holding release button <b>33</b> protruding from the side surface of the casing <b>11</b> is pressed inwardly by the user, it presses the end portion <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the rotational arm <b>31</b>. As a result, the end portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>is rotated in the direction opposite to that indicated by arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and against the biasing force of the extension coil spring <b>32</b>, with the supporting portion <b>35</b> being a pivot point. Accordingly, the projecting portion <b>27</b> projecting from the end portion <b>31</b><i>a </i>is also moved in the direction opposite to the direction indicated by arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, thereby releasing the holding surface <b>28</b> of the holding piece <b>25</b> from the holding state. Thus, the shutter member <b>20</b> is moved in the direction indicated by arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by the biasing force of the biasing member <b>24</b> to close the opening portion <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, the IC card <b>40</b> loaded with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b> will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The IC card <b>40</b> includes a substantially rectangular plate-shaped card body <b>41</b> which constitutes a casing formed by molding a synthetic resin. Included within the card body <b>41</b> is a printed circuit board on which is mounted one or more semiconductor elements constituting a fingerprint sensor and control circuits therefor.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Terminal portions <b>42</b> comprised of plural electrodes are formed on one short side of the card body <b>41</b> so as to extend from the front end serving as the insertion end of the IC card <b>40</b> with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b> toward the bottom surface thereof. The transmission of data to and reception of data from the loading portion <b>15</b> is carried out by a serial interface. In a practical sense, the terminal portion <b>42</b> at least includes an input terminal for a serial protocol bus state signal, an input terminal for a serial protocol data signal, an input terminal for a serial clock and a power supply terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Moreover, at one corner of the front end of the card body <b>41</b> where the terminal portions <b>42</b> are formed, a chamfered portion <b>43</b> is provided in order that the user can easily determine the insertion direction with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b>. In addition, the upper surface of the card body <b>41</b> at the read end thereof is provided with a fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> adapted to detect the fingerprint of the user as the fingertip of the user is pressed against it.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A method of inserting the IC card <b>40</b> as described above with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b> will now be explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the IC card <b>40</b> is inserted into the insertion hole <b>16</b> of the casing <b>11</b> so that the upper surface of the card body <b>41</b> faces upwardly and the front end of the card body <b>41</b> at which the terminal portions <b>42</b> are provided is the insertion end. At this time, the IC card <b>40</b> is inserted into the loading portion <b>15</b> while being guided by the guide recessed portion <b>19</b> and the bottom surface <b>15</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the terminal portions <b>42</b> of the IC card are electrically connected to the connector <b>18</b> of the loading portion <b>15</b>. The IC card <b>40</b> can be removed from the loading portion <b>15</b> by sliding the IC card <b>40</b> in the direction of the insertion hole <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It is to be noted that, in addition to the IC card <b>40</b> for fingerprint collation, an IC card having a memory element used as an external memory unit of the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> may be loaded with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The circuit configuration of the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> to which mouse <b>5</b> as described above is connected will now be explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> is an apparatus having substantially the same configuration as an ordinary personal computer, and comprises a hard disk <b>61</b> serving as a memory unit in which various application programs and/or processing data, etc. are preserved (stored), a Random Access Memory (hereinafter simply refereed to as a RAM) <b>62</b> in which programs, etc. preserved on the hard disk <b>61</b> are loaded, an interface <b>63</b> such as a USB, etc. to which keyboard <b>3</b> and/or mouse <b>5</b> are connected, a display unit <b>64</b> for displaying data, etc. to be processed, and a Central Processing Unit (hereinafter refereed to as a CPU) for controlling the entire operation of the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> on the basis of the programs, etc. loaded in the RAM <b>62</b>. On the basis of input from the keyboard and/or the mouse <b>5</b>, the CPU reads a predetermined application from the hard disk <b>61</b> into the RAM <b>62</b> to display it on the display unit <b>64</b> and to carry out data processing. The CPU <b>65</b> is adapted so that when a user attempts to access a specific computer, or attempts to access a specific file preserved on the hard disk <b>61</b>, it displays its effect on the display unit <b>64</b> in order to carry out a request for certification by fingerprint collation. Only when the CPU <b>65</b> receives a certification signal from the IC card <b>40</b> indicating that certification has been obtained by fingerprint collation does it permit access to a specific computer or access to a specific file preserved on the hard disk <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The mouse <b>5</b> connected to the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> through the interface <b>63</b> comprises, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a first switch element <b>71</b> pressed by the first operating portion <b>12</b> provided in the casing <b>11</b>, a second switch element <b>72</b> pressed by the second operating portion <b>13</b> provided in the casing <b>11</b>, the detecting portion <b>14</b> for detecting the rotation direction and rotation quantity of the spherical body, a serial/parallel parallel/serial interface <b>73</b> for carrying out transmission of data to and reception of data from the IC card <b>40</b> loaded with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b>, a control unit <b>74</b> for generating an operating signal output to the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> on the basis of signals input from the first switch element <b>71</b>, the second switch element <b>72</b> and the detecting unit <b>14</b>, and a hub <b>75</b> for selectively outputting a signal from the interface <b>73</b> and a signal from the control unit <b>74</b> to the information processing apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When an input is provided from the first switch <b>71</b>, the control unit <b>74</b> generates a first operating signal to output it to the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> through the hub <b>75</b>. When an input from the second switch element <b>72</b> is provided, the control unit <b>74</b> generates a second operating signal to output it to the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> through the hub <b>75</b>. Moreover, when a rotation direction and rotation quantity of the spherical body are input from the detecting portion <b>14</b>, the control unit <b>74</b> generates a third operating signal corresponding thereto to output it to the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> through the hub <b>75</b>. The information processing apparatus <b>1</b> is supplied with the first to third operating signals from the mouse <b>5</b> through the interface <b>63</b>. Thus, the CPU <b>65</b> carries out data processing corresponding to the first operating signal or the second operating signal, and moves a pointer displayed on the screen of the display unit <b>64</b> in accordance with the third operating signal.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, when the IC card <b>40</b> is loaded with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b> and a certification signal or non-certification signal is input from the IC card <b>40</b> through the interface <b>73</b>, the hub <b>75</b> outputs these signals to the interface <b>63</b> of the information processing apparatus <b>1</b>. At the information processing apparatus <b>1</b>, when a certification signal is input through the interface <b>63</b>, the CPU <b>65</b> permits access to a specific computer or access to a specific file preserved on the hard disk <b>61</b>, etc. When a non-certification signal is input, the CPU <b>65</b> prevents access to a specific computer or access to a specific file preserved on the hard disk <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The circuit configuration of the IC card <b>40</b> loaded with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b> of the mouse <b>5</b> will now be explained. The IC card <b>40</b> comprises, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> onto which the fingertip of the user is pressed, a first memory <b>52</b> for storing registered fingerprints, a collation unit <b>53</b> for collating fingerprints input from the fingerprint detecting unit <b>51</b> and fingerprints preserved in the first memory <b>52</b>, a second memory <b>54</b> for storing the serial number of the IC card <b>40</b> and information relating to the fingerprints registered in the first memory <b>52</b>, a serial/parallel parallel/serial interface <b>55</b> for carrying out transmission of certification signals to and reception of certification signals from the mouse <b>5</b>, and a control unit <b>56</b> for controlling the entire operation of the IC card <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> includes a fingerprint sensor in which a barrier metal consisting of Ti, etc. and/or metallic wiring such as Al, etc. are formed on a substrate in which elements such as transistors, etc. are formed. A passivation film consisting of an insulating material is formed at the uppermost layer of the substrate. As a result of a finger of the user pressing against the passivation layer, a capacitor is formed in the fingerprint sensor between the finger and the metallic wiring. Since the distance between each metallic wiring and the finger changes in accordance with the uneven state of the fingerprint, differences occur in the capacity of the respective capacitors constituting the fingerprint sensor. The fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> detects these differences to thereby extract feature points of the fingerprint, e.g., branch or center of skin upheaval lines. Further, when the fingerprint registration is carried out, the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> outputs to the first memory <b>52</b> fingerprint data consisting of feature points of the fingerprint. The fingerprint data consisting of feature points of the fingerprint to be registered is preserved in the first memory <b>52</b> for every identification number. When fingerprint collation is carried out, the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> outputs the fingerprint data to the collation unit <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When fingerprint collation is carried out, the collation unit <b>53</b> collates the fingerprint data input from the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> and the fingerprint data stored in the first memory <b>52</b> to carry out certification of the user. When the fingerprint data which has been input from the fingerprint detecting unit <b>51</b> and the fingerprint data which has been read out from the first memory <b>52</b> correspond with each other indicating certification, the collation unit <b>53</b> outputs a certification signal to the interface <b>55</b>. When the fingerprint data which has been input from the fingerprint detecting unit <b>51</b> and the fingerprint data which has been read out from the first memory <b>52</b> do not correspond with each other indicating no certification, the collation unit <b>53</b> outputs a non-certification signal to the interface <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Information relating to the fingerprint data registered in the first memory <b>52</b> is preserved in the second memory <b>54</b>. Specifically, names or ID numbers of the fingerprint registrant and serial numbers of the IC cards are preserved in the second memory <b>54</b> as related information. Further, when a certification is made at the collation unit <b>53</b>, the second memory <b>54</b> outputs to the interface <b>55</b>, along with the certification signal, data of the user for which certification has been made.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The control unit <b>56</b> serves to control the entirety of the IC card <b>40</b>, and drives the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> when a fingertip is pressed onto the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> and controls the operation of writing fingerprint data to be registered into the first memory <b>52</b>, the operation of writing information relating to the registered fingerprint data into the second memory <b>54</b>, and the operation of reading out this related information.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It is to be noted that the IC card <b>40</b> is driven by power supplied from the apparatus body <b>2</b> through the mouse <b>5</b>. Of course, the IC card <b>40</b> may be driven by an included battery.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Next, a series of operations from the time the IC card <b>40</b> is loaded with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b> of the mouse <b>5</b> until fingerprint collation is carried out will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">First, a method of loading the IC card <b>40</b> with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b> will be explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the IC card <b>40</b> is inserted into the insertion hole <b>16</b> of the casing <b>11</b> so that the upper surface of the card body <b>41</b> faces upwardly and the front end of the card body <b>41</b> at which the terminal portions <b>42</b> are provided is the insertion end. At this time, the IC card <b>40</b> is inserted into the loading portion <b>15</b> while being guided by the guide recessed portion <b>19</b> and the bottom surface <b>15</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the terminal portions <b>42</b> of the IC card <b>40</b> are electrically connected to the connector <b>18</b> of the loading portion <b>15</b>. When the IC card <b>40</b> is completely loaded with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b>, the opening portion <b>17</b> is opened so that the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A method of registering a fingerprint with respect to the IC card <b>40</b> will next be explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref> and <b>7</b>, when the user operates the keyboard <b>3</b> or the mouse <b>5</b>, the control unit <b>56</b> of the IC card <b>40</b> first receives a command from the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> to place it in a fingerprint registration mode. The user allows his fingertip to come into contact with the shutter member <b>20</b> to thereby remove static electricity charged on the finger, and thereafter to move the shutter member <b>20</b> toward the rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the casing <b>11</b> so as to open the opening portion <b>17</b>. Then, when the user inserts his fingertip through the opening portion <b>17</b> and into contact with the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b>, the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> detects any differences in capacitance taking place in the respective capacitors constituting the fingerprint sensor to thereby extract feature points of the fingerprint, e.g., branch or center of skin upheaval lines to generate fingerprint data. At this time, since any static electricity charged on the finger of the user has been removed by the shutter member <b>20</b>, the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> can precisely detect differences in capacitance and can precisely detect the fingerprint. Further, the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> adds an ID number to the fingerprint data and outputs it to the first memory <b>52</b>. Thus, the fingerprint data of the user is preserved, i.e., registered, in the first memory <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">It is to be noted that information relating to the fingerprint data to be registered can be preserved in the IC card <b>40</b>. Namely, in the information processing apparatus <b>1</b>, the user operates the keyboard <b>3</b> or the mouse <b>5</b> to thereby input the name or ID number of the fingerprint registrant with respect to the IC card <b>40</b>, thus making it possible to record this input data into the second memory <b>54</b> of the IC card <b>40</b> through the mouse <b>5</b> connected to the interface <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Next, a method of collating fingerprints will be explained. When a user attempts to access a specific computer, or attempts to access a specific file preserved on the hard disk <b>61</b>, etc. through use of the keyboard <b>3</b> or the mouse <b>5</b> serving as an operating unit of the information processing apparatus <b>1</b>, the CPU <b>65</b> displays a request for certification by fingerprint collation on the display unit <b>64</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In response thereto, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the user removes static electricity and thereafter moves the shutter member <b>20</b> to open the opening portion <b>17</b>. The user then inserts his fingertip through the opening portion <b>17</b> and presses it onto the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> of the IC card <b>40</b> loaded with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b> of the mouse <b>5</b>. The fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> detects any differences in capacitance taking place in the respective capacitors constituting the fingerprint sensor to thereby extract feature points of the fingerprint, e.g., branch or center of skin upheaval lines. From this, fingerprint data is generated and output to the collation unit <b>53</b>. The collation unit <b>53</b> reads out registered fingerprint data from the first memory <b>52</b> and collates it with fingerprint data which has been input from the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b>. When the fingerprint data which has been input from the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> and the fingerprint data which has been read out from the first memory <b>52</b> correspond with each other indicating certification, the collation unit <b>53</b> outputs a certification signal to the interface <b>55</b>. Along with this, the control unit <b>56</b> outputs to the interface <b>55</b> related information of the user for which certification has been made. When the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> has received the certification signal through the mouse <b>5</b>, the CPU <b>65</b> permits access to a specific computer, or access to a specific file preserved on the hard disk <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, when the fingerprint data which has been input from the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> and the fingerprint data which has been read out from the first memory <b>52</b> do not correspond with each other indicating no certification has been made, the collation unit <b>53</b> outputs a non-certification signal to the interface <b>55</b>. When the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> has received the non-certification signal through the mouse <b>5</b>, the CPU <b>65</b> prevents access to a specific computer, or access to a specific file preserved on the hard disk <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">It is to be noted that the operation of removing the IC card <b>40</b> from the loading portion <b>15</b> can be carried out by sliding the IC 40 card in the direction of the insertion hole <b>16</b> through the opening portion <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">An IC card having a memory element used as an external memory unit of the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> also can be loaded with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b>. In this case, the CPU <b>65</b> executes an application program preserved on the hard disk <b>61</b> to thereby read out data, such as a file name or a data size, etc., from a memory element, such as a flash memory, etc., within the IC card. Further, in accordance with an operating signal input from the keyboard <b>3</b> or the mouse <b>5</b>, the CPU <b>65</b> reads out data from a memory element of an IC card loaded with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b> of the mouse <b>5</b>, and writes data into the memory element.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In accordance with the mouse <b>5</b> which is an input device of the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> as described above, even in the case in which the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> has only a few connecting portions which connect to the peripheral equipment, the IC card <b>40</b> having the fingerprint detection/collation function may be loaded with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b> of the mouse <b>5</b>, thereby making it possible to easily add fingerprint detection/collation processing to the information processing apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Moreover, in accordance with the mouse <b>5</b> which is an input device of the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> as described above, since the shutter member <b>20</b> is provided in the opening portion <b>17</b> which faces the loading portion <b>15</b> in which the IC card <b>40</b> is to be loaded, it prevents dust, etc. from being admitted into the loading portion <b>15</b> when the IC card <b>40</b> is not loaded. Thus, it is possible to prevent the connector <b>18</b> from becoming coated by dust, etc. Further, when the IC card <b>40</b> is loaded in the mouse <b>5</b>, it prevents dust, etc. from depositing on the fingerprint detecting portion. Thus, it is possible to precisely detect fingerprints. Further, since the shutter member <b>20</b> of the mouse <b>5</b> consists of a conductive material connected to the earth, if the user touches the shutter member <b>20</b> before detecting his fingerprint, it is possible to remove static electricity charged on his finger. Accordingly, in the fingerprint detection method using the electrostatic capacity detection method, it is possible to precisely detect differences in capacitance of the respective capacitors constituting the fingerprint sensor. Thus, it is possible to precisely identify fingerprints. In addition to the above, since the mouse <b>5</b> is the peripheral device that the user most frequently handles at the time of use of the information processing apparatus <b>1</b>, and the operation of pressing the fingertip onto the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> can be carried out by this mouse <b>5</b>, convenience in use in carrying out fingerprint collation can be improved. Also, the loading portion <b>15</b> provided in the mouse <b>5</b> can be used for both the IC card <b>40</b> for fingerprint collation and the IC card for memory. In addition, since the opening portion <b>17</b> which faces the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> is provided in the upper portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the casing <b>11</b>, it is possible to easily carry out fingerprint collation work.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The input device to which the present invention is applied also may be formed as follows. It is to be noted that the same reference numerals are respectively used for the same members as in the above-described mouse <b>5</b>, and their detail will be omitted. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a shutter member <b>80</b> which opens or closes opening portion <b>17</b> of this mouse <b>5</b> is formed so as to have a substantially rectangular shape having substantially the same dimensions as the opening portion <b>17</b>, similarly to the above-mentioned shutter member <b>20</b>. A projecting portion <b>81</b> is formed on the shutter member <b>80</b> so as to face upwardly. Further, the shutter member <b>80</b> is formed from a conductive material such as a metallic plate, etc. grounded to the earth. The finger of a user comes into contact with the shutter member <b>80</b> before fingerprint detection is carried out, thereby making it possible to remove static electricity charged on the finger. Thus, it is possible to precisely detect the fingerprint.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The shutter member <b>80</b> is engaged with a guide portion <b>22</b> formed at a side edge portion of opening portion <b>17</b> so that the opening/closing of the opening portion <b>17</b> is guided. A holding portion <b>82</b> is provided on one side edge of the shutter member <b>80</b>. The holding portion <b>82</b> holds a torsion coil spring <b>83</b> provided on one side of the loading portion <b>15</b> which feeds the shutter member <b>80</b> in the opening/closing directions.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The torsion coil spring <b>83</b> has one end portion <b>83</b><i>a </i>rotatably held at the holding portion <b>82</b> of the shutter member <b>80</b>, and the other end portion <b>83</b><i>b </i>rotatably held at a holding projection of casing <b>11</b> (not shown). In the state in which the shutter member <b>80</b> closes the opening portion <b>17</b>, the torsion coil spring <b>83</b> biases the shutter member <b>80</b> in the direction indicated by arrow C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> to close the opening portion <b>17</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. However, when the shutter member <b>80</b> is placed in the state in which the opening portion <b>17</b> is open, the torsion coil spring <b>83</b> biases the shutter member <b>80</b> in the direction opposite to that indicated by arrow C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> to open the opening portion <b>17</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Accordingly, the shutter member <b>80</b> is fed in the opening or closing directions by the user until a middle portion at which the torsional coil spring <b>83</b> is inverted. As a result of the fact that the biasing direction is changed, the shutter member <b>80</b> is fed in the direction of rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>or in the direction of front end <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the casing <b>11</b>, thus making it possible to carry out opening/closing operations of the opening portion <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Namely, when the shutter member <b>80</b> is moved from the state in which the shutter member <b>80</b> closes the opening portion <b>17</b> toward the rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the casing <b>11</b>, the end portion <b>83</b><i>a </i>of the torsion spring <b>83</b> held by the holding portion <b>82</b> of the shutter member <b>80</b> is also moved toward the rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the casing as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As the end portion <b>83</b><i>a </i>passes the other end portion <b>83</b><i>b </i>held at the holding projection provided on the casing <b>11</b>, the torsion coil spring <b>83</b> is inverted with the end portion <b>83</b><i>b </i>held at the holding projection acting as a pivot point. Thus, the torsion coil spring <b>83</b> biases the shutter member <b>80</b> toward the rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the casing <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, when the shutter member <b>80</b> is moved from the state in which the opening portion <b>17</b> is open toward the front end <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the casing <b>11</b>, the end portion <b>83</b><i>a </i>of the torsion spring <b>83</b> held by the holding portion <b>82</b> of the shutter member <b>80</b> is also moved toward the front end <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the casing, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As the end portion <b>83</b><i>a </i>passes the other end portion <b>83</b><i>b </i>held at the holding projection provided on the casing <b>11</b>, the torsion coil spring <b>83</b> is inverted with the end portion <b>83</b><i>b </i>acting as a pivot point. Thus, the torsion coil spring <b>83</b> biases the shutter member <b>80</b> toward the front end <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In an input device provided with such shutter member <b>80</b>, it is possible to bias the shutter member <b>80</b> in the opening direction or in the closing direction of the opening portion <b>17</b> by the biasing force of the torsion coil spring <b>83</b>. Accordingly, in such input device, the user first allows the shutter member <b>80</b> to undergo a feed operation, thereby making it possible to automatically open or close the opening portion <b>17</b>. Moreover, in accordance with this input device, since the shutter member <b>80</b> is provided in the opening portion <b>17</b> which faces the loading portion <b>15</b> in which the IC card <b>40</b> is to be loaded, it prevents dust, etc. from being admitted into the loading portion <b>15</b> when the IC card <b>40</b> is not loaded therein. Thus, it is possible to prevent the connector <b>18</b> from becoming coated by dust, etc. Further, in accordance with this input device, when the IC card <b>40</b> is loaded within the loading portion <b>15</b>, it is possible to prevent dust, etc. from being deposited on the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b>. Thus, it is possible to precisely detect fingerprints. Further, since the shutter member <b>80</b> consists of a conductive material connected to the earth, if the user contacts the shutter member <b>80</b> before fingerprint detection, it is possible to remove static electricity charged on his finger. Accordingly, in the fingerprint detection method using the electrostatic capacity type detection method, it is possible to precisely detect differences in capacitance of the respective capacitors constituting the fingerprint sensor. Thus, it is possible to precisely identify fingerprints.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">It is to be noted that while an explanation has been given of an input device adapted so that an IC card having a fingerprint collation function is loaded from the front end <b>11</b><i>b </i>side of the casing <b>11</b> of the mouse <b>5</b>, the present invention may be adapted so that the IC card <b>40</b> is loaded from the rear end <b>11</b><i>c </i>side of the casing <b>11</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Moreover, in the present invention, the opening portion <b>17</b> may be open at all times without providing the shutter member <b>20</b>. It is to be noted that while an example has been explained in which the mouse <b>5</b> is provided with a loading portion <b>15</b> having an IC card <b>40</b> with a fingerprint collation function loaded therein, the present invention may be formed as an input device in which a fingerprint detection function is included by providing a fingerprint detecting portion and/or a memory, etc. within the casing without using the IC card <b>40</b> having the fingerprint collation function.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Further, the input device to which the present invention is applied is usable not only for the electrostatic capacity type detection method, but also for the optical type detection method. In the optical detection method, the fingerprint detecting portion of the IC card <b>40</b> includes an image pick-up unit, such as a CCD or a line sensor, etc., and a back light for irradiating a pressing portion onto which the fingertip is pressed. When a finger is pressed against the fingerprint detecting portion, the back light is turned ON to pick up the image of the fingerprint at the image pick-up unit. The fingerprint detecting portion extracts feature points of the fingerprint, e.g., branch or center of skin upheaval lines from the imaged fingerprint. When a fingerprint registration is carried out, the fingerprint detecting portion outputs to the first memory <b>52</b> fingerprint data consisting of feature points of the fingerprint. Further, fingerprint data consisting of feature points of a fingerprint to be registered is preserved in the first memory <b>52</b> for every identification number. The fingerprint detecting portion outputs the fingerprint data to the collation unit <b>53</b> when fingerprint collation is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the input device provided with a fingerprint detecting portion using the optical type detection method, the provision of the shutter member <b>20</b> which opens or closes the opening portion <b>17</b> which faces the fingerprint detecting portion prevents dust, etc. from being admitted into the loading portion <b>15</b> when an IC card <b>40</b> is not loaded therein. Thus, it is possible to prevent the connector <b>18</b> from becoming coated by dust, etc. In addition, when an IC card <b>40</b> is loaded within loading portion <b>15</b>, dust, etc. is prevented from being deposited on the image pick-up unit such as a CCD, etc. Thus, it is possible to precisely detect fingerprints.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">It is to be noted that, in the present invention, in addition to the mouse <b>5</b> as described above, an IC card <b>40</b> having a fingerprint collation function may be loaded with respect to various input devices such as a remote control device for carrying out remote control of electronic equipment, etc. For example, the present invention may be applied to a keyboard <b>3</b> that, along with the mouse <b>5</b>, is most frequently handled by the user at the time the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> is used. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the loading portion <b>15</b> is provided in keyboard <b>3</b> in such a manner that an insertion hole <b>16</b> is provided on a side surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the keyboard <b>3</b> adjacent an upper surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>thereof. Further, an opening portion <b>17</b> for exposing the fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> of the IC card <b>40</b> to the exterior is provided at the upper surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>so as to make it easy to carry out fingerprint collation work. The opening portion <b>17</b> is adapted to have an opening on the side surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the keyboard <b>3</b> to make it easy to take out the IC card <b>40</b> through the insertion hole <b>16</b>. Further, a side surface <b>17</b><i>a </i>of the opening portion <b>17</b> includes a curve protruding toward the exterior, and is adapted so that a fingertip is easily inserted in carrying out fingerprint collation and the user does not become tired in view of human-engineering. Further, shutter member <b>20</b> is disposed in the opening portion <b>17</b> to prevent dust, etc. from being deposited on connector <b>18</b> with respect to an IC card <b>40</b> inserted within the loading portion <b>15</b> and/or a fingerprint detecting portion <b>51</b> of the IC card, and for removing static electricity charged on the finger of the user during fingerprint collation. It is to be noted that an IC card as an external memory unit may be loaded with respect to the loading portion <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Moreover, the connection between the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> and the mouse <b>5</b> is not limited to the above-described USB, but an interface such as IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 1394, etc. may be employed, and both wired systems and wireless systems may be employed. Further, the transmission/reception of data between the IC card <b>40</b> attached at the loading portion <b>15</b> and the mouse <b>5</b> also may be carried out by a wireless system. In addition, it is possible to load plural IC cards in the loading portion <b>15</b>. In this case, an IC card <b>40</b> for fingerprint collation and an IC card for memory may be loaded in the loading portion <b>15</b>, e.g., in a laminated manner.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As explained above in detail, in accordance with the input device of the present invention, even in the case of host equipment having only a few connecting portions, an IC card having a fingerprint collation function may be loaded with respect to a loading portion of the input device, thereby making it possible to easily add a fingerprint collation function to the host equipment. Further, since this input device is a device that a user most frequently handles at the time the host equipment is used, it is easy to press a fingertip onto the fingerprint detecting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Further, in accordance with the present invention, since the input device is provided with a fingerprint detecting portion for detecting the fingerprint of the user, and a shutter member in an opening portion which exposes the fingerprint detecting portion to the exterior, the fingerprint detecting portion can be closed by the shutter member when fingerprint detection is not carried out. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent dust, etc. from being admitted to deposit on the fingerprint detecting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In addition, in accordance with the input device of the present invention, a metallic shutter member is provided, thereby making it possible to remove static electricity charged on the finger of the user before fingerprint detection is performed. Accordingly, the fingerprint detecting portion can precisely detect the fingerprint of the user.</p>
