<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A push-pull plug has an outer housing that may be moved forwardly and backwardly along a plug housing. When the outer housing is in its forward position, a latch arm is in an upward or mated position and the plug will stay mated to a jack when the plug is inserted into the jack. When the outer housing is moved backwardly, cam surfaces on the outer housing push cam followers on the latch arm downwardly, moving the latch arm and latch to a downward or unmated position. The plug may then be removed from a jack as the outer housing is pulled. The plugs may be adapted for use with an insertion and removal tool. Corner finger grips may be formed on the outer housing and may be located in an alternating manner to facilitate use when plugs are closely positioned.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/621,229 filed Oct. 22, 2004, and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to communications connectors and more particularly to push-pull plugs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the rising importance of data communications, there is a drive toward the use of high-density connections. Increased density of connections in communications equipment—such as patch panels and network switches—is desirable because increased connection density allows for more connections in a given area. For example, many enterprises employ racks for their networking equipment, and the racks take up a certain amount of floor space. Such enterprises can install more network connections by replacing standard network equipment with high-density network equipment within the same racks. The high-density equipment thus allows the same amount of floor space to support more network connections.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">But as connection density is increased, it becomes more difficult to plug in and unplug connectors. Areas with a high density of connections, such as high-density patch panels, leave little space for installers to access the plugs. Because the plugs are very close to one another, it is difficult for a technician to reach between adjacent plugs in order to operate a latch on a plug and thereby release the plug. It is also difficult to hold a plug during insertion. The high density of cables coming out of the plugs adds to these difficulties. It is desirable to have a plug that is easy to insert and remove from a jack, even in high-density environments.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a push-pull plug is provided with an outer housing that activates a latch.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to some embodiments of the present invention, an outer housing has one or more cams that interact with one or more cam followers on a latch arm to move the latch arm between a mated position and an unmated position. In the mated position, a latch provided on the latch arm is in position to latch with a jack. In the unmated position, the latch is in position to be removed from the jack.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A latch arm may be connected to the plug housing only at a rear end of the latch arm. Alternatively, a latch arm is connected to the plug housing at front and rear ends of the latch arm. In another alternative embodiment, the latch arm is connected to the plug housing only at the front of the latch arm.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Springs may be provided to bias the outer housing. In some embodiments, the outer housing is biased in a forward position by the springs, with the latch being in a mated position when the outer housing is in the forward position. In another alternative embodiment, a slider latch is used to secure the plug housing to the outer housing.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one embodiment of a plug <b>10</b> is shown. The plug <b>10</b> comprises a plug housing <b>12</b> and an outer housing <b>14</b>. A boot <b>16</b> is attached to the rear of the plug housing <b>12</b> to control the bend radius of a cable <b>70</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>) terminated at the plug. The outer housing <b>14</b> interacts with a latch arm <b>18</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, moving a latch <b>20</b> of the latch arm between a first, or mated, position in which the latch is positioned to mate with a jack and a second, or unmated, position in which the latch is positioned to be released from a jack. The interaction between the outer housing <b>14</b> and the latch arm <b>18</b> allows the plug <b>10</b> to be installed and removed by pushing and pulling the outer housing <b>14</b>. The boot <b>16</b> is connected to the plug at a boot adapter <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The outer housing <b>14</b> has retention notches <b>22</b> in retention grooves <b>24</b>. The retention notches <b>22</b> and the retention grooves <b>24</b> allow a tool <b>52</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, to securely but releasably grip the outer housing <b>14</b> to facilitate insertion of the plug <b>10</b> into a jack and removal of the plug from the jack.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A rear perspective view of the plug <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The boot <b>16</b> is connected to the plug housing <b>12</b> at a boot adapter <b>26</b>. An outer housing latch <b>28</b> engages the rear plug wall <b>30</b>, holding the outer housing <b>14</b> in place as the outer housing is forwardly biased (toward the upper right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an exploded view of the plug <b>10</b> is shown. To assemble the plug <b>10</b>, the boot <b>16</b> is connected via slots <b>32</b> to boot latches <b>34</b> on the boot adapter <b>26</b>. The boot adapter <b>26</b> is inserted into a rear opening <b>36</b> of the plug housing <b>12</b> and may be held in place by latches.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The outer housing <b>14</b> is slid onto the plug housing <b>12</b> from the front, and springs <b>38</b> are inserted into pockets <b>40</b> in the outer housing <b>14</b>. The springs <b>38</b> are interposed between the rear plug wall <b>30</b> and a front wall of the outer housing <b>14</b>, and the outer housing latch <b>28</b> latches with the rear plug wall <b>30</b>. The springs <b>38</b> bias the outer housing <b>14</b> forwardly (toward the upper right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), and the outer housing latch <b>28</b> holds the outer housing <b>14</b> in place against the biasing force. This arrangement allows the outer housing <b>14</b> to be slid backwardly (toward the lower left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), thereby moving the latch arm <b>18</b> and the latch <b>20</b> from a mated position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to an unmated position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the latch arm <b>18</b> is integral with the plug housing <b>12</b> and is hingedgly attached by a flexible member <b>42</b> to an upper surface <b>44</b> of the plug housing <b>12</b>. The latch arm <b>18</b> of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is also connected to a front edge of the plug housing <b>12</b> via a front latch arm support <b>46</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the front arm latch support <b>46</b> may be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The latch arm <b>18</b> is resiliently biased away from the upper surface <b>44</b> of the plug housing <b>12</b>. Cam followers <b>48</b> extend laterally from the latch arm <b>18</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the plug housing <b>12</b> having the latch arm <b>18</b> in a mated position, which results when the outer housing (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is in a forward position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the plug housing <b>12</b> having the latch arm <b>18</b> in an unmated position, which results when the outer housing is in a rearward position. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> are side views of the plug housing <b>12</b> showing the latch arm <b>18</b>, respectively, in a mated position and an unmated position. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the plug housing <b>12</b>, the latch arm <b>18</b>, and the flexible member <b>42</b> are integrally molded from thermoplastic.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> are cutaway views of the plug housing <b>12</b> and the outer housing <b>14</b>, showing the interaction between cam surfaces <b>50</b> on the outer housing <b>14</b> and cam followers <b>48</b> on the latch arm <b>18</b>. The cutaway views in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> show the interaction of only one cam surface <b>50</b> and one cam follower <b>48</b>, but in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref> there are two cam surfaces <b>50</b> on the outer housing <b>14</b> and two cam followers <b>48</b> on the latch arm <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the outer housing <b>14</b> is in the forward position, and the latch arm <b>18</b> is in the mated position. When the latch arm <b>18</b> is in the mated position, the cam follower <b>48</b> is in its uppermost position and the latch <b>20</b> is positioned to latch onto mating projections within a jack. During insertion of the plug into the jack, when the latch arm is in the mated position the latch arm is deflected downwardly and then springs back up due to the resilience of the latch arm <b>18</b>, with the latch <b>20</b> locking behind the mating projections of the jack.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To release the plug from the jack, a user pulls the outer housing <b>14</b> back to a rearward position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. This forces the cam surface <b>50</b> of the outer housing backwardly, thereby forcing the cam follower <b>48</b> downwardly. The latch arm <b>18</b> moves downwardly with the cam follower <b>48</b> until it reaches the unmated position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, with the latch <b>20</b> disengaged from a mating projection in the jack. With the latch arm <b>18</b> in its unmated position, the plug is free to be removed from the jack. After removal of the plug from the jack, the springs <b>38</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) force the outer housing <b>14</b> forwardly, and the latch arm <b>18</b> returns to the mated position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Removal of the plug <b>10</b> from a jack requires that a user pull the outer housing <b>14</b> backwardly, and does not require direct downward force on a latch from the user. This simplifies manual removal of the plug from a jack. Plugs according to the present invention may also be used with a tool as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a tool <b>52</b> for insertion and removal of plugs according to some embodiments of the present invention is shown. The tool <b>52</b> may be used with the plug embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-28</figref>, but is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref> in use with the plug embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-19</figref>. The tool <b>52</b> has a handle <b>54</b> and a stem <b>56</b> extending from the handle <b>54</b>. The stem <b>56</b> has a clip <b>58</b> at its end. The clip <b>58</b> comprises opposing clip arms <b>60</b> having inwardly-directed clip ridges <b>62</b>. According to one embodiment of the tool <b>52</b>, the handle <b>54</b> is plastic and the stem <b>56</b> and clip <b>58</b> are metal. Other materials may be employed. It is preferred for the stem <b>56</b> and the clip <b>58</b> to have flexibility in order to facilitate insertion and removal of plugs using the tool, as shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the tool <b>52</b> gripping a plug <b>110</b>. As shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the clip ridges <b>62</b> of the clip engage the retention notches <b>122</b> on the outer housing <b>114</b>. In operation, it is preferred to first engage one of the retention notches <b>122</b> with one clip ridge <b>62</b>, then axially rotate the tool <b>52</b> to engage the opposing retention notch <b>122</b> with the other clip ridge <b>62</b>. When the clip ridges <b>62</b> are inserted into the retention notches <b>122</b>, the tool may be pulled backwardly (toward the upper left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>), moving the outer housing <b>114</b> to its rearward position and thereby moving the latch arm <b>118</b> to its unmated position. With the latch arm <b>118</b> in the unmated position, the plug <b>110</b> will be removed from a jack as the tool <b>52</b> is pulled.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The tool <b>52</b> may also be used for insertion of a plug into a jack. To insert a plug into a jack, the clip ridges <b>62</b> are inserted into opposing retention notches <b>122</b> of an uninserted plug. The tool is then guided toward a jack and the plug is inserted into the jack. Next, the tool may be disengaged from the plug by axially rotating the tool to disengage one clip ridge <b>62</b> from its retention notch <b>122</b>. Following this disengagement, a slight upward movement of the tool and a slight axial rotation in the opposite direction disengages the tool and allows the tool to be pulled backwardly, with the plug remaining in the jack. According to one embodiment, four retention notches <b>122</b> are provided in the outer housing <b>114</b>. With two retention notches <b>122</b> on each side of the outer housing <b>114</b>, the retention notches <b>122</b> may be engaged by the tool <b>52</b> from above or from below. In an alternative embodiment, only one retention notch is provided on each side of the outer housing, allowing engagement from above or below by a tool having elongated clip arms.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-19</figref> show features of a plug <b>110</b> according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. In the alternative embodiment, the latch arm <b>118</b> of the plug <b>110</b> is integral with the plug housing <b>112</b> and extends in a forward direction from the rear plug wall <b>130</b>. The latch arm <b>118</b> is hingedly attached by a flexible member <b>142</b> to the rear plug wall <b>130</b>. The latch arm <b>118</b> is resiliently biased away from the upper surface <b>144</b> of the plug housing <b>112</b>. The latch arm <b>118</b> has cam followers <b>148</b> and a latch <b>120</b> and operates similarly to the latch arm <b>18</b> of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>. The latch arm <b>118</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-19</figref> is free from connection to the upper surface <b>144</b> of the plug housing <b>112</b> along its forward edge.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-19</figref> show the plug <b>110</b> with an outer housing <b>114</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, the outer housing <b>114</b> is in its forward position, and the latch arm <b>118</b> and latch <b>120</b> are in their mated position. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, the outer housing <b>114</b> has been moved to its rearward position, and the latch arm <b>118</b> and the latch <b>120</b> are in their unmated position. Similarly to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, springs are provided within pockets of the outer housing <b>114</b> to return the outer housing <b>114</b> to its forward position when the outer housing <b>114</b> is released. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the outer housing <b>114</b> has retention notches <b>122</b> in a retention groove <b>124</b>, enabling the use of a tool to install and remove the plug <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-27</figref> show plug <b>210</b> in yet another alternative embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the outer housing <b>214</b> includes a finger grip <b>228</b> which allows a user to insert and remove the plug <b>210</b> without the use of a tool.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The outer housing <b>214</b> is slid onto the plug housing <b>212</b> from the front, either manually by finger grip <b>228</b>, or by the use of a tool, and is held in place by one or more slider latches <b>225</b>. This arrangement allows the outer housing <b>214</b> to be slid backwardly (toward the lower left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>), thereby moving the latch arm <b>218</b> and the latch <b>220</b> from a mated position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, to an unmated position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-25</figref>, the latch arm <b>218</b> of the plug <b>210</b> is integral with the plug housing <b>212</b> and extends in a forward direction from the integral spring arm <b>230</b>. The latch arm <b>218</b> is hingedly attached by a member <b>242</b> to an integral spring arm <b>230</b>. The latch arm <b>218</b> is resiliently biased away from the upper surface <b>244</b> of the plug housing <b>212</b>. The latch arm <b>218</b> has cam followers <b>248</b> that extend laterally from the latch arm <b>218</b> and a latch <b>220</b>. The latch arm <b>218</b> is free from connection to the upper surface <b>244</b> of the plug housing <b>122</b> along its forward edge.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows the plug housing <b>212</b> having the latch arm <b>218</b> in a mated position, which results when the outer housing <b>214</b> is in a forward position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows the plug housing <b>212</b> having the latch arm <b>218</b> in an unmated position, which results when the outer housing is in a rearward position. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 25</figref> are sectional views of the plug housing <b>212</b> showing the latch arm <b>218</b>, respectively, in a mated position and an unmated position. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the plug housing <b>212</b> and the latch arm <b>218</b> are integrally molded from thermoplastic.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, when the outer housing <b>214</b> is in the forward position, the latch arm <b>218</b> is in the mated position. When the latch arm <b>218</b> is in the mated position, the cam follower <b>248</b> is in its uppermost position and the latch <b>220</b> is positioned to latch onto mating projections within a jack. Insertion of the plug <b>210</b> into the jack is essentially the same as the insertion of plug <b>10</b>, described above.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">To release the plug from the jack, a user pulls the outer housing <b>214</b> back to rearward position using finger grip <b>228</b>. This forces a cam surface <b>50</b> (described above) of the outer housing backwardly, thereby forcing the cam follower <b>248</b> downwardly. The latch arm <b>218</b> moves downwardly with the cam follower <b>248</b> until it reaches the unmated position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, with the latch <b>220</b> disengaged from a mating projection in the jack. With the latch arm <b>218</b> in its unmated position, the plug is free to be removed from the jack. After removal of the plug from the jack, the integral spring arm <b>230</b> forces the outer housing <b>214</b> forwardly, and the latch arm <b>218</b> returns to the mated position.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Removal of the plug <b>210</b> from a jack requires that a user pull the outer housing <b>214</b> backwardly using finger grip <b>228</b>, and does not require direct downward force on a latch from the user. This simplifies manual removal of the plug from a jack. Plugs according to this embodiment may also be used with a tool <b>52</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, which shows the tool <b>52</b> gripping a plug <b>210</b>. The clip ridges <b>62</b> of the clip engage the retention notches <b>222</b> on the outer housing <b>214</b>. The tool <b>52</b> may also be used for insertion of a plug <b>210</b> into a jack by the same method as described above with respect to plug <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref> show a plug <b>210</b> installed in a patch panel. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, cable <b>70</b> is attached to plug <b>210</b> at boot <b>216</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates how the finger grips <b>228</b> are placed on the plugs <b>210</b> in an alternating manner to allow for easier manual insertion and removal of a single plug while neighboring plugs are inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While particular embodiments and applications of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the precise construction and compositions disclosed herein and that various modifications, changes, and variations may be apparent from the foregoing descriptions without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. For example, though plugs according to the present invention have been illustrated as RJ-45 communication plugs, it is to be understood that the principles of the present invention could be applied to other types of plugs, including electrical and optical plugs.</p>
