<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the invention generally relate to apparatus and methods for directional deposition of material on magnetic recording media and more specifically, for deposition of tilt perpendicular media.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Magnetic and magneto-optical media are extensively employed in the computer industry and can be locally magnetized by a write transducer or write head to record and store information. The write transducer creates a concentrated magnetic field which is directionally alternated based upon specific bits of the information being stored. When the local magnetic field produced by the write transducer is greater than the coercivity of the recording medium, grains of the recording medium at that location are magnetized. The grains retain their magnetization after the magnetic field produced by the write transducer is removed. The direction of the magnetization matches the direction of the applied magnetic field. The magnetization of the recording medium can subsequently produce an electrical response to a read sensor, allowing the stored information to be read.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Magnetic recording media with higher storage capacity, less noise when reading or writing and lower production cost is increasingly in demand. Therefore, efforts have been made to reduce the size (e.g., nanometer range) of recording media required to magnetically record bits of information. Also, the integrity of the information must be maintained as size is decreased. The space necessary to record information in magnetic recording media depends upon the spacing of transitions between oppositely magnetized areas. Generally, these transitions are nanometers in size. It is, therefore, desirable to produce magnetic recording media that will support the smallest transition size possible. However, the output transitions from smaller recording media must avoid excessive noise (generally expressed in signal-to-noise ratio (SMNR)) to reliably maintain the integrity of the stored information.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, achieving a magnetic recording media having acceptable characteristics involves microstructural and crystallographic control of the media materials during a deposition process. Such control is typically attempted by manipulating the deposition process and proper use of underlayers and seedlayers (e.g., templating the magnetic layer). In spite of these improved techniques for higher quality media, such as less noise and higher storage capacity, traditional perpendicular media remains the deposited material.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Tilted perpendicular media has been proposed as a means to write higher anisotropy magnetic recording media than otherwise possible using conventional perpendicular recording schemes, since more grains are distributed along a similar magnetic path. Therefore, smaller grain size and higher areal density of tilted perpendicular media has an extended thermal stability compared to conventional perpendicular media. The basic advantage of the tilted geometry is suggested by the dependence of the switching field on the applied field angle, graphically shown for an ideal Stoner-Wohlfarth particle in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The graph contains several regions, such as region <b>2</b> for conventional perpendicular overwrite media, region <b>4</b> for conventional perpendicular writing media and region <b>6</b> for tilted perpendicular writing and overwrite media. Ideally, a minimum switching field of ½H<sub>k</sub>=K/M<sub>s </sub>is realized for an applied field direction of 45° to the particle magnetic easy axis, where K is the uniaxial anisotropy constant and M<sub>s </sub>is the saturation magnetization. This minimum value is one-half the maximum switching field of H<sub>k</sub>=2K/M<sub>s</sub>, realized for an applied field direction of 0°, i.e., head-on to the easy axis. Conventional perpendicular recording structures using a soft magnetic underlayer and perpendicular easy axis for the recording layer typically operate close to the head-on geometry, where switching is in fact least efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Region <b>2</b> depicts conventional perpendicular overwrite media with head-on geometry and a write field of 5°±6° with respect to media H<sub>k</sub>. Region <b>4</b> depicts conventional perpendicular writing media with a slightly lower switching field than perpendicular overwrite media. Conventional perpendicular writing media has a slight geometric grade and a write field of 12°±6° with respect to media H<sub>k</sub>. However, region <b>6</b> depicts titled perpendicular writing and overwriting media with only about 50% of the switching field than that required in conventional perpendicular overwrite media. The ideal write field is about 45°±8° with respect to media H<sub>k</sub>. Therefore, the minimum switching field is achieved as the field angle increases to 45°. Hence, the use of tilted symmetry material will inherently minimize the switching field. The art is deficient while providing adequate processes and apparatuses to deposit tilted perpendicular media.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need for an apparatus and method for depositing tilted symmetry material on a magnetic recording medium. Furthermore, there is a need to control the angle the material is deposited to the substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">So that the manner in which the above recited features of the present invention can be understood in detail, a more particular description of the invention, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to embodiments, some of which are illustrated in the appended drawings. It is to be noted, however, that the appended drawings illustrate only typical embodiments of this invention and are therefore not to be considered limiting of its scope, for the invention may admit to other equally effective embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Generally, methods and apparatus are disclosed for fabrication of angle-of-incidence layers on a disk. In one embodiment, the angle-of-incidence layers may have radial and/or circumferential tilt symmetry. Deposition techniques for forming the layers on the disk include, for example, sputtering or evaporation techniques capable of producing directional material according to the desired tilt symmetry. The methods are considered capable of providing adequate uniformity, sufficient throughput, and suitable inventory for high rate, single-sided or double-sided, continuous fabrication processing on disk-based sputter or evaporation production tools.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>, conventional perpendicular recording media (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) is schematically compared with the tilted perpendicular recording media (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B-C</figref>) on disk <b>10</b>. The easy axis in the recording layer is tilted to take advantage of the substantially reduced switching field required to record information. For a given write field magnitude, tilting the easy axis allows the anisotropy K to be increased without compromising writability. The media in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> contains perpendicular grains <b>14</b> and perpendicular texture <b>11</b>, while the media in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> contains tilted grains <b>16</b> and tilted texture <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates a media containing perpendicular grains <b>14</b> and tilted texture <b>12</b>. The particle volume, which fundamentally determines the transition width and linear recording density, can then be reduced while maintaining an acceptable thermal stability ratio KV/kT. Generally, larger particle volumes correlate to larger transition width. Further advantages of the tilted easy axis are a reduced switching time due to the large reversal torque, and a narrower track-to-track guard band resulting from increased multi-pass thermal erasure stability.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For rotating disk applications with a bit width to bit length aspect ratio greater than one, the optimal easy axis tilt direction is thought to be radial. Physically perpendicular grains with tilted c-axis and correspondingly tilted easy axis texture have been experimentally demonstrated using angle-of-incidence seed layers. In these experiments, a highly directional ion beam deposition source was used to create a tilted columnar thin film microstructure, onto which a Co-alloy recording layer was sputter deposited with resultant tilted c-axis texture yet perpendicular physical grain morphology. Such a microstructure, with the c-axis (magnetic easy axis) tilted in the radial direction, is considered promising for practical realization of the theoretical concept. However, many challenges remain to develop a practical disk media manufacturing process, such as available materials, control during deposition and cost of manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Generally, easy axis is the axis along which the magnetic moment spontaneously aligns in the absence of an applied external field. The internal magnetization is stable when pointing parallel to the easy direction. Circumferential tilt symmetry, used herein, is the easy axis lies in the plane defined by a vector tangential to a circle centered on the disk (a track) and a vector normal to the disk surface. Radial tilt symmetry, used herein, is the easy axis lies in the plane defined by a vector along the disk radial direction and a vector normal to the disk surface.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">One embodiment of an apparatus for depositing material on a disk is depicted by system <b>18</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. System <b>18</b> utilizes an aperture <b>20</b> in shutter plate <b>24</b> disposed between the sputter cathode <b>22</b> and disk <b>30</b> to constrain the angle of the depositing flux. Aperture <b>18</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> with a radially-oriented, rectangular geometry, but aperture <b>20</b> may have other geometries (e.g., square, circular, triangular or trapezoidal) and dimensions. A mounting bracket <b>25</b> connects the shutter plate <b>24</b> to the table <b>28</b>. A collimator (not shown) is optionally applied between cathode <b>22</b> and shutter plate <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Sputter cathode <b>22</b> emits sputtered materials at various trajectories <b>23</b> via source <b>21</b> including perpendicular and non-perpendicular angles with respect to the disk <b>30</b>. The shutter plate <b>24</b> restricts transmission of a portion of sputtered material, while the aperture <b>20</b> allows passage of sputtered material with specific trajectories. In one embodiment, a rotational speed is selected for the disk <b>30</b> while resting on a rotatable nest <b>26</b> supported by a table <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another embodiment, cathode <b>22</b> and/or shutter plate <b>24</b> are movable to produce a tilted angle relative to the plane of the disk <b>30</b>. The relative placement of the disk <b>30</b>, sputter cathode <b>22</b> and aperture <b>20</b> controls the degree of tilt angle and symmetry, i.e., radial or circumferential of the deposited material.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The relative placement of the disk <b>30</b>, sputter cathode <b>22</b> and aperture <b>20</b> is proportional to the tilted angle of the media. That is, tilted media with angles between about 30° and about 60° relative to the surface of the disk can be derived with the relative placement of the disk, cathode and shutter plate/aperture. Preferably, the deposited material has a tilt angle of about 45°. Therefore, the adjustment of all or any one of these variables proportionally alters the tilt angle of the deposited material. In one example, sputter cathode <b>22</b> and aperture <b>20</b> remain in position while disk <b>30</b> is shifted to adjust the tilt angle. In another example, sputter cathode <b>22</b> and disk <b>30</b> remain in position while aperture <b>20</b> (i.e., by moving shutter plate <b>24</b>) is shifted to adjust the tilt angle. In another example, disk <b>30</b> and aperture <b>20</b> remain in position while sputter cathode <b>22</b> is shifted to adjust the tilt angle. The configuration of the apparatus provides an advantage of flexibility, e.g., easy adjustment of deposition geometry since disk <b>30</b>, sputter cathode <b>22</b> and/or aperture <b>20</b> independently can be adjusted. Therefore, disk <b>30</b>, sputter cathode <b>22</b> and/or aperture <b>20</b> is/are adjusted while any one or two of the other(s) remain in position.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Radial uniformity can be achieved using multiple cathodes and apertures material deposition to the surface of disk <b>30</b>, such as sequentially alternating between cathodes containing different sources or simultaneously sputtering with two or more cathodes. Rotation of the disk <b>30</b> during deposition assures circumferential uniformity. Rotation is generally maintained in the range from about 20 rpm to about 1,000 rpm, preferably from about 50 rpm to about 100 rpm. The time needed to deposit the media material depends on several variables, such as material composition, size of disk, power supply and other process parameters. Exposure time is about 20 seconds or less for a 95 mm OD disk. Preferably, the exposure time is in a range from about 2 seconds to about 20 seconds, more preferably, the exposure time is in a range from about 3 seconds to about 8 seconds. In one embodiment, material is deposited across the substrate equally with respect to time. In another embodiment, material is deposited with inconsistent uniformity with respect to time. In another embodiment, radial uniformity can be achieved on both sides of a disk, i.e., double-sided coating is also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the sputter cathode <b>22</b> is displaced from the center axis of the disk <b>30</b> by an angle in the range from about 30° to about 60° relative to the substrate normal. Preferably the easy axis of the deposited material has a tilt angle in the range from about 40° to about 50° relative to the substrate normal, more preferably at about 45° relative to the substrate normal. Herein, substrate normal is a term used to define the 90° axis from the plane of the substrate or disk, wherein the plane is consistent with the circumference of the substrate or disk. In one embodiment, the axis of the cathode <b>22</b> is 90° to the plane of disk <b>30</b> and off centered relative to the axis of the disk <b>30</b>. Therefore, the trajectory angle of the depositing material not obscured by the shutter plate <b>24</b> inherently has the tilt angle of the deposited material. In another embodiment, the cathode <b>22</b> is less than 90° from the disk <b>30</b> and is centered or off centered relative to the axis of the disk <b>30</b>. The angle is measured from the plane of the disk <b>30</b>, that is, when the cathode is facing the disk <b>30</b>, an axis through the cathode extends normal to the disk <b>30</b>. Generally, the sputter cathode <b>22</b> is displaced from the disk <b>30</b> at a distance from about 2.54 cm to about 15.24 cm, preferably from about 5.08 cm to about 7.62 cm. The shutter plate <b>24</b> can be substantially parallel with respect to the disk <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> depicts shutter plate <b>24</b> shielding portions of the sputtered materials at various trajectories <b>23</b> from source <b>21</b>. Sputtered material traveling along the desired angle pass through aperture <b>20</b> and deposits on disk <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> depicts another viewpoint of the same embodiment, whereas selected angles of sputtered materials at various trajectories <b>23</b> pass through aperture <b>20</b> and deposits to disk <b>30</b>. Excess sputtered material is collected on various surfaces within the process chamber, including the inner walls of the chamber, the shutter plate <b>24</b>, the mounting bracket <b>25</b> and the rotatable nest <b>26</b>. The excess sputtered material is removed from the chamber during regular cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref> illustrate another embodiment of system <b>40</b> configured to achieve tilted symmetry of media material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a front view of the system <b>40</b> and includes a stationary disk <b>44</b> sitting on a pedestal (not shown). System <b>40</b> contains a cathode assembly <b>43</b> with the individual cathodes <b>42</b> tilted either radially and/or circumferentially to generate the desired directionality of the depositing flux. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4C</figref> (side view) illustrate system <b>40</b> including rotating cathodes <b>42</b> with a radial tilt. The cathodes <b>42</b> are positioned in angles relative to the desired tilt angle of the deposited media. In one embodiment, there is overlap of the perimeter between a cathode <b>42</b> and disk <b>44</b>. Generally, the cathodes <b>42</b> have relative angles in the range from about 30° to about 60°, preferably from about 40° to about 60° with respect to substrate normal.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To further reduce the spread in flux incident angle, various shields or channeled filters <b>48</b> (e.g., collimator) can be disposed between the cathodes <b>42</b> and the disk <b>44</b>, i.e., appended to the cathode structure, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. For radial uniformity of film thickness and tilt angle, the cathodes can be staggered at different radii, if necessary. For example, one cathode is angled towards the outer circumference of the disk, while another cathode positioned at a shorter radius is angled to a more inner circumference of the disk than the first cathode. In one embodiment, the cathode assembly <b>43</b> rotates about the disk <b>44</b> at a rate of between about 100 rpm to about 1,000 rpm. In another embodiment, though not shown, relative rotation is achieved by rotating the disk and maintaining the cathode assembly stationary. Circumferential uniformity results naturally from the rotating motion of the cathodes, so long as an integral number of cathode revolutions are maintained during the deposition process. At least one rotating cathode assembly <b>43</b> on each side of the disk <b>44</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">System <b>40</b> offers several different features which enable high volume production. First, from the point of view of particle generation, the cathode assembly <b>43</b> can be well removed (i.e., distanced) and shielded from the surface of the disk <b>44</b>. Therefore, the surface of disk <b>44</b> will be less contaminated with irregular particulates when the cathode assembly <b>43</b> is farther from disk <b>44</b>. Second, the tilted cathodes <b>42</b> enable an increased proportion of material to be deposited on the disk <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> show an embodiment of system <b>50</b>, such that at least one stationary large diameter target <b>51</b>A and/or <b>51</b>B is implemented to deposit media to a fixed disk <b>52</b>. Targets are independently with a hole on the center, as in target <b>51</b>A, or consistent (without a hole in the center), as in target <b>51</b>B. In FIG. <b>5</b>A, a disk <b>52</b> is disposed between a pair of cathodes <b>54</b>. The radial baffles <b>56</b> are disposed in a nested configuration to ensure radial symmetry, i.e., any point at a given radius is symmetrical (e.g., thickness) to all points with the same radius. The disk <b>52</b> may be resting on a pedestal (not shown). Also, radial baffles <b>56</b> are between the disk <b>52</b> and each cathode <b>54</b>. The radial baffles <b>56</b> are of a geometric shape selected to produce an angled deposition (e.g., radial tilt) of the sputtered material to the surface of the disk <b>52</b>. To further reduce the circumferential spread of the depositing flux, radially oriented rib baffles <b>57</b> can be added between the radial baffles <b>56</b>. The baffles direct the depositing material to the surface of the disk <b>52</b> at a desired angle.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates a top view of the radially orientated rib baffles <b>57</b>. The plane of baffles <b>57</b> are turned into the substrate normal for clarity of the illustration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> shows an array of radially oriented rib baffles <b>57</b> tilted in the circumferential direction for circumferential tilt (only one quadrant shown). To further reduce the radial spread of the depositing flux, circumferentially oriented rib baffles <b>58</b> can be added between the radial elements. The media is uniformly deposited radially across the surface of the disk with the radial baffles <b>56</b>. The baffles control the flow and angle of the incoming material to be deposited. The trajectory angle from the source to the disk is proportional to the tilt angle of the easy axis of the deposited material.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The stationary cathode and disk are advantageous for manufacturing and the baffles are positioned to diminish any non-uniformity due to shadowing of the depositing flux by the collimating baffles. To minimize such shadowing effects, the thickness of the baffles can be kept to a minimum, such as in a range from about 10 mils to about 50 mils, preferably from about 15 mils to about 25 mils. Also, the spacing between the baffles <b>56</b> and disk <b>52</b> can be kept as large as possible, such as in the range from about 2 mm to about 10 mm, preferably about 4 mm. The baffles <b>56</b> are inclined at relative angles in the range from about 30° and about 60°, preferably from about 40° to about 60° with respect to substrate normal. Furthermore, multiple deposition stations can be used with an offset in baffle location.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a side view illustrating a large diameter cylindrical hollow cathode <b>64</b> surrounding at least one disk <b>62</b>. Six disks <b>62</b> loaded into cathode <b>64</b> are shown. However, disks <b>62</b> can number from 1 to about 12. In one embodiment, disks <b>62</b> are spaced apart from each other by about 2 cm to about 10 cm. Disks <b>62</b> are held in place by a disk support <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The cathode <b>64</b> has an inner diameter from about 6.5 cm to about 20 cm, depending on the size of disks <b>62</b>. For example, when disks <b>62</b> have an OD of 65 mm, then the inner diameter of cathode <b>64</b> is in the range from about 7.5 cm to about 10 cm. In one embodiment, cathode <b>64</b> is consumed as the sputtering source and is made from the desired deposition material. The disks <b>62</b> are rotated by spinning the disk support <b>63</b> at a speed from about 50 rpm to about 1,000 rpm while sputtering the media to the surface of the disks <b>62</b>. An actuator <b>65</b> can be used to control the rotation of disk support <b>63</b> extending axially within the hollow portion of cathode <b>64</b>. The rotation of the disks <b>62</b> provides a even distribution of the sputtered material. The cathode <b>64</b> extends beyond disks <b>62</b> by lengths L<sub>1 </sub>and L<sub>2</sub>, where L<sub>1 </sub>is in the range from about 1 cm to about 10 cm and L<sub>2 </sub>in the range from about 1 cm to about 10 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, the radial angle of incidence can be constrained by other disks <b>62</b> and excellent target utilization can be achieved. However, in another embodiment, the radial angle of incidence can be constrained by channel configurations formed in optional shields <b>68</b>. Radial angles of incidence are referenced relative to the plane of disks <b>62</b> and range from about 30° to about 60°, preferably from about 40° to about 60°. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, radial baffles <b>67</b> can be added to reduce the circumferential spread of depositing. The disks <b>62</b> can be rotated to eliminate shadowing by the radial baffles <b>67</b> during a consistent deposition of media with a radial tilt.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-C</figref> are schematic side views illustrating another embodiment of a deposition system. Two ring-shaped cathodes <b>74</b> are spaced with a gap in between to allow disk transport. The gap is in the range from about 0.2 cm to about 10 cm. The disk <b>72</b> rests on a pedestal <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Three different ring geometries are shown. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows inward sputtering, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows cross-wise sputtering and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> shows angular sputtering. In one embodiment, the disk <b>72</b> is positioned between the cathodes <b>74</b>, such that the cathodes are inwardly positioned towards the disk and the axes of the cathodes are parallel to the disk plane. In another embodiment, the disk <b>72</b> is positioned between the cathodes <b>74</b>, such that the cathodes are cross-wise positioned towards the disk and face the axes of the cathodes are parallel to the disk axis. In another embodiment, the disk <b>72</b> is positioned between the cathodes <b>74</b>, such that the axes of the cathodes are angularly positioned towards the disk such that they make an angle between about 0° and about 90° relative to the plane of the disk. Ring-shaped sputtering sources, such as the Triatron, are available commercially from Unaxis Corporation. The angular configuration, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, generally offers higher source utilization and higher deposition rates than the inward and cross-sputtering configurations. Radial shields can be added (not shown) to reduce the circumferential spread of depositing flux at the expense of source utilization.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Disks or substrates are made from a variety of materials, such as metals, glass, ceramic, glass-ceramic composite, polymers and plastic. Metal substrates include elemental metals (e.g., Al, Ni, Cr or Co), metal alloys (e.g., AlMg or NiAl) and doped metals (e.g., NiP<sub>x</sub>). Disks that are round have a variety of outer diameters, including 65 mm, 84 mm and 95 mm. An adhesion layer is generally sputtered onto the disk, followed by a magnetically soft underlayer and a lamination layer. The magnetically soft underlayer may be a material such as Fe—Co—B, Co—Zr, Co—Zr—Cr, Co—Zr—Nb, Co—Ta—Zr, Co—Fe—Zr and Fe—Ta—C. The under layer is deposited to a thickness in the range from about 500 Å to about 1,000 Å. The lamination layer, sputtered onto the magnetically soft underlayer, is usually a metal (e.g., Ta or Ag) and is deposited to a thickness in the range from about 10 Å to about 100 Å, preferably about 25 Å. The magnetically soft underlayer and the lamination layer may be deposited in series several times, namely two to three times. That is, there may by 1-3 layers of the bilayer laminate consisting a magnetically soft underlayer and a wetting layer. The aforementioned layers are generally deposited perpendicular to the disk.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The disk is further processed by depositing recording media including a template layer and a magnetic alloy layer containing tilted grains and tilted texture or containing perpendicularly-oriented grains and tilted texture. In any case, the tilt symmetry can be provided by embodiments of the invention. The template layer is deposited to the soft underlayer and controls the crystal orientation for the forthcoming deposition of the magnetic alloy layer. The control of crystal orientation is due to lattice matching of the under and over layers (i.e., the soft underlayer and magnetic alloy layers). The template layer also incorporates the tilt angle which the magnetic alloy layer will inherit. A template layer can include an amorphous layer and a crystalline layer. The amorphous layer includes a metal layer, such as an Fe—Co—B soft magnetic layer, sputtered to a thickness in the range from about 500 Å to about 1,000 Å, preferably about 800 Å. Amorphous layers also include other metal layers, such as Fe, Fe-alloys, Co, Co-alloys and combinations thereof. The crystalline layer includes a metal layer, such as ruthenium or ruthenium alloys, sputtered to the disk to a thickness in the range from about 50 Å to about 300 Å, preferably about 100 Å. The crystalline layer is grown with small grain size of about 6 nm to about 10 nm. Optionally, a thin layer of a noble metal may be sputtered in between the amorphous and the crystalline layers. The noble metal aids in lattice matching between the two layers. In one example, silver is deposited with a film thickness in the range from about 5 Å to about 200 Å.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The magnetic alloy layer is deposited (e.g., sputtered) to the template layer. Since the template layer has a crystalline top layer, the magnetic alloy layer assumes the desired crystal orientation and takes the existing directional tilt of the template layer. The magnetic alloy layer may be deposited to a film thickness in the range from about 100 Å to about 400 Å, preferably about 200 Å. The magnetic alloy layer may include cobalt and cobalt alloys, such as Co—Pt, Co—Cr, Co—Pt—Cr, Co—Ta, Co—Pt+O<sub>2</sub>, and Co—Pt+SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A protective carbon layer is usually deposited to the magnetic alloy layer. The carbon layer generally includes a mixture of sp2 and sp3 carbon and is deposited to a thickness in the range from about 30 Å to about 50 Å.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Embodiments of the invention are conducted within a process chamber suitable to deposit the various described layers. The process chamber may have many process stations (e.g., 12), such as the Intevac MDP 250B, available from Intevac. Further description of useful apparatuses and methods are described in the commonly assigned, U.S. Pat. No. 6,328,856, incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">For methods utilizing sputter deposition, directionality of the depositing species can be maintained only over a finite distance due to scattering in the ambient inert gas. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the mean free paths of some common gases based on self-scattering calculations, which can be taken as a rough approximation to the scattering of sputtered metal atoms by ambient Ar atoms. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> graphically demonstrates that the mean free path is inversely proportional to the gas pressure. To maximize directionality of the beam, it is desirable to operate at as low a sputtering pressure as possible so as to maximize the mean free path between scattering collisions, and to use a low molecular weight inert gas, e.g., argon or neon. At the lowest practical pressure for conventional magnetron sputtering, about 1 mTorr (10<sup>−3 </sup>Torr) or slightly below, it is seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> that the mean free path is about 10 cm. This puts a rough upper limit on the target-to-substrate distance over which adequate beam directionality can be maintained for the above sputter methods. It also becomes apparent that beam scattering effects may be a function of radial position on the disk surface for certain of the above sputtering methods, which could lead to non-uniformity of film properties. Therefore, the target-to-substrate distance is maintained in the range from about 5 cm to about 50 cm, preferably between about 5 cm and about 15 cm and more preferably at about 10 cm. Also, the chamber pressure is maintained with a pressure in the range from about 10<sup>−4 </sup>Torr to about 10<sup>−2 </sup>Torr, preferably at about 10<sup>−3 </sup>Torr.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Mean free path issues were avoided altogether in the aforementioned embodiment of the invention because an ion beam deposition technique operated in the high vacuum regime. For high throughput production, however, a high deposition rate technique such as evaporation is also practical. Evaporation is also compatible with high vacuum less than 10<sup>−5 </sup>Torr, for which no significant scattering occurs over distances comparable to typical deposition system dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 10B</figref>, apparatuses are utilized for oblique incidence evaporation of materials with suitable apertures to create either radial or circumferential tilt growth symmetry. Materials suited for evaporation methods include Ag, Ru, Co—Cr, Ru—Cr, Ni—Fe and other materials used to deposit template layer. Generally, the evaporation methods operate under a low vacuum (about 10<sup>−5 </sup>Torr) and at or near the melting temperature of the material to be deposited. The evaporation methods form angles of incidence, referenced relative to the plane of disks, in the range from about 30° and about 60°, preferably from about 40° to about 60°. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref> (top view) and <b>9</b>B (side view) illustrate oblique incidence evaporation for radial tilt growth symmetry, single-sided deposition. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows disk <b>90</b> on rotatable disk support <b>92</b>. The evaporation capsule <b>94</b> with orifice <b>95</b> emits deposition material at various trajectories <b>96</b> including perpendicular and non-perpendicular angles with respect to the disk <b>90</b>. Evaporated material with selected trajectories travel through collimator <b>97</b>. A shutter plate <b>91</b> further restricts transmission of a portion of the evaporated material via an aperture <b>93</b>. The aperture <b>93</b> is in fluid communication from the orifice <b>95</b> to the surface of disk <b>90</b>. This process requires rotation of the disk substrate for circumferential uniformity. The relative placement of the evaporation capsule <b>94</b> and the aperture <b>93</b> to the disk <b>90</b> controls the tilt angle and symmetry, i.e., radial.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As illustrated, the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> are suitable for single-sided deposition. It should be apparent, however, that that double-sided single or multiple disk deposition can be accomplished using a multiplicity of evaporation sources and apertures and a disk holders similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
