<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An air intake system for an engine of an outboard motor includes an air intake support member that provides support for other components of the air intake system. The other component of the air intake system that can be supported by the air intake support member include a throttle valve assembly, plenum chambers, and air intake passages. The air intake passages can be made longer to increase engine performance and can be manufactured with less material because the air intake passages do not need to provide support for the air intake system.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on and claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-094863, filed Mar. 31, 2003, the entire contents of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to an air intake system for an engine and, more particularly, to an improved air intake system that increases engine performance and that uses an improved air intake support member.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Watercraft engines typically incorporate an air intake system. Watercraft engines are designed to operate and perform well in a confined environment. The air intake system of a watercraft engine includes a throttle body housing that is usually attached to one end of the intake runners or conduits. The other end of the intake runners is attached to a body of the engine. The length of the intake runners can enhance engine performance throughout various engine speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is common practice for the intake runners of a compact watercraft engine to be supported on one of their ends by the engine body. The other end of each intake runner commonly supports the throttle body housing. The intake runners thus need to be strong enough to support the throttle body and therefore the intake runners commonly are bulky to provide the necessary rigidity and strength. Unfortunately, due to the compact area in which a watercraft engine is positioned and the fact that the throttle bodies are supported by the runners, it is difficult to benefit from longer runners.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, a need exists for an improved air intake system that incorporates intake runners that can be long enough to increase engine performance while maintaining a compact size of the engine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One aspect of the present invention is an engine comprising an engine body and an air intake system. The engine body includes at least one combustion chamber to which the air intake system supplies air through an induction air passage. The air intake system includes an air silencer having an air intake port and a throttle body in communication with the air silencer. An induction air support member is connected to and provides fluid communication between the air silencer and the induction air passage. The induction air support member is attached to the engine body and supports at least the throttle body on the engine body.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the present invention involves an engine comprising an engine body that includes at least one combustion chamber and an air induction system for supplying air to the combustion chamber. The air induction system includes a support member defining at least one flow passage and a flow control device supported by the support member. The flow control device communicates with the flow passage so as to regulate an amount of air flow through the flow passage. A runner communicates with the combustion chamber and with the flow passage of the support member. One end of the runner is supported by the support member and the other end of the runner is supported by the engine body.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a top plan view of an outboard motor <b>10</b> is illustrated. As is well understood in the art, the outboard motor <b>10</b> can include a drive unit and a bracket assembly. The bracket assembly is used to attach the drive unit to an associated watercraft and supports a marine propulsion device, such as, for example, a propeller in a submerged position relative to a surface of a body of water.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, the terms “forward,” “forwardly,” and “front” mean at or to the side labeled “FRONT” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the terms “rear,” “reverse,” “backward,” and “rearward” mean at or to the side labeled “REAR” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, unless indicated otherwise or otherwise readily apparent from the context used. Additionally, the term “horizontally” means that members or components extend generally parallel to the water surface (i.e., generally normal to the direction of gravity) when the outboard motor is positioned in a generally “neutral” trim position (i.e., neither trimmed in or out); a rotational axis of the propulsion device lies generally parallel to the water surface when the outboard motor assumes the neutral trim position. The term “vertically” in turn means that proportions, members or components extend generally normal to those that extend horizontally.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An internal combustion engine <b>28</b> is located within a protective cowling assembly <b>30</b>. The protective cowling assembly <b>30</b> typically defines a generally closed cavity <b>32</b> in which the engine <b>28</b> is disposed. The engine <b>28</b> is thereby is generally protected by the cowling assembly <b>30</b> from environmental elements.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The engine <b>28</b> in the illustrated embodiment preferably operates on a four-cycle combustion principle. With continued reference now <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the engine illustrated is a DOHC (double overhead cam) six-cylinder engine having a V-shaped cylinder block <b>40</b>. The cylinder block <b>40</b> thus defines two cylinder banks <b>41</b>, which lie generally next to each other. In the illustrated arrangement, each cylinder bank <b>41</b> has three cylinder bores such that the cylinder block <b>40</b> has six cylinder bores in total. The cylinder bores of each bank extend generally horizontally and are generally vertically spaced apart from one another. This type of engine, however, merely exemplifies one type of engine. Engines having other numbers of cylinders, having other cylinder arrangements (in line, opposing, etc.), and operating on other combustion principles (e.g., two-stroke or rotary) can be used in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A movable member, such as a reciprocating piston (not shown), moves relative to the cylinder block <b>40</b> in a suitable manner. In the illustrated arrangement, the piston reciprocates within each cylinder bore. Because the cylinder block <b>40</b> is split into the two cylinder banks <b>41</b>, each cylinder bank <b>41</b> extends outward at an angle and terminates at on outer end of the bank <b>41</b>. A pair of cylinder head members <b>42</b> are fixed to the respective outer ends of the cylinder banks to close those ends of the cylinder bores. The cylinder head members <b>42</b> together with the associated pistons and cylinder bores provide six combustion chambers (not shown). Of course, the number of combustion chambers can vary. Each of the cylinder head members <b>42</b> is covered by a cylinder head cover member <b>44</b>. In some arrangements, the cylinder head cover members <b>44</b> can be unitarily formed with the respective cylinder members <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A crankcase member <b>46</b> is coupled with the cylinder block <b>40</b> on the front side of the cylinder block <b>40</b> and a crankcase cover (not shown) is further coupled with a crankcase member <b>46</b>. The crankcase member <b>46</b> and a crankcase cover close the other end of the cylinder bores and, together with the cylinder block <b>40</b>, define a crankcase chamber. A crankshaft <b>50</b> extends generally vertically through the crankcase chamber and is journaled for rotation about a rotational axis by several bearing blocks. Connecting rods couple the crankshaft <b>50</b> with the respective pistons in any suitable manner. Thus, reciprocal movement of the pistons rotates the crankshaft <b>50</b>. In some arrangements, the crankcase cover member can be unitarily formed with the crankcase member <b>46</b>. Thus, the cylinder heads, cylinder block and crankcase member together define at least a portion of a body of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As mentioned above, a driveshaft housing preferably supports a driveshaft, which is coupled with crankshaft <b>50</b> and which extends generally vertically through driveshaft housing. The driveshaft is journaled for rotation and is driven by the crankshaft <b>50</b> via a suitable coupling (preferably a direct coupling).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A lower unit (not shown) depends from the driveshaft housing and supports a propulsion shaft (not shown) that is driven by the driveshaft. A propulsion device is attached to the propulsion shaft. The propulsion device can take the form of a single propeller, a dual counter-rotating propeller system, a hydrodynamic jet, or any of a number of other suitable propulsion devices.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The engine <b>28</b> also comprises an air intake system <b>58</b>. The air intake system <b>58</b> draws air from outside the engine, preferably from within the closed cavity <b>32</b> or an air passage within the cavity <b>32</b>, to the combustion chambers. The illustrated air intake system <b>58</b> comprises six intake passages defined at least in principal part by intake runners or conduits <b>60</b> and a pair of plenum chambers <b>62</b>. In the illustrated arrangement, each cylinder bank communicates with three intake passages <b>60</b> and one plenum chamber <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The most downstream portions of the intake passages <b>60</b> are defined within the cylinder head member <b>42</b> as inner intake passages (not shown). The inner intake passages communicate with the combustion chambers through intake ports, which are formed at inner surfaces of the cylinder head members <b>42</b>. Typically, each of the combustion chambers has one or more intake ports. Intake valves are disposed at each cylinder head member <b>42</b> to move between an open position and a closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The intake valves act to open and close the ports to control the flow of air into the combustion chamber. Biasing members, such as springs, are used to urge the intake valves toward their respective closed positions by acting between a mounting boss formed on each cylinder head member <b>42</b> and a corresponding retainer that is affixed to each of the valves. When each intake valve is in the open position, the inner intake passage thus associated with the intake port communicates with the associated combustion chamber. Of course, other types of valve actuating mechanisms (e.g., hydraulic or electric) can be used to control the amount and timing of air flow into the combustion chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The air within the closed cavity <b>32</b> is drawn into the plenum chamber <b>62</b>. The air expands within the plenum chamber <b>62</b> to reduce pulsations and then enters the intake runners <b>60</b>. The air passes through the intake runner <b>60</b> and flows into the inner intake passages located in each cylinder head member <b>42</b>. A throttle valve <b>70</b> mounted inside a throttle valve assembly <b>72</b> regulates the amount of airflow allowed to enter the plenum chamber <b>62</b> and ultimately into the intake passages <b>60</b>; however, other types of flow control devices can be used as well to regulate air flow to the engine. These and other components of the air intake system <b>58</b> will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The engine <b>28</b> further includes an exhaust system that routes burnt charges, i.e., exhaust gases, to a location outside of the outboard motor <b>10</b>. Each cylinder head member <b>42</b> defines exhaust passages (not shown) that communicate with the combustion chambers through one or more exhaust ports, which can be defined at the inner surfaces of the respective cylinder head members <b>42</b>. The exhaust ports can be selectively opened and closed by exhaust valves. The construction of each exhaust valve and the arrangement of the exhaust valves are substantially the same as the intake valve and the arrangement thereof, respectively. Thus, further description of these components is deemed unnecessary. Additionally, the valve actuation mechanism used to control the timing and duration of exhaust valve movement preferably is of the same type used to actuate the intake valves.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Exhaust manifolds preferably are defined generally vertically with the cylinder block <b>40</b> between the cylinder bores of both the cylinder banks <b>41</b>. The exhaust manifolds communicate with the combustion chambers through the inner exhaust passages and the exhaust ports to collect the exhaust gas therefrom. The exhaust manifolds are coupled with an exhaust discharge passage (not shown). When the exhaust ports are opened, the combustion chambers communicate with the exhaust discharge passage through the exhaust manifolds.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the illustrated embodiment, a valve cam mechanism preferably is provided for actuating the intake and exhaust valves in each cylinder bank. In the embodiment shown, the valve cam mechanism includes second rotatable members such as a pair of camshafts disposed in the cylinder head <b>42</b> of each cylinder bank <b>41</b>. The camshafts typically comprise intake and exhaust camshafts that extend generally vertically and are journaled for rotation generally between the cylinder head members <b>42</b> and the cylinder head cover members <b>44</b>. The camshafts have cam lobes (not shown) to push the respective ends of the intake and exhaust valves in any suitable manner. The cam lobes repeatedly push the valves in a timely manner in proportion to the engine speed. The engine can also include a variable valve timing mechanism. In one form of such a mechanism, a hydraulic actuator can cooperate with one or more of the cam shafts to adjust valve timing, as well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The camshaft drive mechanism <b>76</b> preferably is provided for driving the valve cam mechanism. The camshaft drive mechanism <b>76</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and includes driven sprockets <b>80</b> positioned atop at least one of each pair of camshafts, a drive sprocket <b>82</b> positioned atop the crankshaft <b>50</b> and a flexible transmitter, such as a timing belt or chain <b>84</b>. The flexible transmitter is wound around the driven sprockets <b>80</b> and the drive sprocket <b>82</b>. The crankshaft <b>50</b> thus drives the respective camshaft through the time belt <b>84</b> in the timed relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The illustrated engine <b>28</b> can further include indirect, port or intake passage fuel injection, or the engine can also be carbureted. The fuel injection system (not shown) can include at least six fuel injectors with at least one fuel injector allotted to each one of the respective combustion chambers. In one form, the fuel injectors can spray fuel into the intake passages <b>60</b> under control of an electronic control unit (ECU, not shown). The ECU controls the initiation and duration of the fuel injection cycle of each fuel injector so that the fuel injectors spray a desired amount of fuel for each combustion cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The engine <b>28</b> further includes an ignition system. Each combustion chamber is provided with a spark plug (not shown) or another type of igniter, preferably disposed between the intake and exhaust valves. The spark plugs generate a spark between electrodes to ignite an air/fuel charge in the combustion chamber according to desired ignition timing maps or other forms of controls.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Generally, during an intake stroke, air is drawn into the combustion chambers through the air intake passages <b>60</b> and fuel is sprayed into the air by the fuel injectors. The mixture is then compressed during the compression stroke. Just prior to a power stroke, the respective spark plugs ignite the compressed air/fuel charge in the respective combustion chambers. The air/fuel charge thus rapidly burns during the power stroke to move the pistons. The burnt charge, i.e., exhaust gases, then is discharged from the combustion chambers during an exhaust stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The illustrated engine further comprises a lubrication system to lubricate the moving parts within the engine <b>28</b>. The lubrication system is a pressure fed system where the correct pressure is important to adequately lubricate the bearings and other rotating surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The flywheel assembly <b>88</b>, which is schematically illustrated with phantom line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, preferably is positioned atop the crankshaft <b>50</b> and is positioned for rotation with the crankshaft <b>50</b>. The flywheel assembly <b>88</b> advantageously includes a flywheel magneto that supplies electric power directly or indirectly via a battery to various electrical components, such as to the fuel injection system, the ignition system and the ECU.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The engine <b>28</b> may include other systems, mechanisms, devices, accessories, and components other than those described above such as, for example, a cooling system and a starter motor. The crankshaft <b>50</b> can directly or indirectly drive at least some of those systems, mechanisms, devices, accessories, and components. For example, the crankshaft can drive a water pump of an open-loop cooling system via the driveshaft, as well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The air intake system <b>58</b> will now be described in greater detail. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the air intake system <b>58</b> includes an air intake support member <b>94</b> that supports the plenum chambers <b>62</b>, the corresponding intake runners <b>60</b>, and the throttle valve assembly <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the illustrated embodiment, which is best seen with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>, air enters the air intake system <b>58</b> through an intake opening <b>98</b> of an intake channel <b>96</b>. The intake opening <b>98</b> is disposed near the bottom of the engine <b>28</b> in the illustrated embodiment. The intake channel <b>96</b> is connected to a protruding member <b>100</b> (which is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that communicates with and can be formed with a side portion <b>102</b> of an intake silencer <b>106</b>. The intake silencer <b>106</b> guides the inducted air to the throttle valve assembly <b>72</b> where the throttle valve <b>70</b> regulates the amount of air flowing through the throttle valve assembly <b>72</b>. Heat from the engine, which rises to the top of the protective cowling <b>30</b>, allows for cooler, denser air to be drawn into the air intake system. The inducted intake air is guided into an air intake support member <b>94</b> after passing through the throttle valve assembly <b>72</b>. The air flows from the air intake support member <b>94</b> to each plenum chamber <b>62</b>. Pulsations from the inducted air are reduced in the plenum chambers <b>62</b> and the air flows into the respective intake air passages <b>60</b>. While the illustrated embodiment employs one intake silencer <b>106</b> and one intake opening <b>98</b>, a plurality of intake silencers and/or a plurality of intake openings can be used with the present induction system.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As best understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>, the throttle valve assembly <b>72</b> is mounted to the air intake support member <b>94</b> through a throttle mounting seat <b>108</b>. Preferably, the throttle valve <b>70</b> is a butterfly valve that has a valve shaft journaled for pivotal movement about generally horizontal axis. A control linkage is connected to an operational member, such as a throttle lever, that is provided on the watercraft or otherwise proximate the operator of the watercraft. The operator can control the opening degree of the throttle valve in accordance with operator request through the control linkage. That is, the throttle valve assembly <b>72</b> can measure or regulate amounts of air that flow through intake passages <b>60</b> through the combustion chambers in response to the operation of the operational member by the operator. Normally, the greater the opening degree, the higher the rate of air-flow and the higher the engine speed. While the illustrated embodiment employs only a single throttle valve, the intake system can use a plurality of throttle valves that operate in parallel to regulate air flow into the plenum chambers. The chambers, in this arrangement, can be isolated from each other or can communicate with each other (such as, for example, via the intake support member) to balance air pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b>, recesses <b>110</b> are formed in each plenum chamber <b>62</b> to allow sufficient space to mount each plenum chamber <b>62</b> to the intake support member <b>94</b>. The intake silencer incorporates protrusions <b>114</b> (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 8</figref>) to take advantage of the spaces formed by the recesses <b>110</b> allowing improved intake air noise reduction and efficient use of space in the compact closed cavity <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The respective intake runners <b>60</b> extend forwardly along side surfaces of the engine <b>28</b> on both the port side and the starboard side from the respective cylinder head members <b>42</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the intake runners <b>60</b> terminate generally at the front of the crankcase <b>46</b>. The intake runners <b>60</b> on the same side extend generally parallel to each other and are vertically spaced apart from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The respective plenum chambers <b>62</b> are connected with each other through the air intake support member <b>94</b> which substantially equalizes the internal pressures within each chamber <b>62</b>. The plenum chambers <b>62</b> coordinate or smooth air delivered to each intake passage <b>60</b> and also act as silencers to reduce intake noise.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the air intake support member <b>94</b> is advantageously mounted to a mounting member <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) through fasteners <b>118</b> that can be attached to the mounting member <b>116</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the fasteners <b>118</b> are bolts that thread into threaded holes (not shown) formed on the mounting member <b>116</b>. Of course, other types of fasteners can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The mounting member <b>116</b> is preferably incorporated into the crankcase cover or the front portion of the engine <b>28</b>. By mounting the air intake support member <b>94</b> to the mounting member <b>116</b> located on the front side portion of the engine <b>28</b>, the air intake support member <b>94</b> is able to advantageously support the throttle valve assembly <b>72</b> and the air runners <b>60</b>. Supporting the air runners <b>60</b> by the air intake support member <b>94</b> allows the air passages to be longer, which can improve engine performance. By having both ends of the air intake runners <b>60</b> supported on the engine, the air intake runners <b>60</b> themselves can be less rigid than in prior induction system designs, therefore using less material so that the air intake runners <b>60</b> can be made more compact and use less space. The saved space due to the compact air intake runners <b>60</b> improves the overall compact design of the engine <b>28</b> that is positioned within the compact closed cavity <b>32</b>. The weight of the engine <b>28</b> is also reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The air intake support member <b>94</b> includes a support member cavity or flow passage <b>122</b> that allows fluid communication between each air intake passage <b>60</b> and the throttle valve <b>70</b>. The communication between the plenum chambers <b>62</b> allows intake pulsations between each plenum chamber <b>62</b> to increase the volumetric efficiency of the engine, which can lead to an increase in engine performance and to generally smooth engine operation. Each plenum chamber <b>62</b> is mounted to the air intake support member <b>94</b> through fasteners <b>124</b> that can be attached to the air intake support member <b>94</b>. The fasteners <b>124</b> preferably are bolts that thread into threaded holes <b>126</b> located in the air intake support member <b>94</b>; however, other types of fasteners can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an exploded perspective view of the air intake system <b>58</b> including the air intake runners <b>60</b>, the plenum chambers <b>62</b>, the intake silencer <b>106</b>, the throttle valve assembly <b>72</b>, and the air intake support member <b>94</b> along with other air intake system components. A molded structure system <b>130</b> is preferably incorporated into the back side of the air intake support member <b>94</b>. The molded structure system <b>130</b> strengthens the air intake support member <b>94</b>. The strengthening provided by the molded structure system <b>130</b> allows the air intake support member to provide enhanced support for the plenum chambers <b>62</b> and the air intake runners <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Each component when assembled together, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, forms the compact air intake system <b>58</b> that fits inside the compact closed cavity <b>32</b>. (The assembled air intake system <b>58</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the air intake system <b>58</b> without the throttle valve assembly <b>72</b> to better illustrate a throttle communication port <b>132</b> that allows fluid communication between the air intake silencer <b>106</b> and the throttle valve <b>70</b>.) The induction air travels from the air intake silencer <b>106</b> through the throttle communication port <b>132</b> to be regulated by the throttle <b>70</b> before entering into the air intake support member <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the air intake silencer <b>106</b> in greater detail. The unique form of the air intake silencer <b>106</b> allows for a compact fit of the air intake silencer <b>106</b> with the other components of the air intake system <b>58</b> so as to fit advantageously within the compact closed cavity <b>32</b>. The induction air enters the air intake silencer <b>106</b> through the protruding member <b>100</b> and travels through the side portion <b>102</b> through the angled structure of the air intake silencer <b>106</b> to the protrusions <b>114</b>. The induction air further travels through the protrusions <b>114</b> and enters into the throttle assembly <b>72</b> that is mounted to the air intake support member <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a side elevational view of the plenum chamber <b>62</b> and the air intake runners <b>60</b>. The induction air travels from the throttle assembly <b>72</b> through the throttle <b>70</b> into the plenum chamber <b>62</b>. The induction air travels from the plenum chamber <b>62</b> to the air intake runners <b>60</b> to the engine <b>28</b>. An attachment boss <b>134</b> allows the plenum chamber <b>62</b> and the air intake runners <b>60</b> to be further attached and supported by the air intake support member <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the entire air intake system <b>58</b> compactly assembled to fit inside the compact closed cavity <b>32</b>. Each member of the air intake system <b>58</b> is preferably assembled to efficiently utilize all the space provided within the compact closed cavity <b>32</b> of the outboard motor <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> illustrate another embodiment of the present induction system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates another air intake system <b>138</b> that includes another form of the air intake support member <b>94</b>. The air intake support member <b>94</b> is shown supporting two plenum chambers <b>140</b> and two sets of air intake runners <b>142</b> of an inline engine <b>146</b>. The air intake support member <b>94</b> is able to advantageously support a throttle valve assembly <b>148</b> and the air intake runners <b>142</b>. Supporting the plenum chambers <b>140</b> and air intake runners <b>142</b> by the air intake support member <b>94</b> allows the air intake runners <b>142</b> to be longer and lighter because the air intake runners <b>60</b> do not need to be designed to support the weight of the throttle valve assembly <b>72</b>. The longer air intake runners <b>142</b> can allow for an increase in volumetric efficiency improving engine performance. Supporting the plenum chambers <b>140</b> and the air intake runners <b>142</b> also allow the air intake runners to be less rigid, therefore the air intake runners <b>142</b> require less space. The saved space due to the compact air intake runners <b>60</b> improves the overall compact design of the inline engine that can be positioned within a compact engine compartment.</p>

Induction air enters the intake air silencer <b>150</b> through an inlet <b>152</b>.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Although the present invention has been described in terms of a certain preferred embodiments, other embodiments apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art also are within the scope of this invention. Thus, various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
