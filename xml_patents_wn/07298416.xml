<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a photographing apparatus connected to another electronic device and power supply method.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The USB (Universal Serial Bus) Standard has come into widespread use as an interface standard for communication between a personal computer and its peripheral equipment connected thereto. The USB Standard was worked out by a plurality of business companies and has come to be released to the public. For example when connection is made between a personal computer and a photographing apparatus such as a digital camera according to this USB Standard, the personal computer works as a host machine, while the digital camera as peripheral equipment acts as a slave. The personal computer as a host provides power required for communications between two pieces of equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To supplement the USB Standard, the USB OTG (On The Go) Standard for connection among pieces of peripheral equipment is established. According to the OTG Standard, peripheral equipment working merely as a slave under the USB Standard is provided with the functions of a host. This allows the peripheral equipment to be connected with other peripheral equipment without the aid of a personal computer, whereby communications are established among different pieces of peripheral equipment. For example, when a digital camera is used as peripheral equipment functioning as a host, image data can be transferred to the printer for printing by connection between the digital camera and a printer, the image data can be recorded into the storage apparatus of the PDA by connection between the digital camera and a PDA, or the network can be accessed by connection between the digital camera and cellular phone, so that image data can be sent directly from the digital camera.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When peripheral equipment is connected to another piece of peripheral equipment, one of them functions as a host while the other works as a slave, so power required for communications is supplied from the host to the slave. Accordingly, when the digital camera is used as a host for example, power required for communications is supplied from the digital camera.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Problems to be Solved by the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the power supply method in a prior art photographing apparatus, however, if a digital camera is used as a host for example, power for communications is continuously supplied to the peripheral equipment throughout the operation of the digital camera even when there is no communication with the connected peripheral equipment. This has led to waste of digital camera power supply. A digital camera normally uses a battery to supply power, and waste of power has raised the problem of an ineffective use of the battery power.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, the object of the present invention is to provide a photographing apparatus that ensures an effective supply of power for communications carried out by connection between pieces of peripheral equipment.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The following shows the operation of the present embodiment:</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The following description is based on the assumption that the program for processing described in the following flow chart is stored in the memory <b>4</b> in the form of a program code that can be read by the control section <b>3</b> of the digital camera <b>100</b>, and the control section <b>3</b> sequentially performs the operations in response to the program code.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart representing the processing of power supply carried out by the control section <b>3</b> of the digital camera <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a connection detection signal is sent to the control section <b>3</b> from the OTG connector <b>11</b>. Upon detecting the connection of the communications cable <b>20</b> (Step S<b>1</b>; YES), decision is made to see if the photographing operation is performed or not (Step <b>2</b>). When the photographing operation is performed (Step S<b>2</b>), the control section <b>3</b> provides control in such a way that power is not supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b> (Step S<b>3</b>), and terminates the processing of power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the photographing operation is not performed (Step S<b>2</b>; NO), the control section <b>3</b> checks if an image is being displayed or not (Step <b>4</b>). If it is currently being displayed (Step S<b>4</b>; YES), the control section <b>3</b> provides control in such a way that power is supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b>, and terminates the processing of power supply. Further, if an image is not being displayed (Step <b>4</b>; NO), the control section <b>3</b> provides control in such a way that power is supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b> (Step S<b>6</b>). It also allows image data to be displayed on the display section <b>7</b> (Step S<b>7</b>), and terminates the processing of power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to the first embodiment, when the digital camera <b>100</b> comprising a host function is connected with peripheral equipment through a communications cable <b>20</b> to transfer data between them, detection is made to check that the communications cable <b>20</b> for connection with the peripheral equipment is connected. If the digital camera <b>100</b> is currently in the mode of photographing operation, power is not supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b>. If the digital camera <b>100</b> is not in the mode of photographing operation, power is supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b>, and, at the same time, image data is displayed on the display section <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Accordingly, when the digital camera <b>100</b> as a host is connected to peripheral equipment, power is not supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b> in the photographing operation mode where data communication is not performed, thereby ensuring an effective use of the power of the digital camera <b>100</b> and reducing the power for communications. Further, before the start of data communication with peripheral equipment, the image data to be sent is displayed on the display section <b>7</b>. This allows the user to perform data communications while checking the image data on the display section <b>7</b>, with the result that the convenience of custom is greatly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The operation of the digital camera <b>100</b> given in the aforementioned processing of power supply is only an example, and should not be considered as being restricted thereto. For example, the first embodiment is arranged in such a way that power is supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b> if the connection of the communications cable <b>20</b> is detected while an image appears on the display. Without being restricted to this arrangement, however, it is possible to make arrangement in such a way that power is not supplied when connection of the communications cable <b>20</b> has been detected with an image appearing on the display, and is supplied when the instruction has been entered to print out the image appearing on the display section <b>7</b>. Namely, when the print button has been pressed to enter the printing instruction while an image is displayed, the digital camera <b>100</b> supplies power to the communications cable <b>20</b> to which the printer is connected. At the same time, the displayed image data to be printed is sent to a printer through the communications cable <b>20</b>, and is printed out by the printer. This allows the power for communications to be supplied immediately when communications start instruction is entered, and eliminates the waste of power, thereby making a significant contribution to power saving of the digital camera <b>100</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The following describes the second embodiment of the present invention:</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The digital camera <b>200</b> in the second embodiment is arranged in almost the same configuration as the digital camera <b>100</b> in the first embodiment. The portions having the same configuration as those of the first embodiment will be assigned with the same reference numerals in the drawings. They will not be described to avoid duplication.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the first place the following describes the configuration:</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a drawing representing the external configuration of the digital camera <b>200</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the digital camera <b>200</b> consists of a digital camera <b>100</b>, plus a selector switch <b>6</b><i>a </i>for selecting the communications mode or camera mode. Either the communications mode or camera mode can be selected by selecting this selector switch <b>6</b><i>a </i>to a predetermined position and locking it thereon, whereby photographing processing or communications processing can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">When the equipment to be connected is a slave, i.e. when the digital camera <b>200</b> works as a host, the peripheral equipment linked to the OTG connector <b>11</b> has a host connector that is electrically linked to the identification terminal <b>11</b><i>e </i>of the OTG connector <b>11</b>. When the equipment to be connected is a host i.e. when the digital camera <b>200</b> works as a slave, the equipment to be connected has a slave connector that is not electrically linked to the identification terminal <b>11</b><i>e </i>of the OTG connector <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In other words, the OTG connector <b>11</b> sends to the control section <b>3</b> the connection detection signal containing the information on the presence or absence of the identification terminal <b>11</b><i>e</i>. Depending on the connection state of the identification terminal <b>11</b><i>e</i>, the control section <b>3</b> checks if the host function or slave function is requested. In the following description, “communications cable <b>20</b><i>a</i>” signifies a communications cable to be connected when the digital camera <b>200</b> works as a host, while “communications cable <b>20</b><i>b</i>” signifies a communications cable to be connected when the digital camera <b>200</b> works as a slave. “Communications cable <b>20</b>” means either one of them.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further, the control section <b>3</b> performs processing of power supply <b>2</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) to be described later as the processing characteristic of the second embodiment. When performing processing of power supply <b>2</b>, the control section <b>3</b> checks whether or not the connected peripheral equipment requires the host function in response to the connection state of the identification terminal <b>11</b><i>e</i>, if connection of the communications cable <b>20</b> has been detected by the OTG connector <b>11</b> when the communications mode is selected by the selector switch <b>6</b>. If the connected peripheral equipment requires the host function, i.e. when the peripheral equipment is a slave with a host connector linked thereto, the control section <b>3</b> functions as a host and supplies power to the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When the control section <b>3</b> has started to supply power to the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a</i>, it conducts negotiation to be predetermined through exchange of information on communications conditions, etc. between the connected pieces of equipment and checks whether or not the connected equipment is enabled for communications. Here the connected equipment is not enabled for communications in the following cases where; (1) the connected equipment is a mouse, keyboard or the like not equipped with a driver, (2) the power consumption of the equipment exceeds the predetermined level, or (3) the connected equipment is disabled by a trouble or power interruption. If the connected equipment is not enabled for communications, the control section <b>3</b> allows an alarm such as an error message to be displayed on the display section <b>7</b>, and turns off the power of the digital camera <b>200</b> after the lapse of a predetermined time.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">If the connected equipment is enabled for communication, the control section <b>3</b> further checks whether or not the connected equipment is a printer. If it is a printer, the image data is shown on the display section <b>7</b> prior to starting communications.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The following describes the operation of the present second embodiment:</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart representing power supply processing <b>2</b> carried out by the control section <b>3</b> of the digital camera <b>200</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the control section <b>3</b> checks whether or not the communications mode is selected by the selector switch <b>6</b><i>aa </i>(Step S<b>11</b>). If the communication mode is selected (Step S<b>11</b>; YES), it checks whether or not the connection has been detected by the OTG connector <b>11</b> (Step S<b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">When the connection of the communications cable <b>20</b> has been detected by the OTG connector <b>11</b> (Step S<b>12</b>; YES), the control section <b>3</b> checks whether or not the host function is requested, depending on the connection state of the identification terminal <b>11</b><i>e</i>. If the host function is requested (Step S<b>13</b>; YES), i.e. if the connected equipment is a slave, the control section <b>3</b> controls the power supply unit <b>8</b> to supply power to the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>(Step S<b>14</b>) and starts negotiation with the connected equipment (Step S<b>15</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Then the control section <b>3</b> checks whether or not the connected equipment is enabled for communication by negotiation (Step S<b>16</b>). If the connected equipment is enabled for communications (Step S<b>16</b>; YE), the control section <b>3</b> checks whether or not this equipment is a printer (Step S<b>17</b>). If the equipment is not a printer (Step S<b>17</b>; NO), it terminates the processing of power supply <b>2</b>. If the equipment is a printer (Step S<b>17</b>; YES), the control section <b>3</b> allows the image data to be displayed on the display section <b>7</b> (Step S<b>18</b>), and terminates the processing of power supply <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">If the connected equipment is not enabled for communications (Step S<b>16</b>; NO), the control section <b>3</b> allows the warning to be displayed on the display section <b>7</b> (Step S<b>19</b>). A predetermined time after display of the warning (Step S<b>20</b>; YES), the drive power of the digital camera <b>100</b> is turned off (Step S<b>21</b>) and the processing of power supply <b>2</b> terminates.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further, if the communications mode is not selected (Step S<b>11</b>; NO), the communications cable <b>20</b> is not connected to the OTG connector <b>11</b> (Step S<b>12</b>; NO) or host function is not requested from the connected equipment (Step S<b>13</b>; NO), then the control section <b>3</b> terminates the processing of power supply <b>2</b> without supplying power to the communications cable <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As described above, in the second embodiment the digital camera <b>200</b> comprises a selector switch <b>6</b><i>a </i>for selecting either the communications mode for communications processing or camera mode for photographing. When the communications mode is selected, the communications cable <b>20</b> is connected to the OTG connector <b>11</b> and the host function is requested, then power is supplied to the connected communications cable <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Thus, only when enabled for communications with the connected equipment, power is supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b> to perform communication. This approach eliminates unnecessary power supply and minimizes power consumption of the digital camera <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Negotiation is conducted with the connected equipment. Power supply is continued if the connected equipment is enabled for communications. If the connected equipment is enabled for communications and is a printer, power supply is continued, and at the same time, image data is displayed on the display section <b>7</b>. Then the image data exchanged between pieces of equipment can be shown on the display section <b>7</b> prior to starting communications. This allows the user to check the image data easily, with the result that the convenience of the user is greatly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">If the connected equipment is not enabled for communications, a warning message is given on the display section <b>7</b> and the drive power of the digital camera <b>100</b> is turned off after the lapse of a predetermined time. When the connected equipment is not enabled for communications, this arrangement calls attention of the user in such a way as to ensure immediate disconnection or immediate recover of the connected equipment, thereby permitting immediate solution of the trouble.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When the communications mode is not selected, the communications cable <b>20</b> is not selected to OTG connector <b>11</b> or a host function is not requested, then the control section <b>3</b> does not allow power to be sent to the communications cable <b>20</b>. If power supply is not required, this arrangement stops supply of power from the digital camera <b>200</b>, thereby ensuring an effective use of the power of the digital camera <b>200</b> and reducing the power.</p>

If the camera mode is not selected (Step S<b>42</b>; NO), for example, if processing of image data display is going on, the system proceeds to Step S<b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">If the camera mode is not selected by the selector switch <b>6</b><i>b </i>(Step <b>31</b>; NO), the control section <b>3</b> checks if the host mode is selected or not (Step S<b>32</b>). If the host mode is not selected (Step S<b>32</b>; NO), i.e. if the slave mode is selected, the control section <b>3</b> provides control in such a way that power is not supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b> (Step S<b>45</b>), and terminates the processing of power supply <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">If the host mode is selected (Step S<b>32</b>; YES), the control section <b>3</b> checks if the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>is connected to the host connector or not. If the communications cable (USB cable) <b>20</b><i>a </i>is not connected to the host connector <b>12</b> (Step S<b>33</b>; NO), the control section <b>3</b> checks if the communications cable (USB cable) <b>20</b><i>b </i>is connected to the slave connector <b>13</b> or not (Step S<b>43</b>). If the communications cable <b>20</b><i>b </i>is connected to the slave connector <b>13</b> (Step S<b>43</b>; YES), the control section <b>3</b> issues a warning signal to the display section <b>7</b> (Step S<b>44</b>), and at the same time, provides control in such a way that power is not supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b><i>b </i>(Step S<b>45</b>), thereby terminating the processing of power supply <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">When the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>is connected to the host connector <b>12</b> (Step S<b>33</b>; YES), the control section <b>3</b> provides control in such a way that power is not supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>(Step S<b>34</b>), and at the same time, allows image data to be displayed on the display section <b>7</b> (Step S<b>35</b>). Further, the control section <b>3</b> starts communications with the equipment connected through the host connector <b>12</b> (Step S<b>36</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Then the control section <b>3</b> checks if the communications cable <b>20</b><i>b </i>is connected to the slave connector <b>13</b> (Step S<b>37</b>). If the communications cable <b>20</b><i>b </i>is connected to the slave connector <b>13</b> (Step S<b>37</b>; YES), the control section <b>3</b> checks if communications are exchanged with the equipment connected through the host connector <b>12</b> (Step S<b>38</b>). If there is no communication, (Step S<b>38</b>; NO), the control section <b>3</b> provides control in such a way that power is not supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>(Step <b>40</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">If communications are exchanged with the equipment connected through the host connector <b>12</b> (Step S<b>38</b>; YES), the control section <b>3</b> checks if the communication has terminated or not (Step S<b>39</b>). If the communication has terminated (Step <b>39</b>; YES), the control section <b>3</b> provides control to stop supply of power to the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>(Step S<b>40</b>). The control section <b>3</b> allows communications with the equipment connected through the slave connector <b>13</b>, and terminates the processing of power supply <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As described above, according to the third embodiment, the digital camera <b>300</b> is provided with a selector switch <b>6</b><i>b </i>for selection among the camera mode, host mode and slave mode, a host connector <b>12</b> for connection with slave equipment, and a slave connector <b>12</b> for connection with host equipment. This permits the mode to be set in conformity to the purpose of use of the digital camera <b>300</b>. At the same time, when connected with equipment to exchange communications, the equipment is connected through the connector in conformity to the requested function. This arrangement permits power to be supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>only when necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Accordingly, for example when the camera mode is selected by the selector switch <b>6</b><i>a </i>or the slave mode is selected, the control section <b>3</b> does not allow power to be supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a</i>, thereby eliminating unnecessary power consumption. Power is not supplied when the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>is not connected to the host connector <b>12</b> even when the host mode is selected, or when there is no communication even when the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>is connected. This arrangement reduces power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">A warning signal is displayed on the display section <b>7</b> if the communications cable <b>20</b><i>b </i>is connected to the slave connector <b>13</b> when the host mode is selected, or if communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>is connected to the host connector <b>12</b> when the slave mode is selected. This arrangement calls attention of the user to start immediate communication. When the host mode is selected and power supply to the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>has started, image data is displayed on the display section <b>7</b>. This allows easy checking of the image data to be sent, and permits communication with the connected equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The operation of the digital camera <b>300</b> given in the aforementioned processing of power supply <b>3</b> shows only an example without being restricted thereto. For example, if the communications cable <b>20</b><i>b </i>is connected through the slave connector <b>13</b> while power is supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>connected through the host connector <b>12</b>, supply of power is suspended after confirming the termination of communication with the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a</i>. Instead of this arrangement, it is also possible to use the arrangement where supply of power and communication is stopped in the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>when the communications cable <b>20</b><i>b </i>is connected through the slave connector <b>13</b>, and to start communication with the communications cable <b>20</b><i>b</i>. In other words, priority is given to the case where the digital camera <b>300</b> works as a slave, thereby reducing the power consumption of the digital camera <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">It is also possible to adopt the arrangement where power is not supplied to the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>if there is communication going on with the communications cable <b>20</b><i>b </i>through the slave connector <b>13</b> when the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>is connected through the host connector <b>12</b>. This arrangement does not allow power to be supplied while there is communication with the communications cable <b>20</b><i>b </i>even when the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>has been connected through the slave connector <b>13</b>. So it eliminates unnecessary supply of power and minimizes power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">It is also possible to use the arrangement where power is supplied to the host connector <b>12</b> when the communications cable <b>20</b> is not connected to the host connector <b>12</b> or slave connector <b>13</b>. This approach does not allow the power to be supplied to the slave connector <b>13</b> when the communications cable <b>20</b> is not connected. Thus, this arrangement eliminates unnecessary power supply and minimizes power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">When the host mode is selected and the communications cable <b>20</b><i>a </i>is connected through the host connector <b>12</b>, power is supplied and the image data is shown on the display section <b>7</b>. It is also possible to use the arrangement, for example, wherein the displayed image is deleted when the slave mode has been selected by the selector switch <b>6</b><i>b</i>. In other words, when the digital camera <b>300</b> works as a slave, image data can be displayed on the equipment that works as a host. This approach minimizes the use of display section <b>7</b> of the digital camera <b>300</b>, and saves the drive power of the digital camera <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">It is also possible to use the arrangement provided with a battery remaining charge detector (not illustrated) to detect the remaining charge of the battery provided on a power source <b>8</b>; it detects the remaining charge of the battery when a host mode is selected by the selector switch <b>6</b><i>b</i>, and a warning is given on the display section <b>7</b> if the remaining battery charge is below a predetermined level, thereby ensuring that the digital camera <b>300</b> does not work as a host. When the remaining battery chage of the digital camera <b>300</b> is insufficient, this arrangement permits priority to be given to the drive processing of the digital camera <b>300</b>. At the same time, the user is immediately notified of the shortage of battery remaining chage, with the result that the convenience of the user is much improved.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Further, it is apparent that the detailed configuration and operations of the component parts of the digital cameras <b>100</b> through <b>300</b> in the first through third embodiments can be modified as appropriate without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The present invention provides a photographing apparatus that exchanges data communications with peripheral equipment connected via a communications cable and supplies power thereto, wherein, in conformity to the function required by connected peripheral equipment, decision is made to determine whether or not power should be supplied to the communications cable. Only when necessary, power for communication is supplied to the communications cable, thereby reducing the unwanted power consumption and ensuring an effective use of the power source of the photographing apparatus.</p>
