<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The instant application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/728,910, filed Dec. 8, 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,924,561, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to systems and methods for creating static random access memory (SRAM) using shadow implanting techniques.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The escalating demands for high density and performance associated with ultra large scale integration semiconductor devices require design features, such as gate lengths, below 100 nanometers (nm), high reliability, and increased manufacturing throughput. The reduction of design features below 100 nm challenges the limitations of conventional methodology.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Double-gate MOSFETs represent devices that are candidates for succeeding existing planar MOSFETs. In double-gate MOSFETs, the use of two gates to control the channel significantly suppresses short-channel effects. A FinFET is a double-gate structure that includes a channel formed in a vertical fin. Although a double-gate structure, the FinFET is similar to existing planar MOSFETs in layout and fabrication techniques. The FinFET also provides a range of channel lengths, CMOS compatibility, and large packing density compared to other double-gate structures.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Implementations consistent with the principles of the invention use shadow implanting of tightly spaced FinFET devices to produce high-density SRAM cells. Utilization of shadowed N/P implants permits reduction of SRAM cell size by approximately 40-50%.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect consistent with the principles of the invention, a method of doping fins of a semiconductor device that includes a substrate is provided. The method may include forming multiple fin structures on the substrate, each of the fin structures including a cap formed on a fin. The method may further include performing a first tilt angle implant process to dope a first pair of the multiple fin structures with n-type impurities and performing a second tilt angle implant process to dope a second pair of the multiple fin structures with p-type impurities.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a further aspect, a method may include forming a first fin and a second fin substantially parallel to one another, the first fin and the second fin having a first width and being located a first distance from one another. The method may further include forming a third fin and a fourth fin substantially parallel to one another, the third and fourth fin having the first width and being located a second distance from one another, where the second fin and the third fin are formed substantially parallel to one another and located a third distance from one another and where the third distance is greater than the first distance and the second distance. The method may also include forming a cap on each of the first, second, third and fourth fins. The method may additionally include implanting, at a first tilt angle, first vertical surfaces of the first and third fins with n-type impurities and implanting, at a second tilt angle, first vertical surfaces of the second and fourth fins with p-type impurities.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The following detailed description of implementations consistent with the present invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Implementations consistent with the principles of the invention provide techniques for fabricating high-density SRAM cells using shadowed implant techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a cross-section of a silicon on insulator (SOI) structure <b>100</b> formed in accordance with implementations consistent with the invention. SOI <b>100</b> may include a buried oxide layer on a silicon substrate (collectively shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as substrate <b>110</b>) and a silicon layer <b>120</b> formed on the buried oxide layer. In alternative implementations, substrate <b>110</b> and layer <b>120</b> may include other semiconductor materials, such as germanium, or combinations of semiconductor materials, such as silicon-germanium. The buried oxide layer may include a silicon oxide or other types of dielectric materials.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Silicon layer <b>120</b> may be formed on substrate <b>110</b> using a conventional deposition technique. The thickness of silicon layer <b>120</b> may range from about 50 Å to 500 Å. In an exemplary implementation, silicon layer <b>120</b> may be deposited to a thickness of approximately 50 Å. It will be appreciated that silicon layer <b>120</b> may be used to form one or more fins.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A thick cap layer <b>130</b> (or hard mask) may be formed on top of silicon layer <b>120</b> to aid in pattern optimization and protect silicon layer <b>120</b> during subsequent processing. Cap layer <b>130</b> may, for example, include a silicon nitride material or some other type of material capable of protecting silicon layer <b>120</b> during the fabrication process. Cap layer <b>130</b> may be deposited, for example, by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to a thickness ranging from approximately 50 Å to 200 Å. In an exemplary implementation, cap layer <b>130</b> may be deposited to a thickness of approximately 50 Å.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Silicon layer <b>120</b> may be patterned by conventional lithographic techniques (e.g., optical or electron beam (EB) lithography). Silicon layer <b>120</b> may then be etched using well-known etching techniques to form multiple fin structures <b>210</b>A, <b>2101</b>B, <b>220</b>A and <b>220</b>B, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows a three dimensional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, fin structure <b>210</b>A/<b>220</b>A includes a fin <b>212</b>A/<b>222</b>A and a cap <b>214</b>A/<b>224</b>A and fin structure <b>210</b>B/<b>220</b>B includes a fin <b>212</b>B/<b>222</b>B and a cap <b>214</b>B/<b>224</b>B. Caps <b>214</b>A/<b>224</b>A may remain covering fin <b>212</b>A/<b>222</b>A and caps <b>214</b>B/<b>224</b>B may remain covering fin <b>212</b>B/<b>222</b>B. The width of fin structures <b>210</b>A, <b>220</b>A, <b>210</b>B and <b>220</b>B may range from approximately 50 Å to 500 Å. In an exemplary implementation, the width of each of fin structures <b>210</b>A, <b>220</b>A, <b>210</b>B and <b>220</b>B may be approximately 50 Å. A distance d<sub>1 </sub>between side surfaces of fin structure <b>210</b>A and fin structure <b>220</b>A and between side surfaces of fin structure <b>210</b>B and <b>220</b>B may be approximately twice the width of fin structures <b>210</b>A and <b>220</b>A. d<sub>1 </sub>may, thus, range from approximately 100 Å to 1000 Å. A distance d<sub>2 </sub>between side surfaces of fin structure <b>220</b>A and <b>210</b>B may be approximately four times the width of fin structures <b>220</b>A and <b>210</b>B. d<sub>2 </sub>may, thus, range from approximately 200 Å to 2000 Å. In one implementation, for example, the distance d<sub>1 </sub>may be approximately 100 Å and the distance d<sub>2 </sub>may be approximately 200 Å.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A tilt angle implant process may then be performed to dope fins <b>212</b>A, <b>212</b>B, <b>222</b>A and <b>222</b>B. For example, a conventional implant process of n-type impurities, such as arsenic or phosphorus, may be performed to dope fins <b>212</b>A and <b>212</b>B, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows a three dimensional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, n-type impurities may be implanted at an angle ranging from approximately 40 degrees to 50 degrees. In an exemplary implementation, the implant process may be performed at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. The particular angle used may be dependent upon the height of cap <b>214</b>/<b>224</b>. For example, if the height of cap <b>214</b>/<b>224</b> is approximately equal to the height of fin <b>212</b>/<b>222</b>, then the angle used may be less than or equal to 45 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The n-type impurities may be implanted at a dosage of about 5×10<sup>14 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 1×10<sup>15 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>and an implantation energy of about 3-6 KeV for phosphorus or about 5-10 KeV for arsenic, which may depend on the thickness of fin <b>212</b>. After the implant process is complete, fins <b>212</b>A and <b>212</b>B may include silicon doped predominately, or only, with n-type impurities, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the implanting of n-type impurities does not dope fins <b>222</b>A and <b>222</b>B. There are several factors that aid in preventing the n-type impurities from reaching fins <b>222</b>A and <b>222</b>B. For example, the presence, height, and closeness of fin structure <b>210</b> shields or shadows fin <b>222</b>, thereby blocking the n-type impurities from reaching fin <b>222</b>. The presence of cap <b>224</b> also helps block the n-type impurities.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A tilt angle implant process of p-type impurities, such as boron or BF<sub>2</sub>, may be performed to dope fins <b>222</b>A and <b>222</b>B, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows a three dimensional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, p-type impurities may be implanted at an angle ranging from approximately 40 degrees to 50 degrees. In an exemplary implementation, the implant process may be performed at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. The particular angle used may be dependent upon the height of cap <b>214</b>/<b>224</b>. For example, if the height of cap <b>214</b>/<b>224</b> is approximately equal to the height of fin <b>212</b>/<b>222</b>, then the angle used may be less than or equal to 45 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The p-type impurities may be implanted at a dosage of about 5×10<sup>14 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 1×10<sup>15 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>and an implantation energy of about 2 KeV to about 3 KeV for boron, which may depend on the thickness of fin <b>222</b>. After the implant process is complete, fins <b>222</b>A and <b>222</b>B may include silicon doped predominately, or only, with p-type impurities, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the implanting of p-type impurities does not dope fins <b>212</b>A and <b>212</b>B. There are several factors that aid in preventing the p-type impurities from reaching fins <b>212</b>A and <b>212</b>B. For example, the presence, height, and closeness of fin structure <b>220</b> shields or shadows fin <b>212</b> blocks the p-type impurities from reaching fin <b>212</b>. The presence of cap <b>224</b> also helps block the p-type impurities.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It may also be desirable to dope fins <b>212</b> and <b>222</b> from the other side (i.e., the sides of fins <b>212</b> and <b>222</b> facing each other). This may be desirable in instances where the dopant does not fully dope fins <b>212</b> and <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In this case, a hardened resist may optionally be formed on non-shadowed sides of fin structures <b>210</b> and <b>220</b>. Another group of tilt angle implant processes may then optionally be performed to dope fins <b>212</b>A, <b>212</b>B, <b>222</b>A and <b>222</b>B. For example, a hardened resist <b>510</b> may be formed on the non-shadowed side surface of fin structure <b>220</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows a three dimensional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Resist <b>510</b> may be formed to a thickness ranging from approximately 100 Å to 200 Å. In an exemplary implementation, resist <b>510</b> may be formed to a thickness of approximately 150 Å. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows resist <b>510</b> covering only a portion of fin structure <b>220</b>, resist <b>510</b> may be formed to cover the entire non-shadowed side of fin structure <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A conventional implant process of n-type impurities, such as arsenic or phosphorus, may be performed to dope fins <b>212</b>A and <b>212</b>B, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. The n-type impurities may be implanted at an angle ranging from approximately 40 degrees to 50 degrees. In an exemplary implementation, the implant process may be performed at an angle of approximately 45 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The n-type impurities may be implanted at a dosage of about 5×10<sup>14 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 1×10<sup>15 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>and an implantation energy of about 3-6 KeV for phosphorus or about 5-10 KeV for arsenic, which may depend on the thickness of fin <b>212</b>. After the implant process is complete, fins <b>212</b>A and <b>212</b>B may include silicon doped predominately, or only, with n-type impurities, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. The implanting of n-type impurities does not dope fins <b>222</b>A and <b>222</b>B. For example, resist <b>510</b> and cap <b>224</b> block the n-type impurities from reaching fins <b>222</b>A and <b>222</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A hardened resist <b>610</b> may optionally be formed on the non-shadowed side surface of fin structures <b>212</b>A and <b>212</b>B, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows a three dimensional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. Resist <b>610</b> may be formed to a thickness ranging from approximately 100 Å to 200 Å. In an exemplary implementation, resist <b>610</b> may be formed to a thickness of approximately 150 Å. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows resist <b>610</b> covering only a portion of fin structures <b>210</b>A and <b>210</b>B, resist <b>610</b> may be formed to cover the entire non-shadowed side of fin structures <b>210</b>A and <b>210</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A conventional implant process of p-type impurities, such as boron or BF<sub>2</sub>, may then be optionally performed to dope fins <b>222</b>A and <b>222</b>B, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. The p-type impurities may be implanted at an angle ranging from approximately 40 degrees to 50 degrees. In an exemplary implementation, the implant process may be performed at an angle of approximately 45 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The p-type impurities may be implanted at a dosage of about 5×10<sup>14 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>to about 1×10<sup>15 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>and an implantation energy of about 2 KeV to about 3 KeV for boron, which may depend on the thickness of fins <b>222</b>A and <b>222</b>B. After the implant process is complete, fins <b>222</b>A and <b>222</b>B may include silicon doped predominately, or only, with p-type impurities, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. The implanting of p-type impurities does not dope fins <b>212</b>A and <b>212</b>B. For example, resist <b>610</b> and cap <b>214</b> block the p-type impurities from reaching fin <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After doping of fins <b>212</b>A, <b>212</b>B, <b>222</b>A and <b>222</b>B, conventional FinFET fabrication processing can be used to complete the transistor (e.g., forming the source and drain regions, contacts, interconnects and inter-level dielectrics for the FinFET device). For example, any remaining resist <b>510</b> or <b>610</b> may be stripped. Also, caps <b>214</b> and <b>224</b> may be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a selective oxide strip <b>710</b> may be grown on fins <b>212</b>A and <b>222</b>A. Oxide strip <b>710</b> maybe etched and a gate <b>720</b> and M1 jumper <b>730</b> maybe formed by depositing and patterning polysilicon over fins <b>212</b>A, <b>222</b>A, <b>212</b>B and <b>222</b>B, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Polysilicon may then be deposited and patterned for forming the contacts and interconnect <b>810</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Conventional processing may then be performed to complete the SRAM device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a FinFET SRAM device <b>900</b> that may be formed from the above-processing. As illustrated, SRAM device <b>900</b> includes a group of separate M2 bitline contacts <b>910</b>, an M1 wordline <b>920</b>, an M1 jumper <b>730</b>, a gate <b>720</b>, and a gate interconnect <b>810</b>.</p>
