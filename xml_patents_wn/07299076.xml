<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Automobiles have included a hands free cellular system with a remote microphone located in the automobile to receive acoustic signals, and an antenna as part of a wireless RF link to connect hardware components with the user's cellular telephone. The automobile sound system reproduces the audio signal received by the cellular telephone.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a communication system. The invention relates to methods and apparatus for packaging a microphone array (where the array may consist of a single microphone element or a plurality of microphone elements; a microphone element may also be referred to as a microphone or a microphone capsule) and an antenna mounted permanently in a vehicle in such a manner as to reduce the installation labor and/or materials costs for the microphone and antenna assembly. Microphones operating in a multiple element array each receive acoustic signals. The signals may be processed in such a way as to provide emphasis for acoustic signals originating from a specific location.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One aspect of the invention includes co-locating the microphone and antenna elements in such a fashion as to facilitate combining multiple conductors into a single cable run or vehicle wiring harness branch, for connection with a central controller. Other alternative embodiments include mounting both the antenna and the microphone proximate to one another or in the same enclosure, or modulating electrical signals from multiple microphone elements onto the same conductors, or modulating electrical signals from multiple microphone elements and antenna signals (both transmitted and received) onto the same conductors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to one embodiment, the communication system for a vehicle has a microphone array comprising a plurality of microphone elements within the vehicle for receiving an acoustic signal and converting the acoustic signal to an electrical signal. The communication system also includes an antenna, mounted proximate to the microphone. The antenna communicates a radio frequency signal to a wireless device. The communication system also includes a controller with a first input that is electrically coupled to the at least one microphone element and a second input that is electrically coupled to the antenna. The controller processes the electrical signal and transmits the processed electrical signal to the antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, the microphone array and the antenna are permanently mounted in the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, the communication system further comprises an enclosure that houses the microphone array and the antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, the controller is located remotely from the microphone array and the antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the communication system has a first cable that couples the microphone to the controller and a second cable that couples the antenna to the controller.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the first and the second cable are located proximate to each other for at least a portion of the length of one of the first and the second cables.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, at least a portion of at least one of the first and the second cables is coaxial cable.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the communication system comprises a single cable that couples the controller to at least one microphone in the microphone array and the antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the microphone array for receiving an acoustic signal comprises a plurality of microphone elements configured as a microphone array.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, the microphone array comprises a pressure responsive capsule element microphone.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, the microphone array is positioned proximate to a headliner in the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another embodiment, a microphone element of the microphone array is positioned within one quarter of a wavelength away from a reflective plane formed by the headliner.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In yet another embodiment, the antenna communicates with the wireless device using a Bluetooth® communications protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the antenna is positioned proximate to a headliner in the vehicle at a distance from a grounded metal surface that is within one-fifth of the wavelength of the radio frequency signal.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, the radio frequency signal is a Bluetooth® radio frequency signal.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the antenna is positioned overhead and forward of a driver in the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, antenna is positioned overhead, centered in the vehicle and forward of the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another embodiment, the antenna is mounted within a map light enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In still another embodiment, the antenna is positioned in a location that is chosen from the group comprising a rear-view mirror, an instrument panel, a dashboard, a steering wheel, a visor and an airbag cover.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another embodiment, the communication system further comprises a second antenna positioned in the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the second antenna is positioned in a trunk of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another embodiment, the microphone array is mounted proximate to the antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the microphone array and the antenna are mounted in an enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the communication system comprises a low-pass filter that is coupled to at least one microphone in the microphone array. The low-pass filter filters out radio frequency interference.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another embodiment, the communication system further comprises an amplifier that is coupled to at least one microphone element in the microphone array. The amplifier amplifies an audio signal from the at least one microphone element.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, the electrical signal is transmitted as a low voltage differential signal so as to increase immunity to extraneous interference. Each conductor references to a ground circuit.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In a hands free cellular telephone system in a vehicle, a user's personal cellular telephone is detected and used as part of the hands free system. Acoustic output from the user is captured by a microphone or microphone elements incorporated in the vehicle (other than in the user's cell phone). This eliminates the need for the user to hold his cell phone up next to his mouth (thus hands free). Acoustic signals from the far end of the telephone system (the person on the other end of the phone connection) are played to the user through the vehicle's audio system. The modulation and demodulation of signals transmitted and received over the cellular network is accomplished by the user's cell phone, so that components providing this capability do not need to be duplicated in the vehicle. In order to accomplish this, a bi-directional communication link between the vehicle components and the cell phone must be established.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a communication system <b>100</b> employing a combination of an antenna <b>30</b> and a microphone array <b>70</b> colocated and mounted in an enclosure <b>60</b> remote from controller <b>80</b>, the enclosure <b>60</b> being permanently mounted in a vehicle <b>11</b>. Microphone array <b>70</b> can include any number of microphone elements. The antenna <b>30</b>, microphone array <b>70</b> and enclosure <b>60</b> can be installed in various locations in the vehicle <b>11</b>. The enclosure <b>60</b> contains the antenna <b>30</b>, which is configured to transmit and receive a radio frequency (RF) signal <b>22</b>. The RF signal <b>22</b> is typically modulated with digital information, according to a predetermined protocol such as Bluetooth®, 802.11, UWB or other protocols. In the following discussions, we refer to signals transmitted from a device to antenna <b>30</b>, or signals transmitted by antenna <b>30</b> to a device as RF signals <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Microphone array <b>70</b> is coupled to controller <b>80</b>. One method for coupling is via cable <b>71</b>. The number of conductors incorporated in the cable <b>71</b> depends on the number of microphone elements included in microphone array <b>70</b>, and the method of communicating electrical signals from microphone elements to controller <b>80</b>. For example, single-ended communication requires the use of two conductors, one for signal and one for a reference, and balanced communication requires use of three conductors, one for a non-inverted polarity signal, one for an inverted polarity signal, and one for a reference. Each microphone element may use its own reference connection, or a single reference connection can be used for multiple microphone elements. Alternatively, electrical output signals from a plurality of microphone elements can be multiplexed onto the same set of conductors. Multiplexing multiple electrical signals will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Antenna <b>30</b> is coupled to controller <b>80</b> via cable <b>72</b>. Signals received by antenna <b>30</b> from cell phone <b>40</b> are communicated to controller <b>80</b>. Controller <b>80</b> demodulates the signals received from antenna <b>30</b> in a predetermined manner, such as according to the Bluetooth® protocol. Controller <b>80</b> also provides modulated RF signals to antenna <b>30</b> for transmission to cell phone <b>40</b>. These signals are modulated in a predetermined manner, such as according to the Bluetooth® protocol. Thus, controller <b>80</b> and cell phone <b>40</b> communicate over a bi-directional wireless link. Note that cell phone <b>40</b> incorporates an antenna (not shown) for receiving wireless information from controller <b>80</b>. This antenna may be different from the cell phone antenna <b>51</b> used to communicate with the cellular network. Circuitry in cell phone <b>40</b> (not shown) is configured to receive RF signals, where the RF signals are modulated according to a predetermined protocol, such as the Bluetooth® protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The controller <b>80</b> has an output <b>24</b> that outputs audio information into the vehicle cabin (typically through the vehicle entertainment system, but may also be through separate audio rendering devices). These signals typically originated from a remote telephone, which communication system <b>100</b> is coupled to through cellular telephone <b>40</b> and the cellular telephone network. The system <b>100</b> includes a cellular telephone <b>40</b> (i.e. in the vehicle <b>11</b>) that transmits a cellular telephone protocol signal <b>50</b> over the cellular network.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Microphone array <b>70</b> and antenna <b>30</b> are mounted within the enclosure <b>60</b>. Alternatively, microphone array <b>70</b> and antenna <b>30</b> may be mounted in separate enclosures (not shown), where the separate enclosures are located proximate to each other. The enclosure <b>60</b> is mounted to a headliner <b>12</b> of the vehicle <b>11</b> for effective reception of an acoustic signal.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to an alternative embodiment, signal processing capability may be located in the microphone array housing <b>60</b>. For example, an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter (not shown) and/or a microprocessor (not shown), in addition to the microphone array <b>70</b> and antenna <b>30</b>, may be located in the enclosure <b>60</b>. The A/D converter performs an A/D conversion on the electrical signal output from the microphone (or a microphone pre amplifier). The microprocessor performs digital signal processing of the digital signal output from the A/D converter. The microprocessor may be a general purpose microprocessor, a micro controller, a digital signal processor (DSP), or other device capable of performing computations associated with digital signal processing operations. A useful operation to perform is beamforming, where the multiple signals received from multiple elements in the microphone array are processed to enhance detection of signals arriving at the array location from a particular direction. The output of the beamforming operation (which may be fixed or adaptive) is a single output signal which has been processed to preferentially pickup sound from the location of the acoustic source. The single signal is then sent down over the cable (e.g., a harness <b>74</b>), instead of sending multiple microphone signals. This reduces cost and complexity of the wiring harness.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A branch of the vehicle wiring harness <b>74</b> may incorporate both the cable <b>71</b>, which connects microphone array <b>70</b> to controller <b>80</b>, and cable <b>72</b> which connects antenna <b>30</b> to controller <b>80</b>. The wiring harness branch <b>74</b> may include other cables along a portion of its length, besides the microphone array cable <b>71</b> and antenna cable <b>72</b>. The number of conductors contained in wiring harness <b>74</b> for communicating between microphone array <b>70</b>, antenna <b>30</b>, and controller <b>80</b> depends on methods of communication used, as described earlier, and which will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">For example, a microphone array <b>70</b> receives an acoustic signal such as a conversation, voice command or voice message, etc. generated by a vehicle driver or other acoustic source in the vehicle <b>11</b>. The microphone array <b>70</b> converts the acoustic signal into one or more electrical signals (depending on the number of microphone elements included in microphone array <b>70</b>). The electrical signals are communicated via the cable <b>71</b> to the controller <b>80</b>. The signals can also be carried by the harness <b>74</b> to the controller <b>80</b>. Depending upon the configuration, the controller <b>80</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may include an analog to digital (A/D) converter <b>85</b>, a microprocessor <b>83</b>, and/or a Bluetooth® conversion module <b>86</b>. According to other embodiments of the invention, these components may be located in the enclosure <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The analog to digital (A/D) converter <b>85</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) converts the electrical signals output from microphone elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>(or from microphone pre-amplifiers <b>82</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>) into digital signals. Then the microprocessor <b>83</b> processes the digital signals, and outputs the processed signal to Bluetooth® module <b>86</b>. Bluetooth® module <b>86</b> modulates an RF signal with the digital representation of the acoustic signal picked up by the microphone array <b>70</b> (which was processed by A/D converter <b>85</b> and microprocessor <b>83</b>). In turn, modulated RF is communicated to the antenna <b>30</b> via cable <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The antenna <b>30</b> broadcasts the modulated RF signal <b>22</b>. In turn, the cellular telephone <b>40</b> receives the modulated RF signal. The cellular telephone <b>40</b> re-modulates the digital representation of the original acoustic signal into a form compatible with the cellular telephone protocol signal <b>50</b>, and communicates the re-modulated signal over the cellular network. A remote telephone (not shown) receives the cellular telephone protocol signal <b>50</b>, demodulates it and processes it as necessary to form an acoustic signal that can be heard by a person at the far end of the telephone connection.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The communication system <b>100</b> is also configured to transmit acoustic signals that originate at the location of the remote telephone to the vehicle cabin. Accordingly, the cellular telephone <b>40</b> receives a cellular telephone protocol signal <b>50</b> initiated by a remote telephone (not shown). For example, the cellular telephone <b>40</b> may receive signals representing a telephone audio transmission initiated by a person at the far end of a telephone connection. The cellular telephone <b>40</b> re-modulates the signal received from the remote telephone into a Bluetooth® compatible RF signal <b>22</b>, which is then transmitted from cellular telephone <b>40</b> to the antenna <b>30</b>. The signal received by the antenna <b>30</b> is communicated to the controller <b>80</b> via the cable <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, within the controller <b>80</b>, the Bluetooth® module <b>86</b> converts the received Bluetooth® compatible RF signal <b>22</b> (i.e., representing an audio signal initiated at the far end of a cellular telephone conversation) to an electrical signal (of either analog or digital form, depending on whether digital-to-analog (D/A) converters are incorporated as part of the Bluetooth® module or in a subsequent component located elsewhere in the signal chain) representing the remote telephone acoustic signal. The electrical signal is sent by the controller <b>80</b> to an audio reproduction system <b>87</b> (incorporating a vehicle audio system “head unit” <b>81</b>, and loudspeakers <b>24</b> located within the vehicle cabin), which renders the electrical signal into an acoustical signal audible to passengers in the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Various methods of wireless transmission between the cellular telephone <b>40</b> and antenna <b>30</b> mounted in the enclosure <b>60</b> are possible. One such method is based on the Bluetooth® protocol which provides a method of conducting compatible communications between devices from a variety of manufacturers. The Bluetooth® protocol is a low power (one milliwatt), packet-oriented transmission protocol that has a range of transmission of about thirty feet. Bluetooth® employs spread-spectrum frequency hopping 1,600 times every second, between seventy-nine different channels contained within in the frequency range between approximately 2.4 and 2.5 GHz, which reduces the likelihood of interference with other electronic devices that are located proximate to the cellular telephone <b>40</b>. The Bluetooth® protocol also provides an effective mechanism for communicating with digital devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), telephones, etc. Other protocols for communicating information wirelessly between devices may also be employed. For example, any of the various versions of the IEEE 802.11 family of standards may be employed, as well as any other known method.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When operating in a hands free mode, the speaker and the microphone contained in the cellular telephone <b>40</b> are disabled. The cellular telephone <b>40</b> uses the received Bluetooth® compatible RF signal <b>22</b> (modulated by digital data representative of acoustical signals present within the vehicle cabin) as the input source to the cellular telephone <b>40</b>. The cellular telephone <b>40</b> then converts the modulated Bluetooth® compatible RF signal <b>22</b> into a cellular telephone network signal <b>50</b> for transmission over the cellular telephone network. Similarly, cell phone <b>40</b> outputs a Bluetooth® compatible RF signal (modulated by data received from the cellular telephone network representative of the acoustical signal input to the far end telephone), rather than outputting an electrical signal for reproduction by the internal speaker of the cellular telephone <b>40</b>. The cellular telephone <b>40</b> that is located in the vehicle <b>11</b> operates “hand-free”.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Certain locations within the vehicle <b>11</b> are good microphone locations for reception of the acoustic signal. Certain of the same locations are also good antenna locations for transmission and reception of the Bluetooth® compatible RF signal signals <b>22</b>. In such cases, positioning the microphone array <b>70</b> and antenna <b>30</b> together provides for good reception of both the acoustic signals and RF signals <b>22</b>. Examples of such locations include overhead and in front of the driver, on the dashboard in front of the driver, etc. Several favorable locations for the combined microphone and the antenna enclosure <b>60</b> are detailed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In one example location, microphone array <b>70</b> and antenna <b>30</b> are mounted in the same enclosure <b>60</b> on the headliner <b>12</b> in front of the driver. Alternatively, the microphone array <b>70</b> and antenna <b>30</b> are mounted, not in the same enclosure <b>60</b>, but proximate to one another. Such placement provides opportunities for reduction in material and labor costs associated with manufacture of the assembly as well as material and labor costs for installation of the assembly in the vehicle <b>11</b>. Such co-location of the microphone array <b>70</b> and antenna <b>30</b> reduces the number of places in the vehicle <b>11</b> to which cable needs to be run. Further cost reduction may be possible if multiple signals are modulated onto a single conductor or a smaller number of conductors.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of a communication system <b>200</b> that has separately-wired microphone elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>(i.e., in the microphone array <b>70</b>) for receiving acoustic signals <b>14</b> from a user <b>63</b>. The outputs of each of the individual microphone elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are amplified by pre-amplifiers <b>82</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. Pre-amplification of the individual microphone outputs results in a better signal-to-noise ratio of signals transmitted over the cable <b>71</b> between the microphone array <b>70</b> and the controller <b>80</b>, thereby reducing the potential impact of extraneous noise on the system <b>200</b>. In this example, each individual microphone element <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>is connected to a respective cable <b>71</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>that has two conductors <b>73</b><i>a</i>, <b>73</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A harness <b>74</b> may contain cables <b>71</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>carrying signals from each of the individual microphone elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>of the microphone array <b>70</b>. Such cables may be a plurality of twisted-pair conductors <b>73</b><i>a</i>, <b>73</b><i>b</i>, etc. surrounded by a conductive shielding, for example. The cable <b>72</b> between the controller <b>80</b> and the Bluetooth® antenna <b>30</b> may be strung so as to be part of harness <b>74</b>, or may be strung separately from the harness <b>74</b>. Coaxial cable may be used as the cable <b>72</b> between the controller <b>80</b> and the Bluetooth® antenna <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Each of the individual cables <b>71</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>connects to an A/D converter <b>85</b> within the controller <b>80</b>. The A/D converter <b>85</b> converts electrical signals from microphone array <b>70</b> (or outputs from preamplifiers <b>82</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>) into digital signals. Note that a single A/D converter can be used, where the converter is multiplexed across the different pre-amplifier outputs, or individual A/D converters can be used for each pre-amplifier output. The A/D converted supplies digital signals to microprocessor <b>83</b>. In turn, microprocessor <b>83</b> processes the digital signals. The processing applied may take many forms. In one example, digital signal processing to locate the position of an acoustic source within the vehicle may first be applied. The output of this processing is then used as input to a beamforming algorithm (which may be fixed or adaptive), to improve the ability of the beamformed array to preferentially pick up sounds originating from the location of the acoustic source. Alternatively, beamforming algorithms may be used that automatically identify the location of sound sources and steer the array to preferentially detect sound output from those sources, or specific predetermined locations can be identified in advance (such as driver and passenger seats), and beamforming algorithms are applied that preferentially detect sounds arriving from these pre-determined locations.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The digital output from microprocessor <b>83</b> is supplied to Bluetooth® processor <b>86</b>, which converts the output into a signal formatted according to the Bluetooth® protocol. In turn, Bluetooth® processor <b>86</b> outputs the Bluetooth® compatible signal via cable <b>72</b> to antenna <b>30</b>. As described earlier, antenna <b>30</b> is positioned either within the enclosure <b>60</b> or proximate to the enclosure <b>60</b>. Antenna <b>30</b> then communicates signals to cell phone <b>40</b>, which cell phone <b>40</b> receives and re-modulates into a form for transmission over the cellular network.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As mentioned earlier, the RF link between antenna <b>30</b> and cell phone <b>40</b> is bi-directional. Antenna <b>30</b> may receive signals from cell phone <b>40</b>, as well as transmit signals to cell phone <b>40</b>. The cable <b>72</b>, connecting the Bluetooth® processor <b>86</b> and antenna <b>30</b> may also transmit signals bi-directionally. An acoustic signal present in the location of a phone at the far end of a telephone connection (the phone may be cellular or land based) is picked up by the far end telephone, and modulated onto the cellular phone network (either directly by the remote cell phone, or in a telephone switching facility). Cellular phone <b>40</b> receives this signal from the cellular network, and re-modulates it into a compatible form (an RF signal employing a protocol such as Bluetooth®) for communication to antenna <b>30</b>. Antenna <b>30</b> receives the RF signal, and communicates it to Bluetooth® converter <b>86</b> in controller <b>80</b>. Bluetooth® converter <b>86</b> then demodulates the received signal (i.e. the signal that originated in the remote telephone). The electric signal is sent by the controller <b>80</b> to the audio reproduction system <b>87</b> (incorporating vehicle audio system “head unit” <b>81</b>, and loudspeakers <b>24</b> located within the vehicle cabin) which renders the electric signal into an acoustical signal audible to the user <b>63</b>. Alternatively, the controller <b>80</b> can be integrated with a separate audio reproduction system. In one example, the vehicle audio system or portions thereof may be used for both entertainment output and output of the remote telephone signal.</p>

The preamplifiers <b>82</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, in turn, connect to an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter <b>85</b>, such as the Cirrus Logic 5180 A/D converter/multiplexer.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The A/D converter/multiplexer <b>85</b> converts electric signals from the microphones <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>into digital signals. The multiplexer section of the A/D converter/multiplexer <b>85</b> also combines the resulting digital signals into a time division multiplexed (TDM) signal. These two steps of converting the audio signals into digital signals and combining the multiple digital signals into one multiplexed signal may alternatively be performed by separate components each equipped to perform one of the steps, or one component capable of performing both steps.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In one example, the A/D converter output is composed of four separate communication lines including frame sync <b>76</b>, bit rate <b>77</b>, data <b>78</b> and ground <b>79</b> lines. Together, the four lines successively communicate a multiplexed data stream formed from the output of each of the microphone elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>of the microphone array <b>70</b>. The four lines <b>76</b>, <b>77</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>79</b> are located together in the harness <b>74</b>. According to an alternative configuration, the frame sync <b>76</b>, bit rate <b>77</b>, data <b>78</b> lines transmit signals to the controller <b>80</b> in the form of low voltage differential signals (LVDS).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Low voltage differential signaling (LVDS) is a low noise, low power, low amplitude method for high-speed (gigabits per second) data transmission over copper wire defined in the TIA/EIA-644 and the IEEE 1596.3 standards. To implement LVDS signaling, an LVDS driver converts a TTL/CMOS signal into a low-voltage differential signal composed of two equal and opposite traces referenced to ground. Since each signal is exactly equal and opposite, any returns (i.e., such as induced noise) in a differential circuit simply cancel (with no part of them appearing on the zero-voltage or ground circuit).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The (LVDS) signals are each carried over twisted-pair cable (i.e., two conductors for each signal). The LVDS signals radiate less electromagnetic interference (EMI) thereby causing less interference with other systems.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The digital data representing signals from each microphone (or microphone pre-amplifier) is transmitted via the data signal line <b>78</b> in the form of successive frames. In one example, data in one frame is associated with the signal from one microphone. Successive frames contain data from different microphone elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>(i.e., first microphone <b>70</b><i>a</i>, then second microphone <b>70</b><i>b</i>, then third microphone <b>70</b><i>c</i>, etc.). The amount of data chosen to be contained in single frame (i.e., the frame size) is not critical, but should be chosen to minimize latency in transmission. The frame sync signals transmitted via frame sync line <b>76</b> are used to identify the frame transitions for data signals transmitted via data line <b>78</b> from the different microphones. The 2.4 GHz signal between the controller <b>80</b> and the antenna <b>30</b> is carried separately over a coax cable <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Microprocessor <b>83</b> may perform various digital signal processing algorithms on the received signals. For example, noise reduction, echo canceling (echo canceling prevents feedback from the signal output into the car from being re-fed into the microphone), beamforming, speech recognition processing of the received signals, or other signal processing, may be performed. The processed signals are then output by microprocessor <b>83</b> to Bluetooth® processor <b>86</b>, for processing the signals into a Bluetooth® signal. An example device useful as a Bluetooth® processor is the RF Micro Devices® SiW3500®. In turn, the Bluetooth® signal is transmitted via antenna <b>30</b> to the cellular telephone <b>40</b>, for signal transmission via the cellular network (e.g., GSM, CDMA, etc. network).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As previously described, there is a bi-directional communication link between the cellular network (i.e. connected via the cellular telephone <b>40</b>) and the controller <b>80</b>. Accordingly, cell phone <b>40</b> may receive communications over the cellular network. For example, cell towers maintained by the telephone company relay cellular signals at 900 MHz or 1.6, 1.8 GHz. (i.e. GSM, CDMA, etc.), which are received by the cellular telephone <b>40</b>. In turn, the cellular telephone <b>40</b> transforms the received cellular signal into a Bluetooth® signal for transmission to the antenna <b>30</b>. The Bluetooth® signal is transmitted over the cable <b>72</b> that couples the Bluetooth® antenna <b>30</b> to the controller <b>80</b>. The controller is coupled to the audio reproduction system <b>87</b> from which output is sent to the transducers <b>24</b> in the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> describes a method for multiplexing multiple signals onto four conductors using a digital time division multiplexing scheme (TDM), many other known methods to multiplex multiple signals onto a small number of signal paths may be employed. For example, serial data communication systems employing only two conductors are known and could be employed in place of the four conductor scheme described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Also, it should be noted that the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> could multiplex many more than four microphone signals onto the same four conductor digital transmission path (or a two conductor serial transmission path). Other schemes using packet based transmission may also be employed. Additionally, analog multiplexing methods known in the art, such as frequency division multiplexing could be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">One embodiment of the invention uses modulation techniques to modulate analog signals from multiple elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>in a microphone array <b>70</b> onto a single cable. For example, multiple electrical signals output from the microphones can be modulated onto the same cable by using frequency division multiplexing. FM modulation is well known, and will not be described in detail here. Simply, carrier frequencies are selected for each microphone signal to be modulated. The carriers are spaced apart sufficiently in frequency such that the modulated carriers do not interfere with each other. A bandwidth of 200 kHz for each modulated signal can be used, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">For a system having four microphone signals to be modulated, a first signal can be used at baseband (i.e., without modulation), and each of the three of other microphone signals can be modulated on carriers of 200 kHz, 400 kHz, and 600 kHz, respectively. Three modulators (not shown) that perform the modulation are located near microphone array <b>70</b>. Each of the microphone signals (except the microphone signal sent at baseband) is modulated onto its respective carrier. The outputs of the modulators are summed together, and the combined signal is sent over a single conductor pair (for single ended transmission, three conductors are necessary for balanced transmission). At the reception end (controller <b>80</b>), a low-pass filter can extract the baseband signal. Three demodulators (not shown) are required to extract the three modulated signals. The outputs of the demodulators correspond to the original analog electrical signal outputs of the three microphone elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">It is also possible to use cable <b>71</b> to communicate RF signals to and from antenna <b>30</b>. In an embodiment where analog audio signals are transmitted over cable <b>71</b>, the audio signals contain energy in the low audio frequency range, well separated from the frequency range of RF signals <b>22</b>. Audio signals are generally between 20 Hz-20 kHz, and RF signals (e.g., for Bluetooth®) are in the range of 2.4-2.5 GHz. Simple filtering can be applied at either end of cable <b>71</b> to separate out signals of interest for communication with a device of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In addition to carrying the electrical signals from the microphone array <b>70</b>, the harness <b>74</b> may also be coupled to a power source for transmission of DC power (e.g., such as power designated to power a map light, or to power circuitry contained within the enclosure <b>60</b>, such as pre-amplifiers, A/D converters, etc.). Accordingly, in addition to transmitting the electrical signals from the microphone array <b>70</b>, and/or digital signals, the harness <b>74</b> can also conduct DC power.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exploded view of an enclosure <b>60</b> including microphone array <b>70</b> having a plurality of microphones <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and an antenna <b>30</b>. The enclosure <b>60</b> comprises a top section <b>60</b><i>a </i>and a bottom section <b>60</b><i>b </i>according to one embodiment of the invention. The enclosure <b>60</b> is configured to contain the plurality of microphones <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>of the microphone array <b>70</b> (four microphone elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are depicted, by way of example only) and one or more antennas <b>30</b>. The enclosure surrounds at least a portion of the microphone array <b>70</b>. Within the enclosure <b>60</b>, the individual microphone elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and the antenna <b>30</b> may be oriented in any direction. Additionally, the enclosure <b>60</b> can be constructed with one or more ports to allow at least one of the microphone elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>in the microphone array <b>70</b> to receive acoustic signals. The enclosure <b>60</b> can also include acoustic damping material that can reduce acoustic noise in the enclosure <b>60</b>. The enclosure <b>60</b> can also include EMI shielding that can reduce electromagnetic interference in the enclosure <b>60</b>. The enclosure <b>60</b> may be constructed in any of a variety of shapes and materials and positioned in various locations within the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an interior <b>500</b> of a vehicle <b>11</b> in which various alternative locations for the enclosure <b>60</b> are depicted. The first position <b>130</b>, as described earlier with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, shows the enclosure <b>60</b> mounted in the headliner <b>12</b> of the vehicle <b>11</b>, in front of the driver's seat <b>13</b>. The enclosure <b>60</b> is positioned to provide acceptable reception and transmission of Bluetooth® compatible RF signals, considering the likely locations for the cellular telephone <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) within the vehicle <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The first position <b>130</b> also provides good reception of an acoustic signal <b>14</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) such as the driver's voice. The first position <b>130</b> minimizes noise and interference from undesired acoustic signals such as wind noise emanating from an open window or noise emanating from an air conditioner. The first position <b>130</b> is close to the acoustic signal <b>14</b> and is further away from noise sources, such as the engine, the road, and the wind. This increases the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and improves audio quality of the acoustic signal <b>14</b>. In addition, the first position <b>130</b> minimizes electrical interference to the microphone array <b>70</b> and/or antenna <b>30</b> signals emanating from sources such as the controller <b>80</b>, a video screen, or from other electronic devices mounted elsewhere in the vehicle <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The microphone array may use any type of microphone element, or combination of microphone element types. Typical types are pressure responding and pressure gradient responding (also know as differential, bi-directional, dipole, or figure of eight microphones). However, certain types of elements are more susceptible to generation of wind noise in use. In a vehicle, wind may interact with a microphone when a window is rolled down, or the vehicle environmental controls are used (heat, air conditioning, fan, etc.). Pressure responding type microphone elements are inherently less susceptible to generation of wind noise than pressure gradient type microphones, and may be used in embodiments where the microphone elements are exposed to large air flows. Additional techniques may also be employed to reduce sensitivity to wind noise, such as the application of open cell foam or wire mesh screens to reduce air turbulence in the vicinity of microphone elements.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">One technique for reducing interference with the microphone element output signals is to amplify the microphone element electrical signal outputs at a position near to the microphone elements. The signals are amplified before any external interference during transmission occurs. The amplified signals are then transmitted over cable <b>71</b> to controller <b>80</b> thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal received at controller <b>80</b> from the microphone array <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Another technique for minimizing undesirable interference is to employ balanced signal transmission between the microphone array <b>70</b> and controller <b>80</b>. As previously described, according to such an arrangement, the output of each microphone element is converted from single ended to a differential form, for transmission to the controller <b>80</b>. This involves transmitting a non-inverted and inverted replica of the microphone output signal, as well as providing a reference connection. A differential amplifier is used at controller <b>80</b> to convert the balanced signal back to single ended. Interference induced onto the cable will be approximately equal on each conductor and is rejected by the differential amplifier. Note that this method could also be employed for transmission of a multiplexed microphone signal (e.g., FM modulated), or any audio signal transmitted from the microphone location to a remote location.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Locating microphone elements close to a large reflecting plane can enhance the performance of the microphone array <b>70</b>. Headliner <b>12</b> serves as a reflective plane near the microphone array <b>70</b>. Locating microphone array <b>70</b> close to a reflection plane narrows the directivity of microphone elements (for example, for omni-directional microphone elements, the directivity pattern is changed from spherical to hemispherical), and some acoustic gain is achieved by placement of microphone elements within the “pressure zone” of the reflective surface. To benefit from this acoustic gain, the microphone elements should be located closer to the reflecting plane than a quarter-wavelength, at the highest frequency of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The directivity of antenna <b>30</b>, for both reception and transmission of RF signals, can also be altered by its location. For example, placement of antenna <b>30</b> close to a grounded metal surface (such as the roof of the vehicle <b>11</b> located above and close to the headliner <b>12</b>) increases the directivity of transmission/reception to/from an antenna <b>30</b>. Preferably, the antenna <b>30</b> is mounted a distance from the grounded metal surface that is a small fraction of the wavelength (e.g., less than 1/10) of the highest frequency of interest. For Bluetooth® transmission, this distance is approximately 1.2 cm. However, the directivity of the antenna <b>30</b> can still be improved by mounting the antenna <b>30</b> up to approximately 2.5 cm from the ground plane. According to an alternative embodiment, the communication system is configured to have a second antenna positioned in the vehicle in a location such as the trunk of the vehicle thereby improving reception of radio frequency signals.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Alternative locations for the enclosure <b>60</b> include an overhead position <b>132</b> in the center of the vehicle <b>11</b> and forward of the driver's seat <b>13</b>, within a map-light enclosure or other position on the headliner <b>12</b>, in a rear-view mirror <b>134</b>, in an instrument panel <b>138</b>, on top of the dashboard <b>136</b> in front of the driver's seat <b>13</b>, on a steering wheel <b>16</b>, visor <b>18</b>, on an airbag cover <b>140</b>, or on the controller <b>80</b>. The enclosure <b>60</b> can also be positioned elsewhere in the vehicle <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Additionally, the enclosure <b>60</b> can be positioned in any location (i.e., map light enclosure, other electrical devices, etc.) that has wiring associated with it for other purposes. This can simplify manufacture of the vehicle wiring harness. Furthermore, if the enclosure <b>60</b> is located in an area where other DC power consuming devices are located in the vehicle, the need to run a separate DC power cable to the assembly location can be eliminated, further reducing complexity and cost of the vehicle wiring harness.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Thus, as described in detail, above, embodiments of the invention provide a mechanism for wiring a microphone (or alternatively an array of microphones) and an antenna, such as a Bluetooth® antenna within a vehicle in such a fashion as to reduce the cost of the design, installation and materials, for the microphone and antenna cables. While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined by the appended claims.</p>
