<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system for removing particulates and/or contaminants, including impure compounds and elements from fluid to be treated is provided. The systems can include a receptacle having chamber in which a volume of fluid may be accommodated, a cover for placement across an opening into the chamber, so as to prevent fluid from within the chamber from spilling, and a porous matrix, positioned within the chamber and having a nanostructured adsorption material for trapping and retaining, within its pores, particles and contaminants in the fluid. A method for removing particulates and contaminants is also provided.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The invention described herein relates to a system designed for purification of fluid for consumption by removing contaminants, such as microorganisms, organic, inorganic, and particulate matters from the fluid. In one embodiment of the present invention, the system includes a receptacle having a chamber into which a volume of fluid may be placed. The system may also include a porous matrix placed within the chamber for entrapment of the particulates and/or contaminants upon surface contact between the fluid and the porous matrix. In one embodiment, the porous matrix includes a nanostructured adsorption material and may be embedded on the interior surface of the receptacle. Alternatively, the porous matrix may be placed onto the interior surface of the receptacle as a thin film, coating, layer or as a sheet of material. In another embodiment, the porous matrix may be a loose mass of macro particles that can freely move within the fluid in the receptacle. The nanostructured adsorption material, in one embodiment, may be contain different chemical materials, including silver or silver compounds. The system may further include a sensor in communication with the porous matrix, so as to detect levels of particulates and/or contaminants adsorbed on the matrix or quantity of particulates and/or contaminants removed from the fluid to be treated.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention also provides a method for purification of fluid by removing unwanted particulates and/or contaminants from a fluid. In one embodiment, a receptacle having a chamber for accommodating a fluid to be treated may be provided. A porous matrix having nanoscaled pores may thereafter be placed within the chamber.

Upon surface contact between the fluid and the porous matrix, the particulates and/or contaminants may be directed within the porous matrix and trapped therein. If there is no movement of drinking water within the portable containers or bottles, the contaminants may still removed by slow molecular displacement or diffusion into the porous matrix. In an embodiment, levels of contaminants removed from the fluid may be indicated, as well as whether the ability of the porous matrix to remove additional contaminants has been exhausted.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present invention provides, in one embodiment, a system purification of fluid for consumption by removing particulates, such as impure and undesirable constituents, contaminants, such as microorganisms, biological contaminants, organic and inorganic compounds and elements, and/or matters or substances ranging from about 1 nanometer (nm) to about 100 nm or larger from the fluid, for instance water, so that the resulting treated or purified fluid will be safe to consume, i.e., the fluid has levels of contaminants not exceed the prescribed limits intended for human consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a system <b>10</b> having a receptacle <b>11</b>, for example, a bottle, a container, or the like, into which a volume of fluid to be treated or purified may be placed. The receptacle <b>11</b>, in one embodiment, may include a chamber <b>12</b> for accommodating a volume of fluid, and an opening <b>13</b> through which a volume of fluid may be introduced into the chamber <b>12</b>. A cover <b>14</b> may be provided across the opening <b>13</b> to prevent spillage of fluid from within the chamber <b>12</b>. The cover <b>14</b>, in one embodiment, may be a snap-on cover, a threaded cover, or any other cover known in the art, so long as it can operate to prevent fluid from spilling from within the chamber <b>12</b>. Although illustrated as a portable container, the receptacle <b>11</b> may be larger in scale and can be of any size, depending on the application of interest. In addition, the receptacle <b>11</b> may be made from a transparent material to permit viewing of the fluid content therein.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The system <b>10</b> may also include a porous matrix, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, positioned within the chamber <b>12</b> for the removal of particulates and/or contaminants from the fluid within chamber <b>12</b>. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, porous matrix <b>20</b> may include a nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b> having a large volume of pores <b>23</b>. In addition, the porous matrix <b>20</b> may be provided with a fluid contact surface <b>24</b> against or across which fluid within the chamber <b>12</b> may flow, and a substantially fluid impermeable surface <b>25</b> across which fluid within the porous matrix <b>20</b> and chamber <b>12</b> cannot pass. Pores <b>23</b>, in one embodiment, may be nanoscale in size, ranging from about 1 nanometer (nm) to about 100 nm. In this manner, particles and/or contaminants ranging from about 1 nm to about 10 nm or larger can be removed from the fluid. The pores <b>23</b> may include a total volume ranging from about 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup>/g to about 1.0 cm<sup>3</sup>/g. In a preferred embodiment, the total volume of pores <b>23</b> may range from about 0.8 cm<sup>3</sup>/g to about 0.95 cm<sup>3</sup>/g, with a total specific surface area ranging from at least approximately 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g to approximately 3000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and higher.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b> may include, in one embodiment, a plurality of layers <b>22</b>, each having pores <b>23</b> within a predetermined size range. In such an embodiment, layers <b>22</b> may be arranged so that the pores <b>23</b> in each successive layer <b>22</b> get successively smaller in size, moving from the layer immediately adjacent the contact surface <b>24</b> to the layer immediately adjacent the substantially impermeable surface <b>25</b>. In this manner, smaller particulates and/or contaminants may be permitted to move through the larger pores adjacent the contact surface <b>24</b> and into the smaller pores adjacent the substantially impermeable surface <b>25</b> where they can be trapped and retained.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b> may be designed without distinctive layers <b>22</b>, such that pores <b>23</b> of various nanoscale size ranges may be interspersed throughout the entire nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b>. Although not illustrated, it should be appreciated that the nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b> may be provided with a plurality of layers as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, while each layer may include pores <b>23</b> of various nanoscale size ranges interspersed therein, similar to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The porous matrix <b>20</b> used in connection with the system <b>10</b> of the present invention may, in one embodiment, be formed from, for instance, porous char generated from various starting materials, for example, discarded or used automobile tires or other materials that can generate a relatively high fixed carbon content within the porous char. Of course, new automobile tires or similar starting materials may also be used to generated the porous char. In one embodiment, the starting materials may be heated in a reactor, within which the environment may be controlled, initially from room temperature to about 250° C. to 300° C. During this initial heating period, a mixture of condensable and non-condensable gases may be given off from the starting material within the reactor. This mixture of gases, which can be captured for reintroduction at a later stage, can typically include approximately 25%-35% carbon dioxide, approximately 10%-15% carbon monoxide, approximately 5%-10% methane, approximately 1%-5% volatile acids, with the remaining portion containing a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, hydrocarbons, i.e., organic materials.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Upon the reaching between 250° C. to 300° C., an exothermic reaction can occur within the reactor pushing the temperature of the reactor and thus the resulting porous char to temperatures ranging from about 500° C. to about 600° C. During this period, the previously captured condensable and non-condensable gases may be reintroduced into the reactor for exposure to the porous char. The resulting porous char may contain, at this stage, mostly macro-pores and may only be moderately dense in nature. To subsequently obtain a nanostructured adsorption material, this moderately dense porous char must be transformed to a relatively high-density material with a relatively high fixed carbon content.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">To generate a relatively high fixed carbon content in the porous char, impurities present in the starting materials, and in the transformed material, i.e., porous char, may be removed, using known procedures, at various stages during the conversion process to produce a fixed carbon content in the porous char of greater than about 90% to about 95%. It should be noted that, on average, approximately 20 pounds of starting material, e.g., used tires, will yield about 4 pounds of porous char with a fixed carbon content of between 90% to 95%. Once the condensable and non-condensable gases have been reintroduced into the reactor, the temperature within the reactor may be increased so that the porous char may be heated at a relatively high temperature range of from about 1000° C. to about 1100° C. to enlarge the pores within the porous char. During this stage, a controlled mixture of steam and air may be introduced into the reactor. In one embodiment, for approximately 1 pound of porous char, from about 1.0 pound to about 1.5 pounds of steam and air mixture may be injected into the reactor. The amount of steam and air may vary depending upon how much the pores within the porous char are to be enlarged, and could vary from about 0.5 pounds to over 2.0 pounds per pound of porous char. The introduction of steam and air into the reactor, in one embodiment, can generate a producer gas in the presence of the hot porous char. The content of the producer gas may vary, but can contain about 15%-20% hydrogen, 20%-25% carbon monoxide, with the remainder a mixture of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and other organic materials.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">By exposing the porous char to such a temperature range and a mixture of steam and air, the porous char may be transformed into a relatively high density nanostructured material having the desired porosity. Typically, approximately 1 pound of the high density nanostructured material can be generated from the 4 pounds of the porous char. The exposure of the porous char to such high temperature, in addition to enlarging and generating pores of various nanoscale sizes, can provide the resulting nanostructured adsorption material with internal surface areas ranging from at least approximately 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g to approximately 3000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and higher.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The resulting nanostructured material, similar to nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-B</figref>, may be used in connection with the porous matrix <b>20</b> of the present invention. It should be noted that the process of enlarging the pores structure to specific nanoscale ranges, along with the removal of impurities within the porous char can impart special properties to the nanostructured material. In particular, such a process can impart the nanostructured material with adsorption properties necessary for removal of particulates and contaminants.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition to the size of the nanoscale pores, the ability of nanostructured material to adsorb particulates and contaminant molecules can also be dependent upon the structure of the nanoscale pores, the total surface area, the carbon particle size, and the void space between carbon particles. Specifically, as the nanostructured adsorption material, such as item <b>21</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, essentially comprises nanocarbon particles <b>26</b>, the spaces <b>27</b> between these nanocarbon particles must be sufficiently small, i.e., nanoscale in size and smaller than the molecules of the fluid, so as to facilitate the fluid going through the pores <b>23</b> within the nanoadsorption material <b>21</b> and not through spaces around the pores <b>23</b>. Likewise, should the carbon particles be larger than nanoscale size, such large carbon particles may block, partially block, and/or create interference with the flow of the fluid into the pores <b>23</b>, thus allowing fluid to flow away from the pores <b>23</b>. As a result, particulates and/or contaminants within the fluid flow may escape entrapment within the pores <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be appreciated that since one surface <b>25</b> of the porous matrix <b>20</b> is substantially impermeable to fluid, the porous matrix <b>20</b> of the present invention does not have flow-through properties similar to commercially available filters. Rather, fluid flowing against or across the contact surface <b>24</b> will enter and exit along the contact surface <b>24</b>. Specifically, fluid flowing against or across the contact surface <b>24</b> into the nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b> cannot thereafter exit through surface <b>25</b>. In the presence of the impermeable surface <b>25</b>, the fluid directed into one opening of a pore <b>23</b> adjacent the impermeable surface <b>25</b> may subsequently be allowed to flow out another opening of pore <b>23</b> not blocked by the impermeable surface <b>25</b>, as illustrated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, and eventually make its way out through the contact surface <b>24</b>. Impermeable surface <b>25</b>, in one embodiment of the present invention, may be generated by applying a layer of a substantially fluid impermeable material to one surface of the porous matrix <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The porous matrix <b>20</b> may further, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, be impregnated with, for instance, silver or silver compound(s) so as to minimize microbial growth within the porous matrix <b>20</b>. In particular, the nanostructured adsorption material <b>21</b> may be treated with a silver compound in the presence of acid or alkaline materials, depending on the silver compound used, so that the silver compound can be substantially evenly distributed against internal surfaces of pores <b>23</b>. Since this process can generate undesirable materials during the chemical reactions, such materials can be removed, in one embodiment, by leaching. The process employed herein can enhance the properties of the porous matrix <b>20</b>. In addition to removal of particulates and contaminants, the presence of the silver compound, as noted, can minimize microbial growth within the porous matrix <b>20</b>. Furthermore, it should be noted that the silver content provided within the porous matrix <b>20</b> using the process described herein may be at a level far below the permissible limits of silver in drinking water. In an embodiment, the silver content may be approximately 1 percent by weight. Additionally, the process employed herein can minimize the leaching of the silver content from within the porous matrix <b>20</b>. In this manner, the presence of the silver compound within the porous matrix <b>20</b> does not act to elevate the level of silver above permissible limits.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-B</figref>, there is illustrated a system <b>30</b> for purification of fluid by removing contaminants, such as microorganisms, organic, inorganic and particulate matter from the fluid.

The porous matrix <b>35</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, and used in connection with system <b>30</b>, may be embedded within chamber walls <b>36</b>, so that contact surface <b>37</b> may be exposed to the fluid within the chamber <b>32</b>, while substantially impermeable surface <b>38</b> may be positioned against chamber walls <b>36</b>. In one embodiment, the porous matrix <b>35</b> may be embedded substantially circumferentially about chamber walls <b>36</b>.

In one embodiment of the present invention, porous matrix <b>35</b> may be provided with a thickness ranging from about 0.20 mm to about 0.30 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an alternate embodiment, instead of being embedded within the walls <b>36</b> of the chamber <b>32</b>, the porous matrix <b>35</b>, made from a nanostructured adsorption material, may be applied directly onto the walls <b>36</b>. In one embodiment, the porous matrix may be coated onto walls <b>36</b> as a thin film or layer. Alternatively, the porous matrix <b>35</b> may be designed as a sheet of material that can be adhered to the walls <b>36</b> of chamber <b>32</b>.

In either embodiment, the thin film or sheet of porous matrix <b>35</b> may be designed so that it is sufficiently flexible and pliable for removal or insertion across opening <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Looking now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, there is illustrated a system <b>40</b> for purification of fluid by removing contaminants, such as microorganisms, organic, inorganic and particulate matter from the fluid, similar to the systems disclosed above. The system <b>40</b>, in one embodiment, may include a receptacle <b>41</b> having a chamber <b>42</b> for accommodating a volume of fluid, and an opening <b>43</b> through which a volume of fluid may be introduced into the chamber <b>42</b>. A cover <b>44</b> may be provided across the opening <b>43</b> to prevent spillage of fluid from within the chamber <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The system <b>40</b> may also include a porous matrix <b>45</b> positioned within the chamber <b>42</b> for the removal of contaminants from the fluid. The porous matrix <b>45</b>, being substantially similarly to the previous porous matrices, acts to retain or trap therein contaminants from the fluid. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the porous matrix <b>45</b>, made from a nanostructured adsorption material, may be designed as a substantially cylindrical tube <b>47</b> having a contact surface <b>471</b>, and an opposing impermeable surface <b>472</b>. The porous matrix <b>45</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, may be positioned away from walls <b>46</b> of chamber <b>42</b>. In one embodiment, as illustrated from the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, porous matrix <b>45</b> may be positioned substantially concentrically to the walls <b>46</b>, and may be designed to have a diameter that permits its removal from or placement within the chamber <b>42</b> through opening <b>43</b>. In order to maintain porous matrix <b>45</b> substantially concentric to the walls <b>46</b>, a base (not shown) may be provided within which porous matrix <b>45</b> may be positioned. Alternatively, porous matrix <b>45</b> may be permitted to float freely within the chamber <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is illustrated another system <b>50</b> for purification of a fluid by removing contaminants, such as microorganisms, organic, inorganic and particulate matter from the fluid, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>50</b>, similar to the previously disclosed systems, may include a receptacle <b>51</b> having a chamber <b>52</b> for accommodating a volume of fluid, and an opening <b>53</b> through which a volume of fluid may be introduced into the chamber <b>52</b>. A cover <b>54</b> may be provided across the opening <b>53</b> to prevent spillage of fluid from within the chamber <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The system <b>50</b> may also include a porous matrix <b>55</b> positioned within the chamber <b>52</b> for retaining, trapping, and thus removal of contaminants from the fluid. The porous matrix <b>55</b>, made from a nanostructured adsorption material, and in accordance with this particular embodiment of the present invention, may be provided as a loose mass of macro particles <b>56</b> that can freely move within the fluid in chamber <b>52</b>. Each of the particles <b>56</b> may include a contact surface <b>561</b> and an impermeable core (not shown), so that fluid may be prevented from flowing through the particles <b>56</b>. The particles <b>56</b>, in one embodiment, may be uniform in size and shape, or as illustrated, vary in size and shape. It should be appreciated that the particles <b>56</b> may be of a size and shape that would facilitate their removal from or placement within the chamber <b>52</b> through opening <b>53</b> for replacement purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In another embodiment, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a system <b>60</b> is provided for purification of fluid by removing contaminants, such as microorganisms, organic, inorganic and particulate matter from the fluid. The system <b>60</b>, as with the previously disclosed systems, may include a receptacle <b>61</b> having a chamber <b>62</b> for accommodating a volume of fluid, and an opening <b>63</b> through which a volume of fluid may be introduced into the chamber <b>62</b>. A cover <b>64</b> may be provided across the opening <b>63</b> to prevent spillage of fluid from within the chamber <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The system <b>60</b> may also include a porous matrix <b>65</b>, made from a nanostructured adsorption material, that is positioned within the chamber <b>52</b> for retaining, trapping, and thus removal of contaminants from the fluid. The porous matrix <b>65</b>, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, may be placed circumferentially about walls <b>66</b> at an end <b>67</b> of the chamber <b>62</b> opposite the opening <b>63</b>. In addition, porous matrix <b>65</b> may be designed to be sufficiently flexible and pliable to permit its removal from and placement within the chamber <b>62</b> through opening <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an alternate embodiment, receptacle <b>61</b> may be provided with a removable end <b>67</b> about which porous matrix <b>65</b> may be circumferentially situated. In this manner, should the porous matrix <b>65</b> needs to be exchanged, the end <b>67</b> may be removed from receptacle <b>61</b> and disposed along with matrix <b>65</b>, and a new end <b>67</b> with new porous matrix <b>65</b> may be reattached to receptacle <b>61</b>. To permit removal from the receptacle <b>61</b>, the end <b>67</b> and the receptacle <b>61</b> may be provided with threaded engagement. Alternatively, other engagement mechanisms known in the art, for example, snap-fit etc., may be used, so long as such engagement can prevent leakage of fluid from within the chamber <b>62</b>, while permitting easy removal of end <b>67</b> from the receptacle <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the system of the present invention may be used to purify fluid by removing particulates and/or contaminants from the fluid, such as water, when the levels of particulates and/or contaminants exceed the prescribed limits for fluid that is intended for human consumption. The limits of contaminants in the drinking fluids may be prescribed by the regulators. In operation, fluid <b>71</b> that may include particulates and/or contaminants may be initially be introduced into the chamber of receptacle <b>72</b>. Once introduced within the receptacle <b>72</b>, the fluid along with the molecules of contaminants therein, when come into contact with the porous matrix having the nanostructured adsorption material (e.g., flowing against or across the contact surface of the porous matrix), may be directed into the pores of the nanostructured adsorption material, wherein the molecules of contaminants may be trapped. It should be noted that the movement of fluid within the receptacle caused by or due to, for instance, shaking or moving of the receptacle should be sufficient to direct the flow of contaminants into the pores. If the situation is such that there is no movement of fluid within the receptacle, the contaminants may still be removed by slow molecular displacement or diffusion of molecules into the porous matrix within the receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Since the phenomenon occurs at a molecular level, the particulates and/or contaminants typically cannot be released from the pores within which they are trapped without enormous pressure or the application of heat at elevated levels. As the particulates and/or contaminants enter and become trapped within the pores, the weight of nanostructured adsorption material can increase to a measurable difference. Such an increase can be detected and displayed, for example, by a sensor, to indicate, for instance, the levels of contaminants removed from the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Accordingly, still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a sensor <b>73</b> may be coupled to the receptacle <b>72</b>, such that the sensor <b>73</b> may be in communication with a porous matrix within the receptacle in order to display the levels of contaminants removed from the fluid. Sensor <b>73</b> can be any sensor which can detect a pressure, weight or heat differential between a porous matrix at time t<sub>o </sub>and the same porous matrix at time t<sub>n</sub>, subsequent to exposure of the porous matrix to the fluid. In one embodiment, the sensor <b>73</b> may include pressure detector sufficiently thin (e.g., thin layer wired mesh or sheet), so as to be capable of being embedded within the nanostructured adsorption material of the porous matrix, and a display in communication with the detector. The pressure detector can act to transform the pressure differential between t<sub>o </sub>and t<sub>n </sub>into electrical signals that can subsequently be process and shown on the display as the amount of particulates or contaminants in the porous matrix or the amount of contaminant removed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The sensor <b>73</b> may alternatively employ a weight sensor. It is noted that if at t<sub>o </sub>the weight of the porous matrix is x milligram, then at t<sub>n</sub>, for instance, 15 seconds, when the nanostructured material of the porous matrix has had a chance to adsorb the particulates and/or contaminants, the weight of nanostructured adsorption material will be x+y, with y being the weight of contaminants that has been removed from the fluid. The weight increase due to the adsorption of the contaminants can be transformed to electrical signals, which can subsequently be displayed as information on a scale in terms of percentage of contaminants removed from the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The sensor <b>73</b> may also employ a heat sensor. If, for instance, at t<sub>o </sub>the temperature of the porous matrix is x degrees, then at t<sub>n</sub>, for instance, 15 seconds, when the nanostructured material of the porous matrix has had a chance to adsorb the particulates and/or contaminants, the heat generated in the nanostructured adsorption material will be x+y, with y being the temperature increase due to the adsorption of contaminants in the nanostructured material. This temperature increase can be transformed to electrical signals, which can subsequently be displayed as information on a scale in terms of percentage of contaminants removed from the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Whether using the pressure, weight and/or heat detector, when the nanostructured adsorption material approaches about 90% its capacity level for trapping particulates and/or contaminants, the sensor <b>73</b>, in one embodiment, can be designed to warn the user, for instance, by audio, visual, or other applicable indicators, that the porous matrix needs replacing or that the receptacle can no longer be used, if the receptacle is designed to be a disposable system.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The system of the present invention, accordingly, may be refilled over and over again with fluid to be treated. The system may be used successively to generate purified fluid meeting standards or limits prescribed for human consumption, until the nanostructured adsorption material of the porous matrix approaches its exhaustive capacity for trapping and retaining particles therein, i.e., having entrapped and retained therein particulates and/or contaminants at about 90% of its capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While the invention has been described in connection with the specific embodiments thereof, it will be understood that it is capable of further modification. Furthermore, this application is intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention, including such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which the invention pertains, and as fall within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
