<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/592,298; 60/592,299 and 60/592,315, all filed Jul. 29, 2004.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to eyeglasses holders and more particularly to magnetic eyeglass holders.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typical eyeglasses consist of a frame body that houses two lenses on either side of a nose piece. Attached to the frame body are two temple bars that extend from two ends of the frame body. The temple bars pivot between an open position perpendicular with the frame body and a closed position parallel with the frame body. Sometimes attached to the temple bars are separate ear pieces, or temple tips. The temple bars and nose piece support the frame on the head of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Individuals often remove their eyeglasses temporarily. They may put them down and not recall where, they may hang them around their neck where they bounce against their chest, or they may put them in a pocket and have them fall out and/or get damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To solve this problem, the prior art teaches using mechanical clasps to clip eyeglasses to a garment worn by the user. These are cumbersome and, like all mechanical clasps, may come loose. Some mechanical clasps also depend on the availability of a shirt pocket, a cap visor, belt, holder, straps, or the like. In addition, clips may work well initially, but fatigue can cause metal clips to weaken and lose their ability to hold eyeglasses securely. Moreover, clips can break, thereby causing the eyeglasses to come loose, fall and break, or be lost.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The use of magnets on eyeglass frames for various purposes is also well known in the art. For example, a number of eyeglass frames have magnets that magnetize the wearer for health benefits. Other eyeglass frames use magnets to hold eyeglass frame sections together, thereby facilitating disassembly and reassembly in a new configuration, with auxiliary frames, lenses, or the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to a magnetic eyeglasses holder that includes a clip configured for attaching to an object and a base attached to the clip, wherein the base has a least one magnet. The at least one magnet allows for attractive magnetic communication with each temple bar of an eyeglasses such that when folded the eyeglasses are held in place on the holder. The clip may be a spring clip formed from wire and has first and second ends configured for insertion into an end of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The base can include at least two spaced apart magnets, wherein the magnets are partially positioned within at least one recess in the base. The magnet can be fixed in the recess or rotate within the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The magnet may have a cylindrical shape or it may be a rectangular shaped post extending outwardly from the base.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The magnet may also extend through the base providing for attractive magnetic communication on both sides of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The base may include a first planar section and a second planar section in which the second section is at an angle in relation to the first section, wherein the angle may be about 90°. A magnet can be positioned on the second planar section such that the magnet is offset from the clip.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The base can include a rotator rotationally engaged with the base and the rotator may include the at least one magnet or two magnets. The magnet may be set in the rotator, may be free to rotate within the rotator or may extend through the rotator.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the conception and specific embodiment disclosed may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. It should also be realized by those skilled in the art that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. The novel features which are believed to be characteristic of the invention, both as to its organization and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages will be better understood from the following description when considered in connection with the accompanying figures. It is to be expressly understood, however, that each of the figures is provided for the purpose of illustration and description only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the present invention.</p>
