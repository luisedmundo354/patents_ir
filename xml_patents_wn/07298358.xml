<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display and a driving method to be used for the liquid crystal display and more particularly to the liquid crystal display that can be suitably used when an image including a moving image part and a static image part in a mixed manner is to be displayed and the method for driving the liquid crystal display.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present application claims priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-332283 filed on Sep. 24, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, a liquid crystal display, in particular, out of image display devices, has become large in size and high definition and is used not only for a device to display a static image such as images in a personal computer, word processor, or a like but also for a device to display a moving image such as images in a TV (television) or a like. It is anticipated that a penetration rate of a liquid crystal display in general homes, since its depth is shorter and its occupying area is smaller when compared with those in a TV having a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube), becomes high.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the case of a liquid crystal display, since image data (pixel data) that appeared one frame before is left until new image data is written, an image retention phenomenon or a blur of an edge occurs when a moving image is to be displayed. To solve the problem with the phenomenon, a method in which a backlight is driven by an impulse is available, however, due to the driving method using the impulse, a flicker occurs on a display screen. The flicker is inconspicuous while a moving image is being displayed but becomes conspicuous while a static image is being displayed in some cases and, therefore, a liquid crystal display capable of suppressing the occurrence of a flicker is proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such the conventional technology is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2001-296841 (Pages 11 and 14, and FIGS. 3 and 11.) <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating configurations of a conventional liquid crystal display disclosed in the above patent reference. The liquid crystal display, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, is made up of a switching section <b>1</b>, a high-speed switch <b>2</b>, lamps <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, a light guide section <b>4</b>, and a liquid crystal panel <b>5</b>. In the liquid crystal display device, whether an image to be displayed is a moving image or a static image is judged by a judging section (not shown) and, when the image to be displayed is a moving image, power is fed through the switching section <b>1</b> to the high-speed switch <b>2</b> and the lamps <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>operating as a backlight flash alternately during one frame of a video inputting signal. Then, light from the lamps <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>is diffused by the light guide section <b>4</b> to a direction of the liquid crystal panel <b>5</b> and is modulated in a manner to correspond to a display image on the liquid crystal panel <b>5</b> and is then emitted to a side of a display surface (screen). Moreover, when the image to be displayed is a static image, power is fed through the switching section <b>1</b> to the lamp <b>3</b><i>a </i>to allow the lamp <b>3</b><i>a </i>to be turned ON all the time. The light from the lamp <b>3</b><i>a </i>is diffused by the light guide section <b>4</b> to a direction of the liquid crystal panel <b>5</b> and is modulated in a manner to correspond to a display image on the liquid crystal panel <b>5</b> and is then emitted to the side of the display surface.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating configurations of another conventional liquid crystal display disclosed in the above patent reference. The liquid crystal display, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, includes an image receiving section <b>11</b>, a judging section <b>12</b>, a sorting section <b>13</b>, a switching section <b>14</b>, and a display device <b>15</b>. The display device <b>15</b> has a peripheral portion driving section <b>15</b><i>a</i>, a central portion driving section <b>15</b><i>b</i>, and a moving image corresponding control section <b>15</b><i>c</i>. The display surface (screen) of the display device <b>15</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, has a display element section <b>16</b> making up its central portion and a display element section <b>17</b> making up its peripheral portion. An exclusive backlight (not shown) is formed on the display element section <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the above liquid crystal display, image data output from the image receiving section <b>11</b> is sorted into two groups in the sorting section <b>13</b>, one group being displayed in a peripheral portion of the display screen and another group being displayed in a central portion of the display screen and the image data to be displayed in the peripheral portion is transmitted via the switching section <b>14</b> to the peripheral portion driving section <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the display device <b>15</b> and the image data to be displayed in the central portion is transmitted via the switching section <b>14</b> to the central portion driving section <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the display device <b>15</b>. Moreover, a judgement of whether the above image data is to be corresponded to a moving image or to a static image is made by the judging section <b>12</b> and, if the image data is to be corresponded to a moving image, the image data being displayed in the central portion having been sent out from the sorting section <b>13</b> is transmitted via the switching section <b>14</b> to the moving image corresponding control section <b>15</b><i>c </i>in the display device <b>15</b>. The moving image corresponding control section <b>15</b><i>c </i>lets the sent-out image data be displayed on the display element section <b>16</b> making up the central portion on the display surface and turns on a backlight (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the conventional liquid crystal display devices described above have following problems. That is, in the liquid crystal display device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when a moving image is to be displayed, the lamps <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>alternately flash during one frame and, at this point, while the lamps <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>are being lit, in the liquid crystal panel <b>5</b>, liquid crystal cells whose responding operations to pixel data have been completed and liquid crystal cells whose responding operations to pixel data have not been completed exist, thus causing occurrence of a luminance inclination in the display screen. The brightness inclination becomes conspicuous as the liquid crystal panel <b>5</b> becomes large in size, which presents a problem in that a quality of a displayed image declines.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, the liquid crystal display device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is fabricated on the premise that a moving image is displayed only in a center portion of the display screen and, therefore, lighting of the backlight (not shown) is performed in a manner to correspond to a static image in a peripheral portion of the display screen and, when a moving image is to be displayed in the peripheral portion of the display screen, an afterimage occurs, which presents a problem that a quality of the displayed image declines.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In view of the above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a liquid crystal display which is capable of reducing occurrence in an image retention phenomenon or a blur of an edge when a moving image is to be displayed and of eliminating occurrence of a flicker when a static image is to be displayed and of improving a quality of a displayed image including a moving image part and a static image part in a mixed manner.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the foregoing, a preferable mode is one wherein the light source block driving unit (means) is constructed so as to turn OFF a corresponding light source block before a responding operation of each of the liquid crystal cells to feeding of the pixel data is completed and so as to turn ON the corresponding light source block after the responding operation has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Also, a preferable mode is one wherein the image judging unit (means) detects, from the video input signal and for every frame block, a movement vector between a present frame image appearing continuously in terms of time and a prior frame image and sorts, based on the movement vector, the present frame image into a moving image and a static image for every frame block.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the foregoing, a preferable mode is one wherein, in the light source block driving step, the light source block is turned OFF before a responding operation of each liquid crystal cell to feeding of the pixel data is completed and the light source block is turned ON after the responding operation has been completed.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The moving image detecting circuit <b>21</b> has a memory <b>21</b><i>a </i>and a moving image detecting comparator <b>21</b><i>b</i>. The memory <b>21</b><i>a </i>is made up of, for example, a RAM (Random Access Memory) or a like and stores a video input signal VD for every frame. The moving image detecting comparator <b>21</b><i>b </i>divides one frame of the video input signal VD into four frame blocks each corresponding to a length of each of the backlights <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>35</b> in the scanning direction, and judges whether an image corresponding to each of the frame blocks is a moving image or a static image and outputs its judgement result A.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The driving voltage control section <b>22</b> controls, based on the judgement result A, a voltage to be used for the data electrode driving circuit <b>24</b> to drive each liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>(shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in the liquid crystal panel <b>26</b> in an overshooting manner. In the LUT <b>23</b>, data on a voltage to be used for the overshoot driving that can be used suitably to display a moving image, and data on the voltage that can be used suitably to display a static image are stored. The lighting timing duty control section <b>27</b> is made up of two or more logical circuits or a like and outputs, based on the judgement result A, a control signal to get a backlight corresponding to an image for a frame block having been judged to be a moving image to flash according to a response characteristic of each liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>in the liquid crystal panel <b>26</b> to feeding of image data (pixel data) and also a control signal to allow a backlight <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, or <b>35</b> corresponding to an image for a frame block having been judged to be a static image to be turned ON all the time. In the embodiment in particular, the lighting timing duty control section <b>27</b> turns OFF the backlight before a responding operation of each liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>to feeding of image data is not completed and turns ON the backlight after the responding operation has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The B/L block [<b>1</b>] driving circuit <b>28</b> is made up of, for example, an inverter or a like and drives the backlight <b>32</b> based on a control signal output from the lighting timing duty control section <b>27</b>.

The data electrodes X<sub>i </sub>are formed at specified intervals in an “x” direction (that is, first direction), to which a voltage corresponding to pixel data D<sub>i </sub>is applied. The scanning electrodes Y<sub>j </sub>are formed at specified intervals in a “y” direction (that is, scanning direction or second direction) orthogonal to the “x” direction, to which a scanning signal OUT<sub>j </sub>used to write pixel data D<sub>i </sub>is sequentially fed. Each of the pixel cells <b>40</b><sub>i,j </sub>is formed in a one-to-one relationship to an intersecting region between each of the data electrodes X<sub>i </sub>and each of the scanning electrodes Y<sub>j </sub>and is made up of a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) <b>41</b><sub>i,j</sub>, a liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j</sub>, and a common electrodes COM. The TFT <b>41</b><sub>i,j </sub>is controlled ON and OFF based on a scanning signal OUT<sub>j </sub>and applies, when being put in an ON state, a voltage corresponding to the pixel data D<sub>i </sub>to the liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j</sub>. In the liquid crystal panel <b>26</b>, when a scanning signal OUT<sub>j </sub>is sequentially fed to the scanning electrodes Y<sub>j </sub>and the corresponding pixel data D<sub>i </sub>is fed to the data electrodes X<sub>i</sub>, the corresponding pixel data D<sub>i </sub>is fed to each liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>and modulation is performed on light fed from the backlights <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>35</b> in a manner to correspond to an image to be displayed.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating configurations of the liquid crystal panel <b>26</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and showing positions of backlights <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>35</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The liquid crystal panel <b>26</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, includes a pair of polarizers <b>46</b><i>a </i>and <b>46</b><i>b</i>, a glass substrate <b>43</b>, an array substrate <b>44</b>, and a liquid crystal layer <b>45</b> interposed between the glass substrate <b>43</b> and the array substrate <b>44</b>. On the glass substrate <b>43</b> is formed a color filter <b>50</b> having red (R), green (G), and blue (B) colors, in which one dot is made up of three pixels, one emitting an R color, another emitting a G color, and another emitting a B color. The array substrate <b>44</b> is a glass substrate on which active elements such as the TFT <b>41</b><sub>i,j </sub>(in FIG. <b>2</b>) or a like are formed. The backlights <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>35</b> are arranged on a rear side of the liquid crystal panel <b>26</b> and use light from a white fluorescent lamp as light from the flat light source. The backlights <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>35</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, are fabricated so as to be almost the same in size as the display screen of the liquid crystal panel <b>26</b> and to be divided in a scanning direction of the liquid crystal panel <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the liquid crystal panel <b>26</b>, white light from the backlights <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>35</b> becomes linearly polarized light after having passed through the polarizer <b>46</b><i>b </i>and then enters the liquid crystal layer <b>45</b>. The liquid crystal layer <b>45</b> has a function of changing a shape of the polarized light, however, this function is predetermined by a state of an orientation of a liquid crystal and therefore the shape of the polarized light is controlled by a voltage corresponding to pixel data D<sub>i</sub>. Whether or not light to be emitted is adsorbed by the polarizer <b>46</b><i>b </i>is determined depending on a shape of the polarized light emitted from the liquid crystal layer <b>45</b>. Thus, transmittance of light is controlled by a voltage corresponding to the pixel data D<sub>i</sub>. Moreover, a color image can be obtained by additive color mixture of light having passed through each of the R, G, and B pixels in the color filter <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a time chart explaining operations of the liquid crystal display shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A driving method to be used in the liquid crystal display is described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A video input signal VD is stored in the memory <b>21</b><i>a </i>for every frame. The video input signal VD is divided by the moving image detecting comparator <b>21</b><i>b </i>into four frame blocks [<b>1</b>], [<b>2</b>], [<b>3</b>], and [<b>4</b>] each corresponding to a length of each of the backlights <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>35</b> in a scanning direction. Then, a movement vector between a present frame image of an image appearing continuously in terms of time and a prior frame image being stored in the memory <b>21</b><i>a </i>is detected from the video input signal VD in every frame block and whether the present frame image is a moving image or a static image is judged based on the movement vector for every frame block, and the judgement result A is output (image judging process).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The judgement result A is input to the driving voltage control section <b>22</b> which controls, based on the judgement result A and data being stored in the LUT <b>23</b>, a voltage to be used for the data electrode driving circuit <b>24</b> to drive the liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>in the liquid crystal panel <b>26</b> in an overshooting manner. Moreover, the video input signal VD is input to the data electrode driving circuit <b>24</b> from which a voltage corresponding to pixel data D<sub>i </sub>is applied to each of the data electrodes X<sub>i </sub>in the liquid crystal panel <b>26</b>. This voltage is controlled by the driving voltage control section <b>22</b> so that it has a voltage being suitable to overshooting driving. Also, a scanning signal OUT<sub>j </sub>is applied sequentially from the scanning electrode driving circuit <b>25</b> to each of the scanning electrodes Y<sub>j </sub>in the liquid crystal panel <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the other hand, the judgement result A is input to the lighting timing duty control section <b>27</b> which outputs a signal to get a backlight (one of <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>) corresponding to an image for a frame block having been judged to be a moving image to flash according to a response characteristic of the liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>to feeding of pixel data D<sub>i </sub>and a signal to get a backlight (one of <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>) corresponding to an image for a frame block having been judged to be a static image to be turned ON all the time. These signals are input to the B/L block [<b>1</b>] driving circuit <b>28</b>, B/L block [<b>2</b>] driving circuit <b>29</b>, B/L block [<b>3</b>] driving circuit <b>30</b>, and B/L block [<b>4</b>] driving circuit <b>31</b> and the backlights <b>32</b> <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>35</b> are driven respectively (light source block driving process). At this point, the backlight is turned OFF before a responding operation of the liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>to the feeding of the pixel data D<sub>i </sub>is not completed and the backlight <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, or <b>35</b> is turned ON after the responding operation has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when an image corresponding to the frame block [<b>1</b>] is judged to be a static image during an “n” frame in a video input signal VD and to be a moving image during a “n+1” frame, the backlight <b>32</b> is turned ON all the time during the “n” frame. During a period of the “n+1” frame, the backlight is turned OFF at time t<b>1</b> and, at the same time, a responding operation of the liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>corresponding to the frame block [<b>1</b>] starts. The responding operation of the liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>is completed at time t<b>2</b> and the backlight <b>32</b> is turned ON during a period of T<b>1</b> (for example, during a period of ¼ frames) from the time t<b>2</b> to the time t<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When an image corresponding to the frame block [<b>2</b>] is judged to be a moving image during the “n” frame and “n+1” frame of the video input signal VD, the backlight <b>33</b> that was turned ON during a period of T<b>2</b> (for example, during a period of ¼ frames) is turned OFF at time t<b>4</b> and a responding operation of the liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>corresponding to the frame block [<b>2</b>] is started. The responding operation of the liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>is completed at time t<b>1</b> and the backlight <b>33</b> is turned ON during T<b>3</b> (for example, during a period of ¼ frames) from time t<b>1</b> to time t<b>5</b>. The backlight <b>33</b> that was turned ON during the period of T<b>3</b> is turned OFF at time t<b>5</b> and a responding operation of the liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>corresponding to the frame block [<b>2</b>] is started. At time t<b>3</b>, the responding operation of the liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>is completed and, during a period of T<b>4</b> (for example, during a period of ¼ frame) from time t<b>3</b> to time t<b>8</b>, the backlight <b>33</b> is turned ON.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Similarly, when an image corresponding to the frame block [<b>3</b>] is judged to be a moving image during the “n” frame and “n+1” frame of the video input signal VD, the backlight <b>34</b> that was turned ON during a period of T<b>5</b> (for example, during a period of ¼ frame) is turned OFF at time t<b>6</b> and, at the same time, a responding operation of the liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>corresponding to the frame block [<b>3</b>] is started. The responding operation of the liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>is completed at time t<b>5</b> and the backlight <b>34</b> is turned ON during T<b>6</b> (for example, during a period of ¼ frame) from time t<b>5</b> to time t<b>7</b>. The backlight <b>34</b> that was turned ON during the period of T<b>6</b> is turned OFF at time t<b>7</b> and a responding operation of the liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>corresponding to the frame block [<b>3</b>] is started. At time t<b>8</b>, the responding operation of the liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When an image corresponding to the frame block [<b>4</b>] is judged to be a static image during the “n” frame and “n+1” frame in the video input signal VD, the backlight <b>35</b> is turned ON all the time.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, in the above embodiment, by arranging backlights <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>35</b> being divided in a scanning direction of the liquid crystal panel <b>26</b> and by dividing one frame of a video input signal VD into four frame blocks [<b>1</b>], [<b>2</b>], [<b>3</b>], and [<b>4</b>] each corresponding to a length of each of the backlights <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>35</b> in the scanning direction, and by having the moving image detecting circuit <b>21</b> judge whether an image corresponding to each of the frame blocks [<b>1</b>], [<b>2</b>], [<b>3</b>], and [<b>4</b>] is a moving image or a static image and having the lighting timing duty control section <b>27</b> get the backlight corresponding to an image for the frame block having been judged to be a moving image to flash according to a response characteristic of each liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>to feeding of pixel data D<sub>i </sub>and also allow a backlight corresponding to an image for the frame block having been judged to be a static image to be turned ON all the time, occurrence in an image retention phenomenon or a blur of an edge is reduced when a moving image is to be displayed and no flicker occurs when a static image is to be displayed, which enables improvements in a quality of a displayed image.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It is apparent that the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments but may be changed and modified without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, in the above embodiment, the present invention is applied to transmittance-type liquid crystal panel, however, the present invention may be applied to a reflection-type liquid crystal panel. That is, by arranging four light guide bodies being divided in a scanning direction (equal to an arrangement direction of the backlights <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>35</b>) on a side of a display surface of the liquid crystal panel as in the case of the embodiment and by installing a light source such as a cold cathode fluorescent tube on a light incident side of each of the light guide bodies and a reflection plate on a rear side of the liquid crystal panel, the same effects obtained in the embodiment can be achieved. In the above embodiment, the backlights <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>35</b> are made up of the cold cathode fluorescent tube, however, any component, so long as a needed amount of light is obtained, such as an LED (Light Emitting Diode), EL (Electroluminescent device), or a like may be used. Moreover, in the embodiment, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each of the periods of T<b>1</b> to T<b>6</b> is set to be a ¼ frame, however, so long as a period is one during which a responding operation of a liquid crystal cell <b>42</b><sub>i,j </sub>has been completed, the period may be set to be not only a ¼ frame but also a ½ frame. When the ½ frame is employed, to obtain the same brightness as can be acquired when the period is set to be the ¼ frame, the amount of light is set to be ½.</p>
