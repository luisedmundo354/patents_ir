<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention generally relates to a liner assembly for a duct, and more particularly to a liner assembly including an acoustically active retainer.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional turbine and turbofan engines for aircraft include a plurality of fan blades that rotate within a duct commonly known as a fan case. The fan case serves as a protective covering to protect the fan blades and the aircraft. Further the fan case channels airflow into the turbine engine. The inner surface of the fan case is constructed to withstand impacts from objects that may come into contact with the fan case and includes acoustical features to reduce noise emitted from the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The acoustical features include a layer of noise attenuation structures covered by a protective face layer including a plurality of openings. The face layer is typically a thin sheet of metal or composite material mounted over the noise attenuation structure. Noise causing pressure disturbances emanate through the openings within the face layer into the noise attenuation structure where the pressure disturbances dissipate to reduce the total amount of noise.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The fan case liner includes seams between the several pieces of material used to form the protective face layer. These seams typically are required to accommodate assembly of the noise attenuation structure and face layer. The seam is covered with a mechanical retainer that is bonded to the face layer on either side of the seam. The mechanical retainer covers any underlying openings within the face layer creating an acoustically dead area relative to the rest of the liner assembly. The acoustically dead area reduces the effectiveness of the noise attenuation layer, increasing the total amount of emitted noise.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is desirable to develop a mechanical joint for covering seams in a liner assembly that is acoustically active to improve noise attenuation properties.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An example liner assembly according to this invention includes an acoustically active retainer for covering a seam in a face sheet for improving noise attenuation performance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The example liner assembly includes a noise attenuation layer that is covered by a face sheet. The face sheet includes a first plurality of openings. The noise attenuation layer includes a plurality of individual cells that are each in communication with at least one of the first plurality of openings. Noise energy is communicated through the first plurality of openings into the individual cells and dissipated to reduce noise emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The face sheet is formed from one or several individual sheets with edges adjacent each other that form a seam. The seam results from assembly tolerance stack-ups and also provides for limited expansion and contraction during operation. The seam is covered by a retainer to protect the edges of the face sheet and the underlying noise attenuation layer from damage. The retainer is bonded to the face sheet over the seam and includes a second plurality of holes that communicates noise energy through the retainer to the noise attenuation layer. Communication of noise energy through the retainer provides an acoustically active seam that aids in the dissipation of noise energy and thereby reduces the level of sound emitted from the duct.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, the example retainer of this invention provides an acoustically active mechanical retainer that includes a plurality of openings to communicate noise energy to a noise attenuation layer that improves noise attenuation properties of the liner assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other features of the present invention can be best understood from the following specification and drawings, the following of which is a brief description.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a duct commonly known as a fan case assembly <b>10</b> for a turbine engine includes a liner assembly <b>12</b> mounted within a housing <b>14</b>. A cowling <b>18</b> defines a leading edge of the fan case assembly <b>10</b> and is flush with an interior surface of the liner assembly <b>12</b>. The liner assembly <b>12</b> includes a noise attenuation layer <b>20</b> that is covered by a face sheet <b>22</b>. Rearward of the face sheet <b>22</b>, the noise attenuation layer <b>20</b> is covered by an abradable strip <b>24</b> that is adjacent a fan blade <b>16</b>. The abradable strip <b>24</b> includes a structure and material that can endure limited contact with the fan blade <b>16</b> to protect both the fan blade <b>16</b> and the fan case assembly <b>10</b>. Rearward of the abradable strip <b>24</b> is a plate <b>26</b>. The plate <b>26</b> protects the fan case assembly <b>10</b> against possible impacts from debris. Although this invention is described and shown by example as a fan case liner, any duct including noise attenuation features would benefit from this disclosure and is within the contemplation of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The face sheet <b>22</b> includes a first plurality of openings <b>30</b>. The noise attenuation layer <b>20</b> includes a plurality of individual cells <b>34</b> that are in communication with at least one of the first plurality of openings <b>30</b>. Noise energy is communicated through the first plurality of openings <b>30</b> into the individual cells <b>34</b> and dissipated to reduce noise emissions. The face sheet <b>22</b> is formed from one or several individual sheets placed adjacent each other forming a seam <b>25</b>. The seam <b>25</b> results from assembly tolerance stack-ups and also provides for limited expansion and contraction during operation. The seam <b>25</b> is covered to protect the underlying noise attenuation layer <b>20</b> from damage by a retainer <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The retainer <b>28</b> is bonded to the face sheet <b>22</b> over the seam <b>25</b>. The retainer <b>28</b> necessarily covers the first plurality of openings <b>30</b> adjacent the seams <b>25</b>, potentially creating an acoustically dead zone where noise energy is reflected instead of being communicated to the noise attenuation layer <b>20</b>. However, the retainer <b>28</b> of this invention includes a second plurality of openings <b>32</b> that communicates noise energy through the retainer <b>28</b> to the noise attenuation layer <b>20</b>. Communication of noise energy through the retainer <b>28</b> provides an acoustically active seam <b>25</b> that aids in the dissipation of noise energy and thereby reduces the level of sound emitted from the liner assembly <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the retainer <b>28</b> is shown in cross-section and is T-shaped including a tail section <b>36</b> that extends into the seam <b>25</b> from a center portion <b>38</b>. The tail section <b>36</b> extends into a slot <b>37</b> formed within the noise attenuation structure <b>20</b>. The slot <b>37</b> is formed to accommodate the tail section <b>36</b> and is not part of a seam within the noise attenuation structure <b>20</b>. Seams within the noise attenuation structure are staggered such that they do not align with the seam <b>25</b> of adjacent face sheets <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The retainer <b>28</b> is bonded to the face sheet <b>22</b> by an adhesive <b>44</b> on either side of the seam <b>25</b>. The adhesive <b>44</b> cures and results in blockage of some of the first plurality of openings <b>30</b> in the face sheet <b>22</b>. The second plurality of openings <b>32</b> are then formed through the retainer <b>28</b>, the face sheet <b>22</b> and the adhesive <b>44</b> to provide communication of noise energy to the noise attenuation layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The seam <b>25</b> includes a width <b>42</b> and the center portion <b>38</b> is of a width <b>40</b> that is greater than the width <b>42</b> to assure coverage of the seam <b>25</b>. The width <b>42</b> of the seam <b>25</b> will vary over several liner assemblies, and therefore the width <b>40</b> of the center portion <b>38</b> is determined to provide coverage of any seam width <b>42</b> possible given acceptable tolerances are maintained during assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the retainer <b>28</b> is shown along the axially extending seam <b>25</b>. Although the seam <b>25</b> is shown extending axially, other seam configurations and orientations would also benefit from application of this invention. The retainer <b>28</b> extends along and covers the entire seam <b>25</b> from the cowling <b>18</b> to the abradable strip <b>24</b>. The second plurality of openings <b>32</b> within the retainer <b>28</b> are arranged in a substantially repeating geometric pattern. Fabricating the openings <b>32</b> to communicate with individual cells <b>34</b> of the noise attenuation layer <b>20</b> provides for a more efficient dissipation of noise energy.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The second plurality of openings <b>32</b> are larger in diameter than the first plurality of openings. This allows less of the second plurality of openings <b>32</b> to provide the same cumulative opening area as a greater number of openings that are the size of the first plurality of openings <b>30</b>. Further, the shape of the second plurality of openings <b>32</b> are shown as circular. However, other shapes such as a square opening <b>25</b> and a triangular opening <b>27</b> are within the contemplation of this invention. Other shapes of openings, other than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are also within the contemplation of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, another example retainer <b>50</b> is shown and includes a plurality of acoustic regions <b>54</b> extending from either side of a center portion <b>52</b>. A second plurality of openings <b>64</b> are disposed within the center portion <b>52</b> to communicate noise energy to the noise attenuation layer <b>20</b> below. The acoustic regions <b>54</b> are triangular openings through the retainer <b>50</b> for exposing the first plurality of openings <b>30</b> within the face sheet <b>22</b> to noise energy. The acoustic regions <b>54</b> are defined by a web structure <b>56</b> that extends from either side of the center portion <b>52</b>. The web structure <b>56</b> is a geometric repeating chevron shaped pattern within which the triangular acoustic regions <b>54</b> are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The web structure <b>56</b> extends outwardly from the center portion <b>52</b> to provide an overall width <b>58</b> of the retainer <b>50</b>. The overall width <b>58</b> includes the center width <b>62</b>. The center width <b>62</b> is based on possible seam width <b>40</b> dimensions such that the center portion <b>52</b> will in all cases cover the seam <b>25</b>. The width <b>58</b> provides a desired bonding area to assure positive adherence to the face sheet <b>22</b>. The width <b>58</b> of the retainer <b>50</b> can vary with the application to provide sufficient area on either side of the seam <b>25</b> to assure that the adhesive <b>44</b> can secure the retainer <b>50</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The web structure <b>56</b> includes a width <b>60</b>. The width <b>60</b> is of such a size as to provide minimal blockage of the first plurality of openings <b>30</b>. Further, the width <b>60</b> is of a size that is less than or equal to a spacing between the first plurality of openings <b>30</b> within the face sheet <b>22</b>. Such sizing minimizes the amount openings <b>30</b> that are covered by the retainer <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The retainer <b>50</b> includes a repeating triangular or chevron patterned web structure <b>56</b>. However, other patterns of web structure are within the contemplation of this invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, another example retainer <b>70</b> is shown that includes a plurality of rectangular acoustic regions <b>72</b> disposed on either side of a center portion <b>78</b>. A web structure <b>74</b> extends outward from the center portion <b>78</b> to define the repeating array of acoustic regions <b>72</b>. A second plurality of openings <b>76</b> are formed in the center portion <b>78</b> to provide the desired communication of noise energy to the underlying noise attenuation layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Accordingly, the example retainer of this invention includes a plurality of openings through to a noise attenuation layer to provide uninterrupted acoustic performance within a fan case assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although a preferred embodiment of this invention has been disclosed, a worker of ordinary skill in this art would recognize that certain modifications would come within the scope of this invention. For that reason, the following claims should be studied to determine the true scope and content of this invention.</p>
