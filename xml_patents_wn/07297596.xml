<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A semiconductor device capable of suppressing void migration is provided. The semiconductor device includes a dummy region extending in a first direction substantially perpendicular to a second direction in which a word line extends. In addition, an isolation layer pattern may not cut the dummy region in the second direction. Consequently, leaning of the dummy region and void migration are prevented. A method of fabricating the semiconductor device is also provided.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> are plan views illustrating a conventional method of manufacturing a transistor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>11</b> and <b>13</b> are cross-sectional views taken along I-I′ lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, dummy regions <b>11</b> and active regions <b>12</b> are formed at an upper portion of a semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. The dummy regions <b>11</b> are arranged in a first direction. However, the dummy regions <b>11</b> are not connected to one another in the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thereafter, a silicon oxide layer (not shown) is formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to cover the dummy regions <b>11</b> and the active regions <b>12</b>. A planarization process is then performed on the silicon oxide layer until the dummy regions <b>11</b> and the active regions <b>12</b> are exposed. Thus, an isolation layer pattern <b>30</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The dummy regions <b>11</b> may prevent the active regions <b>12</b> from easily leaning while the planarization process is performed. However, when the sizes of the dummy regions <b>11</b> are relatively small, the dummy regions <b>11</b> as well as the active regions <b>12</b> may lean while the planarization process is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The isolation layer pattern <b>30</b> extends in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction between the dummy regions <b>11</b>. Thus, the dummy regions <b>11</b> are electrically insulated from one another by the isolation layer pattern <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a mask structure <b>40</b> is formed on the dummy regions <b>11</b>, the active regions <b>12</b> and the isolation layer pattern <b>30</b>. The mask structure <b>40</b> has first openings <b>5</b><i>c </i>partially exposing the dummy regions <b>11</b>, the active regions <b>12</b> and the isolation layer pattern <b>30</b>. The first openings <b>5</b><i>c </i>and the mask structure <b>40</b> extend in the second direction. The mask structure <b>40</b> includes silicon nitride layer patterns <b>42</b> and buffer layer patterns <b>41</b>. The nitride layer patterns <b>42</b> are formed on each of the buffer layer patterns <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thereafter, the dummy regions <b>11</b> and the active regions <b>12</b> are etched using the mask structure <b>40</b> as an etch mask. Thus, first grooves <b>1</b><i>c </i>and second grooves (not shown) are formed at upper portions of the dummy regions <b>11</b> and upper portions of the active regions <b>12</b>, respectively. Because the first openings <b>5</b><i>c </i>extend in the second direction, the first grooves <b>1</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves also extend in the second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As described above, the isolation layer pattern <b>30</b> exists between the dummy regions <b>11</b>. The isolation layer pattern <b>30</b> may be minimally etched while the dummy regions <b>11</b> and the active regions <b>12</b> are etched to form the first grooves <b>1</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves. Thus, the sections of the first grooves <b>1</b><i>c </i>taken along the line I-I′ are substantially asymmetric.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, a silicon oxide layer <b>50</b> having a substantially uniform thickness is formed on the mask structure <b>40</b>, the dummy regions <b>11</b>, the active regions <b>12</b> and the isolation layer pattern <b>30</b>. Thus, inner faces of the first grooves <b>1</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves are covered with the silicon oxide layer <b>50</b>. Here, the silicon oxide layer <b>50</b> may conform to the first grooves <b>1</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, an anisotropic etching process is performed on the silicon oxide layer <b>50</b> so that portions of the silicon oxide layer <b>50</b>, the portions being located on bottom faces of the first grooves <b>1</b><i>c</i>, bottom faces of the second grooves, the mask structure <b>40</b> and the isolation layer pattern <b>30</b>, may be selectively removed. Thus, silicon oxide layer patterns <b>51</b> are formed on sidewalls of the first grooves <b>1</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Thereafter, portions of the dummy regions <b>11</b> and portions of the active regions <b>12</b> that are exposed through the first grooves <b>1</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves, respectively, are isotropically etched using the mask structure <b>40</b> and the silicon oxide layer patterns <b>51</b> together as an etch mask. Thus, third grooves <b>3</b><i>c </i>communicated with the first grooves <b>1</b><i>c </i>are formed under the first grooves <b>1</b><i>c</i>. The third grooves <b>3</b><i>c </i>extend in the second direction. In addition, fourth grooves (not shown) communicated with the second grooves are formed under the second grooves. The fourth grooves also extend in the second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the isolation layer pattern <b>30</b> is formed between the dummy regions <b>11</b>. Thus, the sections of the third grooves <b>3</b><i>c </i>taken along the first direction are not substantially circular shapes even though the third grooves <b>3</b><i>c </i>are formed by an isotropic etching process. That is, the sections of the third grooves <b>3</b><i>c </i>taken along the first direction are substantially asymmetric.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the mask structure <b>40</b> and the silicon oxide layer patterns <b>51</b> are removed. Thereafter, a gate oxide layer <b>60</b> including silicon oxide is formed on faces of the active regions <b>12</b> and the dummy regions <b>11</b>, the faces being exposed by the isolation layer pattern <b>30</b>. The gate oxide layer <b>60</b> has a substantially uniform thickness. Thus, inner faces of the first grooves <b>1</b><i>c</i>, the second grooves, the third grooves <b>3</b><i>c </i>and the fourth grooves are covered with the gate oxide layer <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thereafter, a gate electrode layer <b>70</b> including a first portion <b>70</b><i>a </i>and second portions <b>70</b><i>b </i>is formed on the gate oxide layer <b>60</b> and the isolation layer pattern <b>30</b>. The first portion <b>70</b><i>a </i>fills the first grooves <b>1</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves that have been partially filled with the gate oxide layer <b>60</b>. The second portions <b>70</b><i>b </i>fill the third grooves <b>3</b><i>c </i>and fourth grooves that have been partially filled with the gate oxide layer <b>60</b>. The second portions <b>70</b><i>b </i>have voids <b>5</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As described above, the sections of the third grooves <b>3</b><i>c </i>taken along the first direction are not substantially circular shapes. Thus, the voids <b>5</b><i>d </i>generated in the second portions <b>70</b><i>b </i>while the gate electrode layer <b>70</b> fills up the third grooves <b>3</b><i>c </i>may easily migrate from the centers of the second portions <b>70</b><i>b</i>. That is, a void migration may be generated so that failure of a semiconductor device may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Gate mask layer patterns <b>80</b> are formed on the gate electrode layer <b>70</b>. Second openings <b>6</b><i>c </i>are defined between the gate mask layer patterns <b>80</b>. The gate electrode layer <b>70</b> is partially exposed through the second openings <b>6</b><i>c</i>. The second openings <b>6</b><i>c </i>and the gate mask layer patterns <b>80</b> extend in the second direction. Here, the gate mask layer patterns <b>80</b> correspond to word lines.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the gate electrode layer <b>70</b> and the gate oxide layers <b>60</b> are subsequently etched using the gate mask layer patterns <b>80</b> as an etch mask. Thus, gate electrodes <b>71</b> and gate oxide layer patterns <b>61</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Two gate electrodes <b>71</b> are formed on each of the active regions <b>12</b>. In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, two gate electrodes <b>71</b> are also formed on each of the dummy patterns <b>11</b>. This is because the dummy regions <b>11</b> are separated from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Dummy impurity regions <b>13</b> and active impurity regions <b>14</b> are formed at upper face portions of the dummy regions <b>11</b> and upper face portions of the active regions <b>12</b>, respectively, by using the gate mask layer patterns <b>80</b> and the isolation layer pattern <b>30</b> together as an ion implantation mask.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, an insulating layer (not shown) is formed to cover the dummy impurity regions <b>13</b>, the active impurity regions <b>14</b>, the isolation layer pattern <b>30</b>, the gate oxide layer patterns <b>61</b>, the gate electrodes <b>71</b> and the gate mask layer patterns <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thereafter, the insulating layer is anisotropically etched to form spacers <b>90</b> on sidewalls of the gate mask layer patterns <b>80</b>, the gate electrodes <b>71</b> and the gate oxide layer patterns <b>61</b>. Thus, a semiconductor device including the dummy impurity regions <b>13</b>, the active impurity regions <b>14</b>, the gate oxide layer patterns <b>61</b>, the gate electrodes <b>71</b>, the gate mask layer patterns <b>80</b> and the spacers <b>90</b> may be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As described above, the dummy regions <b>11</b> are spaced apart from one another in the first direction. Thus, if the dummy regions <b>11</b> are relatively small, the dummy regions <b>11</b> may lean or collapse.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, because the isolation layer pattern <b>30</b> is formed between the dummy regions <b>11</b>, the sections of the third grooves <b>3</b><i>c </i>taken in the first direction may not be substantially circular shapes even though the third grooves <b>3</b><i>c </i>are formed by the isotropic etching process. That is, the sections of the third grooves <b>3</b><i>c </i>taken in the first direction may be substantially asymmetric.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus, the voids <b>5</b><i>d </i>generated in the second portions <b>70</b><i>b </i>may easily migrate from the centers of the second portions <b>70</b><i>b </i>while the gate electrode layer <b>70</b> fills the third grooves <b>3</b><i>c</i>.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A method of fabricating a semiconductor device includes forming an isolation layer pattern over a dummy region extending in a first direction, forming grooves in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction, forming gate oxide layers on the dummy region and active regions, forming gate electrodes in the grooves having a void, forming gate electrodes and gate oxide layers, and doping impurities into the dummy and active regions exposed by the gate electrode and oxide layers.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The invention will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown. The invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure is thorough and complete, and fully conveys the inventive principles found in embodiments of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the size and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. The drawings are not to scale. Like reference numerals designate like elements throughout the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It will also be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being “on,” “connected to” and/or “coupled to” another element or layer, the element or layer may be directly on, connected and/or coupled to the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly on,” “directly connected to” and/or “directly coupled to” another element or layer, no intervening elements or layers are present. As used herein, the term “and/or” may include any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It will also be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections. These elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms may be used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer and/or section from another element, component, region, layer and/or section. For example, a first element, component, region, layer and/or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer and/or section without departing from the teachings of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Spatially relative terms, such as “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” “above,” “upper” and the like may be used to describe an element and/or feature's relationship to another element(s) and/or feature(s) as, for example, illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use and/or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as “below” and/or “beneath” other elements or features would then be oriented “above” the other elements or features. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the invention. As used herein, the singular terms “a,” “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms “includes” and/or “including”, when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence and/or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein may have the same meaning as what is commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of this specification and the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized and/or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Embodiments of the invention are described with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments of the invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a plan view illustrating semiconductor devices in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along I-I′ line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along II-II′ line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 to 16</figref>, a semiconductor device includes a dummy region <b>110</b>, active regions <b>120</b>, an isolation layer pattern <b>300</b>, gate electrodes <b>10</b>, gate oxide layer patterns <b>610</b>, gate mask layer patterns <b>800</b> and spacers <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The dummy region <b>110</b> extends in a first direction. First grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>and third grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>are formed at an upper portion of the dummy region <b>110</b>. The first grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the third grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>extend in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction. The third grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>are provided under the first grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>such that the third grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>are communicated with the first grooves <b>10</b><i>c</i>. The first grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the third grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>may be formed by an anisotropic etching process and an isotropic etching process, respectively. Dummy impurity regions <b>130</b> are formed at an upper face portion of the dummy region <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Second grooves <b>20</b><i>c </i>and fourth grooves <b>40</b><i>c </i>are formed at upper portions of the active regions <b>120</b>. The second grooves <b>20</b><i>c </i>and the fourth grooves <b>40</b><i>c </i>extend in the second direction. The fourth grooves <b>40</b><i>c </i>are provided under the second grooves <b>20</b><i>c </i>such that the fourth grooves <b>20</b><i>c </i>are communicated with the second grooves <b>20</b><i>c</i>. The second grooves <b>20</b><i>c </i>and the fourth grooves <b>40</b><i>c </i>are formed by the anisotropic etching process and the isotropic etching process, respectively. Active impurity regions <b>140</b> are formed at upper face portions of the active regions <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Because the first grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves <b>20</b><i>c </i>are formed by the anisotropic etching process, sidewalls of the first grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves <b>20</b><i>c </i>are substantially vertical.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">On the other hand, because the third grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the fourth grooves <b>40</b><i>c </i>are formed by the isotropic etching process, sections of the third grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the fourth grooves <b>40</b><i>c </i>taken along the first direction are substantially circular shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Here, the sections may be varied depending on conditions of the isotropic etching process. For example, the sections may be substantially oval shaped or substantially semicircular shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The isolation layer pattern <b>300</b> is provided between the dummy region <b>110</b> and the active regions <b>120</b> and between the active regions <b>120</b>. Thus, the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b> insulates the dummy region <b>110</b> from the active regions <b>120</b> electrically. In addition, the isolation layer insulates the active regions <b>120</b> from one another electrically.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Here, the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b> may not cut the dummy region <b>110</b> in the second direction. Thus, the dummy region <b>110</b> may extend in the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The gate electrode <b>710</b> includes a first portion <b>710</b><i>a </i>and a second portion <b>710</b><i>b</i>. The first portion <b>710</b><i>a </i>extends in the second direction on the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b> such that the first portion <b>710</b><i>a </i>fills the first grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves <b>20</b><i>c</i>. The second portions <b>710</b><i>b </i>are connected to the first portion <b>710</b><i>a</i>. The second portions <b>710</b><i>b </i>fill the third grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the fourth grooves <b>40</b><i>c</i>. Each of the second portions <b>710</b><i>b </i>has a void <b>50</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As described above, because the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b> does not cut the dummy region <b>110</b> in the second direction, the third and fourth grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b><i>c </i>are substantially symmetrical. Thus, the voids <b>50</b><i>d </i>may be generated at the centers of the second portions <b>710</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, two gate electrodes <b>710</b> are formed on each of the active regions <b>120</b>. On the other hand, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, at least three gate electrodes <b>710</b> are formed on the dummy region <b>110</b>. This is because the dummy region <b>110</b> extends in the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The gate oxide layer patterns <b>610</b> are formed between the gate electrodes <b>710</b> and the dummy region <b>110</b> and between the gate electrodes <b>710</b> and the active regions <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The gate mask layer patterns <b>800</b> are formed on each of the gate electrodes <b>710</b>. The spacers <b>900</b> are formed on sidewalls of the gate oxide layer patterns <b>610</b>, the gate electrodes <b>710</b> and the gate mask layer patterns <b>800</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a hard mask layer pattern <b>200</b> is formed on a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. The hard mask layer pattern <b>200</b> partially exposes the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. The hard mask layer pattern <b>200</b> includes a first portion <b>200</b><i>a </i>and second portions <b>200</b><i>b</i>. A dummy region <b>110</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) is to be formed under the first portion <b>200</b><i>a</i>. Active regions <b>120</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) are to be formed under the second portions <b>200</b><i>b</i>. The dummy region <b>110</b> extends in a first direction in which the I-I′ line extends.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is etched using the hard mask layer pattern <b>200</b> as an etch mask. The hard mask layer pattern <b>200</b> is then removed. Thus, the dummy region <b>110</b> and the active regions <b>120</b> are formed at an upper portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Because the dummy region <b>110</b> is formed under the first portion <b>200</b><i>a </i>extending in the first direction, the dummy region <b>110</b> also extends in the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a silicon oxide layer (not shown) is formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> to cover the dummy region <b>110</b> and the active regions <b>120</b>. Thereafter, a planarization process is performed until the dummy region <b>110</b> and the active regions <b>120</b> are exposed so that an isolation layer pattern <b>300</b> may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The dummy region <b>110</b> may prevent the active regions <b>120</b> from leaning while the planarization process is performed. Because the dummy region <b>110</b> extends in the first direction, the dummy region <b>110</b> may not lean while the planarization process is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Here, the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b> corresponds to a field region. Because the dummy region <b>110</b> extends in the first direction, the dummy region <b>110</b> is not cut by the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 to 22</figref>, a mask structure <b>400</b> is formed on the dummy region <b>110</b>, the active regions <b>120</b> and the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b>. The mask structure <b>400</b> has first openings <b>50</b><i>c </i>partially exposing the dummy region <b>110</b>, the active regions <b>120</b> and the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b>. The first openings <b>50</b><i>c </i>and the mask structure <b>400</b> extend in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction. The mask structure <b>400</b> includes silicon nitride layer patterns <b>420</b> and buffer layer patterns <b>410</b>. The silicon nitride layer patterns <b>420</b> are formed on each of the buffer layer patterns <b>410</b>. The buffer layer patterns <b>410</b> may include silicon oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Thereafter, the dummy region <b>110</b> and the active regions <b>120</b> are etched using the mask structure <b>400</b> as an etch mask. Thus, first grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>and second grooves <b>20</b><i>c </i>are formed at an upper portion of the dummy regions <b>110</b> and upper portions of the active regions <b>120</b>, respectively. Because the first openings <b>50</b><i>c </i>extend in the second direction, the first grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves <b>20</b><i>c </i>also extend in the second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 to 25</figref>, a silicon oxide layer <b>500</b> having a substantially uniform thickness is formed on the mask structure <b>400</b>, the dummy region <b>110</b>, the active regions <b>120</b> and the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b>. Thus, inner faces of the first grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves <b>20</b><i>c </i>are covered with the silicon oxide layer <b>500</b>. Here, the silicon oxide layer <b>500</b> may conform to the first grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves <b>20</b><i>c</i>. For example, the silicon oxide layer <b>500</b> may be formed by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 to 28</figref>, portions of the silicon oxide layer <b>500</b> located on bottom faces of the first grooves <b>10</b><i>c</i>, bottom faces of the second grooves <b>20</b><i>c </i>and the mask structure <b>400</b> are selectively removed. Thus, silicon oxide layer patterns <b>510</b> are formed on sidewalls of the first grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves <b>20</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Thereafter, portions of the dummy region <b>110</b> and portions of the active regions <b>120</b> that are exposed through the first grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>and the second grooves <b>20</b><i>c</i>, respectively, are isotropically etched using the mask structure <b>400</b> and the silicon oxide layer patterns <b>510</b> together as an etch mask. Thus, third grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>communicated with the first grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>may be formed under the first grooves <b>10</b><i>c</i>. Here, the third grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>may extend in the second direction. In addition, fourth grooves <b>40</b><i>c </i>communicated with the second grooves <b>20</b><i>c </i>are formed under the second grooves <b>20</b><i>c</i>. The fourth grooves <b>40</b><i>c </i>extend in the second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Because the third grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the fourth grooves <b>40</b><i>c </i>are formed by an isotropic etching process, sections of the third grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the fourth grooves <b>40</b><i>c </i>taken along the first direction are substantially circular shapes. Here, the sections may be varied depending on conditions of the isotropic etching process. As one example, the sections may be substantially oval shapes. As another example, the sections may be substantially semicircular shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As described above, the sections of the fourth grooves <b>40</b><i>c </i>taken along the first direction are substantially circular shapes. Thus, channel regions may be enlarged. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the dummy region <b>110</b> may not be cut in the second direction by the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b>. Thus, the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b> may not exist between the third grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>formed at the dummy region <b>110</b>. As a result, the sections of the third grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>taken along the first direction are substantially symmetrical.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 to 31</figref>, the mask structure <b>400</b> and the silicon oxide layer patterns <b>510</b> are removed. Thereafter, gate oxide layers <b>600</b> including silicon oxide are formed on faces of the active regions <b>120</b> and the dummy region <b>110</b>, the faces being exposed by the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b>. The gate oxide layers <b>600</b> have substantially uniform thicknesses. Thus, inner faces of the first, second, third and fourth grooves <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b><i>c </i>are covered with the gate oxide layers <b>600</b>. The gate oxide layers <b>600</b> are formed by a thermal oxidation process.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The isolation layer pattern <b>300</b> defines the first, second, third and fourth grooves <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b><i>c </i>in the second direction. Thus, if the gate oxide layers <b>600</b> are formed by the thermal oxidation process, the gate oxide layers <b>600</b> may not be formed on portions of the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b>, the portions defining the first, second, third and fourth grooves <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b><i>c </i>in the second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Thereafter, a gate electrode layer <b>700</b> is formed on the gate oxide layers <b>600</b> and the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b>. The gate electrode layer <b>700</b> includes a first portion <b>700</b><i>a </i>and second portions <b>700</b><i>b</i>. The first portion <b>700</b><i>a </i>fills up the first and second grooves <b>10</b><i>c </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>partially filled with the gate oxide layers <b>600</b>. The second portions <b>700</b><i>b </i>fill up the third and fourth grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b><i>c </i>partially filled with the gate oxide layers <b>600</b>. Each of the second portions <b>700</b><i>b </i>has a void <b>50</b><i>d</i>. The gate electrode layer <b>700</b> may include conductive material such as metal or polysilicon doped with impurities.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As described above, the sections of the third and fourth grooves <b>20</b> and <b>40</b> taken along the first direction are substantially circular shapes. Thus, voids <b>50</b><i>d </i>are generated in the second portions <b>700</b><i>b </i>when the gate electrode layer <b>700</b> fills the third and fourth grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As already illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the sections of the third and fourth grooves <b>30</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b><i>c </i>taken along the first direction are substantially symmetrical. Thus, the voids <b>50</b><i>d </i>may be formed at the centers of the second portions <b>700</b><i>b</i>. That is, the voids <b>50</b><i>d </i>may not migrate from the centers of the second portions <b>700</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Thereafter, gate mask layer patterns <b>800</b> are formed on the gate electrode layer <b>700</b>. Second openings <b>60</b><i>c </i>are defined between the gate mask layer patterns <b>800</b>. The gate electrode layer <b>700</b> is partially exposed through the second openings <b>60</b><i>c</i>. The second openings <b>60</b><i>c </i>and the gate mask layer patterns <b>800</b> extend in the second direction. Here, the gate mask layer patterns <b>800</b> correspond to word lines. Thus, the word lines extend in the second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 to 34</figref>, the gate electrode layer <b>700</b> and the gate oxide layers <b>600</b> are subsequently etched using the gate mask layer patterns <b>800</b> as an etch mask. Thus, gate electrodes <b>710</b> and gate oxide layer patterns <b>610</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, two gate electrodes <b>710</b> are formed on each of the active regions <b>120</b>. However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, at least three gate electrodes <b>710</b> are formed on the dummy region <b>110</b>. This is because the dummy region <b>110</b> extends in the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">An ion implantation process is performed using the gate mask layer patterns <b>800</b> and the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b> together as an ion implantation mask so that dummy impurity regions <b>130</b> and active impurity regions <b>140</b> are formed at an upper face portion of the dummy region <b>110</b> and upper face portions of the active regions <b>120</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 to 37</figref>, an insulating layer (not shown) is formed to cover the dummy impurity regions <b>130</b>, the active impurity regions <b>140</b>, the isolation layer pattern <b>300</b>, the gate oxide layer patterns <b>610</b>, the gate electrodes <b>710</b> and the gate mask layer patterns <b>800</b>. The insulating layer may include insulating material such as silicon nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Thereafter, the insulating layer is anisotropically etched so that spacers <b>900</b> are formed on sidewalls of the gate mask layer patterns <b>800</b>, the gate electrodes <b>710</b> and the gate oxide layer patterns <b>610</b>. Thus, the semiconductor device including the dummy impurity regions <b>130</b>, the active impurity regions <b>140</b>, the gate oxide layer patterns <b>610</b>, the gate electrodes <b>710</b>, the gate mask layer patterns <b>800</b> and the spacers <b>900</b> may be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">According to the invention, a dummy region extends in a direction substantially perpendicular to a word line. Thus, leaning of the dummy region may be prevented.</p>
