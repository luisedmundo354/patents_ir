<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention pertains to the field of fabricating anisotropic films. In particular, the invention relates to methods and devices for transferring anisotropic crystal films from a donor plate to a receptor plate.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are known optically anisotropic crystal films, which are obtained from polycyclic organic compounds via special fabrication operations and therefore feature high degree of anisotropy, thermal and light resistance. Technology of fabricating the above films is relatively simple; however it requires special equipment and precise compliance with the fabrication conditions in order to provide reproducibility of parameters of films. During fabrication of light, indicatory and other devices, which mainly represents assembly of already prefabricated parts, it is sometimes difficult to incorporate an additional fabrication process to produce films and parts based on the above films. Additional challenges arise when one needs to fabricate anisotropic coatings with complex configurations or with small pattern features. Usually in this case one forms a continuous anisotropic coating via the known methods and then later removes certain portions of the coating. For example, there is a known method of removing portions of the coating using scotch tape. The scotch tape is adhered to the areas of the film to be stripped of the coating, and after the tape is peeled the remaining coating on the substrate has the desired configuration. This known technique does not require special equipment, however, it does not provide sufficiently sharp edge of the coating and the degree of anisotropy at the edges of the remaining regions, and it is not reproducible enough to obtain elements of small sizes. Another difficulty is the possible decrease in the degree of crystalline order due to the application of various compressive and shear stresses to the anisotropic crystal film. Also the roughness of the surface of the anisotropic crystal film can be increased when the scotch is peeled off.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to fabricate polarizing coatings with the desired configuration one may also use a patterned layer of water-soluble lacquer. After solidifying the lacquer the exposed polarizing coating is washed off with a suitable solvent (water or a mixture of water with and organic solvent). However, this method also requires carrying out several additional fabrication operations (installation of an additional fabrication station), and implementation of this method may raise difficulties in selecting suitable chemical agents (suitable composition of the lacquer for polarizing coating, solvent to remove the protective lacquer, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Technology has been developed which allows avoiding installation of special fabrication processes for producing polarizing films, obtained from organic dyes, with various configurations [Staral et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,446]. This technology is based on using pre-fabricated polarizing films on a base, the so-called donors. This technology involves the known methods of mass transfer as a result of localized heating of the coating areas to be transferred [Chou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,506,189]. Heating may be implemented via thermal elements, and laser radiation, etc. This method allows obtaining polarizing coating of an arbitrary shape with high resolution of the pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Difficulties arising in implementation of this method are related firstly to the structure of the transferring polarizing coating and the possible degradation of optical characteristics of the coating when it is locally heated up to the temperature necessary to carry out the transfer. Polarizing coating is obtained from lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) dyes, molecules of which aggregate into supramolecular complexes. After application of LLC onto the substrate and inflicting the external shearing force supramolecular complexes become aligned in the direction of the influence. After the film dries (removal of the solvent), alignment of molecules is conserved. Therefore the crystalline order obtained from the lyotropic liquid crystal is conserved as well.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The anisotropy of optical, magnetic, or electric properties, the polarizing properties of the anisotropic crystal film is related to the crystalline order. The heating applied to the anisotropic crystal film potentially decreases the crystalline order, and thus the anisotropic properties are deteriorated as well. The risk to destroy the crystalline order with the heating could be substantially increased with particular material, increase of temperature, state of anisotropic crystal film, ambient conditions etc. Therefore the use of heating is generally undesirable for the technology.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another possible solution is preliminary activation, i.e. preliminary influence onto the transferring areas of the film such as to weaken bonds between molecules or supramolecular complexes in the structure thereby providing the transfer of areas of the film from the donor plate to the receptor plate at significantly lower pressure. This does not result in degradation of anisotropy in the bulk material, and in the edges of the patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Besides of general complexity, both heating and activation facilitated transfer technologies suffer from the roughness produced by the peel-off of the donor film performed after the transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The peel-off stress comprises an expansion component and a shear component. Both components disturb the oriented molecules in the anisotropic crystal film. The disturbance comprises the deviation of the molecules' dipoles from the surface plane, thus producing the extensive distortion of the layer of the anisotropic crystal film material adhered to the surface. In particular, optical, magnetic, electrical, ferromagnetic and any other properties can be disturbed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">On the other hand, the production of the anisotropic crystal film with precisely pre-defined thickness is a complicated task when the film has to be produced directly from the solution of the polycyclic organic compound. Thus the thickness is adjusted using the multiple identical anisotropic crystal films with various thicknesses. This is possible since the order of the magnitude of anisotropic crystal film thickness can be varied in the extremely wide range from tenths nanometers to hundreds microns. It is desirable to remove all defects from the interface between films in order to obtain the homogenous film. It is desirable that the films' interfaces are reseated as well, because any traces of the interface boundary produce the interference effects and make worse optical properties. The peel-off disturbance described hereinbefore could substantially affect the properties of the multilayer film, additionally producing the interface effects.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present invention provides a method of transferring an anisotropic crystal film from a donor to a receptor. The method is useful in fabricating devices using anisotropic films as polarizers or retarders etc., such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The method of the invention is also useful in fabrication of materials and products for automotive industry, architecture, and applied art.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In general, the method of the invention transfers an anisotropic crystal film from a donor to a receptor. The donor comprises an anisotropic crystal film and a base that serves as a mechanical base for the anisotropic film. A loading is applied to at least a portion of the base to provide shear and compressive stresses onto the base and anisotropic crystal films and the receptor, thereby transferring at least a portion of the anisotropic crystal film onto the receptor. The base is delaminated from the anisotropic crystal film transferred to the receptor. The level of the lording is controlled so that the applied stresses are sufficient for transfer of the anisotropic crystal film from the donor to the receptor but do not disrupt the crystalline structure of the transferred anisotropic crystal film.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The donor is placed in the contact with the receptor. The anisotropic crystal film is positioned between the base and the receptor. The contact of the anisotropic crystal film with the receptor produces the adhesive bonds between these films, and the bonds could be enforced with the use of pretreatment of the contacting surfaces as described hereinafter. In one embodiment, the donor comprises interference multilayer structure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">An external loading is then applied to the outside surface of the base. The applied loading produces shear and compressive stresses in the base. Although the loading could be applied to a relatively small area, the base redistributes the stress and thus prevents the anisotropic crystal film from the orientation disturbance of the surface. The compressive stress increases the adhesive bonding between the anisotropic crystal film and the receptor. The shear stress breaks the adhesive bonding between the anisotropic crystal film and the base, since the shear strength is always much less than the expansion/compress strength.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Therefore, the transfer of at least a portion of the anisotropic crystal film from the donor to the receptor is performed with the subsequent fixing of the anisotropic crystal film on the receptor. Finally, the base could be delaminated.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The levels of the applied stresses are high enough in order to transfer at least a portion of the anisotropic crystal film from the donor to the receptor and are low enough in order to retain a crystalline structure of the anisotropic crystal film. The shear stress applied to the anisotropic crystal film provides an alignment effect, and thus enhances the anisotropic properties of the anisotropic crystal film.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows the main stages of the method of fabricating anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b> on a receptor <b>101</b> via the transfer from the donor <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> schematically shows the placement of the donor <b>103</b> into the contact with the receptor <b>101</b>. The donor <b>103</b> comprises at least one anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b> to be transferred to the receptor <b>101</b>. The base film <b>104</b> is the base for the anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b> and is the portion of the entire donor <b>103</b>. The anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b> faces the receptor <b>101</b> when the donor <b>103</b> is moved in the direction <b>107</b> in order to be placed in contact with the receptor <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> schematically shows the transfer of the anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b> to the receptor <b>101</b>. The knife <b>105</b> is used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> for illustrative purposes as a device for producing the shear and compressive loadings. Other devices can also be used as will be described below. The knife <b>105</b> presses the donor <b>103</b> and the receptor <b>101</b> as shown by arrow <b>108</b>. Simultaneously the knife <b>105</b> is moved along the external surface of the donor <b>103</b> as shown by arrows <b>106</b>. The described treatment creates the shear and compressive stress distribution in the donor <b>103</b> and forms the disclination on the boundary between the base film <b>104</b> and the anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b>. The disclination causes delamination of the base film <b>104</b> from the anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The receptor <b>101</b> is fixed with the anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b>. The combined effect of the shear and compressive loading produces the transfer of the anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b> from the donor <b>103</b> to the receptor <b>101</b>. The value of the shear and the compressive stresses is sufficiently large to transfer at least a portion of the anisotropic crystal film. On the other hand, the value of the shear and compressive loading is controlled to not degrade the crystalline structure and consequently the optical parameters of the transferred anisotropic crystal film.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows in more detail the transfer stage of the disclosed invention. The knife <b>205</b> is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for illustrative purposes as a device for producing the shear and compressive stresses.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The knife <b>205</b> is moved along the external surface <b>210</b> of the donor <b>203</b>. The knife <b>205</b> is pressed in the direction <b>208</b> from the donor <b>203</b> to the receptor <b>201</b>, and the compressive stress is produced in this way. Simultaneously the knife <b>205</b> is moved in the direction <b>206</b>, and produces the shear stress distribution in the donor <b>203</b> due to the friction. The friction exists between the knife <b>205</b> and the external surface <b>210</b> of the donor <b>203</b>. The lines <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> designate the interfaces between the base film <b>204</b> and the anisotropic crystal film <b>202</b>, and between the donor <b>203</b> and the receptor <b>201</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Microscopic area under the knife edge is shown in more detail inside the circle in the upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The thickness of the base film <b>204</b> and the anisotropic crystal film <b>202</b> is reduced under the edge of the knife <b>205</b> due to the compressive strain produced by the compressive stress.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The hatching lines are used in order to illustrate the value and the direction of the strains. Since the compressive and shear loading produces the elastic deformation of the films <b>202</b>, <b>201</b>, <b>204</b>, the strains shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are proportional to the stresses. The non-stressed portion of the films <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> are shown with vertical hatching lines. The larger deviation of the hatching lines from the vertical line designates the larger value of shear strain in the hatched area. Further, the continuity of the hatching lines is used to describe the adhesive bonding between the receptor <b>201</b>, anisotropic crystal film <b>202</b> and the base film <b>204</b>. The hatching line is continued without break at the boundary <b>211</b> or <b>212</b> when the adhesive bond exists between the respective films. Otherwise, the discontinuity of the hatching line designates the break of the adhesive bond between films.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The anisotropic crystal film <b>202</b> is adhesively bonded to the base film <b>204</b> before the transfer. Once the donor <b>203</b> has been placed in contact with the receptor <b>201</b>, the anisotropic crystal film <b>202</b> adhesively bonds to the receptor <b>201</b>. Thus the hatching lines on the left side of the edge of the knife <b>205</b> continuously intersect both boundaries <b>211</b> and <b>212</b>. The maximum shear strain exists in the area under and right after the knife <b>205</b> edge, therefore the hatching lines possesses the maximum slope immediately under and right after the knife <b>205</b>. The slope decreases as the point inside film <b>202</b> or <b>204</b> moves away from the knife <b>205</b>. The adhesive bonds between the receptor <b>201</b> and the anisotropic crystal film <b>202</b> is strong enough to overcome the applied shear stress, thus everywhere across the boundary <b>212</b> the hatching lines are continuous. On the other hand, the adhesive bond between the anisotropic crystal film <b>202</b> and the base film <b>204</b> is discontinuous at the point <b>225</b>, and the portion of the base film <b>204</b> on the right side of the disclination point <b>225</b> is delaminated from the anisotropic crystal film <b>202</b>, as shown by the discontinuity of the hatching lines.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The various embodiments of the disclosed invention are described hereinafter. The loadings can be applied in the different ways, and different devices can be used to apply loadings. Any different combinations of the loading devices can be employed. The desirable pre-treatments of the anisotropic crystal film, the base film and the receptor are shown, as well as the compressive pre-treatment of the seam between the films. Various additional layers can also be included in the donor or receptor such as adhesive, pressure-sensitive adhesive, layer with weak enough adhesion against shear stress, etc. In one embodiment the anisotropic crystal film comprises various fragments such as colored fragments, fragments with various polarization transmission axes, etc. The desirable embodiments are described with capabilities to transfer a portion of the anisotropic crystal film to the receptor. The disclosed fabrication method comprises embodiments with respect to the time order of the stages. In one desirable embodiment described hereinafter the anisotropic crystal film comprises thin crystal film. The disclosed invention is useful in the fabrication the multilayer films.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, the donor further comprises the interference multilayer structure. Under the interference multilayer structure we understand the structure comprising two or more layers, wherein the thicknesses of at least two layers in the structure are of the same order as the wavelength of the wavelength range under consideration. In one embodiment, the wavelength range is a visible wavelength range.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the donor and the receptor are compressed towards each other. In another embodiment, the shear stress is applied along the interface surface of the anisotropic crystal film and the base. Both embodiments provide the loadings in the desired directions in order to facilitate the transfer and maintain the crystal structure of the anisotropic crystal film.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, the loading device is moved with respect to the donor and receptor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are the examples of the embodiment with the loading device moved with respect to the donor and the receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another embodiment, the donor and receptor are moved with respect to the stationary loading device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically shows the embodiment of this type. The donor <b>303</b> and the receptor <b>301</b> are moved in the direction <b>306</b> with respect to the stationary knife <b>305</b>. The knife <b>305</b> is pressed in the direction <b>308</b> in order to produce compressive loading. The combined effect of the movement <b>306</b> and the compressive stress <b>308</b> produce the desired shear stress.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The desired loadings are produced using the various loading devices. The loading device contacts the external surface of the base, and is pressed to the receptor to produce the compressive stress. Simultaneously, the loading device is shifted along the surface of the donor. The shear stress is produces using the movement due to the friction forces existing between the external surface of the donor and the loading device. For example, the loading devices include such as but limited to knifes with rounded blade, non-rotating or rotating rolls, blades, non-rotating or rotating balls, rules, doctors, and peel-off bars.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, the friction between the loading device and the donor does not move the internal parts of the loading device with respect to each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> show such embodiments using a knife <b>105</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>305</b> as the loading device.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In another embodiment, the friction between the loading device and the donor plate moves the internal parts of said loading device with respect to each other. Roll is a convenient general name for this type of the loading device. One advantage using roll as loading device is the independently adjustable shear and compressive stresses. The compressive stress is adjusted with the force loaded on the rotation axes of the roll. The shear stress is adjusted with the friction force between the roll and the external surface of the donor, and this friction is in turn adjusted using the various handicaps for the free rotation of the roll around its axis. Instead of transfer process itself, the shear stress adjustment is useful for many other purposes. For example, the appropriate selection of the friction force suppresses self-induced vibrations of the donor and receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of a roll as loading device. The axis <b>402</b> of the roll <b>401</b> moves in the direction <b>206</b>. Simultaneously the roll <b>401</b> presses the external surface of the base film <b>204</b> in the direction <b>208</b>. The roll <b>401</b> is rotated around the axis <b>402</b> in the direction <b>410</b>, and the friction force between the roll <b>401</b> and the base film <b>204</b> produces the shear stress in the donor <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Various combinations of the knife and the roll loading devices can be used in the disclosed invention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically shows an embodiment of the invention, said embodiment comprises two knives used to transfer the anisotropic crystal film <b>302</b> from the donor <b>303</b> to the receptor <b>301</b>. The first knife <b>305</b> presses the external surface of the donor <b>303</b>. The relative movement of the knife <b>305</b> and the donor <b>303</b> produces the shear stress. The second knife <b>510</b> is moved on the external surface of the receptor <b>301</b>. The second knife <b>510</b> performs as a support of the receptor <b>301</b>, thus both knives <b>305</b> and <b>510</b> are positioned opposite to each other. The shear stress produced by the second knife <b>510</b> in the receptor <b>301</b> is minimized using the antifriction arrangements applied between the rubbing surfaces of the second knife <b>510</b> and the receptor <b>301</b>. Any known antifriction arrangement is applicable such as but not limited to the lubricant placed between the rubbing surfaces, the manufacturing of the rubbing parts from the lubricating material, the antifriction coating placed on the rubbing surface of the second knife <b>510</b> and/or receptor <b>301</b>, the polishing of the rubbing surfaces, the decrease of the compressive force <b>509</b> applied to the second knife <b>510</b>, etc. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the antifriction coating <b>519</b> covers the edge of the second knife <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The embodiment of the disclosed invention with two rolls is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The second roll <b>601</b> serves as a support for the receptor <b>201</b> and is positioned opposite to the first roll <b>401</b>. The friction between the roll <b>601</b> and the receptor <b>201</b> is minimized in order to avoid the shear stress of the receptor <b>201</b>. Such a stress can produce undesirable delamination of the anisotropic crystal film <b>202</b> from the receptor <b>201</b>. Therefore, the roll <b>601</b> freely rotates in the direction <b>610</b> around the axis <b>602</b>. Simultaneously the axis <b>602</b> of the roll is moved in the direction <b>606</b>, and the roll is pressed in the direction <b>608</b>. The freedom of the rotation <b>602</b> gives the minimal friction of the receptor <b>201</b> and the roll <b>601</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The combination of the roll and the knife can be employed as well. In one embodiment, the roll and the knife are positioned opposite to each other. for example, the knife is moved along the external surface of the donor, and the roll is moved along the external surface of the receptor. In another embodiment the roll is moved along the external surface of the donor, and the knife is moved along the external surface of the receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">One example of the embodiment is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> wherein the knife presses the external surface of the donor and the roll presses the external surface of the receptor. The knife <b>305</b> is used to load the donor <b>303</b> moving in the direction <b>306</b>, while the roll <b>720</b> bears the receptor <b>301</b>. The roll <b>720</b> freely rotates around the axis <b>721</b> in the direction <b>722</b>. Therefore the knife <b>305</b> loads the base film <b>304</b> with the shear stress, while the free rotation <b>722</b> of the roll <b>720</b> gives the purely compressive loading of the receptor <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The pre-treatment of the anisotropic crystal film or the receptor is used in the respective embodiments in order to increase the adhesive properties of the respective surfaces and facilitate the transfer of the anisotropic crystal film from the donor to the receptor. The pre-treatment is also a patterning method employed to facilitate the transfer of the fragments of the anisotropic crystal film. The embodiment comprising the pretreatment of the surface of the receptor employs t pretreatments such as but not limited to ion bombardment, vacuum cleaning, heating, mechanical treatment, electromagnetic irradiation, washing, and chemical modification. One or more of the described procedures can be employed in the pre-treatment in the preferable order.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> schematically shows the pretreatment of the surface of the receptor. The wave-shaped arrows <b>820</b> designate any of the described pretreatment applied to the surface of the receptor <b>201</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The pretreatment of at least a portion of the surface of the base film before the application of the anisotropic crystal film is used to make a delamination easier. One or more of the described procedures can be employed in the pre-treatment such as ion bombardment, vacuum cleaning, heating, mechanical treatment, electromagnetic irradiation, washing, and chemical modification.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The pretreatment with the compressive stress is one embodiment of the disclosed invention. The preliminary exposure of the united donor and receptor under the compressive stress increases the adhesive bonding between the anisotropic crystal film and the receptor. Therefore, it is desirable to compress the donor and receptor after the placement of the donor and receptor in contact, and before the transfer of the anisotropic crystal film.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">An example of the described embodiment comprising the pretreatment using the compressive stress is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The transfer of the anisotropic crystal film <b>302</b> from the donor <b>303</b> to the receptor <b>301</b> is performed using the knife <b>305</b>, and the donor <b>303</b> and receptor <b>301</b> are moved in the direction <b>306</b>. The preliminary press of the donor <b>303</b> and the receptor <b>301</b> is performed using the pair of rolls <b>1006</b> and <b>1007</b>. The rolls <b>1006</b> and <b>1007</b> are installed in front of the knife <b>305</b> with respect to the movement direction <b>306</b>; therefore the compressive pretreatment is performed before the transfer. The rolls <b>1006</b> and <b>1007</b> freely rotate in the directions <b>1000</b> and <b>1001</b>, around the axes <b>1002</b> and <b>1003</b>, respectively. The free rotation of the rolls <b>1006</b> and <b>1007</b> is desirable to obtain the pure compressive loading of the receptor <b>301</b> and the donor <b>303</b> without shear stress. The compressive stress is obtained with the forces <b>1004</b>, <b>1005</b> applied to the axes <b>1002</b>, <b>1003</b> of each roll <b>1000</b> and <b>1001</b>, respectively.</p>

In one embodiment of the invention, the anisotropic crystal film possesses a number of the birefringent fragments, wherein the direction of the c-axes differ with respect to the fragment. In one embodiment, the birefringent anisotropic crystal film possesses dichroism and performs as a polarizer.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment, the anisotropic crystal film comprises thin crystal films due to the possibility of disposition on the variety of surfaces, and other exceptional properties—the low thickness, the thermal stability of the film and of the film optical properties, the high dichroic ratio, etc. See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,563,640, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The described exceptional properties are associated with the technology of thin crystal film manufacturing. The technology was developed by the Optiva™ Inc., San-Francisco, USA.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Thin crystal film is based on the polycyclic organic compounds. An example of the desirable polycyclic organic compound is the dichroic dye, or the mixture of dichroic dyes. In one embodiment the thin crystal film is the partially crystal film formed by rodlike supramolecules of the polycyclic organic compound, and the polycyclic organic compound possesses conjugated π-systems. The thin crystal film possesses birefringence when the axes of the rodlike supramolecules aligned in parallel to the birefringence c-axis. In another embodiment, the birefringent thin crystal film possesses dichroism and performs as a polarizer.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">At least one polycyclic organic compound can be used whose formula contains at least one ionogenic group, providing solubility in polar solvents, and/or at least one nonionogenic group, providing solubility in nonpolar solvents, and/or at least one counterion that either remains or does not remain in the structure of the molecule during preparation of the material. When such organic compound is dissolved in an appropriate solvent, a colloid system is formed (a lyotropic liquid crystal). In the colloid system, molecules are associated in supramolecular complexes which form kinetical units of the system (WO 01/63346). A liquid crystalline phase is a pre-ordered state of the system, which determines the initial anisotropy of the material. In the process of alignment of supramolecules and in the course of subsequent removal of the solvent, a solid crystal film possessing optical anisotropy (e.g., dichroism) is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">It is also possible to mix colloid systems (in this case, mixed supramolecules will be formed in a solution) to obtain crystal films with intermediate optical characteristics. In optically anisotropic dichroic crystal films obtained from mixtures of colloid solutions, absorption and refraction may be characterized by different values in the ranges determined by initial components. Mixing different colloid systems with the formation of mixed supramolecules is possible due to the coincidence of one of molecular dimensions (interplanar distances) of various organic compounds (3.4±0.3 Å).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Surfaces, on which the crystal films are deposited, may be subjected to additional treatment to provide uniform wettability thereof (to provide for hydrophilic properties of the surface). This may be mechanical treatment, annealing, and mechanochemical treatment. Similar treatment can also facilitate decreasing the film thickness and increasing the degree of molecular ordering. Furthermore, to increase the ordering in the film at the surface of a substrate, aligning anisotropic structures can be formed by mechanical treatment of the substrate surface.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment of the invention, the transfer stage and the placement stage do not intersect in the time of realization. Once the sheet of the donor has been placed in contact with the receptor over the all area of the donor, the transfer of the anisotropic crystal film is started. This realization is advantageous as regards to the simplicity of the process and equipment of the fabrication, and can be easily realized over the relatively small sheets of the donor and receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The described embodiment is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows the placement of the entire donor <b>103</b> into the contact with the receptor <b>101</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows the transfer stage after the placement stage. Therefore the transfer stage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) is separated in time from the placement stage (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In another embodiment, the transfer stage and placement stage intersect in the time of realization. The transfer of the anisotropic crystal film is performed over the portion of the donor, which has been already placed in contact with the receptor. This realization is advantageous with respect to the output of the process, and is desirable for the large sheets of the donor and receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The embodiment of this kind is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Here the transfer of the anisotropic crystal film <b>202</b> is performed simultaneously with the stage of placement the donor <b>203</b> and receptor <b>201</b> in contact.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In another embodiment, the loading that causes compressive and shear stresses is applied only to desirable portion of the donor, and only this applied portion of the anisotropic crystal film is transferred from the donor to the receptor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> schematically shows an example where the loading is applied to only portion of the donor.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> shows the partial transfer with the use of the loading device of the knife type. The knife <b>1355</b> comprises a gap <b>1301</b> on the edge. The portion <b>1302</b> of the base film <b>104</b> is placed under the gap <b>1301</b> during the movement <b>106</b> of the knife <b>1355</b>. This portion <b>1302</b> of the base film <b>104</b> and of the donor <b>103</b> is not subjected to the loading. Thus the portion of the anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b>, which underlies the portion <b>1302</b> of the base film <b>104</b>, is not transferred to the receptor <b>101</b>. The portions <b>1304</b> and <b>1306</b> of the base film <b>104</b> and respective underlying portions of the anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b> are subjected to loading produced by the knife <b>1355</b>. Thus the corresponding portions of the anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b> are transferred from the donor <b>103</b> to the receptor <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> shows the anisotropic crystal film that has been transferred to the receptor <b>101</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. The base film <b>104</b> is not shown for illustrative purposes. The portions <b>1305</b> and <b>1307</b> of the anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b> underlie the respective portions <b>1304</b> and <b>1306</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, and the loadings are applied to the portions <b>1305</b> and <b>1307</b>. Therefore the portions <b>1305</b> and <b>1307</b> of the anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b> are fixed in the receptor <b>101</b>. Otherwise, the empty strip <b>1303</b> corresponds to the portion <b>1302</b> of the base film in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. In turn, the portion <b>1302</b> underlies the edge gap of the knife <b>1355</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. This portion of the anisotropic crystal film <b>102</b> is not transferred since the loading is not applied to the respective portion of the donor <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The shear stress produces the delamination of the base from the anisotropic crystal film. Therefore, the base is removed immediately after the transfer of the anisotropic crystal film.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Adhesive materials can be employed in the method of the disclosed invention as well. The use of the adhesives and pressure sensitive adhesives facilitates the transfer. In the embodiment the donor comprises the additional film of the adhesive material placed on the external side of the anisotropic crystal film. In one embodiment said adhesive is pressure-sensitive. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> schematically shows the embodiment, wherein the adhesive film <b>1401</b> is used with the donor <b>1403</b>.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The fabrication method disclosed in the invention is desirably used for the fabrication of the multilayer films. The desirable layers include anisotropic crystal film layers, protective layers, adhesive layers, fluorescent layers, planarization layers, diffusive layers, light-scattering layers, reflective layers, alignment layers, electrical isolation layers, conducting electrode layers, substrate layers, liquid crystal layers, etc. The fabrication method disclosed in the invention is even more desirably used to obtain the multilayer anisotropic crystal film of given thickness, when the each layer is the anisotropic crystal film, possesses the selected thickness, and the optical properties of the layers are the same, and the crystallographic axes of the anisotropic crystal film layers are identically oriented.

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In one embodiment, the receptor comprises multiple layers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> schematically shows the described embodiment.
