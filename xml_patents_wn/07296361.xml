<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/491,361, filed Jul. 31, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to measuring devices and to methods of measuring, and, particularly, to measuring devices for measuring dimension in hollow organs of the body (especially airways) and to methods of measuring such dimensions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Infants can be born with or develop narrowing of the trachea or larynx for a variety of medical ailments. The present method of evaluating the amount of narrowing in these areas is limited. The current technique involves passing various endotracheal tubes of known diameter into the stenotic region. After a tube passes though the narrowing, an airleak is assessed, and the percent stenosis is approximated as the diameter of the tube relative to the age appropriate lumen. This technique assumes that the stricture is concentric and relies on surgeon's insertion method. Not only is the present method potentially inaccurate, but it may be traumatic to the tissue in the stenotic region.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one aspect, the present invention provides a device for measuring dimensions in a hollow organ of the body, including: a length of conduit; a measuring mechanism on one end of the conduit; and an indicator in connection with a second end of the conduit. The indicator is in operative connection with the measuring mechanism to provide an indication of a dimension measured by the measuring mechanism. In one embodiment, the measuring mechanism includes extending members that open and close in the manner of forceps to contact the walls of the organ. The user of the device can, for example, be provided with tactile, visual and/or other indications that the extending members have contacted the wall(s) of the organ to be measured. The indicator preferably includes an indicating element that is calibrated to the distance between the distal ends of the extending members. The indicating element can, for example, move to provide the user of the device with an indication of the distance between the distal ends of the extending members. The indicating element can also or alternatively be in operative connection with a display to provide the user of the device with a displayed indication of the distance between the distal ends of the extending members.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The conduit of the measuring device can be flexible or be rigid, but should be suitable to transport the measuring mechanism thereon to the internal area to be measured. In one embodiment, the conduit is adapted for insertion into an airway. The conduit can, for example, be an extending (or insertion) section or member of an endoscope. In that embodiment, the extending members of the measuring device are, for example, connected to a forceps-like handle of the endoscope via a connecting member passing through the extending section of the endoscope to control the distance between the distal ends of the extending members. The device can further include a port for a camera or other viewing device on the second end of the conduit to enable visualization of the area to be measured or the action of the measuring mechanism. Endoscopes, for example, are commonly provided with such a camera, video or viewing port.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention also provides a method of measuring dimensions in a hollow organ of the body, comprising the steps: inserting a conduit into a hollow organ, the conduit having a measuring mechanism on the end thereof that is inserted into the organ, the conduit having in connection with the other end thereof an indicator in operative connection with the measuring mechanism to provided an indication of a dimension measured by the measuring mechanism to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As described above, the measuring mechanism can include extending members that open and close in the manner of forceps. As also described above, the conduit can be an extending or insertion section of an endoscope. In one embodiment, the conduit is inserted into an airway to measure a narrowing therein. The user can measure the width or dimension of such narrowings in multiple planes (for example, by rotating the device and taking multiple measurement in distinct orientations) to get an accurate representation of the dimensions of the narrowing.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an effort to increase the accuracy of measurements of, for example, trachea narrowing, the present invention provides an instrument or device that can, for example, be readily incorporated into an existing endoscope <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) through relatively minor retrofitting thereof. In one embodiment, a measuring device of the present invention is passed through a bronchoscope to accurately assess the size of the trachea or larynx using, for example, a measuring mechanism on the forward end of the measuring device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Two different measuring devices <b>110</b> and <b>210</b> of the present invention (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, respectively) were assembled and tested in several studies of the present invention. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a mechanical caliper <b>160</b> was attached to the handle of an endoscope to measure the airway. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a digital caliper system <b>260</b> provides an electronic measurement of the amount of narrowing.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Endoscopes are devices that are utilized by medical professionals to perform minimally invasive treatments on patients. In its most basic form, an endoscope (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) is a tool that is used to visualize the interior of a hollow organ or to grab small objects or body materials when equipped with gripping forceps on the distal end thereof. For example, an endoscope can be used to remove unwanted material in blocked passages such as airways or nostrils. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, in one embodiment endoscope <b>10</b> includes two basic mechanical parts: forceps <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) at an end of an extending member <b>30</b> and control handles <b>40</b>. The primary action in endoscope <b>10</b> occurs when handles <b>40</b> are opened and closed. In that regard, forceps <b>20</b> are mechanically coupled to handles <b>40</b>. Endoscope <b>10</b> also includes a camera mount or port <b>50</b> on the handle end so that a physician can view a video representation of the action of forceps <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the case of measuring devices <b>110</b> and <b>210</b> of the present invention, the grasping or grabbing forceps of a commercially available endoscope (available from Karl Storz GmbH &amp; Co. KG of Tuttlingen, Germany) were removed and a measuring device or mechanism <b>120</b> was attached to the end of extending or insertion member <b>130</b> of endoscopic measuring device <b>110</b>. Measuring mechanism <b>120</b> includes extending members <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> having a forceps- or scissor-like opening and closing motion as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a mechanical/analog indicating or display device <b>160</b> similar in operation to a protractor can, for example, be mounted on a handle <b>140</b> and appropriately calibrated using methods known in the mechanical arts so that there is a direct correlation between the indicated measurement and the opening of handle members <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> of handle <b>140</b> (and thereby the distance between the tips of the extending members <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>). Measuring devices other than calipers can also be used in the present invention. Such measuring devices can, for example, be mechanical (such as expanding rings that take the form of the narrowing) or use energy such as sound or light to measure the narrowing.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The devices and methods of the present invention enable ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeons to perform relatively non-invasive measuring techniques to measure narrowing in the trachea or larynx and even other areas of the body. Once again, the currently practiced measuring technique is inadequate as it can be traumatic to the vocal cords, trachea, and larynx. Moreover, the present method does not consider bulges in the throat—it assumes that the airway is constricted concentrically. Unlike the currently practiced method, the devices and measurement procedures of the present invention are relatively non-invasive. In that regard, the calipers/extending members will not be intrusive to the patient. Moreover, the devices of the present invention are also practical and allow accurate, repeatable readings without intruding on a surgeon's ability to manipulate the endoscope.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, measuring device <b>120</b> was operatively connected to the end linkages each of mechanical caliper <b>160</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and a digital caliper <b>260</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). As discussed above, the airway measuring systems or devices of the present invention preferably provide repeatable and accurate results while not harming the patient in any way. Therefore, in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 6</figref>, forceps-like extending members <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> were made straight to allow for linear calibration with motion of handles <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>. Moreover, the tips of extending members <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> were blunted so that they would not pierce the tissue in the stenotic region. Extending members <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> were also made of a length to accommodate the 1.2 cm maximum airway opening of an infant. Other size forceps may be used with adults or for use in measurements in other areas of the body. With forceps-like extending members <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> of the present invention, an airway can be measured in a single step, thus making the procedure safer and faster than original technique. Forceps-like extending members <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> of the present invention generally cause the endoscope to loose its grasping function. To obtain the measurement of a narrowing in multiple planes, the user can rotate extending member <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> of measurement device <b>120</b> through, for example, the lateral and anterior-posterior orientation, while taking multiple measurements to get a more accurate representation of the narrowing. No longer must the surgeon assume that the narrowing is concentric.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, both of the illustrated measurement devices are directly attached using the existing handle pivot screw assembly of a currently available endoscope. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, mechanical caliper <b>160</b> includes a pointer <b>162</b> used in connection with a “measuring arc” <b>164</b> that indicates the size of the larynx/trachea using, for example, the angle of movement of handles <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>. Mechanical airway caliper <b>160</b> was easily calibrated using known diameter tubes so that an indicator or indicators could be placed in operative connection with measuring arc <b>164</b> to provide a visual indication of the narrowing distance. The resolution of one early embodiment of the manual caliper (which was not optimized) was approximately 1 mm, which is significantly more accurate than the currently practiced tube insertion technique of measuring narrowing distance. Mechanical caliper <b>160</b> can be readily made to be symmetric and can thus be used with either the right or left hand.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, digital caliper <b>260</b> measures the linear distance traveled by a rigid member such as a rod that operatively connects extending member <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> to handles <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> in endoscopic measuring device <b>210</b>. In the case of measuring device <b>210</b>, an off-the-shelf digital measuring device <b>260</b> (available, for example, from Woodcutters Supply Inc.) was secured to handles <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> to be linearly slideable with the motion of the rod. A digital caliper or other measuring device can provide several advantages over mechanical measuring devices. For example, one advantage is accuracy—digital measuring device <b>260</b> and other digital measuring devices can, for example, measure to an accuracy of 0.1 mm. In addition, digital measuring device <b>260</b> provides an exact reading of the narrowing upon a display <b>262</b> rather than relying on the health professional's ability to read the value from an arc-pointer or other mechanical indicating system. Finally, a digital system can be more readily equipped to provide digital recording/storage of several measurements of the airway profile that can be directly downloaded and saved onto, for example, a PC in digital format. In that regard, digital measuring device <b>260</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes a data port <b>264</b> that attaches to a PC via an appropriate data cable as known in the art. Alternatively, digital measuring device can be equipped with a wireless transmission system for transfer of data. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (and as with many existing hand-held calipers), digital display <b>262</b> is optimized for viewing by right-handed users.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the embodiment of measuring devices <b>110</b> and <b>210</b>, the ends of handles <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> can, for example, be connected (for example, pinned) to the first end of a connecting member (represented by dashed line <b>132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) such as a wire, a rod or other rigid member that was positioned within the hollow shaft of extending member <b>130</b>. The end of handles <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> can be connected to connecting member <b>132</b> so that when the handles <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> are opened, connecting member <b>132</b> moves toward handles <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>. Likewise, when handles <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> are closed, connecting member <b>132</b> moves away from handles <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>. At the second end of connecting member <b>142</b>, extending members <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> can be connected (for example, pinned) such that they open (that is, the distal ends spread apart) when connecting member <b>132</b> moves toward handles <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> (that is, when handles <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> are opened) and close when connecting member <b>132</b> moves away from handles <b>142</b> and <b>142</b> (that is, when handles <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> are closed). For a known extending member geometry, the distance between the ends of the extending member can, for example, be directly determined by measuring the linear motion of connecting member <b>132</b>. As described above, either digital or mechanical indicating elements or devices can be used to accurately measure the linear motion of connecting member <b>132</b>.</p>
