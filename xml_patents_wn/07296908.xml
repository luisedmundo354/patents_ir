<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Housings for emergency unit luminaires with a front portion that includes a printed circuit board and other operational components and a back portion that includes electrical contacts configured to connect to a source of external power. When the front and back portions are engaged, contact pads projecting from the printed circuit board are guided into engagement with the electrical contacts of the back portion for connection to the external power source. The front portion is disengaged from the back portion, and thus disconnected from power, when needed, for example, for maintenance of the unit.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to emergency lighting luminaires and particularly to housings for emergency unit luminaires.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Building codes require emergency unit lighting fixtures for illumination of egress pathways, doorways, and the like to facilitate evacuation of a building during emergency conditions, such as when a main power supply to the building fails resulting in loss of usual illumination sources. Emergency unit fixtures provide a usable amount of light to enable evacuating persons to follow a preferred pathway out of the space being evacuated. Emergency unit fixtures or luminaires typically include a housing within which an emergency power supply, such as batteries, and circuitry are disposed for driving one or more lamps mounted to the exterior of the housing. In typical emergency unit luminaires, a pair of lamps are mounted to the top of the housing with each lamp being directed forward and to the side away from the housing. Such unit luminaires are often referred to as “frog eyes” and typically do not include a “legend” as exit signs do, thereby allowing use of emergency unit luminaires in locations inappropriate for exit signs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Existing luminaires typically include either fixed optical assemblies or movable optical assemblies. Generally, a housing for mounting a fixed optical assembly has a different design and construction than a housing for mounting a movable optical assembly. In each type of emergency unit luminaire, the housing functions to mount optical assemblies, as well as to contain a source of emergency power supply along with necessary circuitry for operation and testing of the luminaire. Existing luminaire housings made of polymeric materials are often subject to material “creep” or sag due to the weight of a power supply, such as a battery, that is intended to be supported by the housing. Additionally, existing luminaires are time consuming to install and difficult to maintain because of fasteners that require tools for assembly and disassembly of the luminaire.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One existing unit luminaire includes external lamping mounted on a luminaire housing and aimed to direct light into a space in order to facilitate evacuation of the space when an emergency arises. Another existing emergency unit luminaire includes movable optical assemblies mounted to each end of the luminaire housing. Yet another existing device includes movable lighting assemblies operable within a combination emergency unit/exit sign. These existing movable optical assemblies are capable of swiveling or other motion, providing a single degree of freedom so that light from the optical assemblies may be directed toward desired locations.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Despite the existence of numerous commercially available emergency unit luminaires, there remain needs for a luminaire housing that is usable with both fixed and movable optical assemblies, configured to transfer at least the weight of a contained power source to a structure to which the housing is mounted, and easily installed without the use of tools and capable of ready disassembly for maintenance.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This invention provides housings for emergency unit luminaires. A housing may be configured to receive both fixed and movable optical assemblies for mounting, allowing for the manufacture of a single housing for production of differing lighting products or lamp assemblies. A housing may also include structure that transfers at least some of the load associated with a contained power supply and other operational components to a wall or similar structure onto which the luminaire is mounted. Additionally, structural elements of a housing may support printed circuit boards, electronics, test devices, and the like, as well as permit electrical connections to be accomplished during assembly of front and back portions of the housing without the need for fasteners requiring tools.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment of this invention, a housing for an emergency unit luminaire includes at least one concavity within which a movable optical assembly and a fixed optical assembly may be interchangeably mounted. Each concavity may include a first opening that receives a portion of a movable optical assembly when a movable optical assembly is mounted in the concavity and a second opening that receives a portion of a fixed optical assembly when a fixed optical assembly is mounted in the concavity. The housing may also include a front portion and a back portion that may be releasably engaged, wherein the front portion and back portion, when engaged, define a chamber that contains operational components of the luminaire. The front and back portions may be unitary structures formed of a plastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In certain embodiments of this invention, a front portion of a housing may include sloped projections extending from an interior surface that engage receiving projections extending from an interior surface of a back portion of the housing such that surfaces of the sloped projections bias against surfaces of the receiving projections upon engagement of the front portion and the back portion to transfer weight associated with the front portion and the operational components of the luminaire to a structure of a building to which the back portion is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In certain embodiments of this invention, a front portion of a housing receives a printed circuit board that includes projections carrying electrical contact pads. A back portion of the housing mounts electrical contacts that are connected to a source of power external of the housing, and, upon engagement of the front portion and the back portion, the back portion guides the projections of the printed circuit board into engagement with the electrical contacts to form at least a portion of an electrical circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A housing may also include a test mechanism that tests the operational status of components of the luminaire according to certain embodiments of this invention. The test mechanism includes a light-transmissive push button extending through an opening in the housing, a light-transmissive base operable with the push button, wherein the base carries light from a light emitting diode on a printed circuit board inside the housing, and an element that engages a test switch on the printed circuit board upon depression of the push button to initiate a test sequence. The push button, base, and element may be integrally formed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to certain embodiments of the present invention, front and back portions of a housing may be formed of a polymeric material, and the operational components may include a battery and a printed circuit board. The printed circuit board may be positively latched within the front portion of the housing, which may also include guide plates in the front portion, back portion, or both that guide the printed circuit board into engagement with electrical contacts upon engagement of the front portion and back portion.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Additional features and embodiments of this invention are set forth in the detailed description below.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 9B</figref> and <b>13</b> to provide a complete description of the interrelationship of the several structural components of face portion <b>22</b> and back plate <b>44</b>. The views provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 9B</figref> and <b>13</b> particularly illustrate face portion <b>22</b> and back plate <b>44</b> and show each as molded component parts of a luminaire, such as luminaire <b>10</b> or <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an exploded perspective view of various component parts of the luminaire that are mounted by face portion <b>22</b> such that they are within chamber <b>45</b> of housing <b>18</b> when back plate <b>44</b> is releasably connected to face portion <b>22</b>. Other figures, for ease of illustration, show face portion <b>22</b> or back plate <b>44</b> without other components of the luminaire being shown.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 9B</figref> and <b>13</b>, face portion <b>22</b> includes semispherical walls <b>46</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, that define concavities <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Planar flats <b>38</b> are formed integrally with semispherical walls <b>46</b>. A stop wall <b>50</b> is located at the juncture between each flat <b>38</b> and the inside surface of face portion <b>22</b>. Stop walls <b>50</b> act with a corresponding portion of a mounted movable optical assembly <b>14</b> to prevent full 360° rotation of optical assembly <b>14</b> within concavity <b>30</b>, which is necessary so that wiring from movable optical assembly <b>14</b> will not twist too much and become damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Face portion <b>22</b> includes a knock out <b>52</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, that permits a conduit (not shown) to extend into interior of housing <b>18</b> upon removal of knock out <b>52</b>. The conduit contains wiring that is connectable in a conventional manner to electronics contained within is housing <b>18</b>.

Removal of knock out <b>64</b> permits alignment with knockout <b>52</b> such that a conduit can extend into housing <b>18</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Plate <b>62</b> is supported at least in part by supports <b>66</b> that are preferably integrally formed with plate <b>62</b> and an interior back wall <b>68</b> of back plate <b>44</b>. Key-shaped knock outs <b>70</b> are in various locations on back wall <b>68</b>. One or more of knock outs <b>70</b> are removable in order to facilitate a desired mounting to a junction box using conventional fasteners, such as a junction box mounted to or flushly in the wall of a building, as well understood by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Face portion <b>22</b> includes protrusions <b>72</b> having flat-bottomed plates <b>74</b>. Edges of protrusions <b>72</b> and plates <b>74</b> contact opposing portions of back plate <b>44</b> upon assembly of back plate <b>44</b> to face portion <b>22</b> to partially define and enclose chamber <b>45</b>, which is described in further detail below. The contact between protrusions <b>72</b> and plates <b>74</b> with opposing portions of back plate <b>44</b> stabilizes, at least partially, assembly of the component parts of housing <b>18</b>. Opposing interior plates <b>76</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, act to assist in locating and holding in place a battery <b>78</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Top edge portions of battery <b>78</b> fit within notches <b>80</b> in guide plates <b>82</b>.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As may be appreciated by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, battery <b>78</b> sits on upper surface plates <b>84</b> of three T-ribs <b>86</b>. Spacer plates <b>88</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, are located at surface plates <b>84</b> to maintain battery <b>78</b> at the appropriate location on surface plates <b>84</b>. T-ribs <b>86</b> extend from an interior surface of face portion <b>22</b> in aligned and spaced relation to each other and also in spaced relation to and below protrusions <b>72</b> and guide plates <b>82</b>. Leg portions <b>90</b> strengthen T-ribs <b>86</b> and have lower edges <b>92</b> that slope downwardly to junctures with the interior surface of face portion <b>22</b>. The two outside T-ribs <b>86</b> cooperate with two H-ribs <b>94</b> formed on back plate <b>44</b>, as further described below. Battery <b>78</b> is further maintained in place by means of a strap <b>96</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 11</figref>. Strap <b>96</b> includes conventional cooperating fastening elements, such as hook and loop fastening elements or the like, so that strap <b>96</b> can quickly be fed through a pair of loops <b>98</b> formed on the interior surface of face portion <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B, <b>6</b>, and <b>11</b>. Strap <b>96</b> is wrapped about battery <b>78</b> and ends of strap <b>96</b> are connected together along with, optionally, a buckle <b>99</b> for additional security to maintain battery <b>78</b> in the desired location within housing <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B, <b>8</b>A, and <b>8</b>B as well as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, walls <b>102</b> partially define chamber <b>45</b> and are formed on semispherical walls <b>46</b>. Each wall <b>102</b> is generally L-shaped in combination with a plate <b>104</b> extending inwardly toward the center of the interior of housing <b>18</b>. A notch <b>106</b> is formed in each plate <b>104</b> to allow respective tongues <b>108</b> to flex when biased inwardly upon contact between edges of a printed circuit board <b>109</b> and a ramp <b>111</b> formed on each of tongues <b>108</b>. Ramps <b>111</b> each have a detent edge <b>112</b> formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Printed circuit board <b>109</b> includes a notch <b>113</b> cut away from each lateral edge so that rear edges of each of ramps <b>111</b> snap into notches <b>113</b> upon sufficient insertion of printed circuit board <b>109</b> past ramps <b>111</b>. Detent edges <b>112</b> of ramps <b>111</b> engage notches <b>113</b> of printed circuit board <b>109</b> to hold printed circuit board <b>109</b> within tracks <b>115</b> that are defined by outer edge portions of plates <b>104</b> and opposing spaced plates <b>117</b> formed one each on inside surfaces of walls <b>102</b>. Printed circuit board <b>109</b> is thereby positively mounted in an appropriate location within housing <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Printed circuit board <b>109</b> is further mounted along a front edge using guide plates <b>124</b> formed on the inside surface of face portion <b>22</b> below T-ribs <b>86</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B</figref>, <b>8</b>A, and <b>8</b>B. Guide plates <b>124</b> each include a shaped notch <b>126</b>. Front edges <b>129</b> of each notch <b>126</b> angle downwardly and upwardly respectively such that front edges of printed circuit board <b>109</b> contact edges <b>129</b> and are guided to a position against respective interior edges <b>130</b> of notches <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Face portion <b>22</b> also includes a pair of spaced plates <b>132</b> located between apertures <b>40</b>. Each plate <b>132</b> has a notch <b>134</b> that receives a portion of light pipe/actuator <b>143</b>, as described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Light emitting diode <b>142</b> located on printed circuit board <b>109</b> is disposed in proximity to lens <b>141</b> of light pipe/actuator <b>143</b> so that light generated by light emitting diode <b>142</b> passes through the portion of lens <b>141</b> located in aperture <b>42</b> of housing <b>18</b>. Battery status and diagnostic testing related to operational status of electronics carried by circuit board <b>109</b> may be conveniently performed with light from light emitting diode <b>142</b> being visible through aperture <b>42</b> to permit a rapid check of such testing, as described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> in particular and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, back plate <b>44</b> includes snaps <b>144</b> formed along a lower peripheral edge <b>145</b> of back plate <b>44</b>. Snaps <b>144</b> are spaced apart from a tab <b>136</b> located on edge <b>145</b>. Each of snaps <b>144</b> has a generally circular snap plate <b>146</b> formed thereon. Distal portions of snap plates <b>146</b> are tapered to engage ramp portions <b>148</b> inset into the lower edge of apron <b>24</b> of face portion <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. Ramp portions <b>148</b> may be depressions formed in apron <b>24</b> so that snap plates <b>146</b> can be guided into alignment with and snap fit into apertures <b>40</b> of face portion <b>22</b> to engage back plate <b>44</b> to face portion <b>22</b>. Simultaneously, upper portions of edges <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> of back plate <b>44</b> snap fit beneath snap plates <b>54</b> of face portion <b>22</b>, as described above, to positively engage back plate <b>44</b> to face portion <b>22</b> along the upper periphery of housing <b>18</b>. Notches <b>147</b> are formed on each side of snaps <b>144</b> to permit desired flexing of snaps <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Upon engagement of back plate <b>44</b> to face portion <b>22</b>, L-shaped walls <b>154</b> of back plate <b>44</b> fit against or near to edges of walls <b>102</b> of face portion <b>22</b> to define interior chamber <b>45</b> and substantially enclose components held within interior of housing <b>18</b>. Semispherical walls <b>156</b> on opposite sides of back plate <b>44</b> shield, but do not generally engage or contact, openings <b>32</b> formed in face portion <b>22</b>. Interior chamber <b>45</b> protects wiring, such as wiring <b>155</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> with fixed optical assembly <b>16</b>, extending from the optical assembly of the luminaire for electrical connection with appropriate electronics (not shown) mounted by printed circuit board <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Generally rectangular openings <b>158</b> are included in back plate <b>44</b> as a manufacturing expedient. Hook-like tabs <b>160</b> extend from outermost vertical edges of openings <b>158</b>. Tabs <b>160</b> hold a cover <b>162</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. Cover <b>162</b> includes side notches <b>163</b> that receive portions of tabs <b>160</b> to releasably mount cover <b>162</b> to back plate <b>44</b>. Cover <b>162</b> also includes spaced slots <b>165</b> on its outer face that receive tongues <b>167</b> of printed circuit board <b>109</b>. Tongues <b>167</b> of circuit board <b>109</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>8</b>A, and <b>8</b>B, include electrical contact pads <b>169</b> formed thereon, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, that engage electrical contacts <b>171</b> of wires <b>173</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. Pads <b>169</b> electrically connect to circuitry (not shown) carried by circuit board <b>109</b>, and wires <b>173</b> extend through an opening <b>166</b> in back plate <b>44</b> for connection to an external power source (not shown). Power is thereby provided to circuitry (not shown) housed within the luminaire during normal, non-emergency conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Generally, tongues <b>167</b> of printed circuit board <b>109</b> act as an electrical “plug” that is plugged into a power source upon engaging face portion <b>22</b> and back plate <b>44</b>. Face portion <b>22</b> and back plate <b>44</b> are aligned on assembly to permit entry of tongues <b>167</b> into spaced slots <b>165</b> and thus into engagement with electrical contacts <b>171</b>. Angled guide elements <b>175</b> and <b>177</b> formed on either side of each slot <b>165</b> facilitate proper location of tongues <b>167</b> relative to slots <b>165</b>. Cover <b>162</b> also has a series of notches <b>179</b> that receive ends of wires <b>173</b> and assist in holding wires <b>173</b> and electrical contacts <b>171</b> in place. Cover <b>162</b> is preferably formed as a separate component rather than being formed integrally with back plate <b>44</b> to allow placement of electrical contacts <b>171</b> between I-shaped ribs <b>164</b> formed on back plate <b>44</b>, mounting cover <b>162</b> over electrical contacts <b>171</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</figref>, <b>5</b>B, <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B, <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B, H-ribs <b>94</b> on back plate <b>44</b> each include a ramp edge <b>168</b> that acts to lift up T-ribs <b>86</b> of face portion <b>22</b> upon engagement of T-ribs <b>86</b> and H-ribs <b>94</b>. Edges <b>92</b> of T-ribs <b>86</b> bias against bight portions <b>181</b> of H-ribs <b>94</b> to facilitate engagement between T-ribs <b>86</b> and H-ribs <b>94</b>. Engagement between T-ribs <b>86</b> and H-ribs <b>94</b> transfers the weight of battery <b>78</b>, as well as, at least partially, the weight of face portion <b>22</b> and other operational components of the luminaire, to back plate <b>44</b> and then to the structure to which the luminaire is mounted, such as wall <b>20</b>. Thus, face portion <b>22</b> is not required to support the weight of battery <b>78</b>, among other components. This minimizes sagging of housing <b>18</b> that results from “plastic creep” that often occurs in luminaires when heavy components contained within a plastic emergency unit luminaire must be supported by walls of the housing. The weight support structure described above permits the thickness of a plastic material used to form housing <b>18</b> to be reduced relative to the material thickness normally used for emergency luminaire housings. Additionally, reinforcement structure normally employed for providing support to such luminaire housings may be reduced when using the weight support structure described above.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Tab <b>136</b> of back plate <b>44</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, is received along inner surfaces of apron <b>24</b> of face portion <b>22</b>. Tab <b>136</b> provides support for central lower edge portions of back plate <b>44</b>. Back plate <b>44</b> also includes guide plates <b>199</b> with lead-in ramps <b>201</b> that contact edges of an installed printed circuit board <b>109</b> to more positively locate printed circuit board <b>109</b> and provide at least some support for outer edges of printed circuit board <b>109</b>. Two of guide plates <b>199</b> are located one each below hook-like tabs <b>160</b> and two other of guide plates <b>199</b> are located outside of H-ribs <b>94</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a perspective view of a light pipe and test element actuator mountable to an embodiment of a face portion of a housing of this invention. Light pipe/actuator <b>143</b> includes lens <b>141</b>. Lens <b>141</b> is elliptical in shape and sized to fit flush within aperture <b>42</b> formed in face portion <b>22</b>. Lens <b>141</b> has a clear base <b>202</b> that functions as a “light pipe” and connects to a plate <b>204</b> having ears <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> at its opposing ends. An elongated cruciform element <b>210</b> extends upwardly from ear <b>208</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Plate <b>204</b> tapers to form an elongated body element <b>212</b> that curves at <b>214</b> to terminate in a generally rectangular plate <b>216</b>. Plate <b>216</b> has spaced ribs <b>218</b> that extend from an upper face of plate <b>216</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Light pipe/actuator <b>143</b> is preferably formed as an integral piece of optically clear plastic material, although portions of light pipe/actuator <b>143</b> do not have to be so formed. When light pipe/actuator <b>143</b> is placed into face portion <b>22</b>, aperture <b>42</b> receives lens <b>141</b> and plate <b>216</b> engages notches <b>134</b> formed in plates <b>132</b> on face portion <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). Ribs <b>218</b> are disposed in juxtaposition to inner wall surfaces of plates <b>132</b> to assist in properly positioning light pipe/actuator <b>143</b>. Ears <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> bias against edges of plates <b>132</b> to prevent lens <b>141</b> from extending into aperture <b>42</b> to a greater degree than is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The mounting of light pipe/actuator <b>143</b> described above permits flexing of light pipe/actuator <b>143</b> when lens <b>141</b> is depressed manually from housing <b>18</b> of a luminaire. Upon depression of lens <b>141</b>, light pipe/actuator <b>143</b> flexes to depress a test switch <b>200</b> on printed circuit board <b>109</b> through contact of cruciform element <b>210</b> with test switch <b>200</b>. The sequence of events beginning with depression of lens <b>141</b> and ending with depression of test switch <b>200</b> initiates a test sequence that includes disengagement of external power to the luminaire for simulation of mains power loss. Accordingly, battery <b>78</b>, the circuitry (not shown) carried by printed circuit board <b>109</b>, lamping, etc., may be tested and/or subjected to diagnostic procedures. Thus, light pipe/actuator <b>143</b> acts a push button, as well as a pathway for light from light emitting diode <b>142</b> such that the light is visible externally. As well understood by those skilled in the art, printed circuit board <b>109</b> includes discrete circuit elements (generally not shown except as noted herein) on its lower face and printed circuits (not shown) on its upper face, and contact pads <b>169</b> on tongues <b>167</b> connect to such circuits and circuit elements.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is an exploded perspective view of a fixed optical assembly that may be used in an embodiment of a housing of this invention. Fixed optical assembly <b>16</b> includes lens <b>220</b> shaped at its periphery to mate with the shape of concavity <b>30</b>. Lens <b>220</b> has a notch <b>222</b> with a snap tab <b>224</b> disposed adjacently thereto. Snap tab <b>224</b> snap fits onto an edge of opening <b>34</b> in face portion <b>22</b> to facilitate mounting of lens <b>220</b> within concavity <b>30</b>. It should be understood that opening <b>34</b> cannot have a movable optical assembly <b>14</b> mounted therein when a fixed optical assembly <b>16</b> is mounted within concavity <b>30</b>. Lens <b>220</b> also includes a tab <b>226</b> that fits into rectangular opening <b>36</b> of face portion <b>22</b>. Lens <b>220</b> is snap-fit to face portion <b>22</b> and removable by disengagement of lens <b>220</b> as permitted by the flexible nature of tabs <b>224</b> and <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A reflector <b>228</b> fits within concavity <b>30</b> and includes a peripheral flange <b>230</b> enlarged on opposite sides of the reflector.

Reflector <b>228</b> also includes a body member <b>229</b> that is generally conical and extends inwardly to an opening <b>236</b> that receives an electrical socket <b>238</b> mounting a lamp <b>240</b>. Electrical socket <b>238</b> is connected to printed circuit board <b>109</b> by wiring <b>155</b>. Surfaces <b>246</b> of body member <b>229</b> may be coated with a reflective material in order to better direct light from lamp <b>240</b> outwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, battery <b>78</b> includes a wire <b>248</b> with an electrical connector <b>250</b> formed at its end. Electrical connector <b>250</b> connects to a connector <b>252</b> at an end of a wire <b>254</b> that is connected to printed circuit board <b>109</b>. Wires <b>248</b> and <b>254</b> remain disconnected until the luminaire is installed so that battery <b>78</b> does not lose power before the luminaire is placed into service. Battery <b>78</b> is also connected to printed circuit board <b>109</b> through a wire <b>256</b> terminating in a connector <b>258</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a rear perspective view of an embodiment of a housing according to this invention.

Housing <b>18</b> transfers at least some of the load associated with components, such as battery <b>78</b>, and face portion <b>22</b> to the structure on which the luminaire is mounted. Face portion <b>22</b> and back plate <b>44</b> include cooperating structural elements acting to mount printed circuit board <b>109</b> as well as to enclose chamber <b>45</b> within which electrical and other operational components are contained.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Back plate <b>44</b> is mounted to wall <b>20</b> or a similar support with face portion <b>22</b> mounting electronic components and then being snapped to back plate <b>44</b> both quickly and readily without the need for tools. Upon snap fitting of face portion <b>22</b> to back plate <b>44</b>, T-ribs <b>86</b> of face portion <b>22</b> engage H-ribs <b>94</b> of back plate <b>44</b> to transfer the weight of battery <b>78</b>, among other components, to wall <b>20</b>.
