<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a computing device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Personal computing devices typically take one of three forms. Tower and desktop personal computer (PC) systems include a relatively large housing in which is included a motherboard, one or more removable media drives, typically DVD and/or CD drives, and one or more mass-storage devices, more commonly termed hard disk drives. The motherboard supports a main processor fitted with a heatsink, which typically is cooled using a fan. The motherboard typically has supported on it a number of connectors for the connection of external devices, such as connectors for a monitor, one or more external drives, input devices such as a keyboard and a mouse, and the like. The motherboard typically is supported within the housing such that the connectors protrude through suitable holes formed in the rear of the housing, allowing external devices to be connected thereto. The motherboard also includes a number of connectors for the connection of internal devices, such as RAM and graphics cards, sound cards and the like. These devices normally extend in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the motherboard. Such PCs are powered by a cable connection to a mains electricity supply.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Modern PCs typically use one of the four most common motherboards, named ATX, ITX, BTX and Micro ATX. There are numerous advantages associated with using these motherboard types, including the cost effectiveness associated with manufacturing in large numbers. They typically are capable of supporting a wide range of computing power, and allow the connection of numerous additional components to the motherboard main processor. The Micro ATX and ITX motherboards have the same mounting holes, so one housing design can be used with either type of motherboard. The ITX, and Micro ATX motherboards also are available readily and cheaply worldwide, and are relatively small, having dimensions of 244 mm square. The new Flex ATX motherboard has maximum dimensions 229 mm by 191 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The functions of tower and desktop PCs can be provided in portable, battery-powered devices, commonly known as laptop computers, notebooks or notepads, which constitute the third form of PC. The components making up these laptop computers are different to those making up tower and desktop PCs, in particular by being smaller, lighter and by having significantly lower power consumption and heat generation. This applies particularly to the main processor. Laptop computers usually have less connectivity than tower or desktop PCs, since connectors can consume a relatively large amount of volume within a housing. As a consequence of the size and power consumption requirements of components for laptop computers, they tend to be more expensive than corresponding tower and desktop PC components, and they also tend to be less compatible with other PC components than corresponding tower and desktop PC components. Laptop main processors for example tend to cost about twice as much as corresponding desktop PC main processors. Because the power resources available to laptop computers is less than that available to tower or desktop computers, laptop computers tend to have less powerful processors than corresponding tower or desktop PCs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although it is known to provide PCs with outputs suitable for connection to television sets, it still is much more common to use a dedicated monitor instead. This is thought by the inventors to be in part because of the size of conventional PCs, which are too large to lend them easily to being placed under a television set along with a VCR or DVD player. The fans required for PCs can also make them sufficiently noisy to constitute an irritation when being used with a television set. Although laptop computers have a size more suitable for placement beneath a television set, they do not tend to have television output connectors, since they are designed primarily for portable use, and they also are relatively expensive.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an aim of the invention to provide a cost effective computing device which is easily usable with a television set.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a computing device that has a housing having upper, lower, first and second side faces, and front and rear faces. The computing device further has a mains-powered personal computer motherboard of the type including a main processor with a heatsink, both of which are disposed at or near to a first edge of the motherboard and connectors disposed at a second edge of the motherboard. The second and first edges are adjacent to one another, the second and a third edge of the motherboard are adjacent to one another, and the third edge is opposite the first edge. The motherboard is secured in the housing with the connectors contacting the rear face of the housing and the main processor is disposed adjacent the first side face of the housing and in the proximity of a first vent formed therein. A power supply is secured to the housing between the third edge of the motherboard and the second side face of the housing, and is proximate to the rear and second side faces of the housing. A fixed mass-storage device and a removable memory media drive are located one above the other, between the third edge of the motherboard and the second side face of the housing, and in the volume between the power supply and the front face of the housing, wherein the media is transportable to and from the removable memory media drive though an aperture in the front face of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This computing device can use an off-the-shelf tower or desktop PC motherboard, so can provide all the computing power associated with such PCs, yet can be fitted into a housing small enough to fit easily alongside or underneath a television set. The embodied device is in a housing approximately the same size as a typical home slimline DVD player, or any slimline audio/video component.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the embodiments, the motherboard is a Micro ATX, an ITX or a Flex ATX motherboard. These motherboards are characterised in that are available off-the-shelf, in that they are mains-powered, i.e. are not suitable for use in portable, battery-powered computing devices, and in that they have a main processor with a heatsink disposed at one edge of the motherboard and connectors disposed at an adjacent edge of the motherboard. The invention is applicable to ATX, Micro ATX and ITX and Flex ATX motherboards and to other standardised, off-the-shelf and mains-powered motherboards which include a main processor with a heatsink disposed at one edge of the motherboard and connectors disposed at an adjacent edge of the motherboard. A mains powered motherboard could be considered as one having a maximum operational power consumption exceeding 50 Watts, or one which it is not practicable to operate in normal use for a reasonable period of time using a battery suitable for portable computing use.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is no need to provide a separate monitor for use with the computing device, since it can be used with an existing television set, thereby reducing the costs of making the device interface appropriately with a user.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The computing device of the invention can also be provided with the functions of a DVD player, thereby eliminating the need for a separate device. Because the device has in-built computing capability, providing it with a tuner or a digital television signal input can allow it to be provided relatively easily with the function of a hard-disk recorder. If the removable memory media drive is able to record data onto media, for example by being a DVD-R or DVD-RW drive, then the device can also be provided with the function of a DVD recorder or DVD rewriter with relatively little additional software. The computing device can also be capable of the functions of conventional CD players, with the additional capability to handle MP3, DIVX, MPEG-3 and -4 and many other formats.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Use of the device as a PC can be achieved easily by the connection of a keyboard and mouse. Preferably, these are connected wirelessly, using Bluetooth or alternatively an infra-red receiver located externally or in the front panel of the housing. The device can be used as a PC at distances from the display device (the television) that would normally be found when watching television normally, so it may not be necessary for any change in the seating location of a user. A wireless keyboard is easily supported on a user's lap. Microsoft Corporation has released their Media Center operating software, remote, and wireless keyboard, which will allow simple switching between the functions of the computing device</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Where the motherboard includes power connectors disposed at an edge adjacent the front face, cabling connecting the motherboard power connectors preferably runs along part of that edge between the motherboard and the front face, and along the edge of the motherboard opposite the edge including the main processor to the power supply. This allows power to be provided to the motherboard whilst allowing the power supply to be located in the volume between the storage device and the rear face of the housing. This also allows the motherboard to be placed only a short distance, sufficient to allow the cabling to pass, from the power supply and the fixed mass-storage device or the removable memory media drive.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably the heatsink includes plural generally parallel blades extending at least approximately in the direction of the vent. This allows heat to be conducted away from the processor and heatsink arrangement directly to atmosphere, without first passing through any substantial volume within the housing, thereby minimising the amount by which other components within the housing become heated by the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Advantageously the device further comprises a cooler fan operable to blow air from a cooler vent in the top face of the housing directly onto the heatsink. This provides additional efficiency of dissipation of heat from the heatsink to atmosphere. Preferably, the fixed mass-storage device is located adjacent the bottom and second side faces of the housing, and the removable memory media drive is located above the fixed mass-storage device adjacent the top face of the housing. This is advantageous since it can allow cabling to connect the power supply and the motherboard without preventing the position of the removable memory media drive to be dictated by the position of the cabling.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Advantageously the device further comprises a graphics card disposed in a plane parallel to the plane of the motherboard, the graphics card being connected to the motherboard by a riser. This can allow the functionality provided by a conventional tower or desktop PC graphics card to be provided within a relatively short housing. A conventional connection of a graphics card would ordinarily result in the card protruding a significant height from the motherboard, increasing significantly the size of the housing. Preferably, the graphics card includes a television output connector arranged to contact the rear face of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The processors used in tower and desktop PCs tend to be very powerful, in terms of processor speed and also in terms of processor bit width. To maximise processor speed for a given CMOS process size requires relatively high voltages, which results in a correspondingly high power consumption and heat generation. Heatsink and fan arrangements need to be used to remove heat from the processor, to prevent it from overheating. In tower and desktop PCs, heatsink and fan arrangements tend to strike a balance between cost and noise generation; cheaper arrangements involving more noisy fans than more expensive arrangements. The relatively large internal volume of desktop and tower PCs present few problems for heat removal, but smaller volumes could present heat removal problems. It is an aim of a secondary aspect of the invention to provide an arrangement which can allow a processor having a relatively level of heat generation to be operationally housed in a relatively low volume housing.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Advantageously, the heatsink includes plural generally parallel blades extending at least approximately in the direction of the first vent, and a graphics card is disposed in a plane parallel to the plane of the motherboard, the graphics card being connected to the motherboard by a riser card, the riser card being disposed at least approximately in line with the heatsink in the direction in which the blades extend. This can result in the deflection of air heated by the heatsink and blown by a fan by the riser. Providing a second vent in the upper face of the housing at the position of a face of the riser which faces the heatsink is advantageous since this heated air can be deflected directly to atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The device may include a duct extending between the heatsink and the first vent. This enhances the flow of air from the heatsink directly to atmosphere. When a cooler fan is used, the presence of the duct can obviate the need for an additional fan specifically for blowing air from the heatsink to atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Whether or not there is a duct, at least one fan may be located between the heatsink and the vent, the fan being operable to blow air from the vicinity of the heatsink through the first vent. Such can provide improved venting of heated air.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates in plan view internal components of a computing device <b>10</b> according to the invention. A housing includes a floor pan <b>11</b>, which constitutes a lower face, left and right side faces <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> and a rear face <b>14</b>. The floor pan <b>11</b> may be formed integrally with one or more of the left and right side and rear faces <b>12</b> to <b>14</b>, or some or all may be formed separately and subsequently connected together. The exact form of the housing is not critical on the invention, so long as it can form a chassis for the device <b>10</b>. A front panel <b>15</b> is connected to the floor pan <b>11</b> and to the left and right side faces <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>. As is usual with housings for DVD players and the like, the front panel <b>15</b> extends supra the footprint of the floor pan <b>11</b>. It also includes a treated metal portion (not shown) designed to prevent unwanted electromagnetic emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Secured to the floor pan <b>11</b> by some screw fixtures (not shown) is a motherboard <b>16</b>. The motherboard <b>16</b> is located approximately 10 mm from the first side face <b>12</b>, and is located up against and flush with the rear face <b>14</b> of the housing. The motherboard <b>16</b> is a Micro ATX motherboard, a Flex ATX motherboard or an ITX motherboard. Accordingly, it includes along a second edge <b>21</b> a series of connectors <b>17</b>, including a digital out connector <b>18</b> and a number of other connectors, including two or more USB connectors, a network connector, mouse and keyboard input connectors, a parallel port, two serial ports, line in and microphone (not shown), which are in register with apertures in the rear panel <b>14</b> so as to allow connection with external devices. The line out connector <b>18</b> is for connection directly to a digital television set or a PC monitor, thereby to provide an audio output. The portion of the motherboard <b>16</b> including the connector <b>17</b> is aligned along the rear panel <b>14</b> and adjacent a first edge <b>17</b> of the motherboard. The first edge <b>17</b> is adjacent to the left side panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">First to fourth USB ports <b>5</b>-<b>8</b> and an IEEE 1394 port, also known as a Firewire port, <b>9</b> are supported on the front panel <b>15</b> of the housing. This provides improved convenience to the user. The USB ports <b>5</b>-<b>8</b> and the Firewire port <b>9</b> are located behind a hinged flap (not shown), which hides the ports when they are not in use, i.e. when no cables are connected to them. This provides improved appearance, and also provides protection for the USB ports <b>5</b>-<b>8</b> against the infiltration of unwanted dirt and moisture. The USB ports <b>5</b>-<b>8</b> and the Firewire port <b>9</b> are connected to the motherboard using suitable cabling (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The USB ports <b>5</b>-<b>8</b> allow devices to be connected to the computing device without a user needing to attach cables to connectors at the rear of the housing. Such devices can include gaming controllers (also known as gamepads or joysticks), external harddrives, printers, card readers, pen drives, MP3 players, camcorders, DV camcorders, PDAs and the like. It will be appreciated that this then significantly enhances the functionality of the computing device <b>10</b>. The Firewire port <b>9</b> is particularly suitable for camcorders and DV camcorders, but can be used to effect by numerous other external devices.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The motherboard <b>16</b> includes approximately halfway along the first edge <b>19</b> a CPU (not shown), or main processor, on which is mounted a heatsink <b>20</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the CPU is hidden beneath the heatsink <b>20</b>. An end of the heatsink <b>20</b> is separated from the first edge <b>19</b> of the motherboard <b>16</b> by a short distance, for example 8-15 mm. The end of the heatsink thus is separated form the side face of the housing by 18-25 mm. The heatsink <b>20</b> includes a number of planar metal blades B which extend in a plane perpendicular to the page and parallel to the second edge <b>21</b> of the motherboard. Example heatsinks are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A third edge <b>22</b> of the motherboard <b>16</b> is located opposite the first edge <b>19</b>. In the quadrant of the motherboard <b>16</b> which is adjacent the second and third edges <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> are located first, second and third PCI connector blocks <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>. Located just towards the centre of the motherboard <b>16</b> from the first PCI connector <b>23</b> is an AGP connector <b>26</b>. The AGP connector <b>26</b> constitutes an accelerated graphics port. Located adjacent a fourth edge <b>27</b> of the motherboard <b>16</b> are first and second IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) ports <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, a power in connector <b>30</b> and a floppy disk drive connector <b>31</b>. The connectors <b>17</b>, the PCI connectors <b>23</b> to <b>25</b>, the AGP connector <b>26</b>, the IDE connectors <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, the power connector <b>30</b> and the floppy disk drive connector <b>31</b> are all standard components of Micro ATX, Flex ATX and ITX motherboards, so their operation and exact location need not be described in detail here.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The fourth edge <b>27</b> of the motherboard <b>16</b> is separated from the corresponding edge <b>32</b> of the floor pan <b>11</b> of the housing by a distance of approximately 20 mm. If the motherboard <b>16</b> is a Micro ATX or an ITX motherboard, it typically has dimensions of 244 mm square, which results in the length of the first and second side faces <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> of floor pan <b>11</b> being approximately 268 mm. Using a Flex ATX motherboard can result in a narrower housing.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A power supply <b>33</b> is located in the region of the housing adjacent the rear panel <b>14</b> and the second side panel <b>13</b>. The power supply <b>33</b> is arranged with its lengthwise axis extending parallel to the rear panel <b>14</b>. The power supply <b>33</b> is separated from the rear panel <b>14</b> by a distance of approximately 10 mm, and is separated from the second side panel <b>13</b> by a distance of approximately 20 mm. The power supply <b>33</b> is secured to the floor pan <b>11</b> by some screw fixings (not shown). The power supply <b>33</b> includes a mains connector <b>34</b>, which extends into the rear panel <b>14</b> so as to allow connection of a power cable (not shown) thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The power supply <b>33</b> has a dimension of 128 mm in the direction parallel to the rear face <b>14</b> of the housing, and is 78 mm long in a direction parallel to the second side face <b>13</b> of the housing. The height of the power supply is approximately 38 mm. The power supply <b>33</b> may take any suitable mains voltage. The power supply <b>33</b> is arranged to provide a suitable low voltage DC supply from a mains voltage anywhere in the range of 90 to 240V and a frequency of 50 or 60 Hz. Such power supplies are available off-the-shelf. Preferably, the power supply <b>33</b> is a custom power supply with a custom harness <b>36</b>, so as to allow the mains connector <b>34</b> to be located on the rear face <b>14</b> of the housing and to allow the harness <b>36</b> to be located on an edge <b>35</b> of the power supply closest to the motherboard <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A power supply fan <b>70</b> is arranged between the power supply <b>33</b> and the second side face <b>13</b> of the housing, which has a corresponding vent (not shown) formed therein. The power supply fan <b>70</b> is arranged to blow air from the atmosphere outside the housing over the power supply <b>33</b> and from there into the volume within the housing. The power supply <b>33</b> may be surrounded above and to the side opposite the rear face <b>14</b> of the housing by an electrical insulative cover (not shown), to improve the movement of air through the power supply as well as preventing accidental short circuits between the chassis and the power supply components. The power supply fan <b>70</b> preferably is 50 mm in diameter, although it can take any suitable form.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Located along an edge <b>35</b> of the power supply <b>33</b> which is opposite to the second face <b>13</b> of the housing are a number of wires which together form the harness <b>36</b>. In the Figure, the wires of the harness <b>36</b> are illustrated schematically as a single wire for each set of connecting wires. The harness <b>36</b> includes first wires <b>37</b> which extend along the third face <b>22</b> of the motherboard <b>16</b> in the same plane as the motherboard before turning 90° and passing along the side of the fourth face <b>27</b> of the motherboard. At the end of the first wires <b>37</b> are a connector (not shown) which connects with the power in connector <b>30</b> of the motherboard. The first wires <b>37</b> pass along the side of the fourth face <b>27</b> of the motherboard <b>16</b> in substantially the same plane thereas, before rising over the fourth edge to meet the power in connector <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A hard disk drive <b>38</b> is located within the area of the housing adjacent to the second side face <b>13</b> and the front face <b>15</b>. The hard disk drive <b>38</b> has dimensions approximately 145 mm in a direction parallel to the second face <b>13</b> by 102 mm in a direction perpendicular to the second face. The height of the hard disk drive <b>38</b> is approximately 26 mm. The hard disk drive <b>38</b> is secured to the floor pan <b>11</b> of the housing by a metal bracket (not shown). The hard disk drive <b>38</b> can be a standard component, having any suitable amount of storage. The hard disk drive <b>38</b> includes at its face opposite the front face <b>15</b> of the housing a power connector <b>39</b>, which is connected by a wire <b>40</b> to the harness <b>36</b> of the power supply <b>33</b>. The hard disk drive <b>38</b> also includes on the same face a connector <b>41</b> which connects with the first IDE connector <b>28</b> by way of second wires <b>42</b>, to allow the transfer of data between the hard disk drive <b>38</b> and components on the motherboard <b>16</b>. To this end, it is advantageous that the second wires <b>42</b> pass along the third and fourth edges <b>22</b>, <b>27</b> of the motherboard <b>16</b> along with the first wires <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Located on top of the hard disk drive <b>38</b> is a DVD drive <b>45</b>. The DVD drive <b>45</b> includes a first edge <b>46</b> which extends parallel to the second side face <b>13</b> of the housing and is substantially aligned with the corresponding edge of the hard disk drive <b>38</b>. A rear face <b>47</b> of the DVD drive <b>45</b> is separated by a distance of a few millimetres from the power supply <b>33</b>. An edge <b>48</b> of the DVD drive <b>45</b> opposite to the first edge <b>46</b> is separated from the third edge of the motherboard <b>22</b> by a distance of a few millimetres. However, since the DVD drive <b>45</b> is located above the hard disk drive <b>38</b>, the DVD drive is located in a different plane to the motherboard <b>16</b>. This allows wires forming part of the harness <b>36</b> to pass beneath the DVD drive <b>45</b> without interference therebetween. Third wires <b>40</b> connecting the hard disk drive <b>38</b> and the power supply <b>33</b> also run beneath the DVD drive <b>45</b>. The DVD drive <b>45</b> includes on the face <b>47</b> adjacent the power supply <b>33</b> a power connector <b>49</b>. Fourth wires <b>50</b> forming part of the harness <b>36</b> connect the power supply <b>33</b> to the power connector <b>49</b> of the DVD drive <b>45</b>. Depending on the location of the connectors <b>49</b> on the DVD drive <b>45</b>, the fourth wires <b>50</b> may pass alongside the power supply <b>33</b>, or they may pass above the power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The DVD drive <b>45</b> also has a connector <b>51</b>, which is connected by fifth wires <b>52</b> to the second IDE connector <b>29</b> on the motherboard <b>16</b>, so as to allow the transfer of data between components on the motherboard and the DVD drive <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Advantageously, the fifth wires <b>52</b> ran with the first wires <b>37</b> and the second wires <b>37</b> along the third and fourth edges <b>22</b>, <b>27</b> of the motherboard <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The length of the various cables depends on the position on the motherboard <b>16</b> of the connectors to which the cables must extend. Since the positions of these connectors depends on the particular motherboard selected for use, it is advantageous to select for all of the cables lengths which are sufficiently long, but no longer, to allow connection to a connector which is located on the motherboard <b>16</b> as far as is allowable from the device at the other end of the relevant cable.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this embodiment, the DVD drive <b>45</b> is a standard size 5¼″ DVD drive. Such DVD drives are available off-the-shelf for inclusion in desktop and tower PCs. As such, the DVD drive <b>45</b> is mass produced and thus relatively inexpensive. The DVD drive <b>45</b> may be a read-only drive, or alternatively it could be a DVD recorder or a DVD rewriter drive. The combined height of the hard disk drive <b>38</b> and the DVD drive <b>45</b> gives rise to a housing height of 75 mm being particularly appropriate. The 75 mm housing height determines the height of the front panel <b>15</b>, as well as the first and second side panels <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> and the rear panel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The front panel <b>15</b> of the housing is provided with an aperture (not shown), which allows DVDs to be passed into and out of the DVD drive <b>45</b>. The front panel <b>15</b> also is provided with a display (not shown), such as an LCD or matrix display, as well as DVD player (or recorder) control switches (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">First and second fans <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B are located adjacent each other and between the end of the blades B of the heatsink <b>20</b> and a vent (not shown) formed in the first side face <b>12</b> of the housing. The vent coincides with the locations of the fans <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B. The first and second fans <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B are powered by the power supply <b>33</b>, and operate to blow air away from the CPU and heatsink through the first side face <b>12</b> of the housing to atmosphere. The first and second fans <b>58</b>A. <b>58</b>B are secured in place, either to the first side face <b>12</b> or the floor pan <b>11</b> of the housing. The first and second fans <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B preferably are low-noise fans. The inventors consider that 40 mm fans having a flow of 9.7CFM each are suitable in most computing device designs. Fans 40 mm across, such as fans produced by Delta Electronics Inc (www.delta.com.tw), may be suitable. The same fan type may be used for the power supply fan <b>70</b>, although a different fan is preferred to be used instead, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">If a computing device is required to be provided with advanced graphics capability, it can be provided with a graphics card <b>65</b> connected to the AGP connector <b>26</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The graphics card <b>65</b> can be of any suitable type. In this embodiment, the graphics card <b>65</b> provides video out signals at S-video, VGA and DVI connectors, shown at <b>65</b>A. These connectors <b>65</b>A are operable to provide high quality graphics to a suitable television set, analogue or digital, or to a PC monitor. The connectors <b>65</b>A are in register with suitable apertures in the rear panel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The graphics card <b>65</b> can be provided with a television tuner (not shown), which may be of the analogue type but preferably is digital. In this case, it may include an S-video in connector and/or a CATV (cable TV) connector (not shown). Here, the satellite or cable selector discussed above may be omitted, since the tuner in the graphics card <b>65</b> can instead allow the computing device <b>10</b> to be provided with hard-disk or DVD recorder functionality. One form of output connector which the graphics card may include is an 8 pin S-video-like female connector providing both audio and video signals. In this case, an external connector (not shown) can be used to provide, from this connector, S-video, RCA audio and RCA video connectors, for connection to a television set or PC monitor. Such an external connector can be relatively small, for example about 20×60×100 mm, allowing it to be located at the back of the computing device <b>10</b> without impinging on the convenience of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Instead of the graphics card <b>65</b> extending perpendicularly to the plane of the motherboard <b>16</b>, as is conventional with PCs of the desktop and tower types, the graphics card <b>65</b> is connected at one end by a riser <b>66</b>. At one side, the riser <b>66</b> plugs directly into the AGP connector <b>26</b>. At another side, at 90° to the AGP connector side, it includes a female connector into which is plugged the graphics card <b>65</b>. Such risers can be purchased from custom PC suppliers. The inventors have found that using a 1.0U riser can place the graphics card so close to the motherboard that the heat generated by the graphics card can have a negative influence thereon. A 2.0U riser however provides sufficient separation from the motherboard whilst not requiring any increase in housing size. The 2.0U riser <b>66</b> results in the graphics card <b>65</b> being disposed in a plane parallel to the plane of the motherboard <b>16</b> and being separated from the motherboard <b>16</b> by distance of approximately 30 mm. This allows a conventional PC graphics card, many of which are currently available off-the-shelf, to be used without requiring a larger housing to be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An additional consequence of the use of a 2.0U riser is that sufficient volume is provided between the graphics card <b>65</b> and the motherboard <b>16</b> to allow one or more of the PCI connectors <b>23</b>-<b>25</b> to be connected to an ISP server, a network hub, a 5+1 sound card and/or some other device, for expanding the functionality of the computing device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Once all of the components have been arranged in their housing and the appropriate connections have been suitably made, an upper panel (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, described below) is placed on to the computer device <b>10</b> and secured thereto, so as to complete the computing device <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, the housing may have dimensions of 430 mm wide by 268 mm deep by 75 mm high. As such, the computing device <b>10</b> is approximately the same size as standard DVD players available today, although of course smaller forms of DVD players are available.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The upper panel is shown in plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Here, the upper panel <b>200</b> is shown to include a vent <b>201</b>. The vent <b>201</b> is generally rectangular in shape, and comprises a number of parallel apertures formed in the metal of the upper panel <b>200</b>, or alternatively a metal mesh inserted into an aperture in the upper panel. Front and rear limits <b>202</b>, <b>203</b> of the vent <b>201</b> are generally level with, that is they generally coincide with, the edges of the riser <b>66</b>. The vent <b>201</b> thus is as wide as the riser <b>66</b>. A rightmost limit <b>204</b> generally coincides with the position of the riser <b>66</b>. A leftmost limit <b>205</b> extends to a position about 15 mm from the edge of the upper panel <b>200</b>. The riser <b>66</b> is shown in outline, although it is not visible through the vent <b>200</b> when viewed from directly above. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the location of the heatsink <b>20</b> can be seen.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A third fan <b>59</b> is placed in the plane of the Figure on top of the heatsink <b>20</b>. The third fan <b>59</b> also is powered by the power supply <b>33</b>. However, the third fan <b>59</b> is arranged to blow air from atmosphere through the vent <b>201</b> in the upper panel <b>200</b> of the housing onto the heatsink <b>20</b>. Accordingly, air is blown into the volume between the blades B of the heatsink <b>20</b> by the third fan <b>58</b>. This air is channelled by the blades B of the heatsink <b>20</b> in two directions, namely left and right as shown in the Figure. A large proportion of the air channelled to the right is deflected by the riser card <b>66</b> through the vent <b>201</b> to atmosphere. This is due to the relative locations of the heatsink <b>20</b>, the parallel blades B of the heatsink <b>20</b> and their direction of alignment, and the location of the vent <b>201</b>, and is seen to be a significant feature with significant positive consequences. A large proportion of the air channelled to the left is blown to atmosphere by the first and second fans <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B. This results in very little heating by the CPU of the air in the volume of the housing. Of course, this air is heated to some extent by the power supply <b>33</b>, but this generates much less heat than the CPU. The first and second fans <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B also serve to blow air in the general volume of the housing to atmosphere, thereby disallowing heat to build up.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Heatsinks suitable for use as the heatsink <b>20</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an E1U-NPFCS-01 heatsink produced by Cooler Master of Milton Keynes, UK is shown (www.coolermaster.co.uk). As can be seen, this heatsink has parallel blades, which in place on the motherboard extend from left to right, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This heatsink has a copper base and copper stacked fins, and dimensions of 89×60×25 mm. It is designed for Intel (RTM) Xeon (Prestonia) (RTM) CPUs.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a Cooler Master EP3-SLMFC heatsink is shown. This is designed for use with Intel Xeon PIII (RTM) and AMD Athlon MP (RTM) CPUs.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The particular heatsink selected for use will depend on the CPU, on the thickness of the third fan <b>59</b>, and on the space available above the CPU in the housing. 1U heatsink may be particularly suitable because of their dimensions. The inventors consider the Cooler Master EIU-N7BCC-03 heatsink to be particularly suitable. This heatsink includes an integral fan on its uppermost surface, which constitutes the third fan <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Optionally, a satellite or cable television signal decoder (not shown) is included, for example by being connected at any suitable location on the motherboard <b>16</b>. To this end, the connectors <b>17</b> may include an antenna input connection <b>61</b>, by which modulated television signals can be received at the computing device <b>10</b>. The inclusion of the satellite or cable signal decoder and the antenna connector <b>61</b> allows the computing device <b>10</b> to be provided with signals usable to produce television or radio programs from received broadcast signals. This has two significant consequences.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Firstly, connection to a cable television source allows the provision of Internet access, potentially of a significantly higher speed than available with conventional 56 kbps modems, in a convenient manner without necessarily requiring a connection to a telephone line. Thus, a user of the computing device <b>10</b> may be provided with the ability to access the worldwide web and to use other resources associated with the Internet without connection to a telephone line.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Secondly, providing the computing device <b>10</b> with suitable software allows it to serve as a hard disk recorder. Alternatively or in addition, the computing device <b>10</b> can be provided with software to allow it to function as a DVD recorder. DVD and hard disk recorder equipment is already available for consumer purchase. However, because these devices require a significant amount of processing power and relatively expensive components, hard disk recorders and DVD recorders tend to cost significantly more than DVD players. However, the computing device <b>10</b> is provided already with the resources needed to provide hard disk recorder and/or DVD recorder capability, so this functionality can be provided at relatively little additional cost.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The Microsoft (RTM) Media Center software, in its present or any future form, can be used to provide the hard disk recorder and DVD recorder functionality. Instead, this functionality may be provided by any other suitable software</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A wireless keyboard (not shown) and a wireless mouse (not shown) can be connected to the computing device <b>10</b>, so as to enable the computing device to be used in the same way as conventional personal computer. To this end, the front panel <b>15</b> preferably includes a transducer <b>63</b>. In its simplest form, the transducer <b>63</b> is an infrared receiver, allowing input from a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse. However, the transducer <b>63</b> may instead be a Bluetooth (RTM) transceiver, allowing operation with a Bluetooth keyboard and a Bluetooth mouse. Providing a Bluetooth transceiver <b>63</b> also has the advantage of allowing the wireless connection of printers and other peripheral devices. Accordingly, the transducer <b>63</b> may allow the transfer of data from the computing device <b>10</b> to a peripheral device, as well as the provision of control signals from external peripheral devices to the computing device <b>10</b>. Alternatively the infra red transducer is an external device, which is connected by way of one of the USB ports <b>5</b>-<b>8</b> at the front of the housing or by way of a USB port included in the connectors <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">An alternative computing device <b>300</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Here, the first and second fans <b>58</b>A and <b>58</b>B are omitted. Instead, fan ducting <b>301</b> is arranged between the heatsink <b>20</b> and a vent <b>302</b> formed in the side face of the housing. The ducting <b>301</b> constitutes a channel in which air blown into the volume between the blades B of the heatsink can flow in a contained manner directly to atmosphere. The inclusion of a fan in the side face of the housing can be avoided since the third fan <b>59</b> blows air through the heatsink <b>20</b> through the channel provided by the ducting and to atmosphere. The ducting <b>301</b> prevents all except a small proportion of the air forced out to the left of the heatsink <b>20</b> from being retained in the volume of air contained by the housing. This is advantageous since is utilises fewer fans. Air in the volume contained by the housing is expelled by air blown into the housing by the third fan <b>59</b> and by the power supply fan <b>70</b>. The ducting <b>301</b> may take any suitable form, for example a plastic tube, or a rolled plastic sheet. The ducting <b>301</b> need not necessarily form an enclosed channel. For example, a plastic cover could be used, with a channel being formed by this and by the uppermost surface of the motherboard <b>16</b>. The primary requirement of the ducting <b>301</b> is that it channels the majority of the air exiting the left side of the heatsink <b>20</b> directly through the vent <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A further alternative computing device <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Reference numerals are retained from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for like elements. The 5¼″ DVD drive <b>45</b> is omitted, and a DVD drive <b>101</b> from a notebook or laptop computer is included instead. Here, the DVD drive <b>101</b> is approximately 130 mm long by 128 mm wide by 14 mm high. Although the DVD drive <b>101</b> is 128 mm wide at its widest point, the drive tapers to a width of 102 mm for a portion of its length closest to the power supply <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The notebook DVD drive <b>101</b> is connected via a power connector <b>102</b> and sixth wires <b>103</b> forming part of the harness <b>36</b> to the power supply <b>33</b>. The notebook DVD drive <b>101</b> also is connected via a connector <b>104</b> and seventh wires <b>105</b> to the second IDE connector <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The use of the notebook DVD drive <b>101</b> allows the housing of the computing device to have a height of only 53 mm, which is about the same as so-called slimline DVD players currently available. This also allows more space for the graphics card <b>45</b>, which can therefore be longer and/or which can be connected to an AGP connector <b>26</b> located closer to the third edge <b>22</b> of the motherboard <b>16</b> than would otherwise be possible. This allows additional design flexibility, and the potential for a less expensive computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">However, this does not allow a 2.0U riser <b>66</b> to be used with the graphics card <b>65</b>. The inventors have found that using a 1.0U riser <b>66</b> can place the graphics card <b>65</b> so close to the motherboard that the heat generated by the graphics card can have a negative influence thereon. The inventors prefer to use a 1.5U riser, at present available only as a custom made product, in this embodiment. This provides sufficient separation from the motherboard whilst allowing a small housing size. The 1.5U riser <b>66</b> results in the graphics card <b>65</b> being disposed in a plane parallel to the plane of the motherboard <b>16</b> and being separated from the motherboard <b>16</b> by a distance of approximately 20 mm. This allows a conventional PC graphics card <b>65</b>, many of which are currently available off-the-shelf, to be used without requiring a larger housing to be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Also shown in this Figure is a metal support bar <b>110</b>. This is indicated in outline so as not to obscure the other components. The support bar <b>110</b> is rigid, and is secured to the chassis at the front and the back and provides an upper support surface immediately below the upper panel <b>200</b>. This provides mechanical support, and allows equipment to be supported on top of the housing. For example, a television set or a PC monitor could be mounted directly onto the top surface of the upper panel. This further increases the utility of the computing device. Although not shown, this is included in all the embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In a further embodiment of the invention (not shown), the depth of the housing, i.e. the length of the sides <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, is increased by a few centimetres and accommodates a full size ATX motherboard. In this embodiment, the hard disk drive <b>38</b> may be placed with its longitudinal axis running parallel to the front panel <b>15</b>, i.e. perpendicular to the hard disk drives of the above embodiments. Here, the hard disk drive and the removable media drive still are located one above the other. A power supply having different dimensions to those illustrated in the above embodiments may be beneficial to as to minimise the volume of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although the above described computing devices are particularly suitable for use with television sets, it will be understood that any could be used with a PC monitor instead, if required.</p>
