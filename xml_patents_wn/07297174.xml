<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">While the concepts of the present disclosure are susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific exemplary embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the disclosure to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives following within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, there is shown a first particulate filter assembly <b>10</b> for trapping or otherwise filtering particulate matter present in exhaust gas <b>12</b> discharged from an exhaust gas producer such as an internal combustion engine (e.g., diesel engine). The assembly <b>10</b> comprises a housing <b>14</b>, a filter <b>16</b>, and a conductor <b>18</b>. The conductor <b>18</b> mounts the filter <b>16</b> in an inner tube <b>20</b> of the housing <b>14</b> and conducts filtered exhaust gas away from the filter <b>16</b> for discharge from the assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Conductor <b>18</b> is useful with an arrangement in which the inner tube <b>20</b> is configured, for example, as a right circular cylinder and the filter <b>16</b> is configured, for example, as a rectangular parallelepiped made of sintered metal. The conductor <b>18</b> thus provides a mechanism for mounting a “rectangular” filter in a “round” tube.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The assembly <b>10</b> maximizes the flow area of exhaust gas <b>12</b> to minimize back pressure on the engine. In so doing, exhaust gas <b>12</b> is routed axially along an axis <b>64</b> of the assembly, into the filter <b>16</b>, transversely relative to axis <b>64</b> to cause the exhaust gas <b>12</b> to exit the filter <b>16</b> through side faces <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of the filter <b>16</b>, and then axially again through outlet passageways <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> defined by the conductor <b>18</b> to end cap outlets <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> formed in the end cap <b>33</b> to exit the assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, the conductor <b>18</b> is secured to the filter <b>16</b> and the end cap <b>22</b> but not to the inner tube <b>20</b>. Such an arrangement allows thermal expansion and contraction of the filter <b>16</b> relative to the inner tube <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The housing <b>14</b> comprises an outer tube <b>34</b> surrounding the inner tube <b>20</b>. The outer tube <b>34</b> is secured to the end cap <b>33</b> and spaced apart from the inner tube <b>20</b> by use of annular spacers <b>36</b> to define therebetween an annular space <b>38</b> containing insulation <b>40</b>. Similar to the inner tube <b>20</b>, the outer tube <b>34</b> is configured, for example, as a right circular cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The filter <b>16</b> comprises a single substrate <b>44</b>. The substrate is shaped as a rectangular parallelepiped having generally parallel and planar first and second side faces <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, generally parallel and planar third and fourth side faces <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, and generally parallel and planar first and second end faces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>. Side faces <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> connect end faces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>. Each of third and fourth side faces <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and end faces <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> act as a exhaust gas inlet faces to admit unfiltered exhaust gas into the substrate <b>44</b>. First and second side faces <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> act as exhaust gas outlet faces to discharge filtered exhaust gas from substrate <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A number (e.g., two) of internal substrate passageways are <b>54</b> defined in the substrate <b>44</b>. The substrate passageways <b>54</b> connect first and second side faces <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> so as to connect exhaust gas outlet passageways <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to conduct filtered exhaust discharged into substrate passageways <b>54</b> to exhaust gas outlet passageways <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. Substrate passageways <b>54</b> have a diameter which is substantially larger than the pore size of the substrate <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The substrate <b>44</b> is made of sintered metal. In particular, the substrate <b>44</b> comprises a plurality of rectangular sintered metal plates <b>55</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> showing just four of the possibly many plates <b>55</b> of substrate <b>44</b>) stacked one on top of the other between side faces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. The rectangular parallelepiped shape of the substrate <b>44</b> results from stacking the rectangular sintered metal plates <b>55</b> one on top of the other. As such, the rectangular parallelepiped shape of substrate <b>44</b> thus facilitates use of the sintered metal plates <b>55</b> in the production of sintered metal substrate <b>44</b>. A catalyst may be applied to the surfaces and the pores of the plates <b>55</b> to promote filtering of particulate matter.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Adjacent plates <b>55</b> may be secured to one another along the peripheries <b>57</b> of the plates <b>55</b> or around the internal apertures <b>59</b> defined in the plates <b>55</b> to form the substrate passageways <b>54</b>. For example, a first pair of plates <b>55</b> may be secured to one another by a weldment <b>61</b> extending along their peripheries <b>57</b> and a next adjacent pair of plates <b>55</b> may be secured to one another by another weldment <b>63</b> extending along their peripheries <b>57</b>. The two pairs of plates <b>55</b> may then be secured to one another by a weldment <b>65</b> extending along the internal apertures <b>59</b> of adjacent plates <b>55</b> of the two pairs of plates. The substrate <b>44</b> may have about 70 pairs of sintered metal plates <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A corner bracket <b>56</b> is secured to each of the four comers of the substrate <b>44</b>. The four brackets <b>56</b> thus facilitate securement of the plates of the substrate <b>44</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Conductor <b>18</b> comprises a first conduit <b>58</b> and a second conduit <b>60</b>. The first conduit <b>58</b> defines the first exhaust gas outlet passageway <b>22</b> and the second conduit <b>60</b> defines the second exhaust gas outlet passageway <b>24</b>. The first conduit <b>58</b> is secured to the first side face <b>26</b> and extends into the first end cap outlet <b>30</b> (e.g., an aperture) so as to be secured thereto. The second conduit <b>60</b> is secured to the second side face <b>28</b> and extends into the second end cap outlet <b>32</b> (e.g., an aperture) so as to be secured thereto. Conduits <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> are not secured to inner tube <b>20</b> but have rounded plates <b>62</b> that mate against an inner surface of the inner tube <b>20</b> for slidable movement relative thereto to facilitate axial thermal expansion and contraction of the filter <b>16</b> relative to the inner tube <b>20</b> along an axis <b>64</b> of assembly <b>10</b> and tube <b>20</b> while at the same time mounting the filter <b>16</b> in the inner tube <b>20</b>. Each rounded plate <b>62</b> is secured to the respective outlet <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and to a flat plate <b>66</b> of the respective conduit <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>. Each flat plate <b>66</b> is secured to the respective side face <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and respective outlet <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">During manufacture of the assembly <b>10</b>, the conduits <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> are secured to side faces <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and then secured to the end cap <b>33</b> at end cap outlets <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The inner tube is then slid over the conduits <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and secured at one end to the end cap <b>33</b> so that the conduits <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and the filter <b>16</b> are located in the inner tube. The outer tube <b>34</b>, spacers <b>36</b>, and insulation <b>40</b> are then assembled around the inner tube <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In use, exhaust gas <b>12</b> is advanced through the assembly <b>10</b> to be filtered by the filter <b>16</b>. A portion of the exhaust gas <b>12</b> enters first end face <b>50</b> while the rest of the exhaust gas <b>12</b> enters exhaust gas side inlet passageways <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>. First exhaust gas side inlet passageway <b>68</b> is defined between third side face <b>46</b> and inner tube <b>20</b> and second exhaust gas side inlet passageway <b>70</b> is defined between fourth side face <b>48</b> and inner tube <b>20</b>. Side inlet passageways <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> conduct exhaust gas <b>12</b> to third and fourth side faces <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> for entry therethrough into the substrate <b>44</b>. Side inlet passageways <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> conduct the exhaust gas <b>12</b> which does not enter substrate <b>44</b> through side faces <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> to an exhaust gas end inlet passageway <b>72</b> defined between end cap <b>33</b> and second end face <b>52</b>. End inlet passageway <b>72</b> conducts the remaining exhaust gas <b>12</b> to the second end face <b>52</b> for entry therethrough into the substrate <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Particulate matter present in the exhaust gas <b>12</b> is filtered out of the exhaust gas <b>12</b> as the exhaust gas <b>12</b> flows through the substrate <b>44</b>. The thus-filtered exhaust gas <b>12</b> is discharged into the internal substrate passageways <b>54</b> which conduct the filtered exhaust gas <b>12</b> to the exhaust gas outlet passageways <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The outlet passageways <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> then conduct the filtered exhaust gas <b>12</b> to the end cap outlets <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> for discharge from the assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, a second particulate filter assembly <b>110</b> is similar in structure and function to the assembly <b>10</b> except that its filter <b>116</b> has two coaxial rectangular parallelepiped substrates <b>144</b> which are constructed in manner similar to substrate <b>44</b>.
