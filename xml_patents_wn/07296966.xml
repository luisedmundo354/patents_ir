<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to gas turbine engines, and more particularly, to methods and apparatus for assembling gas turbine engines.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Known gas turbine engines include a combustor which ignites a fuel-air mixture that is then channeled through a turbine nozzle assembly to power a turbine. Known turbines include a plurality of turbine rotor blades surrounded by a circumferential turbine shroud assembly. The combustion exit gases are channeled through the turbine nozzle assembly and directed towards the rotor blades to cause rotation of the turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">At least some known turbine nozzle assemblies include a plurality of circumferentially-oriented nozzle segments. Known turbine nozzle segments are fabricated with at least two circumferentially-spaced hollow airfoil vanes coupled together by integrally-formed inner and outer band platforms. The inner band defines a portion of the radially inner flowpath boundary and the outer band defines a portion of the radially outer flowpath boundary.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As relatively high temperature combustion gases are channeled through the turbine nozzle assembly, over time, the high temperatures may cause the turbine nozzle assembly and the turbine shroud to oxidize. Because of their orientation relative to the gas flow, an inner surface and a rear face of the turbine nozzle assembly outer band are generally most susceptible to oxidation. Moreover, in at least some known turbine nozzle assemblies, oxidation may occur in a discrete arc extending along a throat area defined between adjacent airfoil vanes, wherein combustion gases are channeled through the turbine nozzle assemblies. In at least some other known turbine nozzle assemblies, oxidation may occur along the rear face of the outer band as combustion gas are channeled through a gap defined between the nozzle assembly and the turbine shroud, a condition known as gas path ingestion.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In at least some known gas turbine engines, additional cooling air is channeled to each turbine component to facilitate reducing an operating temperature of the component to yield an acceptable rate of oxidation. However, increasing the flow of cooling air increases the overall operating costs of the engine. Specifically, the increased cooling air may increase the specific fuel consumption of the engine, thus increasing the overall operating costs of the engine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, a method of operating a gas turbine engine is provided. The method of assembling a gas turbine engine includes coupling at least one turbine nozzle segment within the gas turbine engine, each turbine nozzle segment includes at least one airfoil vane extending between an inner band and an outer band, wherein the airfoil vane includes a leading edge and a trailing edge, and wherein the outer band includes a front face, a rear face, and an inner surface extending therebetween. The method also includes coupling at least one turbine shroud segment downstream from the at least one turbine nozzle segment, wherein each turbine shroud segment includes a front face, a rear face, and an inner surface extending therebetween, and coupling a cooling fluid source to each turbine nozzle segment such that cooling fluid may be channeled to each turbine nozzle inner surface proximate to one of the leading edge and the trailing edge of each airfoil vane, such that cooling fluid channeled to each turbine nozzle outer band rear face is directed towards the front face of at least one turbine shroud segment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect, a nozzle assembly is provided including an inner band, and an outer band including a front face, a rear face, and an inner surface extending therebetween. The outer band rear face includes a plurality of cooling holes configured to direct cooling fluid onto at least one turbine shroud. The inner surface includes a plurality of cooling holes configured to facilitate cooling the inner surface. The nozzle assembly also includes at least one airfoil vane extending between the inner band and the outer band, wherein each of the at least one airfoil vanes includes a first sidewall and a second sidewall connected at a leading edge and a trailing edge.</p>

Airflow (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) from combustor <b>16</b> drives turbines <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, gas turbine engine <b>10</b> is a CFM engine available from CFM International. In another embodiment, gas turbine engine <b>10</b> is a CF-34 engine available from General Electric Company, Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of a turbine nozzle segment <b>50</b> that may be used with engine <b>10</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of turbine nozzle segment <b>50</b> coupled within engine <b>10</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, a plurality of turbine nozzle segments <b>50</b> are circumferentially coupled together to form turbine nozzle assembly <b>30</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the exemplary embodiment, nozzle segment <b>50</b> includes a plurality of circumferentially-spaced airfoil vanes <b>52</b> coupled together by an arcuate radially outer band or platform <b>54</b>, and an arcuate radially inner band or platform <b>56</b>. More specifically, in the exemplary embodiment, each band <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> is integrally-formed with airfoil vanes <b>52</b>, and each nozzle segment <b>50</b> includes two airfoil vanes <b>52</b>. In such an embodiment, nozzle segment <b>50</b> is generally known as a doublet. In an alternative embodiment, nozzle segment <b>50</b> includes a single vane <b>52</b> and is generally known as a singlet. In yet another alternative embodiment, nozzle segment <b>50</b> includes more than two vanes <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the exemplary embodiment, airfoil vanes <b>52</b> are substantially identical and each nozzle segment <b>50</b> includes a leading airfoil vane <b>76</b> and a trailing airfoil vane <b>78</b>. Each individual vane <b>52</b> includes a first sidewall <b>80</b> and a second sidewall <b>82</b>. First sidewall <b>80</b> is convex and defines a suction side of each airfoil vane <b>52</b>, and second sidewall <b>82</b> is concave and defines a pressure side of each airfoil vane <b>52</b>.

Each airfoil trailing edge <b>86</b> is spaced chordwise and downstream from each respective airfoil leading edge <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">First and second sidewalls <b>80</b> and <b>82</b>, respectively, extend longitudinally, or radially outwardly, in span from radially inner band <b>56</b> to radially outer band <b>54</b>. First and second sidewalls <b>80</b> and <b>82</b>, respectively, define at least one cooling cavity <b>90</b> within each airfoil vane <b>52</b>. More specifically, cavity <b>90</b> is bounded by an inner surface (not shown) of each respective airfoil sidewall <b>80</b> and <b>82</b>. Cooling cavity <b>90</b> channels cooling fluid through airfoil vane <b>52</b> and through airfoil sidewall cooling holes <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the exemplary embodiment, outer band <b>54</b> includes a front or upstream face <b>94</b>, a rear or downstream face <b>96</b>, and a radially inner surface <b>98</b> extending therebetween. Inner surface <b>98</b> defines a flow path for combustion gases to flow through nozzle segment <b>50</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the combustion gases are channeled through nozzle segments <b>50</b> to turbines <b>18</b> or <b>20</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). More specifically, the combustion gases are channeled through turbine nozzle segments <b>50</b> to turbine rotor blades <b>100</b> which drive turbines <b>18</b> or <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A turbine shroud assembly <b>102</b> extends circumferentially around rotor blades <b>100</b> and includes a front or upstream face <b>104</b>, a rear or downstream face <b>106</b>, and a radially inner surface <b>108</b> extending therebetween. In the exemplary embodiment, a plurality of turbine shroud segments are circumferentially coupled together to form turbine shroud assembly <b>102</b>. Inner surface <b>108</b> defines a flow path for combustion gases to flow through turbines <b>18</b> or <b>20</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, a gap <b>110</b> is defined between turbine shroud front face <b>104</b> and turbine nozzle rear face <b>96</b>. Gap <b>110</b> facilitates allowing thermal expansion of turbine shroud assembly <b>102</b> and/or nozzle segment <b>50</b>. Additionally, at least a portion of the combustion gases are circulated in and out of gap <b>110</b>, thus accelerating oxidation of nozzle rear face <b>96</b> and/or shroud front face <b>104</b>, thus reducing an overall performance of engine <b>10</b> due to a reduced durability thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A plurality of cooling holes <b>120</b> extend across nozzle inner surface <b>98</b> to facilitate enhancing film cooling along nozzle inner surface <b>98</b>. In one embodiment, cooling holes <b>120</b> are positioned within a nozzle throat area <b>122</b> defined between adjacent airfoil vanes <b>52</b> to facilitate reducing oxidation of outer band inner surface <b>98</b>. Additionally, cooling fluid channeled through cooling holes <b>120</b> facilitates cooling other engine components, such as, for example, but not limited to, downstream turbine shroud assembly <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the exemplary embodiment, cooling holes <b>120</b> extend arcuately along nozzle inner surface <b>98</b> between adjacent airfoil vanes <b>52</b>. Specifically, cooling holes <b>120</b> extend along nozzle inner surface <b>98</b> between airfoil vane first sidewall <b>80</b>, proximate leading edge <b>84</b>, and an adjacent airfoil vane second sidewall <b>82</b>, proximate trailing edge <b>86</b>. In one embodiment, non-chargeable cooling air is supplied to cooling holes <b>120</b> such that a specific fuel consumption (SFC) of engine <b>10</b> is not increased, thus facilitating reducing operating costs of engine <b>10</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, three cooling holes <b>120</b> are positioned along each nozzle throat area <b>122</b>. In alternative embodiments, more or less than three cooling holes <b>120</b> are positioned along each nozzle throat area <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A plurality of cooling holes <b>130</b> are spaced across outer band rear face <b>96</b> to facilitate providing impingement cooling to turbine shroud front face <b>104</b>, convection cooling to outer band <b>54</b>, and/or purge flow to gap <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, outer band cooling holes <b>130</b> facilitate impingement cooling of turbine shroud front face <b>104</b>, and as such, openings <b>130</b> facilitate reducing the amount of cooling fluid used to cool turbine shroud assembly <b>102</b>. Specifically, in the exemplary embodiment, outer band cooling holes <b>130</b> are substantially aligned with throat area <b>122</b>. In another embodiment, outer band cooling holes <b>130</b> are substantially aligned with alternating throat areas <b>122</b> of turbine nozzle assembly <b>22</b> to facilitate reducing an amount of cooling fluid channeled through cooling holes <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the exemplary embodiment, a plug <b>140</b> of material is added to the downstream face of outer band rear face <b>96</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, plug <b>140</b> has a uniform thickness <b>142</b> and facilitates reducing a width <b>144</b> of gap <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, gap width <b>144</b> is between approximately forty and sixty mils. In another embodiment, gap width <b>144</b> is between approximately twenty and forty mils. Gap width <b>144</b> varies depending on the temperature of engine components. Accordingly, gap <b>110</b> facilitates allowing thermal expansion of the components. In one embodiment, plug thickness <b>142</b> is between approximately ten and twenty mils. As such, in the exemplary embodiment, plug thickness <b>142</b> enables plug <b>140</b> to substantially fill gap <b>110</b> while still allowing thermal expansion of nozzle segment <b>50</b> and/or turbine shroud assembly <b>102</b>. By reducing gap width <b>144</b>, plug <b>140</b> facilitates reducing circulation of combustion gas in and out of gap <b>110</b>. Additionally, by reducing gap width <b>144</b>, plug <b>140</b> facilitates increasing an effective cooling of turbine shroud assembly <b>102</b> through cooling fluid discharged from outer band cooling holes <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">During operation, as combustion gases flow through nozzle segments <b>50</b>, an operating temperature of nozzle segments <b>50</b> is increased. Cooling fluid supplied to cooling holes <b>120</b> and/or <b>130</b> is channeled through outer band <b>54</b> towards inner surface <b>98</b> and rear face <b>96</b>, respectively. Cooling fluid channeled through inner surface holes <b>120</b> facilitates film cooling of inner surface <b>98</b> within throat area <b>122</b>. Cooling fluid is also directed downstream of nozzle segment <b>50</b> towards turbine shroud assembly <b>102</b> to facilitate cooling turbine shroud inner surface <b>108</b>. Cooling fluid channeled through outer band cooling holes <b>130</b> facilitates impingement cooling of turbine shroud front face <b>104</b> and film cooling of turbine shroud inner surface <b>108</b>. Additionally, outer band cooling holes <b>130</b> are oriented along outer band <b>54</b> such that cooling fluid is directed at the areas of increased operating temperature along turbine shroud assembly <b>102</b>. Specifically, the cooling fluid is directed to the portions of turbine shroud assembly <b>102</b> that are adjacent to combustion gases channeled through nozzle segments <b>50</b>. Moreover, plug <b>140</b> extends into gap <b>110</b> to facilitate reducing gap width <b>144</b> and to facilitate reducing an amount of cooling fluid used to cool turbine shroud assembly <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The above-described turbine nozzle segments include a plurality of cooling holes extending along an inner surface and a rear face of the turbine nozzle outer band. More specifically, the cooling holes extend through the inner surface of the outer band within the throat area of the inner surface of the nozzle, and are substantially aligned with the rear surface. As a result, cooling fluid is supplied to the turbine nozzle segment and turbine shroud in a flow distribution pattern that facilitates distributing cooling fluid the areas of the components directly exposed to the hot combustion gases. Accordingly, the turbine nozzle segment and shroud are operable at a reduced operating temperature, thus facilitating extending the durability and useful life of the turbine nozzle segments, and reduces the operating cost of the engine.</p>
