<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A transistor-outline TO-can type optical module includes a stem, a sub-mount arranged in the stem and a laser diode (LD) is mounted in the sub-mount. A photo diode (PD), which has an inclined light incident surface, converts light emitted from the LD to current. A plurality of leads is extended through the stem while electrically being connected to the sub-mount. The inclined light incident surface of the PD permits that sufficient monitoring of photocurrent can be obtained and a p-side up bonding of a p-type electrode is allowed. Thus, the SMSR of the LOB is increased. A bias-tee is built in the TO-can to reduce heat caused by DC current and to increase opto-electric efficiency while suppressing an increase in the temperature of an LD chip.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM FOR PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 to an application entitled “TO-Can Type Optical Module,” filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Nov. 14, 2003 and assigned Serial No. 2003-80505, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to an optical module. More particularly, the present invention relates to a TO-can (Transistor-Outline-can) type optical module.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An optical module is an essential part of any system used for optical transmission. Owing to the recent rapid growth of the information industry, there are increasing proportions of information transmission traveling over an optical communication network, as well as increased demand for fast transmission and transmission of a large volume of information. The optical module must be designed to support fast and large-volumes of information transmission. Optical devices such as a laser diode (LD) or a photodiode (PD) for the optical module are usually available in TO-can packages.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a conventional TO-can optical module package <b>100</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the conventional TO-can optical module package <b>100</b> comprises a stem <b>101</b> provided at a surface thereof, with a protruding heat sink block <b>111</b>, and a plurality of leads <b>102</b>. The four leads <b>102</b> comprise two leads for driving laser diode <b>103</b> and two leads for biasing monitor photodiode <b>104</b>. The laser diode LD <b>103</b> and the monitoring photodiode MPD <b>104</b> are arranged on the surface the stem <b>101</b>. In particular, LD <b>103</b> is normally arranged on the heat sink block <b>111</b>. The LD <b>103</b> and the MPD <b>104</b> are connected to the leads <b>102</b> by, for example, wire bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The leads <b>102</b> are coaxially aligned via through-holes <b>113</b> penetrating both surfaces of the stem <b>101</b>, the through-holes <b>113</b> are filled with a glass sealant <b>105</b>, and the glass sealant <b>105</b> is melted, thereby fixing the leads <b>102</b> to the stem <b>101</b> and sealing the through holes <b>113</b> at the same time. Such a conventional TO-can package is the model C-13-DFB10-TJ-SLC21 manufactured and sold by Luminent Inc.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the conventional optical module package is not practical for high-speed transmissions at 10 Gbps or over because of (1) parasitic inductance which is inherent in the leads, (2) parasitic capacitance between the leads and the stem, and (3) characteristic impedance mismatch for the RF signal passing through the leads.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of another conventional TO-can optical module package <b>200</b> featuring a ceramic feed-through. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the TO-can optical module package <b>200</b> comprises a stem <b>201</b> provided with a protruding heat sink block <b>211</b>, and a ceramic stack feed-through <b>203</b> inserted into the stem <b>201</b>. The feed-through <b>203</b>, disposed on the heat sink block <b>211</b>, has a coplanar waveguide (CPW) <b>202</b> at a surface thereof. The CPW-type package <b>200</b> receives an external RF signal through a plurality of leads <b>204</b>. TO TX PKG A2527 of Kyocera Corp. is one of such CPW-type packages.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The feed-through <b>203</b> is normally fabricated in a ceramic stack structure. Since the feed-through <b>203</b> is formed by LTCC (Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic), its processing temperature is high, for example, between 800 and 1000° C. Thus, the manufacturing costs are higher than those of conventional TO-can optical module package shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, when a waveguide structure is arranged with the optical module to improve the RF characteristics, the size of a sub-mount has to be increased. In this case, light emitted from the back facet of laser diode is reflected from or scattered on the surface of the sub-mount, resulting in a decrease of monitoring photocurrent. To solve this problem, Sumitomo Inc. proposed a TO-can type optical module package in which the sub-mount is shaped like “<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="2.79mm" wi="2.79mm" file="US07298937-20071120-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>”. However, the conventional technology has distinctive shortcomings such as an increase in sub-mount manufacturing costs and a difficult assembly procedure. What makes it worse is that if a matching resistor is mounted on the sub-mount without any consideration of the other components, heat problems can become severe in case of un-cooled operation. When a mixture of a DC bias and an RF signal, produced from an external bias-tee, passes through the matching resistor, the heat dissipation mostly coming from DC current directly increases the operating temperature of the LD, which is located very close to the matching resistor, thereby deteriorates the performance of the TO-can type optical module in a fatal fashion.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention substantially solves many of the above-mentioned problems and/or disadvantages of conventional TO-can optical modules, and provides additional advantages described, infra. The first aspect of present invention provides an optical module that has a high frequency response characteristic while still offering the benefits of a TO-can structure.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a TO-can type optical module that is manufactured easier than previously known structures with lower cost and higher throughput yields than those previously known.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The above aspects can be achieved by providing a TO-can type optical module that includes a stem; a sub-mount arranged in the stem and a laser diode LD is arranged in the sub-mount. A photodiode PD, which has an inclined light incident surface, converts light emitted from the LD to current. A plurality of leads is extended through the stem, and is electrically connected to the sub-mount.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is preferable that a bias-tee is installed in the sub-mount so as to superpose an RF signal on the DC current for LD driving. In addition, a coplanar waveguide and a matching resistor are provided to transmit the RF signal without distortion, and an inductor serves as a choke to block the RF signal from a DC current path.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferred aspects of the present invention will be described herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail when it is believed that they would obscure detailed description of the invention with unnecessary detail that is known by the person of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a TO-can type optical module according to an aspect of the present invention. In particular, attention is directed to the structure of a sub-mount for a DML (Direct Modulated Laser) driver or cathode driven type.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a TO-can type optical module <b>300</b> according to the present invention comprises a stem <b>301</b>, a heat sink <b>302</b>, a sub-mount <b>303</b>, an LD <b>304</b>, a PD <b>305</b>, and a plurality of leads <b>315</b> to <b>319</b>. Further included is CPW composed of <b>306</b>, <b>307</b> and <b>308</b>, an anode line <b>309</b> for the PD <b>305</b>, a DC line <b>310</b>, a matching resistor <b>311</b>, first and second spiral inductors <b>312</b> and <b>313</b>, and a damping resistor <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The sub-mount <b>303</b> comprises a ceramic substrate that is die-bonded onto the heat sink <b>302</b> perpendicular to the upper surface of the stem <b>301</b>. The ceramic substrate electrically isolates the conductive stem <b>301</b> so that a variety of electrical patterns can be formed on the sub-mount <b>303</b>. Ceramic materials can include AlN, SiC, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, etc. In comparison to other ceramic materials, AlN exhibits excellent thermal conductivity and is therefore a favored material used as a sub-mount of a heat generator, such as an LD, a matching resistor and etc. The thermal conductivity of AlN is 2.1 W/cm° C., which is about twice as high as that of silicon, 0.84 W/cm° C. Also, an AlN sub-mount can be made thinner than a silicon sub-mount. Therefore, AlN is favorable in terms of thermal conductivity to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The LD <b>304</b> emits a laser beam depending on a DC bias or an RF signal. The CPW composed of <b>306</b>, <b>307</b> and <b>308</b> together with the matching resistor, the PD line <b>309</b> and the DC line <b>310</b> are formed on the sub-mount <b>303</b> by thin-film processing. The matching resistor <b>311</b> is electrically connected to a signal line of the CPW <b>307</b>. The CPW (composed of <b>306</b>, <b>307</b> and <b>308</b>) and the matching resistor <b>311</b> transfer an external 10-Gbps RF signal without distortions. 50 Ω is preferred to 25 Ω as the input impedance of the sub-mount <b>303</b> in terms of power consumption. The input impedance of the sub-mount <b>303</b> is the sum of the impedance of the matching resistor <b>311</b> and the dynamic resistance of the LD <b>304</b>. The characteristic impedance of the CPW composed of <b>306</b>, <b>307</b> and <b>308</b> is also matched to 25 Ω.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first inductor <b>312</b> is a spiral type. It is connected to the DC line <b>310</b>, functioning as a choke for blocking an RF signal from a DC path.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The second inductor <b>313</b> is positioned between the LD <b>304</b> and the PD <b>305</b>. It isolates the LD <b>304</b> from the PD <b>305</b>, thereby preventing unexpected RF signal leakage. The second inductor <b>313</b> is also spiral type like the first inductor <b>312</b>. The matching resistor <b>311</b> and the first and second inductors <b>312</b> and <b>313</b> can be formed on the sub-mount <b>303</b> by thin-film processing. Therefore, a laser module package can be made compact.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The damping resistor <b>314</b> is connected in parallel to the first inductor <b>312</b> and prevents LC resonance caused by parasitic capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The leads <b>315</b> to <b>319</b> are inserted through the stem <b>301</b> such that one end of each of the leads <b>315</b> to <b>319</b> protrudes from one surface of the stem <b>301</b>, while the other end thereof is extended through the other surface of the stem <b>301</b>. The first lead <b>315</b> is connected to an anode of the LD <b>304</b>, the second lead <b>316</b> to an cathode RF terminal of the LD <b>304</b>, the third lead <b>317</b> to a cathode of the PD <b>305</b>, the fourth lead to an anode of the PD <b>305</b>, and the fifth lead <b>319</b> to a cathode DC terminal of the LD <b>304</b>. The first and third leads <b>315</b> and <b>317</b> are commonly connected. The leads <b>315</b> to <b>319</b> are fixed to the stem <b>301</b> by a glass sealant filled in through holes. The glass sealant is filled in the state of glass seal powder into the through holes into which the leads <b>315</b> to <b>319</b> are aligned and melted at about 500° C., thereby sealing the through holes. Alternatively, a pre-shaped glass sealant can be prepared such a way that it can hold the leads <b>315</b> to <b>319</b> and can plugged into TO-stem <b>301</b>. Then melting at about 500° C. completes the hermetic sealing of the through-hole.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A solder pattern (e.g., AuSn) is formed on the sub-mount <b>303</b>, for die-bonding of the LD <b>304</b> and the PD <b>305</b>. The structure of the sub-mount <b>303</b> may vary with the type of LD driver.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The PD <b>305</b> detects light emitted from the back face of the LD <b>304</b>, determines whether the LD <b>304</b> is operating normally, and correspondingly performs an automatic power control (APC) operation. The PD <b>305</b> is an RMF (Reflection Mirror Facet) type MPD having the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> schematically illustrates the structure of the RMF MPD <b>305</b>. The light emitted from the LD <b>304</b> is incident on the RMP MPD <b>305</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, because the RMF MPD <b>305</b> has an inclined light incident surface <b>402</b>, the reception efficiency of light reaching a light absorption layer <b>403</b> can be increased and so a sufficient monitoring photocurrent can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Also, the light incident surface <b>402</b> allows p-side up bonding of a p-type electrode <b>404</b> of the LD <b>304</b>, thereby increasing the SMSR (Side Mode Suppression Ratio) of the LOB (LD on Block). The SMSR of a DFB (Distributed Feed Back) laser varies with its bonding configuration. In general, it has higher SMSR in the case of p-side up bonding than p-side down bonding of a p-type electrode, showing a low bonding stress level.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">This PD configuration suppresses a roll-off in electro-optic response, caused by the parasitic capacitance of a pad and thus improves RF characteristics. It further allows bonding of an LD and an MPD on a plane without V grooves as in SiOB process, simplifying sub-mount fabrication and assembly and eliminating the need for flip-chip bonding during die bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of the TO-can type optical module illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Here, the first lead <b>315</b> is shown being electrically connected to an anode of the LD <b>304</b>, the second lead <b>316</b> to an anode RF terminal of the LD <b>304</b>, the third lead <b>317</b> to a cathode of the PD <b>305</b>, the fourth lead <b>318</b> to an anode of the PD <b>305</b>, and the fifth lead <b>319</b> to a cathode DC terminal of the LD <b>304</b>. The first and third leads <b>315</b> and <b>317</b> are commonly connected.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a TO-can type optical module according to yet another aspect of the present invention. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of a sub-mount for an EML (Electro-absorptive Modulated Laser) driver or anode driven type.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a TO-can type optical module according to still another aspect of the present invention. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of a sub-mount for a differential type laser driver.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As described above, the present invention has the following advantages:</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The use of a PD having an inclined light incident surface increases light reception efficiency and thus leads to a sufficient monitoring photocurrent. It also allows for the p-side up bonding of a p-type electrode in an LD, thereby increasing an SMSR. This PD structure suppresses a roll-off in electro-optic response caused by the parasitic capacitance of a pad, and so improves RF characteristics. Because an LD and a PD can be bonded on one plane without V grooves, assembly is simplified. Also, there is no need for flip-chip bonding for die bonding. Thus, process complexity is decreased and cost is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The reduction of heat generation by incorporating a bias-tee into a TO can increases opto-electric efficiency and suppresses a temperature increase of an LD chip. Integration of an inductor and a matching resistor formed by thin-film processing on a sub-mount renders an optical module compact.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
