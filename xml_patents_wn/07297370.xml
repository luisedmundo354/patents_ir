<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention may include embodiments that relate to an encapsulant for encapsulating electronic components. The invention may include embodiments that relate to a method of making and/or using the encapsulant. The invention may include embodiments that relate to an electronic device that includes the encapsulant.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electronic components, such as integrated circuits, may be encapsulated by transfer molding for environmental protection and to maintain structural and functional integrity. The encapsulating material may be a polymeric composition. Such encapsulating materials may be useful for encapsulation of semiconductors, semiconductor integrated circuits, passives, passive networks, multichip modules, opto-electronic devices and numerous other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">During molding, currently available encapsulating materials may stick to process equipment, or may be otherwise problematic. At room temperature, the encapsulating materials may be liquid or semi-solid putties.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,632,798; 4,632,798; 5,355,016; 5,998,876; and 5,272,377 address one or more encapsulant issues and disclose materials related thereto. International Publication No. WO 03/072628 A1 discloses a novolac type phenolic epoxy resin composition for encapsulating electronic parts.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It may be desirable to have an encapsulating material with different properties than encapsulants that are currently available. It may be desirable to have a cured encapsulant produced with materials and/or methods different from those materials and/or methods currently available. It may be desirable to have an electronic device that includes an encapsulant produced with materials and/or methods different from those materials and/or methods currently available.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, a curable encapsulant composition may be provided. The composition may include a mixture of a functionalized polymer and at least one reactive monomer composition. At least one reactive monomer or reactive monomer component of the reactive monomer composition may be a room temperature solid and may be present in the reactive monomer composition an amount in a range of greater than about 20 weight percent based on the total weight of the reactive monomer composition. The encapsulant, at low temperature, may be solid or tack-free, or both solid and tack-free.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, an electronic device may be provided. The electronic device may include an encapsulated circuit or die. The encapsulating composition may include a mixture of a functionalized polymer and a reactive monomer composition. At least one reactive monomer in the reactive monomer composition may be a room temperature solid and may be present in an amount in a range of greater than about 20 weight percent based on the total weight of reactive monomer composition. The mixture may be solid and/or tack-free at low temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, a method of making an encapsulant may be provided. The method may include mixing a functionalized polymer with a reactive monomer composition. The reactive monomer composition may include a reactive monomer that is a low temperature solid and that is present in the reactive monomer composition an amount in a range of greater than about 20 weight percent based on the total weight of reactive monomer composition. The functionalized polymer and the reactive monomer composition may be heated to a temperature sufficient to soften or liquefy, and the functionalized polymer and the reactive monomer composition may be mixed with each other. The softened or liquid mixture may be cooled to form an encapsulant composition that is solid and/or tack-free at low temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, a method of encapsulating at least a portion of the electronic or optical device may be provided. The method may include melting at least a portion of pellets or powder, in which the portion may include a mixture of a functionalized polymer and the reactive monomer composition. The reactive monomer composition may include a reactive monomer that may be a low temperature solid, and which is present in the reactive monomer composition in an amount in a range of greater than about 20 weight percent based on the total weight of reactive monomer composition. The pellets or powder, at room temperature, may be solid and/or tack-free. The molten portion may be flowed into contact with the portion of the electronic or optical device.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Approximating language, as used herein throughout the specification and claims, may be applied to modify any quantitative representation that could permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related. Accordingly, a value modified by a term or terms, such as “about”, is not to be limited to the precise value specified, and may include values that differ insubstantially from the specified value. In at least some instances, the approximating language may correspond to the precision of an instrument for measuring the value. Tack free may refer to a surface that does not possess pressure sensitive adhesive properties at about room temperature. By one measure, a tack free surface will not adhere or stick to a finger placed lightly in contact therewith at about 25 degrees Celsius, the temperature may be different using other specified measures.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The compositions may be employed in a transfer molding process. In one embodiment, the composition may be formed into a pellet. Pellets may be used in a transfer molding process, for example, as the encapsulant of an electronic device such as a circuit. Pellets may be readily formed by conventional techniques such as compression of the composition in a mold at ambient temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The transfer molding apparatus may include a pot, which may be a cylindrical cavity fitted with a retractable plunger. The composition of the invention in pellet form and the pot may have approximately the same diameter. The pot may be kept hot, at the same temperature as the molding tool. After the pellet has been inserted into the pot, the plunger presses the pellet through an opening at the bottom of the pot into the hot runner system of the molding tool. Cycle time may be in a range of from about 1 minute to about 4 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The pot and the molding tool may be independently held at temperatures that are greater than about 50 degrees Celsius, in a range of from about 50 degrees Celsius to about 100 degrees Celsius, from about 100 degrees Celsius to about 130 degrees Celsius, from about 130 degrees Celsius to about 140 degrees Celsius, or from about 140 degrees Celsius to about 175 degrees Celsius, or greater than about 175 degrees Celsius. Temperatures higher than about 150 degrees Celsius may be useful with, for example, lead-free solder applications.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Pellets under about 7 grams may be softened within a few seconds by inserting the pellet into the transfer pot. Large pellets (over about 7 grams) may be pre-heated, for example, using a radio frequency pre-heater with an infrared pyrometer, and then inserted into the transfer pot.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A low softening temperature for the pellet may inhibit the composition from flowing out of the pot before the pellet has softened. For example, the pellet may deform or sinter to other pellets. The softened pellets may glom to each other, and/or the sides of the container, and may not pour as free-flowing pellets. A softening temperature too high may undesirably cure the pellets prior to use.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Transfer-molding suitability may correlate to a spiral flow length. Spiral flow length may be measured by SEMI G11-88 recommended practice for ram follower gel time, and for spiral flow of thermal setting molding compounds, or by EMMI 1-66. Spiral flow length may be measured at about 1 MPa and about 150 degrees Celsius. In various embodiments, the spiral flow length of the compositions may be greater than about 11 inches, in a range of from about 11 inches to about 30 inches, from about 30 inches to about 50 inches, from about 50 inches to about 61 inches, or from about 61 inches to about 100 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The spiral flow length may be controlled by selection of, for example, reactive diluent type and amount. Alternatively or additionally, the spiral flow length may be increased by the presence of the polymerization inhibitor, and may be decreased by the presence of filler, colorant, and/or flame retardant. The spiral flow length may be decreased by using more of the CPAE, particularly MACPDMPE. Also, when using a mixture of 0.12 intrinsic viscosity MACPDMPE and 0.30 intrinsic viscosity MACPDMPE, increasing the relative amount of 0.12 intrinsic viscosity MACPDMPE in the mix may increase the spiral flow length. In one embodiment, an encapsulant may exhibit a high flow rate (measured as a relatively long spiral flow length) and low viscosity in a temperature range of from about 125 degrees Celsius to about 175 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">A cured encapsulant may exhibit a hardness in a range of from about 20 Shore D to about 30 Shore D, from about 30 Shore D to about 50 Shore D, from about 50 Shore D to about 60 Shore D, or greater than about 60 Shore D. A suitable molding compositions may exhibit, after curing, a flex strength in a range of from about 65 MPa to about 70 MPa, from about 70 MPa to about 150 MPa, from about 150 MPa to about 160 MPa, or from about 160 MPa to about 200 MPa.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">With reference to the Shore D hardness values, a durometer (e.g., a Zwick Durometer Hardness Tester) may be used to determine the relative hardness of soft materials, usually plastic or rubber in accordance with ASTM D2240. The durometer measures the penetration of a specified indentor into material under specified conditions of force and time. The testing procedure may include the following steps. The specimen may be first placed on a hard flat surface. The indentor for the instrument may be pressed into the specimen making sure that it is parallel to the surface.

<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Examples 1-10 include a functionalized polymer (such as a capped polyarylene ether (CPAE)), a room temperature solid reactive monomer composition (that is, having a melting or softening point above room temperature), an initiator, and reinforcing filler. Examples 1-10 are prepared and evaluated as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The capped polyarylene ether (CPAE) is a methacrylate-capped poly(2,6-dimethyl phenylene ether) (MACPDMPE) having an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.12 or about 0.30 depending on the example. A50/50 mixture of 0.12 intrinsic viscosity MACPDMPE and 0.30 intrinsic viscosity MACPDMPE is used in Examples 1 and 2.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In Examples 1-10, cyclohexane dimethanol diacrylate (sold by Sartomer under the trademark SARTOMER® CD 406) is employed, optionally together with one or more other reactive monomer compositions. For example, mixtures of cyclohexane dimethanol diacrylate (CDD) and ethoxylated (2) bisphenol A dimethacrylate (sold by EBAM under the trade name SR-348, abbreviated herein as E2BPA) or 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate (sold by EBAM under the trade name SR-248, abbreviated here as 1,6-HDD) are employed.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">A polymerization inhibitor, t-butyl catechol (abbreviated herein as TBC), is included in the composition at a concentration of approximately 1000 ppm to reduce a risk of premature polymerization of the composition.</p>

<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Compositions are prepared by blending the components under vigorous stirring in a container for about 15 minutes at about 170 degrees Celsius on a hot plate until a clear liquid formed. The hot liquid is quenched by pouring the contents of the container into a shallow aluminum pan at room temperature. Within minutes, crystalline spherulites form and grow in the quenched composition.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The quenched composition in each of Examples 1-10 is a tack-free, friable hard solid. Tack is determined by the finger touch test at room temperature, and at 35 degrees Celsius. To be considered tack-free for this instance, the Examples 1-10 need only be tack-free at room temperature. Each of the Examples 1-10 was tack-free at both room temperature and at about 35 degrees Celsius. Friability is determined by striking a portion of the solid composition with a hammer and observing the formation of a powder having discrete particles. Pellets formed from the material of each of Examples 1-10 were relatively free flowing at least up to a temperature of about 5 degrees Celsius. Further, the pellets each had a softening point or melt point that is in a temperature range of from about 50 degrees Celsius to about 150 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The compositions of Comparative Examples 1-4 and Examples 12-24 are prepared as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Comparative Examples 1 and 2 do not have a room temperature solid reactive monomer composition content. The reactive monomer composition used in Comparative Examples 1 and 2 (E2BPA) is a liquid at about room temperature; has a relatively high degree of tack, or tackiness, prior to cure; contributes to a relatively low spiral flow length; and, when cured, contributes to a relatively low hardness (Shore D). Comparative Examples 3 and 4 are filled systems that do not include functionalized polymer content. The reactive monomer composition used in Comparative Examples 3 and 4 is a monomeric biphenol epoxy resin, and the filler loading is greater than 75 percent by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Examples 12-24 include both a functionalized polymer and a reactive monomer composition. The functionalized polymer includes methacrylate-capped poly(2,6-dimethyl phenylene) ether (MACPDMPE). The reactive monomer composition includes at least one reactive monomer composition that is a room temperature solid.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Comparative Examples 1-4 and Examples 12-14 and 17-24 include an adhesion promoter (SMA) and a flame retardant. All the Comparative examples and Examples 12-24 include a mold release agent (stearic acid), a polymerization inhibitor (t-butyl catechol), colorant, and a curing agent (t-butyl peroxy benzoate). The functionalized polymer (MACPDMPE) has an intrinsic viscosity of 0.30 or 0.12, as indicated in Table 4.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The reactive monomer composition includes reactive monomers selected from among ethoxylated (2) bisphenol A dimethacrylate (E2BPA); bisphenol A dimethacrylate (BPA); 1,5-dimethacryloyl naphthalene (1,5-NP); bis[[4-[(vinyloxy)methyl]cyclohexyl]methyl]terephthalate (BVM); tetramethyl bisphenol A dimethacrylate (TMBPA); tetramethyl biphenol dimethacrylate (TMBiPh); and 4-biphenyl methacrylate (4-BiPh) and mixtures thereof. Each of the compositions of Comparative Examples 1-2 and Examples 12-24 comprise t-butyl catechol as a polymerization inhibitor. With the exception of the compositions of Examples 15 and 16, an adhesion promoter that includes styrene maleic anhydride (SMA) is employed. The SMA enhances adhesion of the final composition to a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The functionalized polymer and reactive monomer composition are mixed in a 200-milliliter beaker that is immersed in a stirred, 4-liter oil bath at about 170 degrees Celsius. An overhead stirrer is used to agitate the contents of the beaker for about 15 minutes. Subsequently, the contents of the beaker are a transparent liquid. The beaker is removed from the oil bath, and allowed to cool on the bench, while being monitored with a glass thermometer until the temperature of the contents is about 100 degrees Celsius. After 100 degrees Celsius is achieved, the colorant and mold release agent are added with manual stirring, as well as any optional ingredients such as adhesion promoter. When the temperature had cooled to about 80 degrees Celsius, the curing agent is added with manual stirring.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The hot liquid is quenched by pouring the contents from the beaker into a shallow aluminum pan at room temperature. Within minutes, crystalline spherulites form and grow in the quenched composition. Approximately 80 grams of each composition are produced for each of Comparative Examples 1-2 and Examples 12-24. Approximately 71.2 grams of each composition is crushed into small pieces and compounded with a filler and a flame retardant as follows. Examples 15 and 16 receive no flame retardant.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The filler is a fused silica (a mixture of FB 570 and SFP 30M treated with gamma-methacryloxy propyl trimethoxy silane, as described above). The filler is mixed with the flame retardant OP 1311 (a mixture of melamine polyphosphate and aluminum diethylphosphinate, CLARIANT) in a Henschel mixer at room temperature. Next, the filler mixture is split into two approximately equal portions.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The first potion of the filler mixture is poured into a Brabender mixing bowl fitted with roller mixing blades operated at 80 rpm. The bowl temperature is about 80 degrees Celsius. Next, approximately 71.2 grams of the crushed mixture of the methacrylate-capped poly (2,6-dimethyl phenylene ether, reactive monomer composition, optional adhesion promoter (SMA), and t-butyl catechol ingredients is charged into the Brabender mixer, followed immediately by the second portion of the filler mixture. The total mixing time is about 5 minutes. The resulting filled composition has a mass of about 540 grams.</p>

Table 6. Properties of Comparative Examples and Examples.
</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In comparing the results shown in Table 6, a pellet at room temperature with a Shore D hardness of greater than about 20 Shore D is considered solid. As shown, Examples 13-14, 18, and 24 all have Shore D hardness values greater than 30. Accordingly, Examples 13-14, 18, and 24 are considered to be solid at about room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Thus, even though all of the samples have at least some material that is a room temperature liquid, at least some of the samples may be room temperature solids. Further, at least some of the Examples may be tack-free at room temperature.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Examples 25-30</heading>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Room Temperature Solid Reactive Monomer Compositions</heading>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Examples 25-30 demonstrate compositions in which all of the reactive monomer compositions used are room temperature solid materials. The compositions are prepared in the same manner as that described for Examples 12-24. The ingredients and amounts are listed in corresponding tables, below.</p>

<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The foregoing examples are merely illustrative, serving to illustrate only some of the features of the invention. The appended claims are intended to claim the invention as broadly as it has been conceived and the examples herein presented are illustrative of selected embodiments from a manifold of all possible embodiments. Accordingly it is Applicants' intention that the appended claims are not to be limited by the choice of examples utilized to illustrate features of the present invention. As used in the claims, the word “comprises” and its grammatical variants logically also subtend and include phrases of varying and differing extent such as for example, but not limited thereto, “consisting essentially of” and “consisting of.” Where necessary, ranges have been supplied, those ranges are inclusive of all sub-ranges there between. It is to be expected that variations in these ranges will suggest themselves to a practitioner having ordinary skill in the art and where not already dedicated to the public, those variations should where possible be construed to be covered by the appended claims. It is also anticipated that advances in science and technology will make equivalents and substitutions possible that are not now contemplated by reason of the imprecision of language and these variations should also be construed where possible to be covered by the appended claims.</p>
