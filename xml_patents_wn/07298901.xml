<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to machine scannable forms and systems for scanning such forms. Automatic scanning machines for scanning preprinted forms save time for an operator compared to manually grading student or survey response forms. Automatic scanning machines and preprinted forms enable rapid monitoring of items and personnel, and permits more frequent record keeping or testing than might otherwise be achieved if an operator had to check the forms manually. For example, such machines are frequently used to score scholastic test results, tally attendance data, and tally inventory.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Presently, machine scannable forms are sold in packs by retailers, such as school book stores. It may be difficult to put a mark on each individual form to indicate a sales price because such mark may interfere with scanning response marks entered by a student.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A scannable form is disclosed with a numeric value block, a plurality of response control marks, response receiving rows, and a zone for a bar code, optical character recognition (OCR) spaces and/or intelligence character recognition (ICR) spaces. The response control marks indicate positions of the response receiving rows, which can include numeric values or multiple choice letters. A scanner detects and interprets entries in the response receiving rows. The scanner can combine one or more numeric values with a tally derived from multiple choice response inputs on the scannable form. The scannable form allows a mathematical operation to be performed by a scanner between the numeric value and the correct question response. The numeric value may represent the result of a related test, which is then mathematically combined with the tallied result of a set of multiple response inputs to obtain a total. The numeric value can also be used to assign weights to different responses.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The scannable form may use either a horizontal format, in which a fixed number of response receiving spaces are row aligned with each response control mark, or a vertical format, in which a single response receiving space is aligned with each response control mark. In the vertical format, the number of response choices per question is not fixed. A format mode selection mark (or the absence of such a mark) automatically conditions the scanner for vertical or horizontal operation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The form may provide a number of advantages. For example, the bar code allows retailers, such as school book stores, to assign a price to each form and track product inventory without interfering with scanning operations of completed forms.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One general aspect relates to a scannable form comprising (a) an elongate rectangular shape with first and second substantially straight longitudinal edges; (b) at least two response columns parallel to the first longitudinal edge; and (c) a control mark column, parallel to the first longitudinal edge and parallel to the response column but spaced therefrom. The control mark column contains, in a direction parallel to the first longitudinal edge: (1) a first set of response control marks having a first length; (2) a second set of response control marks having the first length; (3) a start-of-form mark having a second length different from the first length; and (4) an end-of-form mark having a third length different from the first length and the second length. The first set of response control marks is column aligned with the start-of-form mark and before the second set of response control marks. The start-of-form mark is column aligned before the second set of response control marks, and the second set of response control marks is column aligned before the end-of-form mark. The scannable form further comprises (d) a response row corresponding to each response control mark. Each response row is row aligned with the corresponding response control mark perpendicular to the first longitudinal edge. Each response row contains at least two response receiving spaces, and each response receiving space is aligned in one of said response columns. The first set of response control marks is associated with response rows that have numeric value response receiving spaces. The scannable form further comprises (e) a bar code in at least one of a first location and a second location. The first location is a first pre-determined distance below the end-of-form mark and a second pre-determined distance above a bottom edge of the form. The second location is a third pre-determined distance from at least one response row and a fourth pre-determined distance from one of the first and second longitudinal edges. The bar code is sufficiently spaced away from the response rows to avoid false detection of marks in the response rows.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another general aspect relates to a method of making a scannable form. The method comprises: printing on a form having an elongate rectangular shape with first and second substantially straight longitudinal edges. The form has (a) at least two response columns parallel to the first longitudinal edge; and (b) a control mark column, parallel to the first longitudinal edge and parallel to the response column but spaced therefrom. The control mark column contains, in a direction parallel to the first longitudinal edge: (1) a first set of response control marks having a first length; (2) a second set of response control marks having the first length; (3) a start-of-form mark having a second length different from the first length; and (4) an end-of-form mark having a third length different from the first length and the second length. The first set of response control marks is column aligned with the start-of-form mark and before the second set of response control marks. The start-of-form mark is column aligned before the second set of response control marks, and the second set of response control marks is column aligned before the end-of-form mark. The form also has (c) a response row corresponding to each response control mark. Each response row is row aligned with the corresponding response control mark perpendicular to the first longitudinal edge. Each response row contains at least two response receiving spaces. Each response receiving space is aligned in one of said response columns. The first set of response control marks is associated with response rows that have numeric value response receiving spaces. The form also has (d) a bar code in at least one of a first location and a second location. The first location is a first pre-determined distance below the end-of-form mark and a second pre-determined distance above a bottom edge of the form. The second location is a third pre-determined distance from at least one response row and a fourth pre-determined distance from one of the first and second longitudinal edges. The bar code is sufficiently spaced away from the response rows to avoid false detection of marks in the response rows.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The following description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating one or more uses of a scannable form and scanner, such as to aid in test scoring, recording of school attendance, inventory, or any other type of record keeping.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a conventional scannable form <b>13</b>′ having a horizontal format marketed by Scantron Corporation of Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> designed to scan a scannable form <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) having a horizontal format or a scannable form <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) having a vertical format. The scannable form <b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref> is best understood with reference to the conventional Scantron-type scannable form <b>13</b>′ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> having a horizontal format.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the conventional form <b>13</b>′ is placed face-up on a vertically inclined platen <b>32</b> provided on the apparatus housing <b>33</b>. A longitudinal edge <b>34</b>′ of the form <b>13</b>′ rests on a ledge <b>35</b> at the bottom of the platen <b>32</b>. The form leading edge <b>36</b>′ is inserted behind a reader housing <b>37</b> containing a pair of drive wheels <b>38</b>, rotated by motor <b>39</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), which transports the form <b>13</b>′ at a predetermined rate in the direction of the arrow <b>40</b>. As the form <b>13</b>′ is driven beneath the housing <b>37</b>, each response is detected and marked. The total number of responses may appear on a display <b>41</b> and optionally may be printed on the form <b>13</b>′. When the form <b>13</b> is used to score tests, the number of correct responses may be displayed and printed. Alternatively, the tallied responses may be recorded in electronic form for further processing by another machine, or transmitted (e.g., by modem) to a central computer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the Scantron-type scannable form of the prior art has a start-of-form mark <b>12</b>′, multiple response control marks <b>14</b>′, and an end-of-form mark <b>16</b>′. These marks <b>12</b>′, <b>14</b>′ and <b>16</b>′ are aligned in a control mark column <b>44</b>′ which is parallel to the longitudinal form edge <b>34</b>′ of the form <b>13</b>′. Detection of the start-of-form mark <b>12</b>′ by the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> automatically initiates scanning of the form <b>13</b>′. Each of the response control marks <b>14</b>′ is row aligned with one or more response spaces <b>15</b>′. Responses are indicated by marking an opaque mark within a response space <b>15</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">If a test is being scored, detection of a response control mark <b>14</b>′ enables appropriate circuitry to compare a response entered in a response receiving space <b>15</b>′ aligned with that response control mark <b>14</b>′ with corresponding correct answer data stored in a memory. In other applications, responses entered in response spaces <b>15</b>′ are tallied. The end-of-form mark <b>16</b>′, the last mark in the control mark column <b>44</b>′, enables score or tally printout, or triggers data storage or transmission. Both the start-of-form mark <b>12</b>′ and the end-to-form mark <b>16</b>′ can act as response control marks. The present disclosure is not limited to use with forms having a start-of-form mark <b>12</b>′ and/or an end-of-form mark <b>16</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a diagrammatic view of the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> as seen along the line <b>2</b>—<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. To tally data, the form <b>13</b>′ is transported past a read station <b>42</b> containing a light source <b>43</b>, which illuminates both the control mark column <b>44</b>′ and the response receiving spaces <b>15</b>′ of the form <b>13</b>′. This may be referred to as optical mark recognition (OMR). The read station <b>42</b> also includes a control channel sensor <b>46</b> which detects control marks in the control mark column <b>44</b>′, and a plurality of data channel sensors <b>47</b><i>a </i>through <b>47</b><i>e </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) which detect responses in the spaces <b>15</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The control channel sensor <b>46</b> may comprise a light guide <b>46</b><i>a</i>, a photosensor <b>46</b><i>b</i>, and an associated amplifier (not shown) which provides an output signal when a control mark is sensed by a reduction in the light level reflected from the form <b>13</b>′. Similarly, the data channel sensors <b>47</b><i>a</i>-<b>47</b><i>e </i>each may comprise a light guide, a photosensor, and an associated amplifier providing respective, parallel outputs. The data channel sensors <b>47</b><i>a</i>-<b>47</b><i>e </i>are row aligned with the control channel sensor <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The scanning apparatus may also include an error marking device <b>50</b> for marking erroneous responses, and a score printer <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the scannable form <b>13</b> of the present disclosure having a horizontal format. If used with a Scantron-type scanner, the form <b>13</b> has a start-of-form mark <b>12</b> and an end-of-form mark <b>16</b> in a control mark column <b>44</b>. However, the form <b>13</b> has response control marks <b>14</b> both above and below the start-of-form mark <b>12</b>. Shown above the start-of-form mark <b>12</b> are multiple numeric value blocks <b>17</b> which each contain a number of response control marks <b>14</b> and associated row aligned response receiving spaces <b>15</b>. In a preferred configuration, the numeric value blocks <b>17</b> are located above the start-of-form mark <b>12</b>. However, the numeric value blocks <b>17</b> can be located below the start-of-form mark <b>12</b> or in any location within the bounds of the form <b>13</b>. As explained below, numeric values can be entered in each of the numeric value blocks <b>17</b>. Below the start-of-form mark <b>12</b> are multiple rows of response control marks <b>14</b> with their associated row aligned response receiving spaces <b>15</b>. These response control marks <b>14</b> allow a user to enter answers to test questions in scholastic tests, tally information in inventory control, or the input of other types of data.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In each numeric value block <b>17</b>, each response receiving space <b>15</b> is marked with a number which determines the weighting for that response receiving space <b>15</b>. The response receiving spaces <b>15</b> in each numeric value block <b>17</b> are added according to the weighting factors in order to obtain a sum representing an associated numeric value for the numeric value block <b>17</b>. For example, if the response receiving spaces <b>15</b> of the numeric value block <b>17</b> are marked in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>with weights of “100”, “20”, and “5”. Thus, the numeric value associated with the block <b>17</b> is “125”.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> is programmed to interpret the opaque marks in a numeric value block <b>17</b> of the form <b>13</b> as a numeric value by marking the corresponding numeric value block <b>17</b> on a “key” sheet. The “key” sheet allows entry of this numeric value block <b>17</b> information and other information including the appropriate responses for other response receiving spaces <b>15</b> and the type of result reporting that is desired. In addition to marking the “key” sheet, a program switch <b>54</b> on the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> should be momentarily closed before feeding the “key” sheet into the apparatus <b>30</b>. If the program switch <b>54</b> is not closed, data entry is inhibited even though a “key” sheet is present. In a preferred configuration, the “key” sheet is identified by marking the key space <b>37</b>, which is the response receiving space <b>15</b> that is farthest from the start-of-form mark <b>12</b> in the row containing the start-of-form mark <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The numeric value marked by the operator on the “key” sheet both allows a numeric value to be entered in the associated numeric value block <b>17</b> on a form <b>13</b> and assigns a maximum value to this numeric value. Each numeric value maximum from the “key” sheet is stored in an addressable memory. If the numeric value maximum for any numeric value block <b>17</b> is present on the “key” sheet, the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> is conditioned to read the associated response receiving spaces <b>15</b> for that numeric value block <b>17</b> on the form <b>13</b> being scanned in order to obtain the numeric value input. If no numeric value maximum is marked on the “key” sheet for a numeric value block <b>17</b>, the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> is conditioned not to read the response receiving spaces <b>15</b> for the associated numeric value block <b>17</b> on the form <b>13</b> being scanned.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, where an educator is administering both a multiple choice test and a related test, such as an essay, the educator would mark the numeric value block <b>17</b> on the “key” sheet with the numeric value maximum, which is the total possible points for the related test. Thus, the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> would be conditioned to read the response receiving spaces <b>15</b> for the associated numeric value block <b>17</b> on the form <b>13</b> being scanned to obtain the numeric value input for that form <b>13</b>. If the educator is not administering a related test, the numeric value block <b>17</b> on the “key” sheet would not be marked, and the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> would not read response receiving spaces <b>15</b> for the associated numeric value block <b>17</b> on the form <b>13</b> being scanned. If a numeric value input from the form <b>13</b> being scanned is more than the associated numeric value maximum, an error condition exists. The form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> can be programmed to handle error conditions in different ways.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The remaining response receiving spaces <b>15</b> allows entry of question or tally responses. On a form <b>13</b> with a horizontal format, each response is marked in a response receiving space <b>15</b> aligned with a response control mark <b>14</b>. When the form <b>13</b> is used for testing purposes, correct responses are received from the “key” sheet and are stored in the addressable memory along with any maximum numeric values. When such a form <b>13</b> is read by the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b>, the absence of a “key” mark automatically conditions the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> not to store new correct responses.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a testing mode, the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> compares each entered response to the response read-in from the “key” sheet and obtains a correct response sum. If the form <b>13</b> that is scanned has response receiving spaces <b>15</b> on both sides of the sheet, the apparatus <b>30</b> will add to correct responses on both sides of the sheet to obtain the correct response sum. In a preferred configuration, each numeric value input for a numeric value block <b>17</b> that has an associated maximum value on the “key” sheet is added to this response sum to obtain a total. For example, where an educator has administered both a multiple choice and a related test, the correct response sum, corresponding to the total correct answers for the multiple choice test, is added to the numeric value input, corresponding to the score from the related test, to obtain a total overall score for the two tests.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Alternatively, the scannable form <b>13</b> or the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> can include one or more function inputs for indicating the appropriate mathematical function to be performed using the correct response sum and the numeric value input. For example, the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> could include one or more input switches to allow the operator of the apparatus <b>30</b> to indicate the appropriate mathematic function to be performed or the form <b>30</b> could include one or more response receiving spaces <b>15</b> for the “key” sheet to indicate the mathematic function. The mathematical function to be performed can include, but is not limited to, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or a combustion thereof. For example, a numeric value input entered into a numeric value block <b>17</b> can be used as a multiplication weighting factor, so that each student taking a test can be individually considered to take into account skill or age level, previous times tested, etc. A weighting factor can also be used to weight wrong answers differently from right answers, to penalize guessing. Further, different numeric value blocks <b>17</b> can be used on one form to indicate that associated questions are to be weighted differently from other questions.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a non-testing or tallying mode, a “key” sheet need not define correct responses, but would instead define categories and multiple response values. For example, if a form <b>13</b> is used for inventory control, each response control mark <b>14</b> can be defined to represent a particular inventory item, and the response spaces <b>15</b> can be defined as inventory counts or ranges. When the form <b>13</b> is scanned, marks in the response spaces <b>15</b> are tallied for each inventory item.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Considerable flexibility is permitted with respect to how many of the response controls marks <b>14</b> and associated response spaces <b>15</b> on a form <b>13</b> are actually used. That is, fewer question or tally response or numeric value inputs may be needed than are available on a pre-printed form. If no response or numeric value is stored in the memory location associated with a particular response control mark <b>14</b> when the “key” sheet is read-in, that response or numeric value is ignored when the form <b>13</b> is scanned. Furthermore, the present disclosure permits multiple sheet forms <b>13</b> to be used. Page marks or other means may be used to indicate which page of the form <b>13</b> is currently being scanned.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The numeric value blocks <b>17</b> operate identically with either form <b>13</b> having a horizontal format, or form <b>70</b> having a vertical format. However, the scanning of the tally or question responses is different with each format. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> as viewed along the line <b>3</b>—<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, with a scannable form <b>13</b>, having a horizontal data format. With a horizontal format, a single response control mark <b>14</b> is associated with each tally item or question. The tally items or questions themselves may be identified by numbers printed in a column <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For each tally item or question on the form <b>13</b>, one or more (here, five) response receiving spaces <b>15</b> are row aligned with the corresponding response control mark <b>14</b>. Thus, for item <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the response receiving spaces <b>52</b><i>a</i>-<b>52</b><i>e </i>are aligned with the response control mark <b>49</b><i>a</i>. To respond to item <b>1</b>, an opaque mark is entered in one of the response spaces <b>52</b><i>a</i>-<b>52</b><i>e </i>corresponding to the selected response. Such response marks are detected by the control channel sensors <b>47</b><i>a</i>-<b>47</b><i>e </i>which are positioned over the respective response columns <b>45</b><i>a</i>-<b>45</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the vertical format of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the scannable form <b>70</b> has a control mark column <b>44</b>″ like that of the form <b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. However, several response control marks <b>14</b>″ are associated with each item or question. The response receiving spaces <b>15</b>″ all are situated in a single column <b>45</b><i>b</i>″ detected by the data channel sensor <b>47</b><i>b</i>. End-of-item marks <b>73</b> may be provided in a column <b>45</b><i>a</i>″ aligned with the sensor <b>47</b><i>a </i>to indicate the end of each item or question. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, question #<b>1</b> includes two response receiving spaces <b>72</b><i>a </i>and <b>72</b><i>b </i>row aligned with the respective answer control marks <b>49</b><i>a</i>″ and <b>49</b><i>b</i>″. An end-of-item mark <b>71</b><i>a </i>aligned with the response control mark <b>49</b><i>b</i>″ indicates that the response space <b>72</b><i>b </i>is the last response space associated with question #<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The scanning apparatus <b>30</b> scans the form <b>70</b> having a vertical format in a manner similar to that for the form <b>13</b> having a horizontal format. In the preferred configuration, the circuitry of the apparatus <b>30</b> is enabled to scan the vertical format by detecting a vertical space <b>75</b> that has been marked with an opaque mark. The vertical space <b>75</b> is row aligned with the start-of-form mark <b>12</b>″ and column aligned for detection by the data channel sensor <b>47</b><i>d</i>. Absence of a marked vertical space <b>75</b>, as on the form <b>13</b>, causes the apparatus <b>30</b> to score or tally in the horizontal mode. Of course, other means, such as a manual switch, may be used to enable the scanning apparatus <b>30</b> to score or tally in one or the other of these modes.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Provisions are made for the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> to mark on the form <b>13</b> or the form <b>70</b> each incorrect response, the correct response next to the incorrect response, the total number of correct responses, the percentage of correct responses, the total number of incorrect responses, the result obtained from the operation of the numeric value input on the total of the correct responses, and the average of this result. Other types of responses may be provided as necessary for particular applications. For example, the form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> may provide for printing a roster of scores on a sheet used to post such scores.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The form scanning apparatus <b>30</b> can print the marks on the bottom of the first side of the form <b>13</b> or the form <b>70</b>, or on the second side of a two-sided form <b>13</b> or form <b>70</b>. The apparatus <b>30</b> may also operate in a “re-scan” mode where the marks to be printed on the form <b>13</b> or the form <b>70</b> are offset. In this mode, a form <b>13</b> or a form <b>70</b> can be scanned a second time, such as after a confusing question has been eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Bar Codes, OCR and ICR</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows a front side of a scannable form <b>700</b> with a numeric value block <b>704</b>, a plurality of response control marks <b>706</b>, response receiving rows <b>708</b>, and zones <b>702</b>A, <b>702</b>B for printing a bar code (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8B</figref>), optical character recognition (OCR) spaces (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) and/or intelligence character recognition (ICR) spaces. The zones <b>702</b>A, <b>702</b>B have been selectively positioned to avoid interfering with handwritten marks in the rows of response receiving spaces <b>708</b> and provide a sufficient margin of error for printing, paper placement, etc. For example, if a bar code is placed too close to one or more response receiving rows <b>708</b> and/or the form <b>700</b> is not properly aligned with a scanner, the scanner may detect a false mark or a scanning error. The zones <b>702</b>A, <b>702</b>B may also be spaced from the edges of the form <b>700</b> to ensure that the bar code, OCR spaces and/or ICR spaces are properly printed on the form <b>700</b> with a margin for error.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A bar code (e.g., element <b>802</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) may be assigned to a scannable form with a particular arrangement of control marks, response receiving spaces and other items. The bar code may have a number of uses, such as allowing retailers (e.g., school book stores) at a point-of-sale to assign their own price for each scannable form and track the number of scannable forms sold or remaining in the store as inventory. A bar code scanner may scan the bar code and output price and product information for display. The bar code scanner may be separate and located at different locations from the scanner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>. The bar code may be limited in size and cannot be enlarged or reduced in size on the form <b>700</b>. Thus, a position of the bar code on the scannable form <b>700</b> may be important.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A user can write alphanumeric characters in OCR spaces (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), which can be read by a scanner and recognized by a software application. A machine can digitally print or type (machine written) alphanumeric characters in ICR spaces, which can be read by a scanner. OCR and ICR marks do not have to be in boxes as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The area for OCR and ICR marks may be defined by the form definition, which may be stored in the scanner memory. However, the accuracy of OCR and ICR recognition is greatly increased when using the designated boxes (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) because the boxes identify the exact point to write (for OCR) or print (for ICR), which the scanner has been defined to read.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows a back side of a scannable form <b>712</b> with a plurality of response control marks <b>720</b>, response receiving rows <b>722</b>, and zones <b>724</b>A, <b>724</b>B for a bar code, optical character recognition (OCR) spaces and/or intelligence character recognition (ICR) spaces.
