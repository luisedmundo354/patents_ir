<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A schematic of the structure of an interpolator is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For more details of the operation and function of such a circuit the reader is referred to the applicant's co-pending application filed on even date under the designation TI-38552, U.S. application Ser. No. 11/150,902, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It will be observed that the interpolator has a four stage structure and that each stage is biased by a current mirror, such as current mirror <b>11</b>. The presence of the current mirror enables the stage to be controlled by a steering currents I<sub>0</sub>, I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>3 </sub>and the generation of such a steering current will now be considered in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A steering current generator <b>20</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The required resultant current is generated by summing a number of currents generated and controlled within the circuit. Sub-circuit <b>21</b> may for example be controlled by differential inputs PS and PSZ to sum current into the summing node of switching circuit stages B<b>0</b> and B<b>1</b> respectively (i.e. stages <b>23</b> and <b>26</b>). In an exemplary embodiment of the current steering control arrangement, there are <b>31</b> instances of circuit block <b>21</b>, receiving <b>31</b> separate single bit inputs such that each of the transistors within the instances of the circuit maybe individually controlled to supply current to either stage B<b>0</b>, B<b>1</b> in accordance with the single bit inputs. Note that since the PS&lt;i&gt; is the inverse of PSZ&lt;i&gt; the total current provided to the stages B<b>0</b> and B<b>1</b> is a constant, namely 31 times lb.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, assume that the interpolator is operating at operating point <b>31</b>, equivalent to a PS input of 0; i.e. 31 bits each with a value of 0. The operating point may be stepped by gradually increasing the number of bits set and eventually the operating point reaches <b>32</b>, where all 31 bits have the logic value of 1.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus far, the operating point of the interpolator has been restricted to a first quadrant of operation <b>30</b>. The operating quadrant is defined by a two bit code (QS), which in the first quadrant <b>30</b> has the value 00. In that quadrant the control signals QS cause the current summed from the circuit blocks <b>21</b> to form currents I<sub>B0 </sub>and I<sub>B1</sub>. Those currents also comprise an additional unit of lb. provided by a current source <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> respective to each of the stages <b>23</b> and <b>26</b>. These currents I<sub>B0 </sub>and I<sub>B1 </sub>are mirrored into the interpolator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the circuit implementation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) the QS inputs, also control further the stages of the circuit, such as stages <b>22</b> and <b>27</b> (stages B<b>2</b> and B<b>3</b>) and are input to one of two coupled transistors in each stage, such as input <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In quadrant 00 stages B<b>2</b> and B<b>3</b> do not receive any current from the circuit blocks <b>21</b> but only units of ½ lb. from respective current sources, which currents respectively form currents I<sub>B2 </sub>and I<sub>B3</sub>, which are mirrored into other stages of the interpolator.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Stages B<b>2</b> and B<b>0</b> are cross coupled together, and stages B<b>1</b> and B<b>3</b> likewise. Each of the stages are fed from a different leg of the single bit driven circuits, <b>21</b>. (B<b>2</b> and B<b>0</b> from one leg and B<b>1</b> and B<b>3</b> from the other.) Moving the operating point to the first point of the second quadrant <b>35</b> is achieved by altering the QS Code from the value 00 to the value 01. This switches the current from circuit blocks <b>21</b> from contributing to I<sub>B0 </sub>to contributing to I<sub>B2</sub>, and I<sub>B0 </sub>becomes ½ lb. It is not necessary to alter the individual bit codes applied to the circuit blocks <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The operating point may then be stepped through the second quadrant, <b>35</b> by stepwise reduction of the number of set bits applied to the circuits <b>21</b>, eventually reaching operating point <b>34</b>, which corresponds to the all zeros input condition.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the operating point of the current generator is illustrated by the current summation of (I<sub>B0</sub>-I<sub>B2</sub>) as the x-axis and (I<sub>B1</sub>-I<sub>B3</sub>) as the y-axis. In the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, however, of course, I<sub>B0 </sub>I<sub>B1</sub>, I<sub>B2</sub>, I<sub>B3 </sub>control the four stages individually and respectively, but the angular position of the spots in the diagram about the origin nonetheless also represent the phase of the signal output by the interpolator.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A number of advantages of the circuit has thus far described will be apparent.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Firstly, the circuit is fully differential.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The quadrant selection code is intrinsically, Gray-coded, it and since the single bit values for operating points, which our neighbours across the reference phase boundaries such as points <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> are the same, by virtue of the Gray-code only a single bit change in the entire circuit is required to cross the reference phase boundary, for example from the first sector quadrant <b>30</b> the second quadrant <b>35</b>. It will be appreciated that the entire phase wheel, may be transitioned by changing a single bit at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It will be noted that the bleed current applied to stage <b>22</b> is in magnitude of one half different to that applied to circuit portion <b>23</b>. In this way, when the circuit switches quadrants, a full step value is achieved by switching from for example −½ lb. to +½ lb. By virtue of this arrangement the output of the interpolator is never derived from a single reference phase. This has the important consequence that the current in any of the stages is never reduced to zero.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In particular embodiments, it may be found that other bleed current combinations are advantageous for example, 7½ for circuit <b>22</b> and <b>8</b> for circuit <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Note also that the architecture of the interpolator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> allows other numbers of reference phases and respective circuit stages therefor, from a minimum of three. Versions of the steering current generator comprise two summing nodes and sector switches that direct the currents from the circuit blocks <b>21</b> to the two active circuit stages of the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. (“Sector” has been used since there may be a number of “quadrants” unequal to four.) Bleed currents (e.g. ½ lb.) are switched to the remaining circuit stages.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">While the invention has been shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it is well understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made in the invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
