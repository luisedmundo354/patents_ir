<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A fluid separation system includes a tank with a storage chamber for retaining floating and non-floating particulates. The tank includes a baffle for retaining floating particulates within the storage chamber and for directing flow out of the storage chamber. The tank also includes a bypass with an inlet flow control zone and an outlet flow control zone. The flow control zones are separated by a weir sized and positioned to regulate the fluid flow through a baffle port into the storage chamber. The weir also provides control of the flow rate at which incoming fluid is diverted directly through the bypass to the tank outlet rather than into the storage chamber. The baffle and/or the weir may be curved, and the baffle may include a complex curve, to aid in the smoothing of the fluid flow within the storage chamber to improve particulate separation.</p>

No. 6,991,114 of the same title, by the same inventors, and assigned to a common assignee. The content of that application is incorporated by reference and priority is claimed therein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to systems for separating floating and non-floating particulate from fluids such as drain water and stormwater. More particularly, the present invention relates to a separation system that may be independent, or form part, of a larger fluid transfer system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fluid transfer systems have been and will remain an important aspect of municipal services and commercial facilities management. The protection of ground water and natural bodies of water requires systems for diverting and/or treating water that contacts roadways, parking lots, and other man made structures. If such diversion or treatment systems are not provided, particulate and contaminants located on or forming part of such structures may be carried by drain water or stormwater to the natural water bodies and contaminate them. Local, state and federal laws and rules require municipalities, businesses and, in some instances, private entities, to establish means to reduce particulate and contaminant levels permissibly transferred to natural bodies of water from property under their control. Particular requirements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but all are likely to become more, rather than less, stringent.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Previously, municipal water transfer and treatment facilities provided the only mechanism for diverting contaminated water away from natural bodies of water, either for holding or treatment for subsequent transfer to natural settings. In general, that process involved, and continues to involve, the establishment of a system of drains, such as in a parking lot or at a street curb, by which water enters a system of pipe conduits. Eventually, the water received from the drains reaches either a final outlet destination or is directed to a treatment system for contaminant removal. For purposes of the description of the present invention, “contaminated water” is to be understood to mean any water including floating particulate, such as Styrofoam™ containers and oil, for example; non-floating particulate, such as sand and silt, for example; and entrained contaminants, such as dissolved nutrients or metals, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Land development produces increased levels of drain water and stormwater runoff, resulting in increased strain on existing water transfer and treatment infrastructure and an increased likelihood of natural water contamination. In an effort to reduce the impact of development on natural resources and municipal services, initial upstream fluid treatment has become a requirement in many land development, restoration and repair projects. That is, requirements in various forms have been established to ensure that before contaminated water enters the municipal water transfer and/or treatment system, it must be treated in a manner that reduces the level of contaminants entering the municipal system. Therefore, most new land development plans and upgrades to existing paved surfaces involve the insertion of a preliminary separation system, generally for connection to the municipal water-handling infrastructure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Any preliminary separation system must be designed with the capability to receive fluid flowing in at a wide range of rates. For example, a mild rainfall resulting in rain accumulation of less than 0.25 inches over a span of 24 hours produces a relatively low flow rate through the system. On the other hand, for example, a torrential rainfall resulting in rain accumulation of more than two inches over a span of three hours produces relatively high flow rates through the system. It is desirable, then, to have a separation system capable of handling variable fluid flow rates with reduced likelihood of backup and flooding of the surface above. It is also desirable to control the flow through the system such that trapped particulates are not scoured or washed out of the device and re-entrained during high flows for passage downstream.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition to having a reasonable fluid flow throughput capacity, the separation system must be capable of performing the separation function for which it is intended. Specifically, it may be required to remove from the fluid flow path a certain number, type, or size of floating particulate. It may also be required to remove from that fluid flow path a certain number, type or size of non-floating particulate. It would be preferable to have such a separation system that can remove from the fluid flow path the particulates for which it is designed at the widest range of flow rates but without causing backup or scouring/washout. For that reason, some such systems are designed with a bypass mechanism to permit direct flow through of fluid without preliminary treatment when relatively high flow rates are reached. Unfortunately, ineffectively designed separation systems fail to provide the best particulate removal and further fail to do so under flow rates that may not be particularly high.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is an increasing need and requirement for separation systems associated with drain water and stormwater introduction to municipal water handling systems. However, it is important that they not be prohibitively expensive in order to ensure that meeting those needs and requirements is feasible. It is also of importance that such separation systems are relatively easy to access for maintenance. It is also preferable that separation systems provide a reasonable arrangement for storing accumulated floating and non-floating particulates to minimize the possibility of clogged inlets and outlets and to extend the required maintenance cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, what is needed is a separation system that may or may not be part of a larger fluid handling system that effectively accommodates varied fluid flow rates. What is also needed is such a separation system that conforms or substantially conforms with established floating and non-floating particulate removal requirements. Further, what is needed is such a separation system that is configured to minimize clogging possibilities and to maximize particulate removal capability in a cost effective arrangement. Yet further, what is needed is such a separation system that is configured for ease of maintenance and to maximize the ability to accumulate particulates.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an object of the present invention to provide a separation system that is effective in accommodating varied fluid flow rates. It is also an object of the present invention to provide such a separation system that conforms or substantially conforms with established floating and non-floating particulate removal requirements. Further, it is an object of the invention to provide such a separation system that is configured to minimize clogging possibilities and to maximize particulate removal capability in a cost effective arrangement. Yet further, it is an object of the present invention to provide such a separation system that is configured for ease of maintenance and to maximize the ability to accumulate particulates.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other objectives are achieved with the present invention. The invention is a fluid separation system having an inlet and an outlet. The inlet may be in direct contact with a fluid or it may be connectable to an upstream fluid transfer conduit. The outlet may be in direct contact with a surface water location or it may be connectable to a downstream fluid transfer conduit. If applicable, the upstream fluid transfer conduit and the downstream fluid transfer conduit may be part of a common municipal water handling system. For example, the upstream conduit may be associated with a drain arranged for water on a surface, such as a parking lot surface, to be removed from the surface, and the downstream conduit may form part of the water transfer mechanism designed to divert that water from the drain to a municipal treatment plant or natural surface waters. The intake system of the present invention is designed to remove floating and non-floating particulates from the drain water before it reaches the final outlet destination.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one aspect of the invention, a system is provided for separating floating and non-floating particulate from fluids. The system includes a tank having a bottom and interior sidewalls to define a storage chamber, an inlet at a first location on the interior sidewalls for receiving the drain water or stormwater from an upstream conduit, and an outlet at a second location on the interior sidewalls for transferring the drain water or stormwater to a downstream conduit; a baffle having a bottom, a first side baffle wall, a second side baffle wall and a port through from the first side baffle wall to the second side baffle wall, the baffle connected to the interior sidewalls of the tank, the bottom of the baffle spaced above the bottom of the tank to establish a storage chamber outlet for fluid within the storage chamber to pass along the second side baffle wall to the outlet; a bypass including an inlet flow control zone on the second side baffle wall between the inlet and the port of the baffle and an outlet flow control zone on the second side baffle wall between the storage chamber outlet and the outlet; and a weir positioned between the inlet flow control zone and the outlet flow control zone, the weir configured to divert fluid from the inlet to the baffle port under relatively low fluid flows and to divert one portion of the fluid from the inlet to the baffle port and to allow the remaining portion of the fluid from the inlet to the outlet under relatively high fluid flows. In one embodiment, the bypass includes a flow control plate attached between the second side baffle wall and the interior sidewalls of the tank. The inlet flow control zone is the space defined by the region between the inlet, the second side baffle wall, the interior sidewalls of the tank, the flow control plate and the weir. The outlet flow control zone is the space defined by the region between the outlet, the second side baffle wall, the interior walls of the tank, the flow control plate and the weir. In one arrangement, the flow control plate in the outlet flow control zone space includes one or more ports. In an arrangement of the system, the flow control plate is in a declined orientation from the inlet of the tank to the outlet of the tank. In arrangement of the system, the weir is a curved plate. In another arrangement, the weir is a flat plate angled from the inlet of the tank toward the baffle port. Optionally, the interior sidewalls of the tank are corrugated to aid in control of fluid movement in the storage chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect of the invention, a system is provided for separating floating and non-floating particulate from a fluid and includes a tank having a tank bottom and a storage chamber bottom spaced above the tank bottom, and interior sidewalls, the interior sidewalls, a lid, and the storage chamber bottom establishing a storage chamber, an inlet at a first location on the interior sidewalls for receiving the fluid from an upstream conduit, and an outlet at a second location that may be separate from or substantially near or at the first location associated with the inlet on the interior sidewalls for transferring the fluid to a downstream conduit; a baffle having a bottom attached to the storage chamber bottom, a first side baffle wall, a second side baffle wall and a port through from the first side baffle wall to the second side baffle wall, the baffle connected to the interior sidewalls of the tank; a standpipe substantially centered within the storage chamber and establishing a passageway between the storage chamber and the outlet chamber, the outlet chamber for receiving water from the storage chamber and in communication with a region between the second side baffle wall and a portion of the interior sidewalls of the tank; a bypass including an inlet flow control zone on the second side baffle wall between the inlet and the port of the baffle and an outlet flow control zone on the second side baffle wall between the outlet chamber and the outlet; and a weir positioned between the inlet flow control zone and the outlet flow control zone, the weir configured to divert fluid from the inlet to the baffle port under relatively low fluid flows and to divert one portion of the fluid from the inlet to the baffle port and to allow the remaining portion of the fluid from the inlet to the outlet under relatively high fluid flows.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A separation system <b>10</b> of the present invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the system <b>10</b> includes a tank <b>11</b> having an inlet pipe stub <b>50</b> and an outlet pipe stub <b>60</b>. The tank <b>11</b> is preferably made of concrete but may alternatively be fabricated in whole or in parts of metal, plastic, such as fiberglass, or other suitable materials. It may be fabricated of an existing manhole or manhole design and modified in the manner to be described herein. The inlet pipe stub <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is represented as a short pipe terminating in a flange that may be used to connect the tank <b>11</b> to an upstream fluid transfer system. Similarly, the outlet pipe stub <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is represented as a short pipe terminating in a flange that may be used to connect the tank to a downstream fluid transfer system. For example, the upstream fluid transfer system may include a drainage system from a roadway or a parking lot and the downstream fluid transfer system may include a municipal water treatment plant or natural or artificial surface waters.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an embodiment of the tank <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the inlet pipe stub <b>50</b> and the outlet pipe stub <b>60</b> may be fabricated as an integral part of the body of the tank <b>11</b> rather than being attached to the tank. In the configuration of the pipe stubs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the pipe stubs <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> are configured to receive in sockets thereof conduits from upstream and downstream fluid transfer systems, respectively. In either arrangement of the pipe stubs <b>50</b> and <b>60</b>, it is of interest to configure them to receive upstream and downstream conduits positionable by their connections to the pipe stubs <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> to ensure the fluid enters the tank <b>11</b> tangentially.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The tank <b>11</b> includes an inlet <b>12</b> associated with the inlet pipe stub <b>50</b>, an outlet <b>13</b> associated with the outlet pipe stub <b>60</b>, a baffle <b>14</b>, and a bypass <b>15</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and <b>4</b>). The tank <b>11</b> establishes a storage chamber <b>16</b> defined by a tank bottom <b>17</b> and sidewalls <b>18</b> in a cylindrical form but may alternatively be in a polygonal form. The shape and dimensions of the storage chamber <b>16</b> are further defined by a lid <b>19</b> removably attachable to the sidewalls <b>18</b> at a top thereof, and to the baffle <b>14</b>, also at a top thereof. The lid <b>19</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> substantially completely covers the tank <b>11</b> and may include an access port with access port cover <b>72</b> for accessing the interior of the storage chamber <b>16</b> for maintenance purposes without removing the entire lid <b>19</b>. The tank top of the sidewalls may include a flange for removable attachment of the lid <b>19</b> to the tank <b>11</b>. It is also possible that the height of the sidewalls <b>18</b> and the baffle <b>14</b> may be set to ensure that they are above the highest possible water surface, thereby eliminating the need for a lid while allowing the interior of the tank <b>11</b> to be open for inspection.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The baffle <b>14</b> is located within the tank <b>11</b> as a sectional wall removably attachable to an interior side <b>20</b> of the sidewalls <b>18</b>. The baffle <b>14</b> extends downward from a top area <b>21</b> of the tank <b>11</b> to a point above the tank bottom <b>17</b>. An inner sidewall <b>22</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> is configured to prevent floating particulate from exiting the storage chamber <b>16</b> of the tank <b>11</b>. If a lid such as lid <b>19</b> is employed, positioning the baffle <b>14</b> to be in sealing contact with the lid <b>19</b> ensures that non-floating particulate entering the storage chamber <b>16</b> cannot move over the top of the baffle <b>14</b> and into the bypass <b>15</b>. Alternatively, a tank <b>11</b> with sidewalls <b>18</b> and baffle <b>14</b> above the highest possible water surface ensures that floating particulates cannot exceed the height of the baffle <b>14</b>. An outer sidewall <b>23</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> is spaced from the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank <b>11</b> by the bypass <b>15</b>. It is contemplated that the baffle <b>14</b> may extend down to the tank bottom <b>17</b>, provided a baffle outlet port is established therein to allow fluid to flow up behind the baffle <b>14</b> to the tank outlet <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an alternative design of the tank <b>11</b> of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a partial lid <b>73</b> detachably connectable to the baffle <b>14</b> and a portion of the sidewalls <b>18</b> covers only the area between the outer sidewall <b>23</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> and the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank sidewalls <b>18</b> to ensure that floating particulates do not enter the bypass <b>15</b> from the storage chamber <b>16</b>. The remainder of the inside of the tank <b>11</b> that forms the storage chamber <b>16</b> remains open to a conventional neck-down riser <b>74</b> terminating in a conventional manhole cover <b>75</b> at or near the surface. The manhole cover <b>75</b> and the riser <b>74</b> provide an alternative means for accessing the storage chamber <b>16</b>. In addition, a net or screen may be deployed within the storage chamber <b>16</b> to aid in the separation of neutrally buoyant particulates from the fluid in the storage chamber <b>16</b>. That is, particulates that neither float and are blocked by the baffle <b>14</b>, nor non-floating particulates that fall to the bottom <b>17</b> and are retained in the storage chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an alternative design of the tank <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the height dimension of the storage chamber <b>16</b> is substantially reduced and the diameter thereof is larger with respect to the diameter of the tank in the area of the baffle <b>14</b>. However, the baffle and bypass configurations remain substantially as indicated with respect to the tank <b>11</b> design of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2B</figref>. In the tank <b>11</b> design of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the substantially reconfigured design of the storage chamber <b>16</b> portion enables introduction of the system <b>10</b> into locations having smaller height tolerances. The larger diameter of the tank <b>11</b> at the storage chamber <b>16</b> area ensures adequate dwell time of the fluid in the storage chamber <b>16</b> for the purpose of non-floating particulate settling and for floating particulates to come to the surface of the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The bypass <b>15</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and <b>4</b> regulates the flow of fluid into and out of the storage chamber <b>16</b>. The bypass includes a bypass plate <b>77</b>. The bypass plate <b>77</b> may be substantially horizontally oriented with respect to the centerline of the tank <b>11</b>, it may be sloped or curved, or it may be stepped in an alternative embodiment to be described herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9C</figref>. A weir <b>24</b> is disposed on the bypass <b>15</b>, dividing the bypass passageway into an inlet flow control zone <b>25</b> and an outlet flow control zone <b>26</b>. The baffle <b>14</b> includes a baffle port <b>27</b> spaced from the tank inlet <b>12</b> by the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b>. As can be seen, the baffle port <b>27</b> is through and through from the outer sidewall <b>23</b> to the inner sidewall <b>22</b>. If a net is employed, it is preferably positioned below the baffle port <b>27</b> to capture neutrally buoyant particulates as they enter the storage chamber <b>16</b>. The baffle port <b>27</b> and the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b> are configured to direct flow entering the tank <b>11</b> at the tank inlet <b>12</b> in a manner that generates a fluid flow tangential to the inner sidewall <b>22</b> of the baffle and the interior side <b>20</b> of the sidewalls <b>18</b> of the tank <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The outlet flow control zone <b>26</b> of the bypass <b>15</b> includes one or more ports <b>29</b> through which the fluid exits the storage chamber <b>16</b> by way of the intermediate region below the bypass plate <b>77</b> and between the outer sidewall <b>23</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> and the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank <b>11</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and <b>4</b> show four of the ports <b>29</b>, it is to be understood that more or fewer ports may be employed. Further, while the ports <b>29</b> are shown as being substantially round, it is to be understood that they may be other shapes including, but not limited to polygons and ovals. Yet further, the dimensions of the ports <b>29</b> (or simply one port if that is the design choice) may be selected as a function of the desired fluid output rate from the storage chamber <b>16</b> and the degree to which turbulence must be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The baffle <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is formed with a single curvature aspect to direct the fluid flow within the tank <b>11</b>, and an angled weir <b>24</b> to direct the fluid flow from the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b> through the baffle port <b>27</b>. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the baffle <b>14</b> may be formed of a complex curvature having a first curvature aspect <b>78</b> including the baffle port <b>27</b>, and a second curvature aspect <b>79</b>. In addition, the weir <b>24</b> may also be curved. The curvature of the weir <b>24</b> smoothes the fluid flow transition from the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b> through the baffle port <b>27</b> and into the storage chamber <b>16</b>. The curved weir <b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> blends with the curvature of the second curvature aspect <b>79</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> to enhance the smoothing of that transition. The curved weir <b>24</b> and the second curvature aspect <b>79</b> may be formed of a unitary structure connectable to the first curvature aspect <b>78</b>. Alternatively, the baffle <b>14</b> with the two curvature aspects may be formed of a unitary structure connectable to the curved weir <b>24</b>. Further, each of the weir <b>24</b>, the first curvature aspect <b>78</b> and the second curvature aspect <b>79</b> may be separate structures all connectable together.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the first curvature aspect <b>78</b> is preferably configured to aid in the fluid flow transitioning as the fluid moves within the storage chamber <b>16</b> and may have a less severe curvature than that of second curvature aspect <b>79</b>. The second curvature aspect <b>79</b> deviates from the configuration of the first curvature aspect <b>78</b> at a weir-baffle interface <b>80</b> and terminates at a baffle-chamber interface <b>81</b> in a transitional manner so that fluid flow remains as smoothed as possible when the baffle-chamber interface <b>81</b> is reached. The arrangement of the curved internally positioned baffle <b>14</b>, the baffle port <b>27</b>, and the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b> provides a cost effective means for handling substantial fluid flows while also causing removal of floating and non-floating particulate from the fluid. It is configured to balance the twin goals of fluid flow smoothing (i.e., low turbulence) and maximizing treatment volume within the dimensions of the tank <b>11</b>. That is, an optimal curvature of the baffle <b>14</b> and of the weir <b>24</b> produces the least amount of turbulence within the tank <b>11</b> while minimizing the reduction of the volume of the storage chamber <b>16</b> and fluid dwell time therein. In a comparison of the designs of the baffle <b>14</b> and weir <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, it is to be noted that the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> provides more fluid turbulence in a larger treatment volume while the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> provides less fluid turbulence within a smaller treatment volume. Both have their advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The overall reduction in fluid turbulence produced by the design of the system <b>10</b> of the present invention reduces the level of particulate entrainment, leading to better particulate removal within the tank <b>11</b>. In particular, the arrangement of the baffle port <b>27</b> and the baffle <b>14</b> shape aids in flow smoothing, a useful outcome when maximum particulate removal is desired. The failure to provide the smoothest fluid flow possible increases the likelihood of particulate entrainment as well as particulate scouring out of the storage chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The shape and dimensions of the baffle port <b>27</b> may be varied or selected as a function of the particular flow conditions to be expected. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the baffle port <b>27</b> is preferably shaped to be spaced above the bypass plate <b>77</b> near the inlet <b>12</b> and to gradually approach the bypass plate <b>77</b> away from the inlet <b>12</b> toward the baffle-weir interface <b>80</b>. As a result, under low fluid flow conditions, the fluid is restricted from immediately entering the storage chamber <b>16</b> through the baffle port <b>27</b> as it passes between the outer sidewall <b>23</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> and the weir <b>24</b> until reaching the inner sidewall <b>22</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> approaching the weir-baffle interface <b>80</b>. In that way, the fluid is forced to enter the storage chamber <b>16</b> tangentially at a higher velocity. If the baffle port <b>27</b> were of constant dimension through the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b>, at low flows, the fluid would immediately spill into the storage chamber <b>16</b> non-tangentially at a lower velocity, which disrupts the smooth flow pattern associated with tangential entry. It is advantageous to increase the velocity of low flows to promote the development of rotational flow in the storage chamber <b>16</b>. As flow rates increase, the fluid enters the storage chamber <b>16</b> through the baffle port <b>27</b> relatively closer to the inlet <b>12</b>. The relatively higher fluid velocity associated with relatively higher flow rates aids in maintaining a substantially tangential flow pattern as the fluid enters the storage chamber <b>16</b>. The relatively high flow rates do not need to be accelerated. The transitional design of the baffle port <b>27</b> aids in slowing the flow rate in that situation and therefore aids in reducing turbulence. A baffle port <b>27</b> of constant dimensions would be less effective in regulating fluid flow under all flow conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The bypass <b>15</b> comprising the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b>, the outlet flow control zone <b>26</b>, and the weir <b>24</b> may be formed with a plate connected perpendicularly or substantially perpendicularly to the bypass plate <b>77</b> between the outer sidewall <b>23</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> and the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank <b>11</b>. The dimensions of the two flow control zones may be configured as a function of the fluid flow rates required to be treated and defined by the size of the weir <b>24</b> and the arrangement of the baffle <b>14</b>, the bypass plate <b>77</b>, and any lid, with respect to the interior dimensions of the tank <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The inlet flow control zone <b>25</b> is further configured to change the shape of the fluid flowing into the inlet <b>12</b> so as to reduce its turbulence when entering the tank <b>11</b> and thereby preferably reduce particulate entrainment in the fluid. The tangential flow of the fluid into the storage chamber <b>16</b> causes it to pass along the inner sidewall <b>22</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> and the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank <b>11</b> to produce a swirling effect. In the embodiment of the tank <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the bottom of the baffle <b>14</b> may be shaped downwardly sloping with respect to the direction of fluid swirl within the storage chamber <b>16</b>. That shape of the bottom of the baffle <b>14</b> is preferably configured to substantially match the shape of the flow of particulates trajectory as they pitch about within the storage chamber <b>16</b> so that such particulates may not otherwise be drawn into the area under the baffle <b>14</b> before having a chance to settle on the tank bottom <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the weir <b>24</b> provides a means for regulating the direction of fluid flow through the bypass <b>15</b> as a function of incoming fluid flow rate. Weir <b>24</b> is designed with a wall height such that its top is substantially equal to or exceeds the height of the baffle port <b>27</b>. As a result, fluid entering the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b> crests the weir <b>24</b> at a higher elevation than the top of baffle port <b>27</b>. The baffle port <b>27</b> is therefore preferably submerged when the fluid in the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b> reaches the crest of the weir <b>24</b>. The purpose is to trap floating particulate in the storage chamber <b>16</b> during relatively high fluid flow rates while enabling fluid bypassing at such rates, and to allow the weir <b>24</b> to trap floating particulates as the fluid surface elevation falls below the crest of the weir <b>24</b>. During relatively low flow conditions and at the start of relatively high flow conditions, any floating particulate in the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b> is washed into the storage chamber <b>16</b> such that none is lost over the weir <b>24</b> if/when the fluid reaches the crest of the weir <b>24</b>. Otherwise, in general, the weir <b>24</b> is sized to divert all fluid entering at relatively low flow rates from the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b> into the storage chamber <b>16</b> in a manner consistent with the desire to create a flow tangential to the interior side <b>20</b> of the tank <b>11</b>, and to maximize removal efficiency while minimizing scouring. The weir <b>24</b> is further sized for relatively high flow rates to divert a portion of the entering fluid into the storage chamber <b>16</b> and to allow the remainder of the entering fluid to flow directly from the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b> directly to the outlet flow control zone <b>26</b> for exiting the outlet <b>13</b> of the tank. The specific dimensions of the weir may be varied as a function of the desired amount of fluid treatment for particular inlet flow conditions. As earlier indicated with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the weir <b>24</b> may be an angled rectangular plate or some other form of polygon or another shape, or it may be curved with respect to the direction of flow of the incoming fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In operation, fluid entering the tank <b>11</b> via the inlet <b>12</b> under low flow conditions first passes along the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b> of the bypass <b>15</b> and is diverted by the weir <b>24</b> through the baffle port <b>27</b> into the storage chamber <b>16</b>. As the fluid level in the storage chamber <b>16</b> rises, it comes up along the outer sidewall <b>23</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> until it reaches the underside of the bypass <b>15</b>. Upon reaching the underside of the bypass <b>15</b>, it passes through the port(s) <b>29</b> of the outlet flow control zone <b>26</b>. It is to be understood that after an initial filling of the storage chamber <b>16</b> as indicated above, the fluid remains substantially at a level of the bypass plate <b>77</b>. Thereafter, the fluid level in the storage chamber <b>16</b> only rises as fluid enters the tank <b>11</b>. The outlet flow control zone <b>26</b> and its ports <b>29</b> limit fluid flow through the storage chamber <b>16</b> and to increase head loss such that the upstream fluid surface elevation in the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b> rises and increases the head and volume of fluid in the storage chamber. This serves to decrease the average velocity of the fluid in the tank <b>11</b>, a feature that improves flow smoothing previously described. The arrangement of the outlet flow control zone <b>26</b> and its ports <b>29</b> also causes the inlet <b>12</b> to become submerged at relatively lower flow rates, also a feature of value in smoothing flow within the storage chamber <b>16</b>. That is, at a given flow rate, the fluid within the storage chamber <b>16</b> appears much “calmer” when the inlet <b>12</b> is submerged.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As the fluid exits zone <b>26</b> by way of outlet <b>13</b>, non-floating particulates remain in the storage chamber <b>16</b> and are generally directed toward the center of the storage chamber <b>16</b> due to the tangential flow of the fluid and the reduction in flow turbulence caused by the configuration of the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b>, the weir <b>24</b>, and the baffle <b>14</b>. Floating particulates also remain in the storage chamber <b>16</b> and are blocked from reaching the outlet flow control zone <b>26</b> of the bypass <b>15</b> by the inner sidewall <b>22</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> and by weir <b>24</b>. Under relatively higher flow rates, a portion of the fluid entering the tank <b>11</b> continues to be diverted by the weir <b>24</b> into the storage chamber <b>16</b>. The remainder stays in the bypass <b>15</b> and flows over the weir <b>24</b>, traveling directly from the inlet flow control zone <b>25</b> to the outlet flow control zone <b>26</b>. It then flows out of the outlet <b>13</b> without having spent any dwell time in the storage chamber <b>16</b> for the purpose of removing particulates. That arrangement reduces scouring/wash out effects during said relatively higher flow rates. Also, since most non-floating particulate typically resides at the bottom of a conduit such as a conduit connected to pipe stub <b>50</b> due to the effects of gravity and settling, and generally in the lowest region of a fluid flow, the non-floating particulate stratification (most particulates at the bottom of the flow and least particulates at the top of the flow), diverting all of the fluid at the relatively lower flow rate directs most of the non-floating particulates into the storage chamber <b>16</b> for removal. On the other hand, the top portion of a fluid flow at relatively higher flow rates contains the least amount of non-floating particulates. The arrangement of the weir <b>24</b> allows that top portion (and least particulate containing) part of the fluid to flow directly to the outlet flow control zone <b>26</b> under relatively higher flow rates, thereby maximizing particulate separation in an effective separation tank design while also ensuring all fluid flow conditions can be handled.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>, a second embodiment of the bypass <b>15</b>′, the flow plate designated as bypass plate <b>77</b>′ that defines in part the shape and dimensions of the bypass <b>15</b>′ is slightly sloped downwardly from the inlet <b>12</b> to the outlet <b>13</b>. Further, weir <b>24</b>′ is curved, in a manner described with reference to the weir <b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, and positioned further away from the inlet <b>12</b> than is the weir <b>24</b> of the first embodiment of the invention. The baffle port <b>27</b>′ is also positioned further from the inlet <b>12</b> than is the baffle port <b>27</b> of the first embodiment of the bypass <b>15</b>, thereby orienting the inlet <b>12</b> with respect to the fluid flow such that it is submerged relatively sooner than if the bypass plate <b>77</b>′ were substantially horizontally oriented. Submersion of the inlet <b>12</b> sooner rather than later under the varied fluid flow conditions to be expected likely aids in setting the shape of the fluid flow within the storage chamber <b>16</b>. A port <b>29</b>′ of the outlet flow control zone <b>26</b>′ is of oblong shape and only one employed. However, it is to be understood that alternative port configurations may be substituted, including the plurality of ports of the first embodiment of the outlet flow control zone.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a second embodiment of the system <b>10</b>′ of the present invention includes a tank <b>30</b> with a baffle <b>31</b>, inlet flow control zone (not shown), and outlet flow control zone <b>32</b>, substantially as designed with respect to the tank <b>11</b> or <b>11</b>′ arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>. However, the tank <b>30</b> includes a standpipe <b>33</b> substantially centered in a storage chamber <b>34</b>, the shape and volume of which is defined by the dimensions of interior walls <b>35</b>, the baffle <b>31</b>, and storage chamber bottom <b>36</b>. It is within the storage chamber <b>34</b> that floating and non-floating particulates entering through baffle port <b>37</b> are retained. The standpipe <b>33</b> includes a standpipe port <b>38</b> through which fluid reaching that level passes into a storage chamber output, such as output chamber <b>39</b> established between the storage chamber bottom <b>36</b> and tank bottom <b>40</b>. The standpipe port <b>38</b> is preferably a bellmouth port as shown, as a means to reduce fluid inlet velocity at that entry point. An optional crucifix <b>41</b> or an optional standpipe cover plate <b>42</b> may be included at the entry area of the standpipe <b>33</b> to reduce vortex effects on the fluid exiting the storage chamber <b>34</b>, and to reduce particulate entrainment. In an alternative version of the second embodiment of the system <b>10</b>′ shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the standpipe <b>33</b> is arranged and positioned substantially as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The standpipe <b>33</b> terminates at and connects to a storage chamber output conduit <b>43</b>. The storage chamber output conduit <b>43</b> passes along or below (as shown) the storage chamber bottom <b>36</b> and behind the baffle <b>31</b>. It terminates at the bypass plate in the area of the outlet flow control zone, preferably at a port such as port <b>44</b>, corresponding to port <b>29</b> of the outlet flow control zone shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, for example. The conduit <b>43</b> may be a unitary pipe, or a combination of a pipe leg along or below the storage chamber bottom <b>36</b> and a pipe running up behind the baffle <b>31</b>. Alternatively under this arrangement, the baffle <b>31</b> may extend approximately to the bypass plate, in which case the conduit would not run up behind the baffle <b>31</b>. The conduit <b>43</b> may also be formed as a unitary pipe in combination with the standpipe <b>33</b>. Intermediate space <b>45</b> between the storage chamber bottom <b>36</b> and the tank bottom may be open, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, or it may be filled with a filler material such as concrete. In that case, the conduit <b>43</b> in the area below the storage chamber bottom <b>36</b> may be formed in the process of filling the intermediate space <b>45</b>. The standpipe <b>33</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> may or may not include the bellmouth port opening, the crucifix <b>41</b>, and/or the cover plate <b>42</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In use, the system <b>10</b>′ of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> operates in much the same manner as the system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, including the bypass arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref> with respect to the intake of fluid, the flow control zones of the bypass including the weir, and the output of fluid having particulates removed. However, it varies from system <b>10</b> in the manner of transfer of fluid out of the storage chamber <b>34</b> as compared to fluid transfer out of storage chamber <b>16</b>. In particular, when the fluid level in the storage chamber <b>34</b> exceeds the height of the standpipe <b>33</b>, it flows down into the output chamber <b>39</b> before passing upward along the outer sidewall of the baffle <b>31</b> to the outlet flow control zone (not shown) for transfer out of the tank <b>30</b>. Preferably, the standpipe <b>33</b> is positioned such that the standpipe port <b>38</b> is below the fluid surface elevation under all flow conditions, with floating particulates remaining above the standpipe port <b>38</b> and non-floating particulates remaining below the standpipe port <b>38</b> substantially under all flow conditions so as to avoid scouring of floating and non-floating particulates. More generally, it is to be understood that placing the standpipe <b>33</b> substantially centered in the tank <b>30</b> such that the fluid exits down through the center of the storage chamber <b>34</b> minimizes disruption of the flow pattern within the storage chamber <b>34</b> and therefore maximizes particulate separation. Prior devices having conduits extending through the flow pattern disrupt that pattern and are therefore generally less effective at particulate removal.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, the interior side <b>20</b> of the sidewalls <b>18</b> of the tank <b>11</b> may optionally be corrugated. The corrugations <b>90</b> are in a helical orientation with the helix spiraling downwardly from the tank inlet <b>12</b> to the tank bottom <b>17</b>. The specific angle of the corrugations <b>90</b> may be selected as a function of the desired fluid flow rate down into the storage chamber <b>16</b>; however, that angle should match the downward flow trend of the fluid under average flow conditions. The corrugations <b>90</b> are designed to aid in the smoothing of the fluid flow within the tank <b>11</b>. In the alternative, the corrugations <b>90</b> may be oriented with the helix angle opposing the fluid flow pattern (that is, spiraling downwardly from the tank outlet <b>13</b> instead) to produce more turbulence of the flow pattern along the interior side <b>20</b> of the sidewalls <b>18</b> if that is determined to be of interest. The weir <b>24</b> may also or alternatively be configured to aid in fluid smoothing prior to entry into the storage chamber <b>16</b>, such as by forming corrugations on the side thereof closer to the baffle port <b>27</b>, the corrugations of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>. Further, the inner sidewall <b>22</b> of the baffle <b>14</b> may additionally or alternatively be so configured. It is also to be noted that additional or alternative flow-disrupting projections, such as ribs, may form part of the interior of the tank <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a first alternative embodiment of the bypass of tank <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9C</figref>, the arrangement of the storage chamber <b>16</b>, the pipe stubs <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> and their associated inlet and outlet (not shown), the baffle <b>14</b> remains substantially as previously described. However, the tank <b>100</b> includes a first alternative inlet flow control zone <b>101</b> and a first alternative outlet flow control zone <b>102</b> of a first alternative bypass <b>103</b>. The inlet flow control zone <b>101</b> includes weir <b>104</b> with weir cover plate <b>105</b>. Weir <b>104</b> directs fluid entering the inlet of the tank <b>100</b> to baffle port <b>27</b> for treatment in the storage chamber <b>16</b>. As fluid within the storage chamber <b>16</b> rises behind the baffle <b>14</b>, it exits vertically oriented outlet port <b>106</b> of secondary flow control wall <b>107</b> and passes through the outlet flow control zone <b>102</b> defined by outlet bypass plate <b>108</b> attached to secondary flow control wall <b>107</b>, the backside of baffle <b>14</b>, the interior wall of the tank <b>100</b>, and the secondary flow control wall <b>107</b>. This arrangement of the bypass <b>103</b> moves the outlet from the storage chamber <b>16</b> away from the tank outlet and closer to the tank inlet. The arrangement aids in the transition of fluid flow out of the tank <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a second alternative embodiment of the bypass of the tank <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-C</figref>, the arrangement of the storage chamber <b>16</b>, the pipe stubs <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> and their associated inlet and outlet, the inlet flow control zone (not shown), the weir <b>24</b>, and the baffle <b>14</b> remains substantially as previously described. However, the tank <b>100</b> includes a second alternative bypass <b>103</b>′ having a second alternative outlet flow control zone <b>102</b>′ with secondary flow control wall <b>107</b> and bypass plate <b>108</b>′. The bypass plate <b>108</b>′ includes an upstream section <b>109</b> divided from a downstream section <b>110</b> by secondary flow control wall <b>107</b>. The secondary flow control wall <b>107</b> includes the vertically oriented outlet port <b>106</b> described in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9C</figref>. However, the upstream section <b>109</b> of bypass plate <b>108</b>′ contains a secondary flow control aperture <b>111</b> upstream of the secondary flow control wall <b>107</b>. The aperture <b>111</b> may be sized to regulate flow of fluid out of the treatment chamber and thus through the outlet port <b>106</b> as required.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The benefit of the additional flow control associated with this second alternative embodiment of the bypass is to moderate the flow rate through the storage chamber <b>16</b> when flow over the weir <b>24</b> occurs. Low flows passing only through the storage chamber <b>16</b> are allowed to freely discharge through the aperture <b>111</b> and the outlet port <b>106</b>. However, as flow crests the weir <b>24</b> and enters the upstream section <b>109</b> of the bypass <b>103</b>′, the additional flow is restricted by the outlet port <b>106</b> and begins to submerge the upstream section <b>109</b>. This pooling of fluid in upstream section <b>109</b> creates an additional resistance to flow through the secondary flow control aperture <b>111</b>. This will result in a relatively consistent flow rate through the storage chamber <b>16</b> even as flow through the entire system increases.</p>
