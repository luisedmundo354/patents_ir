<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of recording information with a rotatable recording device, and more particularly, to the control of a rotatable recording device employing a dual encoder arrangement.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A magnetic disk drive, such as a hard disk drive, stores data on one or more disks coated with a magnetic medium. For read/write purposes, the surface of the magnetic medium carries a number of generally parallel data tracks, which on a disk type medium, are arranged concentrically with one another about the center of the disk.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An actuator arm positions a transducer or “head” over a desired track, and the head writes data to the track or reads data from the track. As the disk rotates, the actuator arm moves the head in a radial direction across the data tracks under control of a closed-loop servo system, based on position information or “servo data”, which is stored within dedicated servo fields of the magnetic medium of the disk. The servo fields can be interleaved with data sectors on the disk surface or can be located on a separate disk surface that is dedicated to storing servo information. As the head passes over the servo fields, it generates a feedback signal that identifies the location of the head relative to the centerline of the desired track. Based on this location, the servo system moves the actuator arm to adjust the head's position so that it moves toward a position over the desired track and/or a desired location within the track of current interest.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One requirement in the manufacture of such a hard disk drive relates to the formation of the servo patterns on the magnetic disk, which are typically in concentric circular patterns. Mastering Systems for forming the servo tracks on a master stamper used in magnetic contact printing have used both stepped translation mechanisms with laser beams and continuous translation mechanisms with electron beams. During the recording of the servo data on the substrate, the substrate is located on a rotating turntable located at the top of a spindle. A spindle control motor rotates the spindle in accordance with control signals provided by a controller. The servo tracks are recorded through exposure to an electron beam or laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A format signal generator is used to control the electron beam generator or laser beam generator to form the pattern on the disk as it is rotating with the turntable. The control of the format signal generator, and hence the recording on the disk, may be made in accordance with encoder signals from an encoder located at the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically, the encoder is provided at a bottom end of a spindle, the end opposite to that of the spindle on which the turntable is mounted. A precise motor control is provided by employing an encoder located in this position. In other words, the encoder at the bottom of the spindle may be mounted such that there is substantially no eccentricity with respect to the axis of rotation of the spindle. This allows for a very precise control of the motor based on the encoder signals.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although providing for a precisely centered mounting and accurate motor control signals, the location of the encoder at the bottom of the motor is problematic when used to provide a clock, position or velocity source for the format signal generation process during recording. This is due to the mechanical vibrations, however slight, that occur in the rotating portions of the recording system. In particular, the vibrations at the top of the spindle, where the turntable is located, are not synchronized with the vibrations at the bottom of the spindle, where the encoder is located. Because the distances employed in servo tracks are extremely small, such as between 50 to 90 nm, even minute disturbances will create problems of track-to-track phase errors.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Simply moving the encoder adjacent to the recording surface at the top of the spindle does not provide an adequate solution, however. This is because, in practice, providing for a substantially perfectly centrically mounted encoder adjacent to the recording surface has proven to be very difficult to achieve. Hence, an encoder provided adjacent to the recording surface at the turntable exhibits eccentricity during rotation so that the signals are inadequate for providing a precise clock, position or velocity signal employed to control recording.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a need for an arrangement that provides for a precise control of the spindle motor used in rotating the turntable that supports a recording media, but further provides for a precise clock, position or velocity signal that overcomes the disadvantages of single encoder systems.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This and other needs are met by embodiments of the present invention which provide an electron beam recorder comprising a spindle motor and a spindle driven by the spindle motor. The spindle extends to the spindle motor and has first and second ends. A turntable is mounted at the second end of the spindle and has a central axis of rotation. A first encoder is mounted at the first end of the spindle, and a second encoder is mounted on the turntable. A controller is coupled to the first and second encoders and a spindle motor, and controls the spindle motor and generates recording clock signals as a function of encoder signals received from the first and second encoders.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">By using dual encoders, the spindle motor may be precisely controlled as a function of encoder signals from the first encoder, and recording clock signals are provided as a function of the encoder signals received from the second encoder. In certain embodiments, the controller includes logic for compensating for the eccentric mounting of the second encoder on the turntable with respect to the central axis of rotation of the turntable.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The earlier stated needs are also met by other embodiments of the present invention which provide a method of controlling a rotating recording device having a spindle, a first encoder mounted on a first end of the spindle, a turntable mounted on a second end of the spindle, a second encoder mounted on the turntable, and a controller coupled to the first and second encoders and controlling the rotating recording device in accordance with signals from the first and second encoders. The method comprises the steps of determining an eccentricity of the second encoder with respect to a central axis of rotation of the spindle, and compensating for the determined eccentricity in the signals from the second encoder.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The earlier stated needs are also met by other embodiments of the present invention which provide an electron beam recorder comprising a turntable and motor arrangement with an encoder mounted at the turntable, and means for compensating signals from the encoder caused by eccentricity in the mounting of the encoder.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention addresses and solves problems related to the precise recording of information, such as servo information, on a recording disk. Problems created by the vibrations in such recording systems are overcome in embodiments of the invention by the provision of a dual encoder system. One of the encoders may be employed to control the spindle motor, while the other encoder may be used to provide clock source signals (or position or velocity) signals used by the signal format generator in the recording device. Eccentricity compensation logic allows the precise clock signal to be generated from the encoder signals provided by an encoder that is mounted on a turntable, despite eccentric mounting of the encoder in this location. Hence, a precise control of the spindle motor and precise generation of a clock signal for recording is achieved, despite presence of vibrations in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a cross-sectional side view of a portion of an electron beam recorder or other rotating recording device in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Details regarding the dual encoder arrangement are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and will be discussed later. Marks are formed on the disk surface <b>21</b> by the beam recording system <b>10</b>. The recording system <b>10</b> produces a relative motion between the disk workpiece <b>21</b> and a recording beam. During this movement, the beam impacts a surface and a system modulates the beam to expose the surface of the disk in a desired pattern. The beam, for example, is modulated to form servo marks in a photoresist surface on the disk <b>21</b>, according to servo mark patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The system <b>10</b> is an electron beam recording system, but may also be another type of recording system, such as a laser beam recording system, for example, which would include different components. The system <b>10</b> includes a turntable <b>31</b> and an electron beam column <b>33</b> for generating and manipulating the recording beam. The turntable <b>31</b> supports the disk <b>21</b> for rotation in the direction B about its vertical axis. Examples of such an electron beam recording system are available from Unaxis Nimbus Limited. It is assumed that those skilled in the art are generally familiar with the structure and operation of electron beam column devices. However, for completeness of the discussion, a summary description thereof is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the example, the electron beam column <b>33</b> includes a thermal field emission (TFE) electron source <b>35</b> and a suppression assembly <b>37</b>. The column may also include electronic extractor <b>39</b>. When appropriate voltages are applied to the TFE source <b>35</b>, the suppression assembly <b>37</b> and the extractor <b>39</b>, these elements cooperate to generate a stream of electrons for further processing in the column <b>33</b>. The stream of electrons passes through a first triple element lens <b>41</b>, then through blanking plates <b>43</b> and a blanking aperture <b>45</b>. The stream of electrons then passes through one or more additional lenses, represented, for example, by the second triple lens <b>47</b> in the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The beam position may be controlled by application of a voltage to the deflection plates <b>49</b>. The precise location of the deflection plates in the column, relative to the other elements of the column, is not critical. In the example, the deflection plates are between the blanking aperture <b>45</b> and the lens <b>41</b>, although other column structures use other arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The shapes of and voltages of the signals applied to the elements of column <b>33</b> serve to focus and shape the stream of electrons into a modulated beam of a desired shape and having a desired energy level for a particular application. For example, a set of signals applied to the elements of the column <b>33</b> causes the column to generate a modulated beam for forming servo patterns of particular size and depth at locations on the surface of the disk <b>21</b>. The drawing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the beam traveling through the column <b>33</b> as a straight line, for convenience of illustration. In actual operation, the beam would converge and diverge as it passes through the various elements of the column <b>33</b>, in order to focus on a sample on the turning table <b>31</b> in a desired manner.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The electron beam recording system <b>30</b> also includes a format signal generator <b>61</b>, for generating the various signals used by the electron beam column <b>33</b> to modulate and deflect the beam and thus format the patterns being exposed on the disk <b>21</b>. The formatter <b>61</b> essentially comprises circuitry forming one or more signal generators, for producing the various signals applied to the components of the column <b>30</b> to produce the desired beam.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One example of a signal produced by the generator <b>61</b> is the format modulation signal (or beam “format” signal) for application to the blanking plates <b>43</b>, which controls the energy level of the electron beam and thus the exposure of the recorded pattern. A controller <b>30</b> controls the rotational speed of the turntable <b>31</b>. The format signal generator <b>61</b> provides an encoder signal to the turntable control <b>63</b>, to regulate the rotational operations of the turntable <b>31</b>, and the control <b>63</b> may provide one or more feedback signals to the generator <b>61</b> indicating turntable position and/or speeds. For example, the turntable control <b>63</b> may provide an index signal each time a mark or a feature on the turntable or disk passes a reference point. The index signal provides information regarding speed of rotation. For example, the number of index pulses per minute indicates the number of revolutions per minute (RPM). The time between pulses of the index signal represents a period of one rotation. The angle between rotation start point (e.g., 12 o'clock) and the reference point is a known constant. Hence, the index can also be used to determine start and end points of successive rotations.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As discussed earlier, the use of a single encoder centrically mounted at a bottom end of a spindle motor does not provide accurate enough information due to vibrations at the top of the spindle, where the turntable is mounted. This leads to track-to-track phase errors. The use of a dual encoder arrangement, as depicted in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, overcomes these disadvantages.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the elements of column <b>33</b> are depicted as a single block for ease of illustration. The spindle motor <b>14</b> has coils <b>16</b> and a spindle <b>18</b> that rotates on a central axis. The spindle <b>18</b> is supported by spindle bearings <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A first encoder <b>22</b> is positioned at the first end of the spindle <b>18</b> (i.e., the bottom end of the spindle <b>18</b>). A second encoder <b>24</b> is located adjacent to the recording surface <b>31</b> of the turntable, i.e., at the second end of the spindle <b>18</b>. Sensors <b>26</b> operate in conjunction with the first and second encoders <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to provide encoder signals to the controller <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The controller <b>30</b> includes speed control logic <b>32</b>, digital clock logic <b>34</b> and eccentricity compensation logic <b>36</b>. The speed control logic <b>32</b> controls the speed of the spindle motor <b>14</b>. As will become apparent, the speed control logic <b>32</b>, during recording, normally controls the speed of the spindle motor <b>14</b> based on signals received from the sensor <b>26</b> at the first encoder <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The digital clock logic provides its output signals to the format signal generator to control the electronic beam recorder column <b>33</b> to produce an electron beam in accordance with clock signals. As will be explained further, the digital clock logic <b>34</b> employs the eccentricity compensation logic <b>36</b> to compensate for the eccentricity of the mounting of the second encoder <b>24</b> at the turntable <b>31</b>. The use of signals derived from the second encoder <b>24</b> through the sensor <b>26</b> allow for a more precise clock signal to be generated due to the proximity of the second encoder <b>24</b> to the recording surface <b>21</b>, rather than relying on signals related to the first encoder <b>22</b>. The eccentricity compensation logic <b>36</b> employs stored information, such as eccentricity information stored in table <b>38</b>, to perform the eccentricity compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In order to use the second encoder <b>24</b> as a position, velocity or clock source for recording the pattern, such as the servo pattern, on the disk substrate <b>21</b>, the eccentricity of this second encoder <b>24</b> must be measured. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the eccentricity of mounting of the second encoder <b>24</b> is measured against the more accurately mounted first encoder <b>22</b>. A process for measuring and compensating for the eccentricity is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> according to certain embodiments of the present invention. In step <b>70</b>, the process is started. In step <b>72</b>, control of the spindle motor <b>18</b> is made according to the signals related to the first encoder <b>22</b>. Measurements are made of the repeatable component of the timing of the pulses, using the first encoder <b>22</b>. All encoders have a tolerance, i.e., how tightly they can control distances between marks laid down on a glass substrate. Once the marks are laid down on the disk, these marks are fixed, but a distance variation, (frequency component when the encoder is rotated), reveals a variation in the timing of the pulses, which is fixed relative to an index position. It is termed a “repeatable component” because the amount of timing variation referenced in the index will always be the same.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In step <b>74</b>, the second encoder <b>24</b> is employed to control the speed of the spindle motor <b>14</b> and is also used to measure the repeatable component analogously to the control and measurements performed by the first encoder <b>22</b> in step <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, in step <b>76</b>, the first encoder <b>22</b> is employed to control the spindle motor <b>14</b>, but the second encoder <b>24</b> is used to measure the repeatable component of the timing of the pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In step <b>78</b>, based upon the above measurements, a measure of eccentricity of the mounting of the second encoder <b>24</b> is determined. A table may then be formulated with this eccentricity information, in step <b>80</b>. The table thus contains stored information related to the eccentricity of the mounting of the second encoder <b>24</b>, with respect to the central rotation axis of the turntable <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In step <b>82</b>, recording is performed with the relatively accurately mounted first encoder <b>22</b> operating as the spindle control encoder for the spindle motor <b>14</b>, and the digital clock generating system providing signals to the format signal generator <b>61</b> during recording. Since the second encoder <b>24</b> is located adjacent to the recording surface <b>21</b> in the turntable <b>31</b>, it can provide a more accurate clock signal than the first encoder <b>22</b> located a much greater distance away from the recording surface <b>21</b> and turntable <b>31</b>, thereby avoiding the significant mechanical errors and momentary displacements that can occur between the substrate and the encoder. This prevents the pattern being recorded on the substrate from being inaccurate. At the same time, however, the eccentricity of the mounting of the second encoder <b>24</b> is compensated using the eccentricity compensation logic <b>36</b> and the stored information in the table <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The digital clock logic <b>34</b> and the eccentricity compensation logic <b>36</b> is depicted in block diagram form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Logic <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> receive the encoder signals from the first and second encoders <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. During an actual recording operation, the signals from the second encoder <b>24</b> are employed to produce the digital clock source, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The digital clock logic <b>34</b> and eccentricity compensation logic <b>36</b> include a digital phase detector <b>40</b> coupled to a custom filter (loop compensator) <b>42</b>. A numerically controlled oscillator <b>44</b> receives the output of the filter <b>42</b> and provides its output to the input of a divide-by-N multiplier <b>46</b> that is used to multiply the clock. The digital clock logic <b>34</b> and eccentricity compensation logic <b>36</b> are able to reference the table <b>38</b> to provide the eccentricity compensation as required.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With the embodiments of the present invention, accurate recording of a high quality pattern on a master substrate or other media is achievable in an electron beam recorder or other rotating recording device, by the use of a dual encoder arrangement. The encoder of the spindle control system located some distance away from the recording surface is not employed as the primary clock source for recording the pattern on the master substrate, since the mechanical distance between the spindle encoder and the substrate surface will allow significant mechanical errors and momentary displacements to occur between the substrate and the encoder, causing this pattern recorded on the substrate to be inaccurate. Instead, the invention provides a second encoder located on the turntable adjacent to the recording surface, and which can be used as a position, velocity or clock source for recording the pattern on the substrate. A mounting eccentricity of the second encoder can be compensated by measuring the eccentricity against the spindle control encoder, with a digital clock generating system using a digital phase locked loop compensating for this measured eccentricity.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is to be clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims.</p>
