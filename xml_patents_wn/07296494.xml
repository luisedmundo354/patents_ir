<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention is directed to an improved accelerator pedal module for controlling the power of a driving engine, in particular an internal combustion engine of a vehicle, having a pedal lever held rotatably about a pivot axis by means of a pivot connection on a bearing block, which pedal lever can be made to strike an associated bearing block stop by at least one pedal lever stop.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. The Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One accelerator module of the type with which this invention is concerned is disclosed in German Patent Disclosure DE 195 36 699 A1.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the invention, it is proposed that in the region of the pedal lever stop and/or the bearing block stop, elasticities are present such that during a relative rotary motion executed about the pivot axis between the pedal lever and the bearing block to establish the pivot connection, the pedal lever stop slides past the bearing block stop because of elastic deformations and after springing back engages the bearing block stop from behind. As in a snap connection, the stops associated with one another on the bearing block and on the pedal lever slide past one another with pressure, so that after the elastic regions have sprung back, they prevent the pedal lever from separating from the bearing block. Besides their function as an idling stop, for instance, the stops on the pedal lever and on the bearing block therefore simultaneously act as a snap closure, which forms part of the pivot connection and assures this pivot connection. The pivot connection between the pedal lever and the bearing block can then be established by means of only a single rotary motion; the term pivot connection is understood to mean a connection that essentially cannot be undone and that allows only one degree of rotational freedom.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an exemplary embodiment described in DE 195 36 699 A1, already cited above, two elastic cheeks of the bearing block that each have a through bore must be bent open laterally, to enable introducing a bearing peg of the pedal lever into through holes of the cheeks. This elasticity in the region of the bearing faces requires a resilient bearing of the pedal lever on the bearing block. Since a sensor, which in the context of realizing an electrical accelerator pedal furnishes an electrical signal that is dependent on the actuation travel of the pedal lever to a central engine control unit is mounted on the accelerator pedal module, this kind of resilient support has an adverse effect on the measurement accuracy. In a preferred way, the elastic regions of the accelerator pedal module that make the snap closure possible are therefore located remotely from the bearing faces of the pivot connection, so that the bearing faces can be designed for a high rigidity that is favorable for the sake of measurement accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The elastic deformations that occur during the passage past one another of the associated stops can engender forces which change the relative position between the pedal lever and the bearing block during assembly. It is therefore especially preferable that the pedal lever can be braced on the bearing block by means of the bearing faces, before the pedal lever stop slides past the bearing block stop. The pedal lever is then guided in a defined way on the bearing block before the snap closure is completed, which facilitates assembly substantially.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a first embodiment, the bearing faces of the pivot connection include at least one annular portion, which is formed onto the pedal lever and extends over a partial circle and which can be introduced into an annular groove that is formed onto the bearing block and likewise extends over part of a circle. The result is an especially rigid, rail-like guidance of the pedal lever on the bearing block, which on the one hand facilitates assembly of the snap closure and on the other creates an especially rigid rotary support of the pedal lever on the bearing block.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further embodiment, the bearing faces of the pivot connection have a peg, which is coaxial with the pivot axis and is associated with the bearing block and on which a partly cylindrical bearing face of the pedal lever can be placed. The bearing surface of the pedal lever is then guided on the peg of the bearing block during the relative rotary motion that brings about the snap closure, which for the reasons given above substantially facilitates the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further provision, the bearing block preferably has two cheeks, between which the pedal lever is guided and which are provided with two protruding bearing block stops pointing toward one another. The symmetrical stops advantageously prevent the occurrence of a tilting moment when the pedal lever strikes a stop.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A refinement provides that the cheeks of the bearing block have a lateral elasticity in the region of the bearing block stops. For example, the elasticity of the two cheeks can be increased by a purposeful local reduction in the wall thickness in the region of the bearing block stops, so that the elastic deformations remain limited to that region and so that the associated stops are enabled to move past one another. Conversely, in the region of the bearing faces of the pivot connection, the cheeks should be embodied as only slightly resilient, for the sake of a rigid bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further provision, the pedal lever stop and the bearing block stop have a geometry which prevents the pivot connection, once completed, from being undone. This is preferably achieved by providing that at least the bearing block stop has at least one wedge, protruding in the direction of the pivot axis, with a wedge face that opens into a step, and the wedge face is operative in the direction of the relative rotary motion provided for establishing the pivot connection, and the step is operative in the opposite direction. The pedal lever stop can be formed by at least one stop edge, associated with the step of the wedge, which stop edge defines a region which is retracted in the direction of the pivot axis and in which the wedge is guided with play, once the pivot connection is completed. The wedge and the retracted region can be formed integrally onto the bearing block and the pedal lever, respectively, for instance in the injection molding process.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The accelerator pedal module of the invention is used for controlling a driving engine, preferably an internal combustion engine of a motor vehicle, whose throttle valve is adjustable by a control motor. In that case, the accelerator pedal module serves to generate electrical signals for the control motor, so that the engine power can be controlled as a function of the position of an accelerator pedal of the accelerator pedal module. However, the driving engine can also for instance be an electric motor that is triggered by electrical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The accelerator pedal module <b>1</b> is foot-actuated by the motor vehicle's driver and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a pedal lever <b>2</b>, which preferably is the gas pedal actuated directly by the driver's foot. Alternatively, the pedal lever <b>2</b> can be a lever of a lever mechanism or rod linkage mechanism that includes additional levers and is coupled to the gas pedal. The accelerator pedal module <b>1</b> also includes a bearing block <b>4</b> as a retention structure for the pedal lever <b>2</b>, and this block can preferably be secured directly in the foot area of the driver by means of screw eyes <b>8</b> protruding laterally from a bottom plate <b>6</b> of the bearing block. Further elements contained in the accelerator pedal module <b>1</b> are a sensor and restoring spring elements, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for the sake of simplicity. In addition, the accelerator pedal module <b>1</b> can be provided with a kick-down mechanism for an automatic transmission of the motor vehicle, a mechanism as described for instance in German Patent Disclosure DE 195 36 699 A1.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As can be seen from the upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the bearing block <b>4</b> includes two cheeks <b>14</b>, joined together, at the ends pointing away from the bottom plate <b>6</b>, by a crossbar <b>12</b>, which are disposed parallel with transverse spacing and protrude at a right angle away from the bottom plate <b>6</b>. The cheeks <b>14</b> are also joined to one another by means of an end plate <b>16</b> that likewise protrudes away from the bottom plate <b>6</b> at a right angle. The crossbar <b>12</b>, on its lower face pointing toward the bottom plate <b>6</b>, has a central bearing face <b>18</b>, in the form of an approximately semicylindrical face of an imaginary cylinder, whose center axis corresponds to a pivot axis <b>20</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, of a pivot connection between the pedal lever <b>2</b> and the bearing block <b>4</b>. Toward the cheeks, the crossbar <b>12</b> also has two bearing faces <b>22</b>, which are enlarged in diameter compared to the central bearing face <b>18</b> and are likewise formed approximately by semicylindrical faces. All the bearing faces <b>18</b>, <b>22</b> point toward the bottom plate <b>6</b> of the bearing block <b>4</b>. Transversely to the pivot axis <b>20</b>, that is, viewed longitudinally of the bearing block <b>4</b>, there is, next to each edge of the bearing faces <b>22</b> of the cheeks, a respective introduction slot <b>24</b> leading to a respective annular groove <b>26</b>, which is defined on one side by the larger-diameter bearing face <b>22</b> and on the other by a further, opposed, circular-arclike bearing face <b>28</b> that is coaxial with the pivot axis <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a region of the cheeks <b>14</b> located at a distance from the bearing faces <b>18</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>28</b>, there are two bearing block stops, opposite one another and pointing toward one another and protruding in the direction of the pivot axis <b>20</b>, which are preferably in the form of wedges <b>30</b>, with wedge faces <b>32</b>, extending approximately radially to the pivot axis <b>20</b>, that on their maximally protruding wedge end each form one protruding step <b>34</b> relative to the rest of the cheek surface. Because of the perspective view, only one of the wedges <b>30</b> can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In one of the cheeks <b>14</b> of the bearing block, there is also a further introduction slot <b>36</b>, which opens into a partially circular-arclike opening <b>38</b> of the corresponding cheek <b>14</b>. Adjacent to the partially circular opening <b>38</b> in the cheek <b>14</b>, there is a holder for a sensor housing of the sensor, preferably in the form of pegs <b>40</b> which protrude outward at a right angle and have central blind bores for receiving screws.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As can be best seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bottom plate <b>6</b>, in a region that in terms of the longitudinal direction of the bearing block <b>4</b> is located between the pivot axis <b>20</b> and the bearing block stops <b>30</b>, there is a holder for the restoring spring elements <b>10</b>, which is preferably embodied as a peg <b>42</b>. The restoring spring elements, embodied for instance as helical springs inserted one inside the other, are slipped onto the peg <b>42</b> and centered on it. The bearing block <b>4</b> is preferably embodied as a one-piece plastic injection-molded part; that is, all the elements described thus far, such as the bottom plate <b>6</b>, end plate <b>16</b>, cheeks <b>14</b>, crossbar <b>12</b>, and in particular the bearing block stops <b>30</b>, together form one integral component.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The pedal lever <b>2</b> shown in the lower part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has a lever body <b>44</b>, which on its free end has a foot plate <b>46</b> and, on a pedal lever head <b>48</b>, it has bearing faces, which cooperate with the bearing faces <b>18</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>28</b> of the bearing block <b>4</b> and contain a central, concave bearing face <b>50</b>. The bearing face <b>50</b> is preferably formed by a number of ribs <b>52</b>, parallel to one another with transverse spacing, whose end faces together form approximately a semicylindrical surface with a diameter that is approximately equivalent to the diameter of the central bearing face <b>18</b> of the bearing block <b>4</b>. The central bearing face <b>50</b> of the pedal lever <b>2</b> is disposed between coaxial annular portions <b>54</b>, which protrude away from both side faces of the lever body <b>44</b> and each extend over approximately a semicircular arc, and whose radially inner circumferential surfaces form bearing faces. The annular portions <b>54</b>, in a direction that is radial to the pivot axis <b>20</b>, have a thickness which is equivalent to the inside diameter of the annular groove <b>26</b> of the bearing block <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A peglike driver <b>56</b> also protrudes transversely outward away from the pedal lever head <b>48</b> and for instance engages a rotary lever, not shown, of a wiper ring of a potentiometer retained in the sensor housing; in the present case, the potentiometer for instance forms the sensor. In a region of the lever body disposed between the bearing faces <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> and the foot plate <b>46</b>, a pedal lever stop is present on each of the two side faces, preferably in the form of a stop edge <b>58</b>, which defines a region <b>60</b> that is retracted in the direction of the pivot axis <b>20</b>. The retracted region <b>60</b> has a dimension longitudinally that is approximately equivalent to the actuation travel of the pedal lever <b>2</b> and that extends approximately radially relative to the pivot axis <b>20</b>. The width of the pedal lever <b>2</b> in the area surrounding the retracted region <b>60</b> is approximately equivalent to the transverse spacing of the two cheeks <b>14</b> of the bearing block <b>4</b>. The pedal lever <b>2</b> is preferably embodied as a one-piece plastic injection-molded part; that is, all the elements described thus far, such as the foot plate <b>46</b>, the bearing faces <b>50</b>, <b>54</b>, the driver <b>56</b>, the retracted regions <b>60</b>, and in particular the pedal lever stops <b>58</b> together form one integral component.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For producing the pivot connection between the pedal lever <b>2</b> and the bearing block <b>4</b>, the annular portions <b>54</b> that are present on the pedal lever head <b>48</b> are introduced via the introduction slots <b>24</b> into the associated annular grooves <b>26</b>, and the driver <b>56</b> is introduced into the further introduction slot <b>36</b>. The pedal lever <b>2</b> is then rotated onward by some distance relative to the bearing block <b>4</b>, or vice versa, about the pivot axis <b>20</b>, as a result of which both the central and the outer bearing faces <b>18</b> and <b>50</b>, and <b>22</b>, <b>28</b> and <b>54</b>, respectively, on the pedal lever <b>2</b> and on the bearing block <b>4</b>, and the side faces on the pedal lever <b>2</b> and on the cheeks <b>14</b> of the bearing block <b>4</b> all come into sliding contact with one another. The result is a positive engagement, which permits a rotation of the pedal lever <b>2</b> only relative to the bearing block <b>4</b> about the pivot axis <b>20</b>; particularly because of the two pairs <b>26</b>, <b>54</b> of annular portions and annular grooves, the pedal lever <b>2</b> is guided in compulsory fashion and braced. Before that, the restoring spring elements <b>10</b> are placed on the one hand on the peg <b>42</b> in the bottom plate <b>6</b> of the bearing block <b>4</b> and on the other on a peg of the pedal lever <b>2</b> opposite it in the mounting position, the latter peg not being visible in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In general, in the region of the pedal lever stop <b>58</b> and/or the bearing block stop <b>30</b>, there are elasticities such that during the relative rotary motion, executed about the pivot axis <b>20</b>, between the pedal lever <b>2</b> and the bearing block <b>4</b> to establish the pivot connection, the pedal lever stop <b>58</b> slides past the bearing block stop <b>30</b> as a result of elastic deformations and after springing back engages the bearing block stop from behind. Since in the present case the width of the pedal lever <b>2</b> is approximately equivalent to the spacing of the two cheeks <b>14</b>, and the wedges <b>30</b>, functioning as bearing block stops, must be passed by the stop edges <b>58</b> of the pedal lever in the course of the relative rotation in order to establish the pivot connection, the walls of the cheeks <b>14</b> are double in the region of the wedges <b>30</b>, and therefore have hollow spaces <b>62</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Thin strips <b>64</b>, which are separated by slots from the rest of the wall, are also formed onto the wedges <b>30</b>. As a result, because of elastic deformations of the strips <b>64</b>, the wedges <b>30</b> can escape back into the hollow spaces <b>62</b>, when the stop edges <b>58</b> slide along the wedge faces <b>32</b> that gradually widen in the direction of the relative rotary motion that is intended to establish the pivot connection. Consequently, the elastic deformation of the cheeks <b>14</b> takes place primarily in the locally defined region of the strips <b>64</b>, far from the bearing faces <b>18</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>50</b>, <b>54</b>, respectively, of the pivot connection.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Since the pedal lever <b>2</b> is guided in compulsory fashion on the bearing block <b>4</b>, particularly by the pairs <b>26</b>, <b>54</b> of annular portions and annular grooves, and cannot execute any other motion than a rotation about the pivot axis <b>20</b>, it is advantageously braced and cannot deflect in other directions. The part that comes into engagement first with the annular grooves <b>26</b> during the insertion of the annular portions <b>54</b> of the pedal lever <b>2</b> into the introduction slots <b>24</b> of the bearing block <b>4</b> consequently functions initially as a compulsory guide to facilitate assembly in the overcoming of the forces dictated by the elastic deformations. Consequently, the pedal lever <b>2</b> is already braced on the bearing block <b>4</b> by means of the bearing faces <b>18</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>50</b>, <b>54</b>, respectively, of the pivot connection before the pedal lever stops <b>58</b> slide past the bearing block stops <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Instead of embodying only those regions formed onto the wedges <b>30</b> elastically, the wedges <b>30</b> themselves and/or the stop edges <b>58</b> could also be embodied elastically. The only decisive factor is that the wedges <b>30</b> and stop edges be capable of moving past one another. For instance, spring-prestressed wedges <b>30</b> guided in the cheeks <b>14</b> and embodied as separate components are also conceivable.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Once the stop edges <b>58</b> have moved completely past the wedges <b>30</b> in the course of the further relative rotation, the wedges <b>30</b> emerge again from the hollow spaces <b>62</b> from springing back of the strips <b>64</b>, and—in a manner similar to a snap closure—the steps <b>34</b> on the ends of the wedges <b>30</b> engage the associated stop edges <b>58</b> from behind, and the wedges <b>30</b> protrude with play into the laterally retracted regions <b>60</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Thus the pivot connection between the pedal lever <b>2</b> and the bearing block <b>4</b> is completed, and the pedal lever <b>2</b> can execute the requisite pivoting motions without hindrance. The restoring spring elements <b>10</b> are pressed together during the relative rotary motion completed in the direction of the closing snap closure and exert a restoring force on the pedal lever <b>2</b>. Once the snap connection has been completed, the steps <b>34</b> of the wedges <b>30</b> consequently strike the stop edges <b>58</b> in the opposite direction of rotation and assure a positive engagement, which prevents the stop edges <b>58</b> from moving past the protruding steps <b>34</b> of the wedges <b>30</b> again and undoing the pivot connection that has once been made; this can easily be seen, particularly from the sectional view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The snap closure consequently forms one component of the pivot connection, without which the pivot connection could not be completed. If necessary, however, the pivot connection or snap closure can be undone again by spreading the two cheeks <b>14</b> of the bearing block apart, although in that case a suitable tool is needed. In the completely installed state, the pedal lever stop <b>58</b> is consequently prestressed resiliently against the bearing block stop <b>30</b> counter to a pedal actuation direction, and the pedal lever stop <b>58</b> and the bearing block stop <b>30</b> together form an idling stop <b>66</b> of the accelerator pedal module <b>1</b>, so that the pedal lever <b>2</b> is in the idling position, in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A full-load stop <b>68</b> of the accelerator pedal module <b>1</b> has a plane portion <b>70</b> of the bottom plate <b>6</b>, toward the bearing block <b>4</b>, which is opposite a portion <b>72</b> of the pedal lever <b>2</b> that projects slightly downward; the portion <b>70</b> contacts the portion <b>72</b> when the pedal lever <b>2</b> has been fully depressed, as can easily be understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The retracted regions <b>60</b> of the pedal lever have a length, viewed in the circumferential direction of the rotary motion, which encompasses the entire pedal lever motion between the idling stop <b>66</b> and the full-load stop <b>68</b>. Moreover, by actuation of the pedal lever <b>2</b>, the driver <b>56</b> is moved along the partly circular-arclike opening <b>38</b> of the cheek <b>14</b> of the bearing block <b>4</b> and in the course of this motion carries the rotary lever of the wiper ring of the potentiometer with it, whereupon the potentiometer generates electrical signals for the engine control unit that are dependent on the pedal actuation travel.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">From the above explanation, it is clear that the pivot connection between the pedal lever <b>2</b> and the bearing block <b>4</b> comes about by means of a single rotary motion about a pivot axis <b>20</b>, and this pivoting motion simultaneously furnishes the snap closure that functions simultaneously as an idling stop <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the second exemplary embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, the elements that remain the same and function the same as in the above example are identified by the same reference numerals. In a distinction from the first embodiment, the central bearing face of the bearing block <b>4</b> is formed by the radially outer circumferential surface <b>74</b> of a hollow peg <b>78</b> that is coaxial with the pivot axis <b>20</b> of the pivot connection and that is retained on a protrusion <b>80</b> protruding upward and away from the bottom plate <b>6</b>, as can be best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The hollow peg <b>78</b> extends between the cheeks <b>14</b> of the bearing block <b>4</b> and is freely accessible from above (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) without being covered by a transverse wall. As in the exemplary embodiment described above, wedges <b>30</b> pointing toward one another are disposed on the cheeks <b>14</b>, remote from the bearing face formed by the hollow peg <b>78</b>. In the region of the wedges <b>30</b>, the cheeks <b>14</b> have a relatively slight wall thickness, so that there is lateral resilience.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Besides the hollow peg <b>78</b>, two further bearing faces are embodied on the bearing block <b>4</b>, in the form of partly cylindrical faces <b>82</b> of larger diameter, only one of which is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, that each adjoin the associated cheek <b>14</b>. A holder, in the form of a centering peg <b>84</b>, for restoring spring elements <b>10</b>, comprising two helical springs inserted into one another, is embodied in the crossbar <b>12</b> that in terms of the bearing block stops <b>30</b> is disposed on the far side of the hollow peg <b>78</b>, and the ends of the helical springs are received on this peg <b>84</b>, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It can also be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> that the cylindrical pedal lever head <b>48</b> has a recess <b>86</b>, which opens into a total of three, for instance, partly cylindrical bearing faces that are coaxial with the pivot axis <b>20</b>. These bearing faces include a central bearing face <b>88</b> of the same diameter as the hollow peg <b>78</b>, as well as one further bearing face <b>90</b> of greater diameter on each of their ends in terms of the axial direction; this latter diameter is equivalent to the diameter of the two outer bearing faces <b>82</b> of the bearing block <b>4</b>. The pedal lever head <b>48</b> is also provided with an extension <b>92</b>, extending in the longitudinal direction of the pedal lever, which has a holder for the restoring spring elements <b>10</b>, which is in the form of a further centering peg <b>94</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The laterally retracted region <b>60</b> of the pedal lever <b>2</b>, which is defined by the stop edge <b>58</b>, is also visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For producing the pivot connection, the pedal lever <b>2</b> is placed with its three partly cylindrical bearing faces <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> on the associated bearing faces <b>74</b>, <b>82</b> of the bearing block <b>4</b>, via the radial recess <b>86</b>. Simultaneously, the restoring spring elements <b>10</b> are placed on the centering pegs <b>84</b>, <b>94</b>, which requires that the restoring spring elements be compressed. The compressive force generated because of the change in length of the restoring spring elements <b>10</b> assures that the pedal lever <b>2</b> is retained on the bearing block <b>4</b> and that the respective bearing faces <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> and <b>74</b>, <b>82</b> associated with one another are prestressed against one another. The stop edges <b>58</b> of the pedal lever <b>2</b> are in a position in which they have not yet moved past the wedges <b>30</b>. From that position, the pedal lever <b>2</b> is now rotated counterclockwise, in terms of the view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and the stop edges <b>58</b> slide along the ascending wedge faces <b>32</b> of the wedges <b>30</b>, and the cheeks <b>14</b> deflect outward with elastic deformation. Once the stop edges <b>58</b> have moved past the steps <b>34</b> of the wedges <b>30</b>, the cheeks <b>14</b> spring back inward, and the stop edges <b>58</b> engage the steps <b>34</b> of the wedges <b>30</b> from behind, as described in the preceding exemplary embodiment. The stop edges <b>58</b>, together with the associated wedges <b>30</b>, also form both the idling stop <b>66</b> of the accelerator pedal module <b>1</b> and a snap closure of the pivot connection that has come about because of the rotary motion. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a wedge <b>96</b> can also be seen, which protrudes laterally away from the extension <b>92</b> of the pedal lever head <b>48</b> and strikes a stop, not shown, of the bearing block <b>4</b>, in the full-load position of the pedal lever <b>2</b>, and which as soon as the pedal lever <b>2</b> has been placed on the bearing block <b>4</b> is already in its working position without requiring a relative rotary motion for that purpose. The wedge <b>96</b> on the pedal lever <b>2</b> and the associated stop on the bearing block <b>4</b> together therefore form a full-load stop of the accelerator pedal module.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In both embodiments, the restoring spring elements <b>10</b> tense the bearing faces <b>18</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>) and <b>74</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>) that are associated with one another. Consequently, a frictional moment oriented counter to the actuation motion occurs in the pivot bearing, and this moment depends, among other factors, on the coefficient of friction of the bearing faces and on the diameter of the bearing faces. As a result, as in accelerator pedals with purely mechanical transmission means, a frictional hysteresis is generated, which has an advantageous effect on the road feel. Preferably, at least one of the bearing faces <b>18</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>) and <b>74</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>) are provided with a suitable friction lining, which can for instance be done in the production of the injection-molded part by placement in the mold, so that the friction lining is already integrated with the bearing face <b>18</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>) and <b>74</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>). Then the accelerator pedal module <b>1</b> of the embodiments described above comprises a total of only four different components, namely the pedal lever <b>2</b>, the bearing block <b>4</b>, the sensor <b>102</b>, and the restoring spring elements <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The peg embodied as a hollow peg <b>78</b> is embodied integrally with the bearing block <b>4</b> and in particular with its bottom plate <b>6</b> and has a bearing bore <b>98</b>, which is coaxial with the pivot axis <b>20</b>, for a sensor shaft <b>100</b> of a rotation sensor <b>102</b>, embodied preferably as a rotary potentiometer, in the form of a blind bore in which at least part of the sensor shaft <b>100</b> is directly supported rotatably, that is, without the interposition of bearing bushes, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Consequently, the axis of rotation of the sensor is coaxial with the pivot axis <b>20</b> of the pivot connection between the pedal lever <b>2</b> and the bearing block <b>4</b>. Preferably, one end portion <b>104</b> of the sensor shaft <b>100</b> is received in the bearing bore <b>98</b>, while the other end portion <b>106</b> of the sensor shaft <b>100</b> is rotatably supported in a sensor housing <b>108</b>, secured to the bearing block <b>4</b> for instance by means of screws on the associated holder <b>40</b>, as best seen in the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sensor shaft <b>100</b> rotatably supported inside the hollow peg <b>78</b> and the pedal lever head <b>48</b> rotatably supported on the hollow peg <b>78</b> are directly coupled for rotation to one another by a driver <b>110</b>, in order to transmit the rotary motions of the pedal lever <b>2</b> to the sensor shaft <b>100</b> essentially without play and in linear fashion. This can be achieved for instance by providing that a driver pin <b>110</b>, protruding radially away from the sensor shaft <b>100</b>, protrudes through a slot <b>112</b> in the wall of the hollow peg <b>78</b> and is received directly in a recess <b>114</b> in the central bearing face <b>88</b> of the pedal lever head <b>48</b>. The slot <b>112</b> has a length in the circumferential direction that allows an unhindered motion of the pedal lever <b>2</b> between the idling stop <b>66</b> and the full-load stop. To enable the sensor lever <b>118</b> to be inserted laterally into the bearing bore <b>98</b> of the hollow peg <b>78</b> despite the driver pin <b>110</b> protruding radially away from it, the slot <b>112</b> extends in the direction of the pivot axis <b>20</b> as far as the end of the hollow peg <b>78</b> that is located opposite the sensor housing <b>108</b>. Moreover, the cheek <b>14</b> of the bearing block <b>4</b> pointing toward the sensor housing <b>108</b> has a through hole <b>116</b> that is coaxial with the sensor shaft <b>100</b>, so that by simple lateral insertion into the bearing bore <b>98</b>, the sensor shaft <b>100</b> can be installed with simultaneous alignment of the driver pin <b>110</b> with the slot <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Protruding away from the sensor shaft <b>100</b> is a sensor lever <b>118</b>, which is preferably integral with the sensor shaft and which is provided on its free end with wiper contacts <b>122</b> of a wiper <b>124</b> that are oriented toward a sensor plate <b>120</b>. By rotation of the wiper <b>124</b> relative to the sensor plate <b>120</b>, continuously variable resistance values can be set in a known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The cross section of the driver pin <b>110</b> is preferably widened somewhat at its head <b>126</b>, compared to its part that protrudes through the slot <b>112</b> of the wall of the hollow peg <b>78</b>, with the head <b>126</b> engaging the recess <b>114</b> in the central bearing face <b>88</b> of the pedal lever head <b>48</b>. This recess is preferably embodied by a radially extending blind bore <b>114</b>, whose cross section is somewhat smaller than the cross section of the head <b>126</b> of the driver pin <b>110</b>. The driver pin <b>110</b> is embraced in the recess <b>114</b> with prestressing whenever at least one side wall, for instance, of the blind bore <b>114</b> is capable of deforming elastically upon insertion of the driver pin <b>110</b>. In the present case, two side walls, facing one another, of the blind bore <b>114</b> are double, forming one hollow space <b>128</b> each, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows. Then the side wall, which is preferably embodied as thin, of the blind bore <b>114</b> can yield laterally with elastic deformation, when the head <b>126</b>, of widened cross section, of the driver pin <b>110</b> is inserted. It is understood that the driver pin <b>110</b> can be connected to the pedal lever <b>2</b> instead of to the sensor shaft <b>100</b> and can preferably be embodied integrally with it and received in a recess embodied in the sensor shaft <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The foregoing relates to preferred exemplary embodiments of the invention, it being understood that other variants and embodiments thereof are possible within the spirit and scope of the invention, the latter being defined by the appended claims.</p>
