<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Conveyor systems for storage and movement of goods on pallets and slip sheets. The transfer structures enable slip sheet mounted loads to be transferred to a roller conveyor by providing structures that cooperate with wide platen forks of a lift truck. The structures provide roller contact between a portion of the underside of the slip sheet at all times. In other areas there is alternatively contact between a lift truck platen or additional rollers that cooperate in a manner making it possible to move the slip sheet mounted load from the lift truck to an adjacent conveyor system.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to conveyor systems for storage and movement of goods on pallets and slip sheets and, in particular, to the use of slip sheets with roller conveyor systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Goods are stored and shipped throughout the world in relatively uniform size loads that rest on either pallets or thin plates of pasteboard or other durable material known as slip sheets. Slip sheets provide cost, weight, size and other advantages as compared to pallets but are not as stiff as pallets and must therefore be supported with contact over a larger portion of their undersides than pallets. Accordingly, while pallets can be lifted and transported by contact between relatively narrow regions of the pallet understructure and forks, such as conventional lift truck forks, much wider structures must be used to support slip sheets bearing loads. Transfer of loads resting on slip sheets therefore conventionally occurs by sliding the slip sheet and load between two locations by either pushing the slip sheet and load or pulling the slip sheet by grasping an edge of the slip sheet. There are numerous drawbacks associated with these activities.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a result, it is desirable to provide improved structures and means for transferring loads carried on slip sheets on to and off of roller conveyor systems.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, it is desirable to provide methods and apparatus for providing safety features for operating the roller conveyor systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The transfer structures of this invention enable slip sheet mounted loads to be transferred, for instance, from a lift truck to a roller conveyor by providing structures that cooperate with wide platen forks of a lift truck. The structures provide roller contact with at least a portion of the underside of the slip sheet at all times. In other areas there is alternatively contact between a lift truck platen or additional rollers that cooperate in a manner making it possible to move the slip sheet mounted load from the lift truck to an adjacent conveyor system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one aspect of this invention, a conveyor transfer structure for use with loads supported on a slip sheet includes fixed position rollers, movable position rollers, and a stop. The fixed position rollers provide contact with a slip sheet. The movable position rollers are movable between a first position supporting a portion of the slip sheet and a second position permitting lift platen contact with a portion of the slip sheet. The stop is movable between an elevated position and a depressed position. The elevated position permits slip sheet contact with the stop, and the depressed position permits lift platen contact with a portion of the movable position rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another aspect of this invention, a safety apparatus for use with a conveyor transfer structure comprising movable position rollers is provided. The apparatus includes a stop movable between an upper position and a lower position, wherein the lower position permits lift platen contact with the movable position rollers; and an indicator operably connected to the stop providing an indication of a position of the stop.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect of this invention, a method of using a transfer conveyor structure is provided. The method includes lifting a slip sheet mounted load with a lift platen; contacting a stop associated with the transfer conveyor structure with a portion of the platen, wherein the stop pivots to a lower position; receiving an indication of the lower position of the stop; contacting the platen with a portion of the movable position rollers associated with the transfer conveyor structure, wherein the movable position rollers pivot downward; lowering the slip sheet mounted load onto a portion of the fixed position rollers; and removing the platen from contact with the slip sheet mounted load, wherein a portion of the movable position rollers pivot upward to contact a portion of the slip sheet mounted load, and the stop pivots to an upper position.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to yet another aspect of this invention, a method of using a safety apparatus with a conveyor transfer structure for supporting a slip sheet mounted load is provided. The method includes depressing a stop associated with the conveyor transfer structure from an upper position to a lower position; and observing an indication from the safety apparatus that the stop is in the lower position.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">The present invention relates to transfer structures enabling slip sheet mounted loads to be transferred, for instance, from a lift truck to a roller conveyor by providing structures that cooperate with wide platen forks of a lift truck. The structures provide roller contact between at least a portion of the underside of the slip sheet at all times. In other areas there is alternatively contact between a lift truck platen or additional rollers that cooperate in a manner making it possible to move the slip sheet mounted load from the lift truck to an adjacent conveyor system. Furthermore, the present invention relates to an apparatus providing safety features for operating roller conveyor systems. Methods of using the transfer structures and apparatus are also described.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">FIRST EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">In the first embodiment of the transfer structure of this invention, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>, the transfer structure comprises a generally rectangular structure approximating the size of a conventional slip sheet. The transfer structure, as may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, includes: (1) fixed rollers positioned in the same plane as adjacent roller conveyor structure and (2) movable rollers that move, in response to the presence of lift truck platen, from a first position with the rollers in the same plane as the fixed rollers, to a second position that may or may not place the movable rollers in the same plane but that provides room for the lift truck platens.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> illustrate a first embodiment of this invention where the transfer structure <b>10</b> is mounted adjacent to conventional roller conveyor structure <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, fixed rollers <b>14</b> and <b>18</b> are located at the side edges and middle of transfer structure <b>10</b>. The tops of roller <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, and <b>18</b> are in the same plane as, and their rotational axes are parallel with, rollers <b>12</b> of the conventional conveyor structure. Pivotable rollers <b>20</b> are located on either side of rollers <b>16</b> and on the inner sides of rollers <b>14</b> and <b>18</b>. Each pivotable roller <b>20</b> is mounted on a housing <b>22</b>. As may be seen by reference to the fragmentary details shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the housing <b>22</b> is attached to a bracket <b>24</b> that pivots on a hinge bolt <b>26</b> that also passes through a mounting bracket <b>28</b> that is fastened to a roller support channel <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">Operation of the transfer structure embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> can be appreciated by comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>. A load mounted on a slip sheet resting on platens <b>32</b> is moved onto transfer structure <b>10</b> by advancement of platens <b>32</b> from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> outside of the transfer structure <b>10</b> to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> where platens <b>32</b> are positioned between the central fixed roller <b>16</b> and one or the other of rollers <b>14</b> and <b>18</b>. As platens <b>32</b> move into that position, their ends contact the housings <b>22</b> of pivotable rollers <b>20</b> and cause the housings to pivot from the positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with the rollers <b>20</b> parallel to rollers <b>12</b> to the positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in which rollers <b>20</b> are generally perpendicular to rollers <b>12</b>. After platens <b>32</b> and the load and slip sheet (not shown) move into the transfer structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, platens <b>32</b> are lowered until the slip sheet rests solely on rollers <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>20</b>, and platens <b>32</b> are withdrawn, allowing pivotable rollers <b>20</b> to pivot (under force from springs or other suitable structures not shown) to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in which the rotational axes of all rollers are parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">After the slip sheet and load are thus resting solely on the rollers of transfer structure <b>10</b>, the load can be pushed in the direction of conveyor rollers <b>12</b> and can move along the conveyor system in the conventional manner.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">As will be appreciated by one skilled in the conveyor art, the transfer structures of this invention can also be used for removal of a load resting on a slip sheet by movement of the load onto the transfer structure and use of the lift truck platens in steps that are reverse in order from the above description.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">SECOND EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> illustrate another embodiment of the transfer structure of this invention. In this embodiment <b>50</b>, hinged rollers <b>20</b> (structured in the same manner as hinged rollers <b>20</b> in embodiment <b>10</b> described above) are utilized. Fixed wheels <b>52</b> are located as illustrated in the center of embodiment <b>50</b> and, optionally, other fixed wheels or rollers (not shown) may be used, depending on the nature of the loads to be handled and their dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">Embodiment <b>50</b> also utilizes two sections of rollers <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> mounted in a manner so that they are biased by a spring, pneumatic cylinder, or other suitable structure normally to be in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. However, sections of rollers <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> may be caused to pivot downwards by platens <b>32</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>) so that platens <b>32</b> may lie on top of the sections of rollers <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">In operation of this embodiment <b>50</b>, the ends of platens <b>32</b> contact stop <b>58</b> as the platens move to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Stop <b>58</b> is coupled to support structure <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> for rollers <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>, respectively, causing support structures <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> to pivot to the right and downward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to positions out of the way of platens <b>32</b>, so that a load resting on a slip sheet in turn resting on platens <b>32</b> may be placed on or moved from transfer structure <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">As described above relative to the first embodiment (<b>10</b>) of this invention, the pivotable rollers <b>20</b> pivot. When the load is lifted off of transfer structure <b>50</b> or platens <b>32</b> are moved out from under the load and slip sheet, the pivotable rollers <b>20</b> pivot forward to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and the sections of rollers <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> move back and up to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, providing additional support for the slip sheet that remains on the transfer structure <b>50</b> or that is moved from the conveyor rollers <b>12</b> onto transfer structure <b>50</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">THIRD EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b> illustrate a third embodiment <b>90</b> of the transfer structure of this invention together with a load mounted on a slip sheet schematically illustrated as a load <b>92</b>. Transfer structure <b>90</b> utilizes relatively short fixed rollers <b>94</b>, <b>96</b>, and <b>98</b>, mounted parallel to rollers <b>12</b> of a conventional conveyor structure. Sliding rollers <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> also mounted parallel to conventional rollers <b>12</b> are fixed in rack frames <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. Each of frames <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> is mounted, as may be best appreciated by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, to travel down and under rollers <b>12</b> to provide room for platens <b>32</b> (not shown) during transfer of a slip sheet mounted load. Roller racks <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> may, for instance, rest on wheels <b>108</b> that travel in tracks <b>110</b>. Roller racks <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> are biased by springs, pneumatic cylinders, or other appropriate devices, to return to the positions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> after platens <b>32</b> have moved away from the transfer structure <b>90</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">FOURTH EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, and <b>18</b> illustrate a fourth embodiment <b>200</b> of the transfer structure of this invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a side perspective view, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a front perspective view of the embodiment <b>200</b>. In the embodiment <b>200</b> shown, fixed wheels <b>202</b> (structured in the same manner as fixed rollers <b>14</b> in embodiment <b>10</b> described above) are utilized. Fixed wheels <b>204</b> (similar to fixed wheels <b>52</b> in embodiment <b>50</b> described above) are located as illustrated in the center of embodiment <b>200</b>, and optionally, other fixed wheels or rollers (not shown) may be used, depending on the nature of the loads to be handled and their dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">Embodiment <b>200</b> also utilizes two sections of rollers <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> mounted in a manner so that they are biased by a spring, pneumatic cylinder, or other suitable structure normally to be in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. However, sections of rollers <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> may be caused to pivot downwards by platens (shown as <b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>) so that platens <b>32</b> may lie on top of at least a portion of the sections of rollers <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">The embodiment <b>200</b> also includes an indicator, such as a safety flag shown as <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, that alerts a fork lift driver or another user of a particular condition of the embodiment <b>200</b>. The safety flag is shown and described in greater detail below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref>, <b>16</b>, and <b>17</b>. An indicator can include, but is not limited to, a flag, a light, a sound, a tactile-type signal, a visual-type signal, an auditory-type signal, or any other type of signal. For example, an indicator can be a light controlled by a switch activated by the structure of the stop <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">In operation of this embodiment <b>200</b>, the ends of platens <b>32</b> contact stop <b>212</b> as the platens move towards the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Stop <b>212</b> is coupled to the safety flag <b>210</b> causing the safety flag <b>210</b> to pivot downward and to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to a position to alert a fork lift driver or another user of the condition of the stop <b>212</b>, i.e. in a lowered position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. When the safety flag <b>210</b> or other indication is in a lowered position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the safety flag <b>210</b> or other indication alerts a fork lift driver or other user to a condition where the stop <b>212</b> is sufficiently lowered to a position where a load previously adjacent to the stop <b>212</b> and already mounted on the embodiment <b>200</b> of the transfer structure could begin moving towards the ends of the platens <b>32</b>. The safety flag <b>210</b> or other indication also alerts the fork lift driver or other user to begin moving the platens towards the support structures <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> so that a slip sheet mounted load on the platens <b>32</b> can be placed on the embodiment <b>200</b> of the transfer structure and prevent a load previously adjacent to the stop <b>212</b> and already mounted on the embodiment <b>200</b> of the transfer structure from moving towards the ends of the platens <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">As the platens move further to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the ends of the platens contact the support structures <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> for sections of rollers <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>, respectively. The contact with the platens causes the support structures <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> to pivot to the right and downward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> to positions out of the way of platens <b>32</b>, so that a load resting on a slip sheet in turn resting on platens <b>32</b> may be placed on or moved from transfer structure <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">Similar to the sections of rollers <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> as described above relative to the second embodiment (<b>50</b>) of this invention, the sections of rollers <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> pivot. When the load is lifted off of transfer structure <b>200</b> or platens <b>32</b> are moved out from under the load and slip sheet, the sections of rollers <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> pivot back and up to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, providing additional support for the slip sheet that remains on the transfer structure <b>200</b> or that is moved from a series of conveyor rollers <b>218</b> onto transfer structure <b>200</b>.</p>

The section view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is taken through the safety flag <b>210</b> and stop <b>212</b> adjacent to the leading section of the transfer conveyor <b>200</b>, and through the conveyor rollers <b>218</b> adjacent to the trailing section of the conveyor <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">The stop <b>212</b> cooperates with the safety flag <b>210</b> to cause the safety flag to pivot and move downward. The stop <b>212</b> shown is a pivotable device that pivots downward when platens (shown as <b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of a fork lift contact the stop <b>212</b> and cause the safety flag <b>210</b> to pivot downward. When the platens <b>32</b> are no longer in contact with the stop <b>212</b>, the stop <b>212</b> pivots upward to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, permitting safety flag <b>210</b> to pivot up The stop <b>212</b> is shown and described in greater detail below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref>, <b>16</b>, and <b>17</b>.</p>

The pivot arm <b>402</b> rotates about pivot <b>414</b> just below the spring end <b>416</b> of the pivot arm. An expansion spring <b>404</b> is connected between spring end <b>416</b> of the pivot arm <b>402</b> and a pin <b>409</b> fixed to support structure <b>418</b> to bias end <b>412</b> upward and, this, stop <b>212</b> upright.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the safety flag <b>210</b> and stop <b>212</b> are shown in an upper or initial position. When a force is applied against the stop <b>212</b> in this position, for example, a lateral and/or downward force from a platen (shown as <b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the stop <b>212</b> rotates about the stop pivot mount <b>406</b>, urging stop arm <b>400</b> downward causing pivot arm <b>402</b> to rotate clockwise. The spring <b>404</b> to reacts to the force with an opposing force adjacent to the opposing end <b>418</b> of the pivot arm <b>402</b> as the pivot arm <b>402</b> rotates in response to the portion of the force from the stop arm <b>400</b>. The opposing force from the spring <b>404</b> increases until the stop <b>212</b> has reached a lower or horizontal position, in this example, caused by a platen <b>32</b> resting on a portion of the stop <b>212</b>. In this position, as may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a portion of the safety flag <b>210</b> is visible to a user, such as a fork lift driver, positioned at the leading end of the transfer structure <b>200</b>. In this manner, the safety flag <b>210</b> alerts the user that the stop <b>212</b> is at or near a lower or horizontal position, indicating that a slip sheet mounted load can be safely placed on the transfer structure <b>200</b>, or alternatively a slip sheet mounted load can be safely removed from the transfer structure <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">When the lateral and/or downward force from the platen <b>32</b> is removed from the stop <b>212</b>, the spring <b>404</b> causes the pivot arm <b>402</b> to rotate in a counterclockwise direction about the pivot arm mount <b>414</b> in the example shown. The rotation of the pivot arm <b>402</b> in the counterclockwise direction moves the stop arm <b>400</b> upward and causes the stop <b>212</b> to rotate about the stop pivot mount <b>406</b> until the stop <b>212</b> reaches the upper or initial position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In this position, the safety flag <b>210</b> should not be visible to a user, such as a fork lift driver, positioned at the leading end of the transfer structure <b>200</b> alerting the driver that the stop <b>212</b> can block the movement of a slip sheet mounted load moving towards the leading end of the transfer structure <b>200</b>.</p>

In these views, the roller structure pivots <b>500</b>, <b>502</b> mount to a section of rollers <b>208</b>, and the brake <b>504</b> mounts to the support structure <b>216</b> beneath a portion of the section of rollers <b>208</b>. Separate roller structure pivots <b>300</b>, <b>302</b> and a separate brake <b>304</b> mount to the other section of rollers <b>206</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The roller structure pivots <b>500</b>, <b>502</b> shown each include a pivot arm <b>506</b>, a pivot mount <b>508</b>, and a return spring <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the section of rollers <b>208</b> is attached to the upper end <b>512</b> of the pivot arm <b>506</b> such that the section of rollers <b>208</b> can move to the left (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) and down as pivot arm <b>506</b> moves from the vertical position shown toward a horizontal position. Return spring <b>510</b> connects between a lower portion of the support structure <b>216</b> and the pivot arm <b>506</b> to urge rollers <b>208</b> toward the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> with the rollers <b>208</b> co-planar with the fixed rollers <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 18</figref>, the pivot arm <b>506</b> and section of rollers <b>208</b> are shown in an upper or initial position.

The pivot arm <b>506</b> moves downward and transfers a portion of the force to the pivot mount <b>508</b>. The pivot mount <b>508</b> receives the portion of the force as the pivot arm <b>506</b> rotates about the pivot mount <b>508</b> in a counterclockwise direction in the example shown. As the pivot arm <b>506</b> rotates, the return spring <b>510</b> reacts to the force with an opposing force adjacent to the opposing end <b>514</b> of the pivot arm <b>504</b>. The opposing force from the return spring <b>510</b> increases until the section of rollers <b>208</b> has reached a lower position, in this example, caused by a platen <b>32</b> resting on a portion of the section of rollers <b>208</b>. In this position, a slip sheet mounted load can be placed on the section of rollers <b>208</b>, or alternatively a slip sheet mounted load can be removed from the section of rollers <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">While the section of rollers <b>208</b> is in a lower position, the return spring <b>510</b> maintains the opposing force on the opposing end <b>514</b> of the pivot arm <b>506</b>. When the lateral and/or downward force from the platen <b>32</b> is removed from the section of rollers <b>208</b>, the return spring <b>510</b> causes the pivot arm <b>506</b> to rotate in a clockwise direction with respect to the pivot mount <b>508</b> in the example shown. The rotation of the pivot arm <b>506</b> in the clockwise direction moves causes the section of rollers <b>208</b> to pivot upwards and to the right in the example shown until the section of rollers <b>208</b> reaches the upper or initial position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 18</figref>. In this position, the safety flag <b>210</b> should not be visible to a user, such as a fork lift driver, positioned at the leading end of the transfer structure <b>200</b>.

<p id="p-0051" num="0052">As will be appreciated by reference to the Figures and description of this invention above, the transfer structure <b>200</b> can be practiced in several alternative configurations including configurations not shown in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">In general, all such configurations can provide a transfer mechanism with multiple rollers for supporting a load mounted on a slip sheet so that the load can advance on rollers in the transfer mechanism to a conventional roller conveyor structure or can advance from a conventional roller conveyor structure to the rollers of the transfer mechanism. Some of the rollers or wheels of the transfer mechanism remain fixed in a plane that is substantially the same plane as the tops of adjacent rollers of the conventional roller conveyor. Other rollers, wheels, or other support structures are positioned and mounted to move from: (1) a first position where their support surfaces are in the same plane with the support surfaces of the fixed rollers, wheels or other support structures to (2) a second position permitting the platens of a lift truck to be positioned with their support surfaces in the same plane as the support surfaces of the fixed wheels or rollers. Other load bearing surfaces substitutable for rollers and wheels can be used in appropriate circumstances, including, for instance, low friction surfaces and conveyor belts among other alternatives.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">Various methods in accordance with embodiments of the present invention may be carried out. For example in one embodiment, a method of using a transfer conveyor structure includes lifting a slip sheet mounted load with a lift platen; contacting a stop associated with the transfer conveyor structure with a portion of the platen, wherein the stop pivots to a lower position; receiving an indication of the lower position of the stop; contacting the platen with a portion of the movable position rollers associated with the transfer conveyor structure, wherein the movable position rollers pivot downward; lowering the slip sheet mounted load onto a portion of the fixed position rollers; and removing the platen from contact with the slip sheet mounted load, wherein a portion of the movable position rollers pivot upward to contact a portion of the slip sheet mounted load, and the stop pivots to an upper position.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates an exemplary method <b>600</b> of using a conveyor transfer structure. This exemplary method is provided by way of example, as there are a variety of ways to carry out methods according to the present invention. The method <b>600</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> can be executed in conjunction with or otherwise performed with some or all conveyor transfer structures. The method <b>600</b> is described below as carried out by the transfer structure <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-18</figref> by way of example, and various elements of the transfer structure <b>200</b> are referenced in explaining the example method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">In block <b>602</b>, the method <b>600</b> begins with lifting a slip sheet mounted load with a lift platen. In the embodiment shown, the platens (shown as <b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of a fork lift are used to lift a slip sheet mounted load above a firm surface.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">Block <b>602</b> is followed by block <b>604</b>, in which a stop associated with the transfer conveyor structure contacts a portion of the platen, wherein the stop pivots to a lower position. In the embodiment shown, stop <b>212</b> pivots downward when a portion of the platen <b>32</b> contacts the stop <b>212</b>. The stop <b>212</b> pivots between the upper position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and the lower position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">Block <b>604</b> is followed by block <b>606</b>, in which an indication of the lower position of the stop is received. In the embodiment shown, the stop <b>212</b> is operably connected with an indicator such as the safety flag <b>210</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. When the stop <b>212</b> pivots to the lower position, the safety flag <b>210</b> provides an indication that the stop is in a lower position. The indication from the safety flag <b>210</b> can be viewed from a leading edge of the conveyor transfer structure <b>200</b>. In other embodiments of the invention, an indicator can be any of the example indicators described above, such as a light or a sound.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">Block <b>606</b> is followed by block <b>608</b>, in which the platen contacts a portion of the movable position rollers associated with the transfer conveyor structure, wherein the movable position rollers pivot downward. In the example shown, the platen <b>32</b> moves forward into contact with a portion of the movable position rollers <b>206</b> or <b>208</b>, such as the respective support structure <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>. The movable position rollers <b>206</b> or <b>208</b> pivot downward in response to contact with the platen <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">Block <b>608</b> is followed by block <b>610</b>, in which the slip sheet mounted load is lowered onto a portion of the fixed position rollers. In the example shown, the platen <b>32</b> is positioned over a portion of the movable position rollers <b>206</b> or <b>208</b>. As the platen <b>32</b> is lowered over the portion of the movable position rollers <b>206</b> or <b>208</b>, the movable position rollers <b>206</b> or <b>208</b> pivot downward, and the slip sheet mounted load on the platen <b>32</b> contacts a portion of the fixed rollers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">Block <b>610</b> is followed by block <b>612</b>, in which the platen is removed from contact with the slip sheet mounted load, wherein a portion of the movable position rollers pivot upward to contact a portion of the slip sheet mounted load, and the stop pivots to an upper position. In the embodiment shown, when the platen <b>32</b> is sufficiently lowered and the slip sheet mounted load is in contact with a portion of the fixed position rollers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, the platen <b>32</b> can be removed from beneath the slip sheet mounted load. As the platen <b>32</b> is removed and is no longer in contact with the portion of movable position rollers <b>206</b> or <b>208</b>, such as the support structure <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, the movable position rollers <b>206</b> or <b>208</b> pivot upward to contact a portion of the slip sheet mounted load. Removing the platen <b>32</b> causes an indicator such as the safety flag <b>210</b> to discontinue indicating the lower position of the stop as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">Another method <b>700</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention includes a method of using a safety apparatus with a conveyor transfer structure. The method <b>700</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> can be executed in conjunction with or otherwise performed with some or all conveyor transfer structures. The method <b>700</b> is described below as carried out by the transfer structure <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-18</figref> by way of example, and various elements of the transfer structure <b>200</b> are referenced in explaining the example method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">In block <b>702</b>, the method begins with depressing a stop associated with the conveyor transfer structure from an upper position to a lower position. In the embodiment shown, the indication is an indicator such as a safety flag <b>210</b> operably connected to the stop <b>212</b>. Stop <b>212</b> pivots downward when a portion of the platen <b>32</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) contacts the stop <b>212</b>. The stop <b>212</b> pivots between the upper position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and the lower position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In other embodiments of the invention, an indicator can be any of the example indicators described above, such as a light or a sound.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">Block <b>702</b> is followed by block <b>704</b>, in which an indication from the safety apparatus is observed that the stop is in the lower position. In the embodiment shown, when the stop <b>212</b> pivots to the lower position, the indicator such as the safety flag <b>210</b> provides an indication that the stop is in a lower position. The indication from the safety flag <b>210</b> can be viewed from a leading edge of the conveyor transfer structure <b>200</b>.</p>
