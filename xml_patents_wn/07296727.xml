<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">After detection of contact between respective solder bumps of an electronic component, sucked and held by a suction nozzle of a head tool, and respective solder portions of a circuit board, the solder bumps and the solder portions are melted by heating. Releasing of the electronic component from suction and holding by the suction nozzle of the head tool is performed, not at a time during solder melting, but at a time after the solder is melted, cooled and solidified. Thus, an electronic component mounting method and apparatus capable of mounting high-end electronic components having narrow-pitched bumps are provided.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for mounting electronic components onto a circuit board. More particularly, the invention relates to an electronic component mounting method and apparatus that makes it possible to mount such electronic components as IC chips having narrow pitched bumps onto a circuit board by performing a flip chip bonding method.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As electronic component mounting methods of this type, there have conventionally been known various methods. As an example of a conventional electronic component mounting method corresponding to the flip chip bonding method, is a method including steps of temporarily bonding a plurality of electronic components onto a circuit board and thereafter subjecting the electronic components collectively to reflow soldering, thus achieving electronic component mounting, (hereinafter, described as a collective reflow mounting method) as shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A-22D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>, solder paste is fed by printing or the like onto pads <b>84</b><i>a</i>, which are a plurality of electrodes on a top surface of a plate-like circuit board <b>84</b>, so that solder portions <b>82</b> are formed on the pads <b>84</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>84</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>, an electronic component <b>81</b>, to which solder bumps <b>81</b><i>b </i>are bonded at a plurality of electrodes <b>81</b><i>a </i>provided on a bonding surface of the electronic component <b>81</b>, is sucked and held at its rear surface, which has no electrodes <b>81</b><i>a </i>thereon, by a tool <b>83</b>. After a positional alignment that makes the solder bumps <b>81</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>81</b> bondable with the solder portions <b>82</b> on the circuit board <b>84</b>, respectively, the solder bumps <b>81</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>81</b> are pressed against the solder portions <b>82</b> of the circuit board <b>84</b>, respectively, thereby achieving their temporary bonding. For mounting of a plurality of electronic components <b>81</b> onto the circuit board <b>84</b>, these working steps are iteratively performed so that respective electronic components <b>81</b> are mounted onto the circuit board <b>84</b>. It is noted here that the terms, “temporary bonding,” refer to a bonding process such that the electronic component <b>81</b> and the circuit board <b>84</b> are releasable from their bonding by applying external force to the electronic component <b>81</b> or the circuit board <b>84</b> without breaking the electronic component <b>81</b> or the circuit board <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thereafter, the circuit board <b>84</b>, to which the electronic components <b>81</b> have been temporarily bonded, is conveyed to a reflow soldering working section. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref>, the electronic components <b>81</b> and the circuit board <b>84</b> are heated by a heat source in the reflow soldering working section, by which the solder portions <b>82</b> and the solder bumps <b>81</b><i>b </i>are melted. In a case where a plurality of electronic components <b>81</b> are temporarily bonded to the circuit board <b>84</b>, those electronic components <b>81</b> are collectively subjected to heat so as to melt the solder in this reflow soldering working section.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22D</figref>, with the circuit board <b>84</b> removed from the reflow soldering working section, molten solder is cooled and solidified, thereby achieving primary bonding of the electrodes <b>81</b><i>a </i>of each electronic component <b>81</b> to the pads <b>84</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>84</b>, respectively, via the solder, by which the electronic components <b>81</b> are collectively mounted onto the circuit board <b>84</b>. It is noted here that the terms, “primary bonding,” refer to a bonding process that is performed by melting the solder with heat applied to the temporarily bonded electronic component <b>81</b> and circuit board <b>84</b>, and by thereafter solidifying the solder, and this makes it hard to release a resulting bonded state by applying external force to the electronic component <b>81</b> or the circuit board <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In such a collective reflow mounting method, a multiplicity of electronic components <b>81</b>, after their temporary bonding, can be subjected to collective melting of solder, by which the electronic components <b>81</b> can be finally bonded and thereby mounted to the circuit board <b>84</b>. This allows for electronic-component mounting operations to be efficiently achieved. As a result, it has been a case in that costs of mounting the electronic components <b>81</b> onto the circuit board <b>84</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, for such a method, which includes steps for temporarily bonding of the electronic components <b>81</b> to the circuit board <b>84</b>, and thereafter performing their primary bonding by melting the solder, there is a need for conveying the circuit board <b>84</b>, to which the electronic components <b>81</b> have been temporarily bonded, to the reflow soldering working section. During this conveyance, a bonding position of each electronic component <b>81</b> relative to the circuit board <b>84</b> might be shifted due to vibrations or the like caused by the conveyance, in which case reflowing of the solder in such a shifted state might result in defective bonding of the electronic components <b>81</b> to the circuit board <b>84</b>. Such shifts of the bonding positions as would occur in the collective reflow mounting method would not matter for electronic components to which high precision for their bonding positions is not required, such as general-purpose electronic components. However, for some electronic components, such as IC chips, to which particularly high precision for their bonding positions is required, this would matter.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As an example of a conventional electronic component mounting method corresponding to a flip chip bonding method intended to solve such issues of the collective reflow mounting method as described above, a method including the step of simultaneously heating and pressing electronic components onto a circuit board to thereby subject the electronic components individually to reflow soldering, thus achieving electronic component mounting, (hereinafter, described as a conventional local reflow mounting method) is shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A-23D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, solder paste is fed by printing or the like onto pads <b>94</b><i>a</i>, which are a plurality of electrodes on a top surface of a plate-like circuit board <b>94</b>, so that solder portions <b>92</b> are formed on the pads <b>94</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>94</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>, an electronic component <b>91</b> to which solder bumps <b>91</b><i>b </i>are bonded at a plurality of electrodes <b>91</b><i>a </i>provided on a bonding surface of the electronic component <b>91</b>, is sucked and held at its rear surface, which has no electrodes <b>91</b><i>a </i>thereon, by a tool <b>93</b>. After performing a positional alignment that makes the solder bumps <b>91</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>91</b> bondable with the solder portions <b>92</b> on the circuit board <b>94</b>, respectively, the solder bumps <b>91</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>91</b> are, while heated, pressed against the solder portions <b>92</b> of the circuit board <b>94</b>, respectively, by which the solder portions <b>92</b> and the solder bumps <b>911</b><i>b </i>are melted.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23C</figref>, while solder is maintained in a molten state, suction and holding of the electronic component <b>91</b> by the tool <b>93</b> is released. As a result of this, a self alignment effect by surface tension of the molten solder is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23D</figref>, by solidifying the molten solder, the electrodes <b>91</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>91</b> are bonded to the pads <b>94</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>94</b>, respectively, via the solder, by which the electronic component <b>91</b> is individually mounted onto the circuit board <b>94</b>. In addition, for mounting of a plurality of electronic components <b>91</b> onto the circuit board <b>94</b>, these working steps are iteratively performed so that respective electronic components <b>91</b> are mounted onto the circuit board <b>94</b>, individually.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In such a local reflow mounting method, the electronic component <b>91</b> is sucked and held by the tool <b>93</b>, the solder bumps <b>91</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>91</b> are pressed against the solder portions <b>92</b> of the circuit board <b>94</b> while the solder bumps <b>91</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>92</b> are heated, respectively, by the tool <b>93</b>, and thereafter suction and holding of the electronic component <b>91</b> by the tool <b>93</b> is released while the solder is in the molten state. As a result, a self alignment effect by the surface tension of the molten solder is obtained. Thus, even with more or less poor precision of a bonding position of the electronic component <b>91</b> by the tool <b>93</b>, a precision of a bonding position that would not result in defective bonding eventually could be obtained by the self alignment effect.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, in a case of high-end electronic components of narrowed bump pitches, from among such electronic components as IC chips, with their bump pitch being as narrow as, for example, not more than 150 μm, it is required for electronic components having bumps of such narrow pitches to meet a high precision for a bonding position of, for example, ±5 μm, which would concern a bonding-position shift amount of an electronic component due to a vacuum break blow occurring at releasing of the suction and holding of the electronic component during solder melting, more than the self alignment effect would be concerned in the local reflow mounting method. Therefore, the above-described electronic component mounting performed by the local reflow mounting method, in which suction and holding of an electronic component by the tool is released during a solder's molten state, has had an issue of incapability of mounting high-end electronic components which have bumps of such narrow pitches as shown above and to which high precision for a bonding position is required.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to solve the above-described issues and provide an electronic-component mounting method and apparatus which are capable of mounting high-end electronic components having narrow-pitch bumps, and moreover, which are intended for mounting of electronic components onto a circuit board on which general-purpose electronic components and high-end electronic components are to be mixedly mounted. The method and apparatus allow both productivity and quality to be satisfied by changing a method to be used for individual electronic components depending on precision of a bonding position required for individual electronic components.</p>

The pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b> are placed at positions corresponding to the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b>, respectively, so that the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b> can be bonded together. In this case, the electronic component <b>1</b> is, for example, a high-end electronic component to which high precision of a bonding position is required, such as a high-end IC chip having a 150 μm or less bump pitch, which is an interval pitch of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>formed on the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component. In addition, the circuit board <b>4</b> may be any one of such circuit boards as resin boards, paper-phenol boards, ceramic boards, glass epoxy boards and film boards, or such circuit blocks as single layer boards or multilayer boards, or such object articles having circuits formed thereon as component parts, casings or frames.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Next, the method for mounting the electronic component <b>1</b> onto the circuit board <b>4</b> by using the electronic component mounting apparatus <b>201</b> is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the slide base <b>6</b>, to which is fixed the component tray <b>5</b> with a multiplicity of electronic components <b>1</b> fed thereto and placed thereon, is moved in the Y<b>1</b> or Y<b>2</b> direction by the Y-direction moving mechanism <b>23</b>, and moreover the head tool <b>3</b> is moved in the X<b>1</b> or X<b>2</b> direction by the X-direction moving mechanism <b>22</b>, by which the head tool <b>3</b> is aligned with one electronic component <b>1</b> placed in the component tray <b>5</b> so that this electronic component <b>1</b> becomes suckable by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> provided at the tip portion of the head tool <b>3</b>. Thereafter, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, thereby sucking and holding the electronic component <b>1</b> at its rear surface, that has no electrodes <b>1</b><i>a</i>, by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b>. Then, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved up by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, and the electronic component <b>1</b> is removed from the component tray <b>5</b>. It is noted that although the electronic component <b>1</b> is placed with its rear surface up in the component tray <b>5</b> in the above-described case, a case may be that the electronic component <b>1</b> is placed with its rear surface down, in which case also, suction and holding of the electronic component <b>1</b> at its rear surface by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is enabled by providing an inversion mechanism for inverting the electronic component <b>1</b> before the suction and holding of the electronic component <b>1</b> to the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b>. In addition, a case may also be that with a wafer feed section provided, the electronic components <b>1</b> are fed from wafers instead of a feed of the electronic components <b>1</b> from the component tray <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the slide base <b>6</b>, to which is fixed the stage <b>7</b> with the circuit board <b>4</b> fixed thereon, is moved in the Y<b>1</b> or Y<b>2</b> direction by the Y-direction moving mechanism <b>23</b>, and moreover the head tool <b>3</b> with the electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held thereto is moved in the X<b>1</b> or X<b>2</b> direction by the X-direction moving mechanism <b>22</b>, by which the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b> are aligned with each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, so that the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>formed on the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> become bondable to the solder portions <b>2</b> on the pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, by which the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> are put into contact with the solder portions <b>2</b>, respectively, of the circuit board <b>4</b> fixed to the stage <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">After this contact, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is heated by the ceramic heater <b>12</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> so that the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>11</b>, as well as the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> kept in contact with these solder bumps, are heated. Further, a heating temperature for the suction nozzle <b>11</b> by the ceramic heater <b>12</b> is increased to a temperature not less than a melting point of solder forming the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and not less than a melting point of solder forming the solder portions <b>2</b>, and thus the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b> are melted. As to an atmosphere for such melting process, whereas the melting process is performed in air of an environment under which the electronic component mounting apparatus <b>201</b> is installed (e.g., clear air), a case may alternatively be that the atmosphere is an inert gas atmosphere (e.g., N2 atmosphere) to obtain a successful molten state.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, with the heating by the ceramic heater <b>12</b> stopped, molten solder is subjected to cooling by blows from the cooling blow nozzle <b>19</b>, with the solder being thereby solidified so that the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b> are bonded together, respectively, via the solder. Alternatively, the solder may also be solidified by natural cooling of the molten solder, instead of the forced cooling of the molten solder by the cooling blow nozzle <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, the sucking and holding of the electronic component <b>1</b> by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> at the tip portion of the head tool <b>3</b> is released, and the head tool <b>3</b> is moved up by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>. In addition, for mounting of a plurality of electronic components <b>1</b> onto the circuit board <b>4</b>, these working steps are iteratively performed for each electronic component <b>1</b> so that respective electronic components <b>1</b> are mounted onto the circuit board <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Although the above description has been made for a case where the bonding members are the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>preliminarily formed on the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> as well as the solder portions <b>2</b> preliminarily formed on the pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b>, the bonding members may also be only the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>preliminarily formed on the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Furthermore, flux that can remove surface oxide films at individual bonding portions and enhance wettability of molten solder may preliminarily be supplied by coating the flux onto the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> or onto the pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b>, or onto the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>or the solder portions <b>2</b>, which are both the bonding members. In addition, depending on a type of flux supplied by coating, there are some cases where the flux supplied by coating is removed by cleaning after mounting of the electronic component <b>1</b> onto the circuit board <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Next, the structure of the head tool <b>3</b> in the electronic component mounting apparatus <b>201</b> is explained in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which is a sectional view schematically showing the structure of the head tool <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the head tool <b>3</b> includes a head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>for performing sucking and holding, and heating or other operations on the electronic component <b>1</b>, and a head-tool body portion <b>3</b><i>b </i>for supporting the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>and exercising up-and-down operations on the head tool <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>includes, as viewed from its tip side, the suction nozzle <b>11</b> capable of sucking and holding the electronic component <b>1</b>, the ceramic heater <b>12</b> for heating the electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>11</b>, a water jacket <b>13</b> which is a cooling part for intercepting heat so that heat derived from the ceramic heater <b>12</b> is not transferred to the head-tool body portion <b>3</b><i>b</i>, and a shaft <b>17</b> which is an example of a shaft portion fitted to an upper portion of the water jacket <b>13</b>. The cooling blow nozzle <b>19</b> for cooling by blowing the electronic component <b>1</b> heated by the ceramic heater <b>12</b> is further fitted around a periphery of a lower-portion of the shaft <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The head-tool body portion <b>3</b><i>b </i>includes a frame <b>16</b>, which is an example of a support portion, for supporting the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>and a load cell <b>14</b>, which is an example of a load detector portion on the frame <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The frame <b>16</b>, which is formed of a rigid body into a generally U shape, includes an upper frame <b>16</b><i>a </i>for supporting the load cell <b>14</b>, a lower frame <b>16</b><i>b </i>for supporting the shaft <b>17</b> of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>via a self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b>, which is an example of an elastic member, fitted to a lower portion of an annular-protrusion shaped spring holder portion <b>18</b> provided at a side portion of the shaft <b>17</b> so as to surround an outer periphery of the shaft <b>17</b>, and a cylindrical-shaped intermediate frame <b>16</b><i>c </i>for supporting the upper frame <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the lower frame <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The lower frame <b>16</b><i>b </i>further serves for guiding up-and-down motions of the shaft <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The shaft <b>17</b> has a stepped portion <b>17</b><i>c </i>nearly intermediate of its axial direction, wherein with the stepped portion <b>17</b><i>c </i>serving as a boundary, the shaft <b>17</b> has a shaft lower portion <b>17</b><i>b </i>smaller in diameter than a shaft upper portion <b>17</b><i>a</i>. Further, this shaft lower portion <b>17</b><i>b </i>extends through a hole <b>16</b><i>d </i>formed in the lower frame <b>16</b><i>b </i>supporting the shaft <b>17</b> via the self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b>, wherein the hole <b>16</b><i>d </i>of the lower frame <b>16</b><i>b </i>is formed so as to be capable of guiding up-and-down motions of the shaft <b>17</b>, and is smaller in diameter than the shaft upper portion <b>17</b><i>a</i>. As a result of this, the shaft <b>17</b> can be guided by the hole <b>16</b><i>d </i>of the lower frame <b>16</b><i>b </i>to move up and down while supported by the lower frame <b>16</b><i>b </i>via the self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b>. Also, even if the self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b> has become no longer capable of supporting the shaft <b>17</b> due to damage or the like, a peripheral portion of the hole <b>16</b><i>d </i>of the lower frame <b>16</b><i>b </i>can support the shaft <b>17</b> by the stepped portion <b>17</b><i>c </i>of the shaft <b>17</b> so that the shaft <b>17</b> is prevented from falling off.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Further, the shaft lower portion <b>17</b><i>b </i>has a ball-spline outer ring and a shaft, and the lower frame <b>16</b><i>b </i>has a bearing inside the hole <b>16</b><i>d</i>, wherein the ball-spline outer ring is fitted inside the bearing. Thus, the shaft <b>17</b> can be rotated about its axis while being supported by the lower frame <b>16</b><i>b</i>, and also be made to move up-and-down in an axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The intermediate frame <b>16</b><i>c </i>is cylindrical at both ends, which ends are fixed to nut portions <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>. Rotating a ball screw shaft <b>21</b><i>a</i>, screwed to the nut portions <b>21</b><i>b</i>, by a motor <b>21</b><i>m </i>in the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> causes the intermediate frame <b>16</b><i>c </i>to be operated so as to move up and down, by which the frame <b>16</b> is operated to move up and down, by which the head tool <b>3</b> as a whole is operated to move up and down.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Also, the suction nozzle <b>11</b>, the ceramic heater <b>12</b>, the water jacket <b>13</b>, the shaft <b>17</b> and the load cell <b>14</b> have their centers positioned coaxially on one axis that is positioned parallel to the axis of up/down operations. Thus, by the up/down operations performed by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, the suction nozzle <b>11</b>, the ceramic heater <b>12</b>, the water jacket <b>13</b>, the shaft <b>17</b> and the load cell <b>14</b> are up-and-down movable on the same axis.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Further, an upper end of the shaft <b>17</b> in the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is pressed into contact with a load-detecting surface, which is a lower surface of the load cell <b>14</b>, by the self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b>, which is fitted to the lower frame <b>16</b><i>b </i>to support the shaft <b>17</b> via the spring holder portion <b>18</b>, thus making it possible for the load cell <b>14</b> to detect a load that acts upwardly of the shaft <b>17</b> of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Also, the cooling blow nozzle <b>19</b> fitted to the periphery of the shaft lower portion <b>17</b><i>b</i>, which is a lower periphery of the shaft <b>17</b>, is formed around both sides of the water jacket <b>13</b> and the ceramic heater <b>12</b>, which are positioned under the shaft <b>17</b>. Further, the tip of the cooling blow nozzle <b>19</b> is directed toward an electronic-component suction and holding surface, i.e. lower surface, of the suction nozzle <b>11</b>, so that a blow from the cooling blow nozzle <b>19</b> can cool the electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The control part <b>9</b> controls sucking operation of the suction nozzle <b>11</b>, heating operation of the ceramic heater <b>12</b> and moving operation of the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, and a load detected by the load cell <b>14</b> is outputted to the control part <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Now a control system diagram for the electronic component mounting apparatus <b>201</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Referring to the electronic component mounting apparatus <b>201</b>, the control part <b>9</b> controls operations of individual constituent parts of the electronic component mounting apparatus <b>201</b>, i.e., up/down operations of the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> by the motor <b>21</b><i>m</i>, heating operation of the ceramic heater <b>12</b>, cooling operation of the cooling blow nozzle <b>19</b>, sucking operation of the suction nozzle <b>11</b>, moving operation of the X-direction moving mechanism <b>22</b> by a motor, and moving operation of the Y-direction moving mechanism <b>23</b> by a motor, and further a load detected by the load cell <b>14</b> is outputted to the control part <b>9</b>. As a result of this, the constituent parts, which are controlled parts for the control part <b>9</b>, are controlled correlatively by the control part <b>9</b>, by which mounting of the electronic components <b>1</b> onto the circuit board <b>4</b> is fulfilled in the electronic component mounting apparatus <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Next, a method for detecting a contact load generated upon contact between the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b>, by the load cell <b>14</b> in the head tool <b>3</b>, is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">After alignment between the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b>, while the electronic component <b>1</b> is kept sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>11</b>, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, by which the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> are put into contact with the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, respectively. In this state, there arises a contact load between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, wherein this contact load causes the upper end of the shaft <b>17</b> of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a</i>, in contact with the load-detecting surface of the load cell <b>14</b> of the head tool <b>3</b>, to push up the load-detecting surface of the load cell <b>14</b>, resulting in the contact load being detected by the load cell <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">By detecting the contact load in the load cell <b>14</b> in this way, occurrence of contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> is detected. Moreover, the contact load detected by the load cell <b>14</b> is outputted to the control part <b>9</b>, while the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> is controlled by the control part <b>9</b> so as to obtain a contact load preset in the control part <b>9</b>, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down to a small amount by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, and the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> is controlled so that the contact load detected by the load cell <b>14</b> becomes a preset contact load.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">As to the electronic component mounting method according to the first embodiment which is constituted and performed by the mounting procedure as described above (hereinafter, this method will be referred to as a local reflow mounting method of the first embodiment, since melting, i.e., reflow is performed individually for each electronic component), its mounting procedure is comprehensively given in a flowchart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. It is noted that operational instructions at individual steps are implemented by the control part <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">At step SP<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the electronic component <b>1</b> is sucked and held by the head tool <b>3</b>. At step SP<b>2</b>, a positional alignment between the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b> is performed so that the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>formed on the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> formed on the pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b> become bondable with each other. Thereafter, at step SP<b>3</b>, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down while maintaining sucking and holding of the electronic component <b>1</b>. At step SP<b>4</b>, contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> is detected by the load cell <b>14</b> of the head tool <b>3</b>. Further, at step SP<b>5</b>, by heating of the electronic component <b>1</b> with the ceramic heater <b>12</b> of the head tool <b>3</b>, the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> are melted. Subsequently, at step SP<b>6</b>, cooling by blow of the cooling blow nozzle <b>19</b> onto the molten solder is started. At step SP<b>7</b>, the molten solder is solidified so that the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> are bonded to the pads <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b>, respectively, via the solder. Subsequently, at step SP<b>8</b>, suction and holding of the electronic component <b>1</b> by the head tool <b>3</b> is released. In addition, for mounting of a plurality of electronic components <b>1</b> onto the circuit board <b>4</b>, these steps SP<b>1</b> to SP<b>8</b> as described above are iteratively performed for each electronic component <b>1</b> to fulfill mounting of these respective electronic components <b>1</b>. Further, in other cases, cooling of the molten solder at step SP<b>6</b> may be implemented by natural cooling instead of cooling by blow of the cooling blow nozzle <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Next, in a case where correction of an elongation amount and shrinkage amount of the head tool <b>3</b> due to heat is performed, this correction operation is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">After contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, when the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is heated by the ceramic heater <b>12</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> so that the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b> are melted, at least the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>in the head tool <b>3</b> is elongated in the up/down direction under an effect of heat derived from the ceramic heater <b>12</b>, and further, when heating by the ceramic heater <b>12</b> is stopped, the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is shrunk in the up/down direction with an effect of heat being eliminated. Because of such up/down elongation and shrinkage of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a</i>, during a period from contact to bonding of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, it may become, in some cases, difficult to maintain generally constant a rear-face height of the electronic component <b>1</b> having the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>kept in contact with the electrodes <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b> via the solder portions <b>2</b> and the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0182" num="0181">With a view to fulfilling reliable rear-face height control for the electronic components <b>1</b>, the elongation-amount and shrinkage-amount correction of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is performed during the following procedure. That is, variation data of elongation amount and shrinkage amount due to heat of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>are preliminarily set to a memory in the control part <b>9</b>, and the control part <b>9</b> performs control over the ceramic heater <b>12</b>, the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> and the cooling blow nozzle <b>19</b>. During heating by the ceramic heater <b>12</b>, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved up gradually by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> based on the variation data of elongation amount of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>due to the heating. After a stoppage of the heating by the ceramic heater <b>12</b>, and during cooling by the cooling blow nozzle <b>19</b>, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down gradually by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> based on the variation data of shrinkage amount of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>due to the cooling. Thus, the correction of elongation amount and shrinkage amount of the head-tool tip portion due to heat is fulfilled. As a result of this, the rear-face height of the electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> can be maintained constant during a period from contact to bonding between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>. Otherwise, the correction of elongation amount or shrinkage amount of the head tool <b>3</b> due to heat may alternatively be a correction of only either one of the elongation-amount correction or the shrinkage-amount correction, wherein a decision as to whether the correction is performed or not is made depending on the required bonding precision of the electronic component <b>1</b> onto the circuit board <b>4</b>, or a number of solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>formed on the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0194" num="0193">During step SP<b>4</b>, upon detection of contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions of the circuit board <b>4</b>, there are some cases where some of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b> are not in contact with one another because of variations in a formation height of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b>. An example is an electronic component <b>1</b> on which as many as one thousand or more bumps are formed. In such a case, when the electronic component <b>1</b> is heated as it is, there would occur a problem in that non-contacted solder portions <b>2</b> do not conduct heat from the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b</i>, and therefore are not melted.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">With respect to such a problem, in the constant-load control of the head tool <b>3</b> at step SP<b>5</b><i>a</i>, the constant load is set to a load not less than a contact load for contact detection, and the set load is, under constant control, applied to the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b>. By so doing, even if some of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b> are not in contact with one another because of variations in a formation height of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b> as described the above, upon detection of contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions of the circuit board <b>4</b>, it is implementable to enhance contactability between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b> by applying the above-mentioned constant load, by which all the solder pieces can be melted reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Next described is a case where a load zero setting of the load cell <b>14</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Heat generated by heating of the ceramic heater <b>12</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> is transferred by heat conduction from individual constituent parts of the head tool <b>3</b> or heat conduction through ambient air of the head tool <b>3</b>, so that the self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b> fitted to the spring holder portion <b>18</b> of the shaft <b>17</b> at the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>changes in its spring characteristics under influence of this heat. This results in a change of a pressing load in the load cell <b>14</b> generated by the self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b>, which has changed in its spring characteristics, pressing the shaft <b>17</b> against the load-detecting surface of the load cell <b>14</b>. Further, this pressing load in the load cell <b>14</b> by the self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b> also changes due to secular changes in the spring characteristics of the self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b> depending on duration of use of the head tool <b>3</b>. By this change in the pressing load in the load cell <b>14</b> due to the change in the spring characteristics of the self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b>, there occurs a difference between an actual pressing load upon contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> and a contact-load value detected by the load cell <b>14</b>, resulting in a problem that an actual contact load cannot be controlled in accordance with a preset contact load.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">In such a case, after the electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held by the head tool <b>3</b> is aligned so as to be bondable with the circuit board <b>4</b>, a pressing load, with which the shaft <b>17</b> at the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is pressed against the load-detecting surface of the load cell <b>14</b> by the self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b> in a noncontact state of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b>, is detected by the load cell <b>14</b>, and this detected pressing load is outputted to the control part <b>9</b>. In the control part <b>9</b>, this pressing load is set as a load-zero point in the load cell <b>14</b>. Subsequently, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down, so that mounting of the electronic component <b>1</b> onto the circuit board <b>4</b> is performed. All these steps are performed under control of the control part <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Therefore, even in a case where a pressing load by the shaft <b>17</b> at the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>changes in the load cell <b>14</b> because of changes of the spring characteristics of the self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b> under influence of heat or secular changes, a pressing load detected in the control part <b>9</b> is set to a load-zero point in the load cell <b>14</b> each time alignment between the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b> is performed, which eliminates any difference between an actual contact load upon contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, and a detected value of a load detected by the load cell <b>14</b>, thus allowing control of the actual contact load in accordance with a preset contact load to be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Next described is a method for controlling up/down movement operations of the head tool <b>3</b> to thereby control a contact load to a preset contact load, based on detection of a contact load due to the head tool <b>3</b> upon contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> by virtue of the load cell <b>14</b> of the head tool <b>3</b>, with reference to contact-load control operation flowcharts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> on a basis of a working example.

<p id="p-0201" num="0200">After alignment between the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b>, the head tool <b>3</b> sucking and holding the electronic component <b>1</b> starts to be moved down by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> at step SP<b>3</b>. During this downward movement of the head tool <b>3</b>, it is decided at step SP<b>21</b> whether or not a preset contact load is beyond 450 g. If the preset contact load is beyond 450 g, an initial detected load due to contact is set to 200 g at step SP<b>22</b>. If the preset contact load is not more than 450 g, the initial detected load due to the contact is set to 100 g at step SP<b>23</b>. Next, at step SP<b>24</b>, the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> come into contact with each other, wherein a set initial detected load is detected by the load cell <b>14</b>. Then, at step SP<b>25</b>, the head tool <b>3</b> that has been moving down is stopped so as to be kept in an operation standby state for 200 ms; that is, kept in a static state so as to eliminate any effects on the detected load of the load cell <b>14</b> by the head tool <b>3</b> moving down by a small overshoot after a stop operation of the head tool <b>3</b>, i.e., by the head tool <b>3</b> moving down by a small amount after a move-down operational instruction from the control part <b>9</b> to over a period from deceleration of a move-down speed of the head tool <b>3</b> until its stopping.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Next, it is decided at step SP<b>26</b> whether or not a current load detected by the load cell <b>14</b> is beyond the preset contact load −100 g, wherein it is decided how close the current load is to the preset contact load.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">If it has been determined at step SP<b>26</b> that the current load is over the preset contact load −100 g, the head tool <b>3</b> is subjected to a static state for 200 ms at step SP<b>27</b>.

If the current load is less than the preset contact load −50 g, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down by 1 μm by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> at step SP<b>29</b>, and the head tool <b>3</b> is subjected to a static state for 200 ms at step SP<b>27</b>. Thereafter, it is decided again at step SP<b>28</b> whether or not the current load is not less than the preset contact load −50 g. This operational loop is iteratively performed until the current load becomes not less than the preset contact load −50 g.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">If the current load is not less than the preset contact load −50 g at step SP<b>28</b>, then the head tool <b>3</b> is kept in a static state for a preset time period at step SP<b>30</b>, wherein control of a contact load between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> toward the preset contact load is completed. Then, a result at step SP<b>4</b> is that contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> has been detected. It is noted here that the preset contact load −50 g, which is a decision criterion in step SP<b>28</b>, is a contact load which is expected to occur upon contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>. When a current load, which is a load that actually occurs upon contact, becomes not less than a contact load that is expected to occur upon contact, generally all of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and generally all of the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> come into a contact state, thus resulting in detection of contact.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Otherwise, if the current load is not more than the preset contact load −100 g at step SP<b>26</b>, it is further decided at step SP<b>31</b> whether or not the current load is beyond the preset contact load −500 g, wherein if not, it is further decided at step SP<b>32</b> whether or not the current load is beyond the preset contact load −1000 g in a stepwise manner. If the current load is not more than the preset contact load −1000 g at step SP<b>32</b>, a load difference between the current load and the preset contact load is converted into a movement distance of the head tool <b>3</b> at step SP<b>33</b>. Also, in a case where the current load has satisfied the condition of step SP<b>31</b>, the movement distance of the head tool <b>3</b> is set to 1 μm at step SP<b>34</b>. In a case where the current load has satisfied the condition of step SP<b>32</b>, the movement distance of the head tool <b>3</b> is set to 2 mm at step SP<b>35</b>. Thereafter, at step SP<b>36</b>, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> to an extent corresponding to movement distance of the head tool <b>3</b> in either case as shown above. At step SP<b>37</b>, the head tool <b>3</b> is stopped and kept in a static state for 50 ms. Thereafter, it is decided again at step SP<b>26</b> whether or not the current load is beyond the preset contact load −100 g. The loop of these operations is iteratively performed until this condition of step SP<b>26</b> is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">In the contact-load control method performed by the operations as described above, the head tool <b>3</b> is controlled for its minute move-down operation. Respective movement distances of the head tool <b>3</b> under respective operational conditions are set based on a relationship between an up/down minimum movable distance of the head tool <b>3</b> by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> and a load per head-tool unit movement that can be generated by this minimum movable distance. In the above working example, the minimum movable distance is 1 μm, and the load per head-tool unit movement is 100 g/μm. Accordingly, for example, the difference of 100 g between preset contact load and current load, which is the condition of step SP<b>26</b>, is set based on the load per head-tool unit movement. Also at step SP<b>29</b>, step SP<b>34</b> and step SP<b>35</b>, movement distances of the head tool <b>3</b>, 1 μm and 2 μm, are set based on minimum movable distances, respectively.</p>

As a pattern of this vibrational operation in the reshaping operation performed by the head tool <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9D</figref>, such patterns are available as a cross type (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>), an O type (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>), and 8-letter types (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9C and 9D</figref>) ones as have been used in conventional electronic component mounting methods. Further, as parameters to be used for respective vibrational operations in the reshaping operation performed by the head tool <b>3</b>, a number of reshaping-operation up/down moves for moving up and down the head tool <b>3</b> during the reshaping operation is 0 to 20 times as an example, an operating speed for moving up and down the head tool <b>3</b> during the reshaping operation is 0.1 to 9.9 seconds as an example, an operating amount, that is a movement amount for moving up and down the head tool <b>3</b> in the reshaping operation, is −99 to 99 μm as an example, and a number of reshaping vibrational operations for vibrating the head tool <b>3</b> in the X and Y directions during the reshaping operation is 0 to 200 times as an example.</p>

<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Subsequently, during a period from time t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b>, the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b> come into contact with each other at time t<b>1</b>, and heating of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is started by the ceramic heater <b>12</b>, by which temperature of the suction nozzle <b>111</b> is increased. Since a correction operation of elongation amount of the head tool <b>3</b> due to this temperature increase is performed, the control height of the head tool <b>3</b> is increased as previously set. The head tool <b>3</b> that has been subjected to the elongation-amount correctional operation becomes constant in the tip height of the suction nozzle <b>11</b>. During this period from time t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b>, solder melting is started.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Subsequently, during a period from t<b>2</b> to t<b>4</b>, the temperature of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is controlled by heating of the ceramic heater <b>12</b> so as to be maintained at a constant temperature.

<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Subsequently, during the period from time t<b>4</b> to t<b>5</b>, cooling of molten solder is started, and the temperature of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> falls.

The head tool <b>3</b> that has been subjected to the shrinkage-amount correctional operation becomes constant in the tip height of the suction nozzle <b>11</b>. During this period from time t<b>4</b> to t<b>5</b>, the molten solder is solidified.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Finally, at time t<b>5</b>, suction and holding of the electronic component <b>1</b> by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> is released, and thereafter the head tool <b>3</b> is moved up by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, so that the control height of the head tool <b>3</b> as well as the tip height of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> go up in similar variation states.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Further, a working example which is more concretely embodied according to a modification example of the embodiment of operations of the head tool <b>3</b> as described above is described below. Also, time charts showing time-varying states of the tip height of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b>, temperature of the suction nozzle <b>11</b>, and load detected by the load cell <b>14</b> under loading by the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b> due to downward movement of the head tool <b>3</b>, respectively, are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. Further, schematic explanatory views showing states of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b> at singular time points of the time charts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A-24E</figref>, respectively. In addition, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the horizontal axis is given as a time axis, wherein times Ta-Th are shown as respective singular time points in the above-mentioned varying states, while the vertical axis shows the tip height of the suction nozzle <b>11</b>, the temperature of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> and the load detected by the load cell <b>14</b>, in an order from above to below.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>, after the electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is aligned with a mounting position of the circuit board <b>4</b>, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down so that the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is moved down to a search start height as its tip height (time Ta in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>). It is noted here that the term “search start height” refers to a height at which detection of contact between individual solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and individual solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, respectively, is started by load detection of the load cell <b>14</b>. Also, the temperature of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is maintained at a temperature of, for example, about 100° C. by being heated by the ceramic heater <b>12</b> so that temperatures that do not cause melting of the individual solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> can be maintained with a view to reducing as much as possible a temperature increase time for later solder melting. Thereafter, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down at a move-down speed previously set in the control part <b>9</b> or the like, by which the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is moved down.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">When the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is moved down, some of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> come into contact with the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>, wherein a load due to this contact is detected in the load cell <b>14</b>. When this detected load has reached a preset contact load (e.g., 1 N), it is decided that contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b> has been detected, wherein contact load detection is ended (time Tb in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>). This occurrence of contact between some of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and some of the solder portions <b>2</b> is due to the fact that, for example, the individual solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> are formed of high-temperature solder, varying in their formation height in some cases. Further, since the individual solder portions <b>2</b> are formed by plating with, for example, eutectic solder on the pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b>, respectively, the solder portions <b>2</b> may also vary in their formation height in some cases. Otherwise, another case may be one in which the individual solder portions <b>2</b> are formed by printing with solder paste, instead of being formed by plating as shown above. Accordingly, in a state that contact has been detected, this case is not that all the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and all the solder portions <b>2</b> are necessarily in contact with each other, but that, for example, only some solder portions <b>2</b><i>b </i>that are highest in formation height are in contact, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Subsequently, a temperature of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is increased so that the individual solder portions <b>2</b> are melted. However, if the temperature of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is increased in such a contact-detected state, heat would not be transferred to solder portions <b>2</b> that should be put into contact with solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>other than the above-mentioned some solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b</i>, wherein this solder is not melted, thereby causing higher positionability of occurrence of defective bonding. Therefore, after contact detection, the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is further moved down so that a further load generated by this downward movement is added to the foregoing contact load, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24C</figref>, by which the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of higher formation heights that have previously been in contact are plastically deformed by the load so that all the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>are put into contact with the solder portions <b>2</b>, respectively (time Tb-Tc). A load value necessary in further adding a load as shown above depends on a number of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b</i>. For example, assuming that the number of solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>is one hundred and that a load of 0.03 N is applied to each one solder bump <b>1</b><i>b</i>, then a total load of 3 N is set as a target load for increasing of the load. Also in performing this load increase, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down by a minimum movable distance for move-down of the head tool <b>3</b>, and moreover while a resulting load increment is being measured by the load cell <b>14</b>, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down by a specified amount so as to reach a target load. For example, with a minimum resolution of 1 μm as the minimum movable distance and with a load increment of 1 N corresponding thereto, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down in steps of 1 μm while a detected load is checked. In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, with a setting that the tip height position of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> upon a detection of contact is Hc, the tip height position is first lowered and positioned to Hc-1 μm, and further lowered and positioned to Hc-2 μm, thus stepwise downward movement is performed. Further, during a period from a downward movement of the head tool <b>3</b> to a check of the load value, a wait time of a certain time interval is provided. This is intended to stabilize the load value by a certain time lapse, since plastic deformation of the individual solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>is not completed instantaneously but needs a certain time lapse for the plastic deformation to be stabilized. Further, the load is checked again after the elapse of the specified time period even after the target load is reached, wherein if it is verified that the detected load has reached the target load, then a temperature increase of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> by heating of the ceramic heater <b>12</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Thereafter, the individual solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> are heated by the temperature increase of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> via the individual solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b</i>, by which melting of the individual solder portions <b>2</b> is started (time Tc-Td). In this case, if the solder portions <b>2</b> are formed of a eutectic solder having a melting point of 183° C., the temperature increase of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is performed with a target temperature (e.g., 200° C.) which is slightly higher than a melting point and which is lower than a melting point of high-temperature solder from which the individual solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> are formed. Also, in a case where the tip height of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is maintained as it is during this temperature increase, the tip of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> would be elongated along with the temperature increase, thus causing the load detected in the load cell <b>14</b> to be increased. In this connection, elongation amount of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> depends on its material and temperature increments, and therefore effects of elongation on the load can be reduced by selecting a material hard to elongate due to heat as the material, or by setting the temperature upon contact detection to a highest possible temperature so that a temperature variation against a melting temperature is reduced. Furthermore, a case may be another one in which a load upon contact detection is set to a somewhat lower one in view of a load increase due to elongation of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> during temperature increase. Still also, a case may be another one including a controlling step in which the tip height position of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is moved up according to a temperature of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> with a view to suppressing any load increases, due to such temperature increases, as much as possible. In such a case, an elongation amount of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> corresponding to an incremental temperature of 1° C. is preliminarily set in the control part <b>9</b> or the like as data, and the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is moved up according to a temperature increment from the temperature at contact detection (e.g., 100° C.), thus allowing a load increase due to a temperature increase to be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Further, since the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is under the control of holding its tip height position, the height position of the electronic component <b>1</b> remains as it is at the moment of the melting of the solder portions <b>2</b>, wherein the solder portions <b>2</b> are melted so that no solid substances are present between the individual pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b> and the individual solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b</i>, thus the load detected by the load cell <b>14</b> abruptly decreases toward zero (time Td-Te). In this case, since the circuit board <b>4</b> or the electronic component <b>1</b> is more or less flexed by a load effectuated just before melting of the individual solder portions <b>2</b>, the electronic component <b>1</b> is moved (lowered) in such a direction as to slightly sink toward the circuit board <b>4</b> side at the moment that the load has become zero. Accordingly, not that a gap is left by an extent corresponding to a formation thickness of the solder portions <b>2</b> which has been present between the individual pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b> and the individual solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b</i>, but that tips of the individual solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>are sunk into their corresponding solder portions <b>2</b>, respectively, so that the above-noted gap is reduced. Further, the more the load that has been present just before the melting of the solder portions <b>2</b> becomes larger, the more the gap tends to become smaller. With the load too large, sinkage larger than the gap may occur, so that the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b> are kept in direct contact with each other even after melting of the solder portions <b>2</b>, leading to occurrence of a phenomenon that the detected load does not become zero. Also, with too large a load and with the melting of the solder portions <b>2</b> in rapid progress, the electronic component <b>1</b> may sink as if it were struck against the circuit board <b>4</b> at the moment when the solder portions <b>2</b> have been melted, which may then cause molten solder to spatter, giving rise to short-circuiting faults. Even for prevention of occurrence of such various problems due to abrupt decreases in load caused by melting of the solder portions <b>2</b>, maintaining at a proper value the load that exists just before the melting of the solder portions <b>2</b> is a significantly important factor in terms of bonding stability between the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Thereafter, melting of the solder portions <b>2</b> is started. When a temperature of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> has reached a target temperature (time Te), this state is maintained for a specified time period. As a result of this, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24D</figref>, molten solder portions <b>2</b> are formed into fillets by their surface tension between the individual solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the individual pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b> so as to partly cover outer peripheries of the individual solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">In a case where the above-noted gap has occurred between the solder portions <b>2</b> and the pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>as a result of melting of the solder portions <b>2</b>, the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is moved down so that tips of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>are put into contact with each other, respectively. This is so as to achieve that the gap between the surface of the circuit board <b>4</b> and the electronic component <b>1</b> becomes equal to a formation height of the individual solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>as much as possible at a time of completion of bonding. By performing such an operation, bonding strength of the electronic component <b>1</b> onto the circuit board <b>4</b> can also be enhanced. In more detail, in a state that the load has become zero as a result of melting of the individual solder portions <b>2</b>, the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is moved down until a load is detected by the load cell <b>14</b>, and then, conversely, the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is moved up to an extent corresponding to the above-noted minimum resolution (e.g., 1 μm) from a position where the load is detected, so that a load to be detected again is returned to zero (time Tf). After performing such an operation, a time period required for stabilizing re-melted individual solder portions <b>2</b> is awaited, and then a heating temperature of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> by the ceramic heater <b>12</b> is lowered (time Tf-Tg).</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">Thereafter, when a temperature of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> has become lower than the melting point of the eutectic solder, the molten solder portions <b>2</b> begin to solidify. Once the temperature has lowered to a secure-solidification temperature (e.g., 150° C.), suction and holding of the electronic component <b>1</b> by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is released (time Tg). In addition, before this solidification of the solder portions <b>2</b>, elongation of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> due to heat would restore along with a temperature drop of the suction nozzle <b>11</b>, thereby giving rise to a force that would peel off the electronic component <b>1</b> from the circuit board <b>4</b> by the suction nozzle <b>11</b>. In order to prevent an occurrence of such force, it is also possible to perform a control operation for moving down the suction nozzle <b>11</b> along with a temperature decrease of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> so that a tip height position of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is maintained at a fixed height position. It is yet also that suction and holding of the electronic component <b>1</b> is released at a point in time when the temperature of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> has become slightly lower than the melting point of the eutectic solder, in which state the temperature of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is lowered to a temperature at which the solder portions <b>2</b> are securely solidified.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24E</figref>, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved up so that the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is moved up (time Th), wherein bonding of the electronic component <b>1</b> onto the circuit board <b>4</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Next described is a case which includes a step of performing a leveling operation such that solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of electronic component <b>1</b> are made uniform in their height with one another before the electronic component <b>1</b> is put into association with circuit board <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">With nonuniformities of their height included in the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>bonded to electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b>, when the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> are put into contact with each other, a contact load control would be affected by these nonuniformities of height of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b</i>, so that suction and holding to a predetermined rear-face height of the electronic component <b>1</b> could not be achieved by head tool <b>3</b>. If solder is melted in a state as it is and the electronic component <b>1</b> is bonded to the circuit board <b>4</b>, there would arise a problem in that individual electronic components <b>1</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> could not be made uniform in their height.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">In order to solve such a problem, before a mounting operation of the electronic component <b>1</b> onto the circuit board <b>4</b> by the head tool <b>3</b>, a leveling operation for making uniform a height of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> is performed, and thereafter the mounting operation of the electronic component <b>1</b> onto the circuit board <b>4</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">In the electronic component mounting apparatus <b>201</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a leveling stage <b>8</b> is fixed to the slide base <b>6</b> that can be moved by the Y-direction moving mechanism <b>23</b> in the Y<b>1</b> or Y<b>2</b> direction as viewed in this figure. After an electronic component <b>1</b> is sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b>, and before a positional alignment is performed so that the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> can be bonded with the solder portions <b>2</b> of a circuit board <b>4</b>, respectively, the slide base <b>6</b>, to which the leveling stage <b>8</b> is fixed, is moved in the Y<b>1</b> or Y<b>2</b> direction by the Y-direction moving mechanism <b>23</b>, and moreover the head tool <b>3</b> is moved in the X<b>1</b> or X<b>2</b> direction by the X-direction moving mechanism <b>22</b>, by which the electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> is aligned with a top surface of the leveling stage <b>8</b>. Thereafter, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> so that the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> are put into contact with the top surface of the leveling stage <b>8</b>. It is noted that this top surface of the leveling stage <b>8</b> is formed of a glass plate or the like having a smooth flat surface. In this state, a contact load generated by this contact is detected by the load cell <b>14</b> of the head tool <b>3</b>, and further the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> is controlled according to this detected contact load so that the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down in small steps by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, by which the contact load is controlled so as to become a preset contact load. The solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> are pressed against the top surface of the leveling stage <b>8</b> with the above controlled contact load, by which the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>are made uniform in height. Thereafter, the head tool <b>3</b> is moved up by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, by which a positional alignment between the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b> is performed so that the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> become bondable with the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, respectively. Then, a mounting operation of the electronic component <b>1</b> onto the circuit board <b>4</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">According to this first embodiment, various effects as shown below can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">First of all, according to the first embodiment, after the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> are put into contact with the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, respectively, the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b> are melted by heating, while kept in that contact state, and thereafter solidified by cooling, by which the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b> are bonded together with bonding members interposed therebetween. That is, working processes from contact to bonding between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> are performed at the same place. Thus, it can be made unnecessary to perform a step of conveying a circuit board to a reflow soldering working section with an electronic component temporarily bonded thereto, which is a step that would conventionally be performed after temporary bonding of the electronic component to the circuit board, and before primary bonding of the electronic component to the circuit board by collectively melting solder bumps and solder portions, as would be involved in a conventional collective reflow mounting method. Therefore, occurrence of any bonding-position shifts of the electronic component relative to the circuit board, as would occur during this conveyance, can be eliminated, making it possible to enhance a bonding quality of the electronic component onto the circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Also, after the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> are put into contact with each other, a timing for melting the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b> by heating and for releasing the electronic component <b>1</b> from suction and holding by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> is set not to such a timing that this releasing is performed during melting of solder as in the conventional local reflow mounting method, but to a timing that the releasing is performed after the solder is melted, cooled and solidified. That is, electronic-component mounting is not performed based on obtainment of a self alignment effect by surface tension of molten solder as in the conventional local reflow mounting method, but mounting of the electronic component <b>1</b> onto the circuit board <b>4</b> is performed at a contact position positioned by the head tool <b>3</b>. As a result of this, there can be eliminated any bonding position shifts of the electronic component <b>1</b> due to a vacuum break blow occurring to the suction nozzle <b>11</b> when the electronic component <b>1</b> is released from suction and holding by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b>. Consequently, it becomes possible to achieve mounting onto a circuit board of such electronic components as high-end IC chips of narrowed bump pitches, for example as narrow as <b>150</b> μm or less bump pitches, in which case bonding position shifts of an electronic component due to a vacuum break blow at the suction nozzle would matter rather than obtainment of the self alignment effect.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Also, in the head tool <b>3</b>, by the arrangement that the upper end of the shaft <b>17</b> at the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is pressed in contact against the lower surface, i.e. load-detecting surface, of the load cell <b>14</b> by the self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b> fitted to the lower frame <b>16</b><i>b </i>and the spring holder portion <b>18</b> of the shaft <b>17</b> to support the shaft <b>17</b>, it becomes possible to detect a load that acts upwardly of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>in the load cell <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">As a result, by a contact load generated between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held by the head tool <b>3</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> upon contact therebetween, the upper end of the shaft <b>17</b> of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>pushes up the load-detecting surface of the load cell <b>14</b>, thus making it possible to reliably detect the load by the load cell <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Consequently, by this detection of the contact load, it becomes possible to detect in the control part <b>9</b> the fact that the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> have come into contact with each other. Furthermore, the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> is controlled based on the detected contact load, and the head tool <b>3</b> is moved down in small steps by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, so that an actual contact load can be more accurately controlled so as to meet a preset contact load. Thus, in a case where mounting to the circuit board is iteratively performed for a plurality of electronic components, individual electronic components can be put into contact with the circuit board constantly with the preset contact load, so that a stable bonding quality of electronic components to the circuit board can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Here are described working effects based on embodiments in a case where both an elongation-amount correction and a shrinkage-amount correction of the head tool <b>3</b> are performed, a case in which either one of the elongation-amount correction or the shrinkage-amount correction is performed, and a case in which neither the elongation-amount correction nor the shrinkage-amount correction is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">After contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is elongated in the up/down direction under an effect of heat derived from the ceramic heater <b>12</b>, by which a contact load generated between the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b> is affected. An influence load on the contact load by this elongation of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is about 3 kg. Based on this influence load, working effects by the above-mentioned various combinations of the elongation-amount correction and the shrinkage-amount correction of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>are explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">First, in a case where the electronic component <b>1</b> is an IC chip having electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of not less than 1000 bumps, and where neither an elongation-amount correction nor a shrinkage-amount correction of the head tool <b>3</b> is performed, if the electronic component <b>1</b> is an IC chip having electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of 2000 bumps as an example, then an influence load of about 3 kg due to elongation of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is equivalent to about 1.5 g per bump. After contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, the influence load due to the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is taken as a contact load by using the elongation amount of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a</i>, where a proper contact load of about 1.5 g per bump can be generated, thus making it possible to reduce nonuniformities in melting height of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Next, in a case where the electronic component <b>1</b> is an IC chip having a gap width as narrow as 50 μm or less between adjacent solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>formed at the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a</i>, and where only an elongation-amount correction of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is performed and a shrinkage-amount correction is not performed, the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, which are pressed into contact with each other at a preset proper contact load resulting from an elongation-amount correction of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a</i>, are melted and thereafter these molten solder pieces are solidified by cooling while the head tool <b>3</b> is shrinking. That is, the molten solder is solidified by being elongated to an extent corresponding to a shrinking amount of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>due to the cooling. Therefore, the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b> after the melting and the solidification can be formed into a Japanese hand drum shape, thus making it possible to prevent contact between adjacent solder bumps.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Next, in a case where the electronic component <b>1</b> is an IC chip having electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of not less than 1000 bumps and where an elongation-amount correction of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is not performed and only a shrinkage-amount correction is performed, if the electronic component <b>1</b> is an IC chip having electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of 2000 bumps as an example, then an influence load of about 3 kg due to elongation of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is equivalent to about 1.5 g per bump. After contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, the influence load due to the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is taken as a contact load by using an elongation amount of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a</i>, where a proper contact load of about 1.5 g per bump can be generated. By this contact load, the IC chip is pushed in to a specified extent, and further shrinkage-amount correction of the head tool <b>3</b> is performed. Thus, solder of the IC chip can be solidified while a tip position of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> is kept constant, thereby making it possible to enhance control precision for a final IC-chip rear-face height after solder cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">Furthermore, in a case where the electronic component <b>1</b> is an IC chip having electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of less than 1000 bumps, and where both an elongation-amount correction and a shrinkage-amount correction of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>are performed, if the electronic component <b>1</b> is an IC chip having electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of 100 bumps as an example, then an influence load of about 3 kg due to elongation of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is equivalent to about 30 g per bump. In this case, without performing the elongation-amount correction, an excessive load would be applied to the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b</i>, thereby causing bump crushes to occur. Thus, elongation-amount correction and shrinkage-amount correction of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>are performed so as to enable bonding free from bump crushes.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Consequently, from the individual cases as described the above, it becomes possible to obtain required bonding qualities of electronic components, depending on whether both an elongation-amount correction and a shrinkage-amount correction of the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>are performed, or whether only either one of the elongation-amount correction or the shrinkage-amount correction is performed, or whether neither the elongation-amount correction nor the shrinkage-amount correction is performed, according to a number of solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>formed at the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> to be mounted, or to bonding precision required for the electronic component <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Also, in a case where a standby operation for start of an elongation-amount correction operation is performed during a time period from a start of temperature increase of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> at step SP<b>10</b> until a start of an elongation-amount correction operation of the head tool <b>3</b> at step SP<b>14</b>, even if an elongation amount of the head tool <b>3</b> is affected by, for example, nonuniform heat transfer or thermal disturbance or the like, during an initial stage of heating, to the suction nozzle <b>11</b>, such effects during this initial stage can be eliminated by the standby operation, and thereafter the elongation-amount correction operation of the head tool <b>3</b> can be performed. In addition, working effects similar to the foregoing can be obtained also with a shrinkage-amount correction of the head tool <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">It is noted that numerical values of various loads in the above description are those as an example in this embodiment, and this embodiment is not limited to these numerical values.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">Furthermore, after start of temperature increase of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> by heating by the ceramic heater <b>12</b>, a load detection is performed by the load cell <b>14</b> as a constant-load control state by the head tool <b>3</b>. By deciding a decrease of this detected load as a start of solder melting, a control mode is switched from a constant-load control state of the head tool <b>3</b> to a positional control in which a tip height position of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> is maintained constant, thus making it possible to maintain the tip height position of the suction nozzle <b>11</b> even during melting of solder. As a result of this, when the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> are melted, molten solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and solder portions <b>2</b> can be prevented from crushing due to lowering of the tip position of the suction nozzle <b>11</b>. Thus, it becomes possible to reliably perform rear-face height control of an electronic component even during solder melting.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Further, during constant-load control of the head tool <b>3</b> as described above, with a constant load set to a load higher than a contact load upon contact detection, this load is controlled so as to be constant, and applied to the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b>. Thus, even in such a case where some of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b> are in a noncontact state due to nonuniformities in a formation height of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b> upon detection of contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions of the circuit board <b>4</b>, applying the constant load as described above makes it possible to enhance contactability between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b>, respectively, so that all solder pieces can be securely melted, and thus that bonding reliability between the electronic component and the circuit board can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Furthermore, after the electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> is aligned so as to be bondable to the circuit board <b>4</b>, a pressing load, with which the shaft <b>17</b> at the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>is pressed against the load-detecting surface of the load cell <b>14</b> by the self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b>, is detected by the load cell <b>14</b>, and this detected pressing load is outputted to the control part <b>9</b>. In the control part <b>9</b>, this pressing load is set as a load-zero point in the load cell <b>14</b>. Thus, even in a case where the pressing load by the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>changes in the load cell <b>14</b> because of changes of spring characteristics of the self-weight balancing spring <b>15</b> under influence of heat or the like, there are no differences between an actual contact load upon contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, and a detected value of a contact load detected by the load cell <b>14</b>, thus allowing control of the actual contact load according to the preset contact load to be achieved. Thus, in a case where mounting to a circuit board is iteratively performed for a plurality of electronic components, individual electronic components can be put into contact with the circuit board constantly with the preset contact load, so that a stable bonding quality of electronic components to the circuit board can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Furthermore, after contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, and during melting of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the solder portions <b>2</b>, the head tool <b>3</b> performs a reshaping operation of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b>, by which mutual wettability of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> in a molten state can be improved. Thus, solderability onto the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b> can be made successful, and bonding reliability between an electronic component and the circuit board can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Furthermore, before the electronic component <b>1</b> is put into contact with the circuit board <b>4</b>, a leveling operation for making uniform a height of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> is performed. By so doing, even in a case where the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> have nonuniformities in terms of formation height, these nonuniformities can be eliminated so that the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>can be made uniform in height. As a result, upon contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, influences on a contact load control due to nonuniformities of the formation height of the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>can be eliminated, so that controllability on the contact load can be made successful, and so that the contact load can be applied to the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>more uniformly. Consequently, the electrodes <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the pads <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>4</b> can be bonded together with solder interposed therebetween reliably with a more uniform contact load, and a stabler bonding quality between the electronic components and the circuit board can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Furthermore, in such a case as a rear-face height precision of the electronic component <b>1</b>, after bonding of the electronic component <b>1</b> to the circuit board <b>4</b>, is required, a leveling operation is performed so that the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> are made uniform in formation height. By so doing, it becomes possible to stabilize a rear-face height of the electronic component <b>1</b> after its mounting onto the circuit board <b>4</b>. It is noted that this leveling operation, when applied to electronic components <b>1</b> having, for example, at least 1000 solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b</i>, allows a stabler bonding quality to be achieved, and hence be effective.</p>

<p id="p-0251" num="0250">It is noted that the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment and may be embodied in other various modes. For example, an electronic component mounting method according to a second embodiment of the invention is an electronic component mounting method for mixedly mounting a plurality of types of electronic components onto a circuit board during different methods.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">A first electronic component, which is one type of an electronic component from among the plurality of types of electronic components, is a general-purpose electronic component which is unlikely to incur defective bonding of the electronic component onto a circuit board due to a bonding position shift by virtue of its large bump pitch at which solder bumps are formed at electrodes of the electronic component, respectively, in the conventional collective reflow mounting method even if the bonding position shift of the electronic component with respect to the circuit board has occurred during a process in which the circuit board with the electronic component temporarily bonded thereon is conveyed to the reflow soldering working section. The first electronic component is, for example, a general-purpose electronic component <b>31</b> having a bump pitch of at least 150 μm of bumps formed on individual electrodes of the general-purpose electronic component. Further, a second electronic component, which is another type of electronic component, is a high-end electronic component which is required to meet such a high precision for a bonding position that the above-mentioned bonding position shift would incur defective bonding of the electronic component onto a circuit board in the conventional collective reflow mounting method. The second electronic component is, for example, a high-end electronic component <b>41</b> such as a high-end IC chip having a bump pitch of at most 150 μm or less required to meet a bonding position precision of 5 μm. With these electronic components, a plurality of general-purpose electronic components <b>31</b> are mounted onto the circuit board by a collective reflow mounting method, and thereafter the high-end electronic components <b>41</b> are mounted onto the circuit board by a local reflow mounting method of the foregoing first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">The electronic component mounting method according to the second embodiment of the invention is described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A to 12D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13E to 13H</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, a rectangular-plate shaped circuit board <b>34</b> has a plurality of electrodes, pads <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b</i>, on its top surface, wherein the pads <b>34</b><i>a </i>are bondable to general-purpose electronic components <b>31</b> and the pads <b>34</b><i>b </i>are bondable to high-end electronic components <b>41</b>.

<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, general-purpose electronic component <b>31</b>, on which solder bumps <b>31</b><i>b</i>, serving as bonding members, are formed on the plurality of electrodes <b>31</b><i>a </i>and which has a rectangular-plate shape, is sucked and held at its rear surface which has no electrodes by a tool <b>33</b> as an example of a component holding member. Then, the general-purpose electronic component <b>31</b> is aligned with the circuit board <b>34</b> so that the solder bumps <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the general-purpose electronic component <b>31</b> becomes bondable to the flux portions <b>32</b> formed on the pads <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>34</b>, respectively. Thereafter, the tool <b>33</b> sucking and holding the general-purpose electronic component <b>31</b> is moved down so that the solder bumps <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the general-purpose electronic component <b>31</b> are pressed against the pads <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>34</b> via the flux portions <b>32</b>, and thus are temporarily bonded. For each of the general-purpose electronic components <b>31</b>, these working steps are iteratively performed, by which the general-purpose electronic components <b>31</b> are temporarily bonded to the circuit board <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">Next, the circuit board <b>34</b>, to which the general-purpose electronic components <b>31</b> are temporarily bonded, is conveyed to a reflow soldering working section, where as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, the general-purpose electronic components <b>31</b> and the circuit board <b>34</b> are heated by a heat source in the reflow soldering working section, by which the solder bumps <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the respective general-purpose electronic components <b>31</b> are melted.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>, the heated general-purpose electronic components <b>31</b> and circuit board <b>34</b> are cooled, by which the molten solder bumps <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the general-purpose electronic components <b>31</b> are solidified, so that the electrodes <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the general-purpose electronic components <b>31</b> are finally bonded to the pads <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the circuit board <b>34</b>, respectively, via the solder bumps <b>31</b><i>b</i>; thus the general-purpose electronic components <b>31</b> are collectively mounted onto the circuit board <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13E</figref>, flux is fed by a nozzle <b>45</b> onto the pads <b>34</b><i>b</i>, that are bondable to high-end electronic component <b>41</b>, in the circuit board <b>34</b> with the general-purpose electronic components <b>31</b> mounted thereon, by which flux portions <b>42</b> are formed on the pads <b>34</b><i>b. </i></p>

After this contact, the solder bumps <b>41</b><i>b </i>of the high-end electronic component <b>41</b>, which are in contact with the flux portions <b>42</b> of the circuit board <b>34</b>, respectively, are heated and thereby melted by ceramic heater <b>12</b> of the head tool <b>3</b>. Thereafter, heating by the ceramic heater <b>12</b> is stopped, and then the molten solder is subjected to cooling by blows from cooling blow nozzle <b>19</b>, thereby the molten solder bumps <b>41</b><i>b </i>are solidified, so that the electrodes <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the high-end electronic component <b>41</b> and the pads <b>34</b><i>b </i>of the circuit board <b>34</b> are bonded to the solder bumps <b>41</b><i>b</i>, respectively.

<p id="p-0261" num="0260">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13H</figref>, the sucking and holding of the high-end electronic component <b>41</b> by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> is released, and the head tool <b>3</b> is moved up.</p>

<p id="p-0267" num="0266">Accordingly, the general-purpose electronic components <b>31</b>, after being temporarily bonded onto the circuit board <b>34</b>, can be finally bonded and mounted onto the circuit board <b>34</b> by collectively melting their solder, thus allowing mounting work to be performed efficiently.

As a result of this, the shaft <b>57</b> can be guided by the hole <b>56</b><i>d </i>of the lower frame <b>56</b><i>b </i>to move up and down via the self-weight balancing spring <b>55</b>. Also, even if the self-weight balancing spring <b>55</b> has become no longer capable of supporting the shaft <b>57</b> due to damage or the like, a peripheral portion of the hole <b>56</b><i>d </i>of the lower frame <b>56</b><i>b </i>can support the shaft <b>57</b> by the stepped portion <b>57</b><i>c </i>of the shaft <b>57</b> so that the shaft <b>57</b> is prevented from falling off.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">Further, the shaft lower portion <b>57</b><i>b </i>has a ball-spline outer ring and a shaft, and the lower frame <b>56</b><i>b </i>has a bearing inside the hole <b>56</b><i>d</i>, wherein the ball-spline outer ring is fitted inside the bearing. Thus, the shaft <b>57</b> can be rotated about its axis while being supported by the lower frame <b>56</b><i>b</i>, and also moved up-and-down in an axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">The intermediate frame <b>56</b><i>c </i>is cylindrical at both ends, which are fixed to nut portions <b>21</b><i>b </i>of up/down moving unit <b>21</b>. Rotating a ball screw shaft <b>21</b><i>a</i>, screwed to the nut portions <b>21</b><i>b</i>, by a motor <b>21</b><i>m </i>in the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> causes the intermediate frame <b>56</b><i>c </i>to be operated to move up and down, by which the frame <b>56</b> is operated to move up and down, by which the head tool <b>50</b> as a whole is operated to move up and down.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">Also, the small cylinder <b>58</b> includes a cylindrically-shaped guide <b>60</b> formed at the shaft upper portion <b>57</b><i>a </i>of the shaft <b>57</b>, and a columnar-shaped rod <b>59</b> disposed inside the guide <b>60</b> and guided by an interior of the guide <b>60</b> to move up and down within the guide <b>60</b>, wherein compressed air can be supplied and exhausted to a compressed air supply chamber <b>65</b> surrounded by an inner surface of the guide <b>60</b> and a lower surface of the rod <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Also, the large cylinder <b>61</b> includes a cylindrically-shaped guide <b>63</b> formed at an end portion of the upper frame <b>56</b><i>a</i>, and a columnar-shaped rod <b>62</b> disposed inside the guide <b>63</b> and guided by an interior of the guide <b>63</b> to move up and down within the guide <b>63</b>, and further the rod <b>62</b> has a lower end of a narrow-neck portion <b>62</b><i>b</i>, i.e., its lower portion, fitted to an upper surface of the load cell <b>54</b>. The large cylinder <b>61</b> further includes a compressed air supply chamber <b>66</b> surrounded by the inner surface of the guide <b>63</b> and the upper surface of the rod <b>62</b>, so that compressed air can be supplied and exhausted to the compressed air supply chamber <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">Also, the suction nozzle <b>51</b>, the ceramic heater <b>52</b>, the water jacket <b>53</b>, the shaft <b>57</b>, the guide <b>60</b> of the small cylinder <b>58</b>, the rod <b>59</b>, the load cell <b>54</b>, the guide <b>63</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> and the rod <b>62</b> are positioned coaxially on one axis, so that the rod <b>62</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> and the rod <b>59</b> of the small cylinder <b>58</b> move up and down on this same axis. Further, since this axis is positioned so as to be parallel to an axis of up/down operations of the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, individual constituent parts of the head tool <b>50</b> positioned coaxially as described above are up-and-down movable on the same axis by the up/down operations of the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">Further, an upper end of the rod <b>59</b> of the small cylinder <b>58</b> in the head-tool tip portion <b>50</b><i>a </i>can be put into contact with a load-detecting lower surface of the load cell <b>54</b> at the head-tool tip portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>which is supported on the lower frame <b>56</b><i>b </i>via the self-weight balancing spring <b>55</b>. Thus, when the upper end of the rod <b>59</b> of the small cylinder <b>58</b> makes contact with the load cell <b>54</b>, this contact enables the load cell <b>54</b> to detect a load that acts upwardly on the load-detecting lower surface of the load cell <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">Further, in the large cylinder <b>61</b>, the rod <b>62</b> has a trench-like recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>in an outer periphery of its columnar-shaped side face, which is an axially central portion of the rod <b>62</b>, while the guide <b>63</b> has on its cylindrical-shaped side face a hole <b>63</b><i>a </i>at a position where the guide <b>63</b> is fittable into the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>62</b>. Further, a bar-shaped stopper <b>64</b>, which is an example of a bar member that can pass through this hole <b>63</b><i>a </i>of the guide <b>63</b>, is formed so as to be fittable into the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>62</b> through the hole <b>63</b><i>a </i>of the guide <b>63</b> from outside of the guide <b>63</b> by a stopper driving cylinder <b>67</b>, which is an example of a bar-member drive mechanism provided outside the guide <b>63</b>. The rod <b>62</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> can be restricted in its up-and-down motions by a driving operation of the stopper driving cylinder <b>67</b> for making the stopper <b>64</b> pass through the hole <b>63</b><i>a </i>of the guide <b>63</b> and thereby fitted into the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>62</b>, and an example of a restricting mechanism for restricting operations of the rod <b>62</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> is constituted as described above. It is noted that an inner axial width of the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>62</b> is set slightly larger than an axial width of the stopper <b>64</b>, so that the rod <b>62</b> having the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a</i>, in a state that the stopper <b>64</b> is fitted inside the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a</i>, i.e., in a state that the rod <b>62</b> is restricted in its up-and-down motions, is enabled to move up and down to a little extent corresponding to an extent by which the inner axial width of the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>is larger than that of the stopper <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">Also, the large cylinder <b>61</b>, the small cylinder <b>58</b> and the stopper driving cylinder <b>67</b> are connected respectively to compressed-air supply and exhaust sections <b>69</b>A, <b>69</b>B and <b>69</b>C, each of which is an example of a compressed-air supply and exhaust mechanism. Each of the compressed-air supply and exhaust sections <b>69</b>A, <b>69</b>B and <b>69</b>C is made up of an air supply portion for supplying compressed air, an air exhaust portion for exhausting compressed air, a switching valve for switching between air supply from the air supply portion and air exhaust from the air exhaust portion, and an air supply-and-exhaust line for compressed air connected from the switching valve to the cylinders, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">Also, the cooling blow nozzle <b>70</b> fitted on the periphery of the shaft lower portion <b>57</b><i>b</i>, which is a lower periphery of the shaft <b>57</b>, is formed so as to surround both sides of the water jacket <b>53</b> and the ceramic heater <b>52</b>, which are positioned under the shaft <b>57</b>. Further, a tip of the cooling blow nozzle <b>70</b> is directed toward an electronic-component suction and holding surface, i.e. lower surface, of the suction nozzle <b>51</b>, so that a blow from the cooling blow nozzle <b>70</b> can cool electronic component <b>1</b> sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">Control part <b>9</b> controls a sucking operation of the suction nozzle <b>51</b>, a heating operation of the ceramic heater <b>52</b>, supply-and-exhaust operations of the compressed-air supply and exhaust sections <b>69</b>A to <b>69</b>C connected to the large cylinder <b>61</b>, the small cylinder <b>58</b> and the stopper driving cylinder <b>67</b>, respectively, and a moving operation of the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, and a load detected by the load cell <b>54</b> is outputted to the control part <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">Next, operation of the head tool <b>3</b> in this third embodiment is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">First, in a case where the head tool <b>3</b> is used in the local reflow mounting method of the first embodiment, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, compressed air is supplied to the compressed air supply chamber <b>65</b> in the small cylinder <b>58</b> by the compressed-air supply and exhaust section <b>69</b>A, so that the rod <b>59</b> is moved within the guide <b>60</b> upwardly along the inner surface of the guide <b>60</b> by pressure of this supplied compressed air, thereby bringing the upper end of the rod <b>59</b> into contact with the lower surface of the load cell <b>54</b>. Further, the rod <b>62</b> in the large cylinder <b>61</b> is pushed up via the load cell <b>54</b>, so that the rod <b>62</b> is moved within the guide <b>63</b> upwardly along the inner surface of the guide <b>63</b>. When this is done, the stopper <b>64</b> for restriction of the up-and-down motions of the rod <b>62</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> is not fitted inside the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>62</b>; thus the stopper <b>64</b> is in the OFF state, and the rod <b>62</b> is in a state that the rod <b>62</b> is freely up-and-down movable within the guide <b>63</b> along the inner surface of the guide <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">Next, after the upper surface of the rod <b>62</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> pushed up and moved upwardly is brought into contact with an inner upper surface of the guide <b>63</b>, and the rod <b>62</b> having reached an upper end of its up-and-down motion along the inner surface of the guide <b>63</b>, OFF-state stopper <b>64</b> for restriction of the up-and-down motions of the rod <b>62</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> is fitted into the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>62</b> while made to pass through the hole <b>63</b><i>a </i>of the guide <b>63</b> by supplying compressed air to the stopper driving cylinder <b>67</b> by the compressed-air supply and exhaust section <b>69</b>C, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>; thus causing the stopper <b>64</b> to be brought into the ON state.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">Thereafter, supply of the compressed air to the compressed air supply chamber <b>65</b> in the small cylinder <b>58</b> by the compressed-air supply and exhaust section <b>69</b>A is stopped, compressed air is exhausted from the compressed air supply chamber <b>65</b> in the small cylinder <b>58</b> by the compressed-air supply and exhaust section <b>69</b>A while compressed air is supplied to the compressed air supply chamber <b>66</b> in the large cylinder <b>61</b> by the compressed-air supply and exhaust section <b>69</b>B. Thus, by pressure of the compressed air supplied to the compressed air supply chamber <b>66</b>, the rod <b>62</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> is pushed down, so that the load cell <b>54</b> fitted to the lower end of the narrow-neck portion <b>62</b><i>b</i>, which is a lower portion of the rod <b>62</b>, is moved downwardly, by which the rod <b>59</b> of the small cylinder <b>58</b> with its upper end in contact with the lower surface of the load cell <b>54</b> is pushed down via the load cell <b>54</b> and moved downwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">Thereafter, the lower end of the rod <b>59</b> of the small cylinder <b>58</b> comes into contact with an inner lower end of the guide <b>60</b>, so that the rod <b>59</b> comes into a structure integrated with the shaft <b>57</b> forming the guide <b>60</b> as a result of this contact. Further, by the rod <b>59</b> being pressed downwardly, the head-tool tip portion <b>50</b><i>a </i>in its entirety supported by the lower frame <b>56</b><i>b </i>via the self-weight balancing spring <b>55</b> is pushed down, resulting in a state that the self-weight balancing spring <b>55</b> is compressed by this press-down load. Then, in the large cylinder <b>61</b>, the inner upper surface of the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the pushed-down rod <b>62</b> comes into contact with the upper portion of the stopper <b>64</b>, and in this contact position, the rod <b>62</b> is pressed downwardly and fixed by pressure of the compressed air supplied to the compressed air supply chamber <b>66</b>. It is noted that for relaxation of impact upon contact between the rod <b>62</b> and the stopper <b>64</b>, a quantity of compressed air supplied to the compressed air supply chamber <b>66</b> in the compressed-air supply and exhaust section <b>69</b>B is controlled stepwise by a load detected by the load cell <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">Now a relationship between the inner axial width of the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>62</b> and the axial width of the stopper <b>64</b> is explained here in further detail. The relationship of these two widths is as follows. That is, after performing steps such that the rod <b>59</b> of the small cylinder <b>58</b> is pushed up and moved upwardly within the guide <b>60</b> along the inner surface of the guide <b>60</b>, by which the rod <b>62</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> is pushed up via the load cell <b>54</b> and moved upwardly within the guide <b>63</b> along the inner surface of the guide <b>63</b>, and when the rod <b>62</b> has been moved until the upper surface of the rod <b>62</b> comes into contact with the inner upper surface of the guide <b>63</b>, the stopper <b>64</b> is fittable within the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>62</b>. Moreover, after that, the rod <b>62</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> is pushed down and moved downwardly within the guide <b>63</b> along the inner surface of the guide <b>63</b>, by which the rod <b>59</b> of the small cylinder <b>58</b> is pushed down via the load cell <b>54</b> and moved downwardly within the guide <b>60</b> along the inner surface of the guide <b>60</b> until the lower end of the rod <b>59</b> comes into contact with the inner lower end of the guide <b>60</b>, and the rod <b>59</b> is further pressed, by which it becomes possible to obtain a state that the self-weight balancing spring <b>55</b> is compressed by this pressing force with which the self-weight balancing spring <b>55</b> is pressed, in which state the inner upper surface of the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>62</b> is brought into contact with the upper portion of the stopper <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">In the head tool <b>50</b> in such a state as described above, the electronic component <b>1</b> is sucked and held to the suction nozzle <b>51</b>, and positional alignment between the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b> is performed. Thereafter, while the electronic component <b>1</b> is kept sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>51</b>, the head tool <b>50</b> is moved down by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, by which the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> are put into contact with the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>, respectively. In this state, by a contact load that occurs, the upper end of the rod <b>59</b> of the small cylinder <b>58</b> formed into an integral structure with the shaft <b>57</b> at the upper portion of the head-tool tip portion <b>50</b><i>a </i>presses the load-detecting surface of the load cell <b>54</b>, so that a contact load is detectable in the load cell <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">By detecting the contact load in the load cell <b>54</b> in this way, occurrence of contact between the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> and the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b> is detected. Moreover, the contact load detected by the load cell <b>54</b> is outputted to the control part <b>9</b>, while the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> is controlled by the control part <b>9</b> so as to obtain a contact load preset in the control part <b>9</b>. Thus, the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> is controlled so that the contact load detected by the load cell <b>54</b> becomes a preset contact load.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Next, in a case where the head tool <b>50</b> is used in the local reflow mounting method of the prior art, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in the head tool <b>50</b> in a state of use in the local reflow mounting method of the first embodiment, the stopper <b>64</b> is turned ON, and compressed air is supplied to the compressed air supply chamber <b>66</b> in the large cylinder <b>61</b> by the compressed-air supply and exhaust section <b>69</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">First, a quantity of compressed air supplied to the compressed air supply chamber <b>66</b> is decreased stepwise by the compressed-air supply and exhaust section <b>69</b>B so that this supply of the compressed air is stopped, and thereafter supply of compressed air to the compressed air supply chamber <b>65</b> in the small cylinder <b>58</b> is started by the compressed-air supply and exhaust section <b>69</b>A. As a result of this, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the rod <b>59</b> of the small cylinder <b>58</b> is pushed up and moved upwardly within the guide <b>60</b> along the inner surface of the guide <b>60</b>, by which the upper end of the rod <b>59</b> is brought into contact with the lower surface of the load cell <b>54</b>. Further, the rod <b>62</b> in the large cylinder <b>61</b> is pushed up via the load cell <b>54</b> and moved upwardly within the guide <b>63</b> along the inner surface of the guide <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">Thereafter, the stopper <b>64</b> fitted within the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>62</b> is withdrawn from the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>62</b> by exhausting compressed air that has been supplied to the stopper driving cylinder <b>67</b> by the compressed-air supply and exhaust section <b>69</b>C, by which the stopper <b>64</b> that has been turned ON is turned OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">In the head tool <b>50</b> in such a state as described above, the electronic component <b>1</b> is sucked and held to the suction nozzle <b>51</b>, and positional alignment between the electronic component <b>1</b> and the circuit board <b>4</b> is performed. Thereafter, while the electronic component <b>1</b> is kept sucked and held by the suction nozzle <b>51</b>, the head tool <b>50</b> is moved down by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, and compressed air is supplied to the compressed air supply chamber <b>66</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> or the compressed air supply chamber <b>65</b> of the small cylinder <b>58</b> by the compressed-air supply and exhaust section <b>69</b>A or <b>69</b>B, by which the head-tool tip portion <b>50</b><i>a </i>is pushed down, so that the solder bumps <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the electronic component <b>1</b> are pressed against the solder portions <b>2</b> of the circuit board <b>4</b>. In this case, a load with which the suction nozzle <b>51</b>, sucking and holding the electronic component <b>1</b>, presses against the circuit board <b>4</b> is generated by an operation in which a pressing load detected by the load cell <b>54</b> via the rod <b>62</b> or rod <b>59</b> is transferred to the suction nozzle <b>51</b> via the shaft <b>57</b> by pressure of the compressed air that has been supplied to the compressed air supply chamber <b>66</b> in the large cylinder <b>61</b> or the compressed air supply chamber <b>65</b> in the small cylinder <b>58</b> by the compressed-air supply and exhaust section <b>69</b>A or <b>69</b>B. It is noted that, in this case, a product of the pressure of the compressed air and an upper-surface area of the rod <b>62</b> or rod <b>59</b> is a pressing load. The large cylinder <b>61</b> is used when a larger pressing load is required, and the small cylinder <b>58</b> is used when a smaller pressing load is required.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">The above description has been made for a case where the head tool <b>50</b> has two large-and-small cylinders. However, when a required pressing load is limited to within a range of some extent, electronic component mounting can be fulfilled as in the above-described case by a head tool having only one cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">According to the third embodiment as described above, the head tool <b>3</b> having pneumatic cylinders of a type used in the local reflow mounting apparatus has structure for fixing the pneumatic cylinders, for example, the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>62</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> and the stopper <b>64</b> as described above, and the electronic component mounting apparatus includes such a head tool <b>3</b>; thus making it possible to mount the electronic component <b>1</b> onto the circuit board <b>4</b> both by the local reflow mounting method of the prior art and by the local reflow mounting method of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">Therefore, for example, in a case where the electronic component <b>1</b> is a general-purpose electronic component for which high bonding precision is not required and where this general-purpose electronic component is mounted onto the circuit board <b>4</b>, the stopper <b>64</b> in the rod <b>62</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> is turned OFF so that the rod <b>62</b> is made free to move up and down within the guide <b>63</b>. Thereafter, compressed air is supplied to the compressed air supply chamber <b>66</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> or the compressed air supply chamber <b>65</b> of the small cylinder <b>58</b>. Thus, by making use of pressure of the supplied compressed air, a pressing load detected by the load cell <b>54</b> via the rod <b>62</b> or rod <b>59</b> is transferred to the suction nozzle <b>51</b> via the shaft <b>57</b>, so that the suction nozzle <b>51</b> is pushed down, thus making it possible to mount the electronic component by the local reflow mounting method of the prior art at a high mounting speed.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">Moreover, for example, in a case where the electronic component <b>1</b> is a high-end electronic component for which high bonding precision is required, and where the high-end electronic component is mounted onto the circuit board <b>4</b>, the stopper <b>64</b> inside the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>62</b> in the large cylinder <b>61</b> is turned ON, and compressed air is supplied to the compressed air supply chamber <b>66</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b>, by which the rod <b>62</b> is pushed down so that the inner upper surface of the recess portion <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the pushed-down rod <b>62</b> is put into contact with the upper portion of the stopper <b>64</b>, thereby making the load cell <b>54</b>, the rod <b>62</b>, the guide <b>63</b> and the upper frame <b>56</b><i>a </i>formed into an integral structure. Furthermore, the rod <b>59</b> of the small cylinder <b>58</b> is pushed down by the rod <b>62</b> of the large cylinder <b>61</b> via the load cell <b>54</b>, by which the lower end of the rod <b>59</b> is put into contact with an inner lower end of the guide <b>60</b>, thereby making the head-tool tip portion <b>50</b><i>a </i>in its entirety into an integral state, and the rod <b>59</b> is further pushed down so that the head-tool tip portion <b>50</b><i>a </i>in its entirety is pushed down via the self-weight balancing spring <b>55</b>; thus allowing the head tool <b>50</b> to be of a structural state similar to that of the head tool <b>3</b> of the first embodiment. In the head tool <b>50</b> of such a state, by performing a move-down operation of the head tool <b>50</b> by the up/down moving unit <b>21</b>, contact between an electronic component and a circuit board is detected by the load cell <b>54</b>, and the up/down moving unit <b>21</b> is controlled by the control part <b>9</b> so that this detected contact load becomes a preset contact load. Thus, it becomes possible to mount the electronic component by the local reflow mounting method of the first embodiment with high bonding precision. Consequently, it becomes possible to change a mounting method as required depending on bonding precision required for mounting an electronic component to a circuit board, thus allowing both productivity and quality to be satisfied at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">Further, in the head tool <b>50</b> in which the stopper <b>64</b> has been turned ON so that the head tool <b>50</b> is ready for performing the local reflow mounting method of the first embodiment, a tip height of the suction nozzle <b>51</b> can be maintained constant by controlling a contraction height of the self-weight balancing spring <b>55</b> to a constant height, by which a stable contact load control can be achieved when electronic component <b>1</b> is put into contact with circuit board <b>4</b>, thus making it possible to stabilize a bonding quality of the electronic component.</p>

That is, the second working example is a result of reversing the order of the ultrasonic mounting method and the local reflow mounting method of the first embodiment with respect to the first working example of the fifth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">According to the second working example of the fifth embodiment as described above, mounting of the electronic component <b>111</b> onto the circuit board <b>104</b> is performed by the ultrasonic mounting method, and thereafter mounting of the IC chip <b>101</b> onto the circuit board <b>104</b>, on which the electronic component <b>111</b> has been mounted, is performed by the local reflow mounting method of the first embodiment. Therefore, it becomes possible to eliminate a need for taking into consideration any effects of ultrasonic vibrations, generated during the ultrasonic mounting, on the IC chip <b>101</b>. Thus, in a case where the high-end electronic component, such as IC chips to which high precision for a bonding position is required, is an electronic component that requires further consideration as to effects of vibrations, the electronic component can be mounted onto the circuit board mixedly and together with an electronic component that is mounted by the ultrasonic mounting method.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">Further, a third working example of the fifth embodiment of the invention is to first perform by the ultrasonic mounting method mounting of an electronic component onto a circuit board via a sealing material for sealing a bonding portion between the electronic component and the circuit board, and thereafter perform by a collective reflow mounting method temporary bonding of a general-purpose electronic component onto the circuit board, on which the electronic component has been mounted, via solder, and thereafter perform primary bonding, and thereby mounting, by applying heat collectively to the electronic component, the general-purpose electronic component to the circuit board to make a seal of the bonding portion between the electronic component and the circuit board by the sealing material, and also to melt solder of the general-purpose electronic component that has been temporarily bonded via the solder.

<p id="p-0352" num="0351">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21H</figref>, sucking and holding of the high-end electronic component <b>141</b> by the suction nozzle <b>11</b> of the head tool <b>3</b> is released, and the head tool <b>3</b> is moved up, thus the high-end electronic component <b>41</b> is mounted onto the circuit board <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">Through the electronic component mounting method as described the above, the electronic component <b>121</b>, the general-purpose electronic component <b>131</b> and the high-end electronic component <b>141</b> are mounted onto the circuit board <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">According to the third working example of the fifth embodiment as described above, in addition to effects of the second working example, sealing by the sealing material <b>122</b> for the bonding portions of the electronic component <b>121</b> bonded to the circuit board <b>124</b> by the ultrasonic mounting method, as well as the primary bonding by the collective reflow for the general-purpose electronic component <b>131</b> temporarily bonded to the circuit board <b>124</b>, can further be performed simultaneously by collectively heating electronic components and a circuit board by a heat source. Therefore, in cases where electronic components to be mixedly placed on a circuit board are general-purpose electronic components, electronic components which are mounted by the ultrasonic mounting method and which need sealing of bonding portions, and high-end electronic components to which high precision for a bonding position is required, it becomes possible to reduce a mounting time of these electronic components onto a circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">In addition, combining any arbitrary embodiments together appropriately from among the foregoing various embodiments allows their respective effects to be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">According to the first aspect or second aspect of the present invention, while electrodes of an electronic component sucked and held by the component holding member and electrodes of a circuit board are kept in contact with bonding members, the bonding members between these electrodes are melted by heating, and releasing of the electronic component from suction and holding by the component holding member is performed, not at a time during melting of the bonding members as in the conventional local reflow mounting method, but at a time after the bonding members are melted, cooled and solidified. That is, the electronic-component mounting is not performed based on obtainment of a self alignment effect by surface tension of the molten bonding members as in the conventional local reflow mounting method, but mounting of the electronic component onto the circuit board is performed at a contact position positioned by the component holding member. As a result of this, there can be eliminated any bonding position shifts of the electronic component due to a vacuum break blow occurring when the electronic component is released from the suction and holding by the component holding member. Consequently, it becomes possible to achieve mounting onto the circuit board of such electronic components as those of narrowed electrode pitches of electronic components in which bonding position shifts of the electronic components, due to the vacuum break blow at the component holding member, would matter rather than obtainment of the self alignment effect.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">According to the third to sixth aspects of the invention, the bonding-material feeding method, the bonding-material constituent materials or the flux feeding method which have been used in the electronic component mounting method of the prior art can be applied, thus making it possible to provide a mounting method for electronic components of general-purpose use.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">According to the seventh to ninth aspects of the invention, operations of causing electrodes of an electronic component, sucked and held by the component holding member, and electrodes of a circuit board to be brought into contact with respective bonding members, and melting the bonding members by heating, are performed not in the manner, as in the local reflow mounting method of the prior art, that the electrodes of the electronic component and the electrodes of the circuit board are merely pressed against the bonding members to make the bonding members melt, or that the electrodes of the electronic component and the electrodes of the circuit board are pressed against the bonding members after melting of the bonding members by heating, but in a manner that the electrodes of the electronic component and the electrodes of the circuit board are brought into contact with the bonding members and thereafter the bonding members are melted by heating. Therefore, since the bonding members are not yet in a molten state at a time of contact, it becomes possible to detect a load that actually occurs between the electrodes of the electronic component and the electrodes of the circuit board, and further to exert control so that, at this contact, a detected load actually occurring becomes beyond a contact load that is predicted to occur upon such contact. Therefore, in a process of performing mounting onto the circuit board iteratively for a plurality of electronic components, it is possible to exert precise control so that an actually occurring load constantly becomes beyond a contact load that is predicted to occur upon contact. Thus, a contact position upon contact of each electronic component with the circuit board can be made more uniform, an interval pitch between the electrodes of the electronic component can be made narrower, and mounting onto the circuit board can be achieved while a bonding position relative to the circuit board is kept more stable for electronic components for which high precision for the bonding position relative to the circuit board is required, such as high-end electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">According to the tenth aspect of the invention, after detection of contact between either electrodes of an electronic component sucked and held by the component holding member or electrodes of a circuit board and bonding members, in this contact state, individual bonding members between the electrodes are heated and thereby melted, and releasing of the electronic component from the suction and holding by the component holding member is performed not at a time during melting of the bonding members as in the conventional local reflow mounting method, but at a time after the bonding members are melted, cooled and solidified. That is, the electronic-component mounting is not performed based on obtainment of a self alignment effect by surface tension of the molten bonding members as in the conventional local reflow mounting method, but mounting of the electronic component onto the circuit board is performed at a contact position positioned by the component holding member. As a result of this, there can be eliminated any bonding position shifts of the electronic component due to a vacuum break blow occurring when the electronic component is released from suction and holding by the component holding member. Consequently, it becomes possible to achieve mounting onto the circuit board of such electronic components as those of narrowed electrode pitches in which bonding position shifts of the electronic components due to a vacuum break blow at the component holding member would matter rather than obtainment of the self alignment effect.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">According to the eleventh to fourteenth aspects of the invention, the bonding-material feeding method, bonding-material constituent materials or a flux feeding method which have been used in an electronic component mounting method of the prior art can be applied, thus making it possible to provide a mounting method for electronic components of general-purpose use.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">According to the fifteenth aspect of the invention, in addition to effects of the foregoing aspects, after detection of contact between either electrodes of an electronic component or electrodes of a circuit board and bonding members, it is decided whether or not a correction of an elongation amount of the component holding member due to heating is executed, and further, after start of cooling of molten bonding members, it is decided whether or not a correction of shrinkage amount of the component holding member due to cooling is performed. Thus, it becomes possible to obtain a required bonding quality of an electronic component depending on whether both the elongation-amount correction and the shrinkage-amount correction of the component holding member are performed, or only either one of the elongation-amount correction or the shrinkage-amount correction is performed, or neither the elongation-amount correction nor the shrinkage-amount correction is performed, depending on a number of electrodes of the electronic component or a bonding precision required for the electronic component.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">According to the sixteenth aspect or seventeenth aspect of the invention, only either one of the elongation-amount correction or the shrinkage-amount correction is performed. Thus, it becomes possible to obtain a required bonding quality of an electronic component, like effects of the fifteenth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362">According to the eighteenth aspect or nineteenth aspect of the invention, after detection of contact between either electrodes of an electronic component or electrodes of a circuit board and bonding members, a load that actually occurs between these electrodes, due to this contact is maintained at a generally constant level, and thereafter, upon a decision that a detection of a decrease of the load is regarded as a start of melting of the bonding members, a control mode is switched from one control mode in which the load is maintained generally constant to another control mode in which a contact height position of the electronic component relative to the circuit board is maintained generally constant, by which even in a molten state of the bonding members, a contact height position of the electronic component can be maintained generally constant. As a result, during melting of the bonding members, molten bonding members can be prevented from crushing due to lowering of the contact height position of the electronic component. Thus, it becomes possible to reliably perform control of the contact height position of the electronic component even during a molten state of the bonding members.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">Further, in the control mode in which the load is maintained generally constant, the load is set to a load not less than a contact load upon a contact detection, and this set load is, while maintained generally constant, applied to the electronic component and the circuit board. By so doing, even if some of the electrodes are not in contact with each other via the bonding members because of variations in a formation height of the bonding members upon detection of contact between either electrodes of the electronic component or the electrodes of the circuit board and the bonding members, it is possible to enhance contactability between the electrodes and the bonding members by applying a load that is maintained generally constant, and thus to enhance bonding reliability of the electronic component and the circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">According to the twentieth aspect of the invention, before an electronic component is put into contact with a circuit board, a leveling operation is performed so that bonding members that have preliminarily been fed onto electrodes of the electronic component are made more uniform in their feed height. As a result, even if there are variations in feed height among the bonding members on the electrodes of the electronic component, it is possible to eliminate these variations and make the bonding members more uniform in feed height. Thus, upon contact of the bonding members and either the electrodes of the electronic component or the electrodes of the circuit board, there can be eliminated any effects on a contact load control due to variations in feed height of the bonding members, so that successful controllability for contact load can be obtained and that the contact load can be applied to individual bonding members more uniformly. Consequently, the electrodes of the electronic component and the electrodes of the circuit board can be brought into contact with the bonding members with a more uniform contact load and with reliability. Thus, it is possible to stabilize a bonding quality between the electronic component and the circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">According to the twenty-first aspect of the invention, in the electronic component mounting method for mounting two types of electronic components, a first electronic component and a second electronic component, onto a circuit board, wherein higher bonding positional precision for mounting onto the circuit board is required of the second electronic component than of the first electronic component, the first electronic component is temporarily bonded to the circuit board by the conventional collective reflow mounting method, and this temporarily bonded first electronic component and the circuit board are heated so that the first electronic component is mounted, and thereafter the second electronic component is mounted onto the circuit board, on which the first electronic component has been mounted, by the electronic component mounting methods of the foregoing individual embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366">As a result of this, the first electronic component, after being separately temporarily bonded onto the circuit board, can be heated to melt bonding members, and then the first electronic component can be finally bonded and mounted onto the circuit board, thus allowing mounting work to be achieved efficiently. Therefore, mounting costs of the first electronic component onto the circuit board can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">Moreover, the second electronic component is maintained sucked and held by the component holding member from contact with bonding members between electrodes of the second electronic component and electrodes of the circuit board until solidification of the bonding members after their melting. As a result of this, there occur no bonding position shifts between the second electronic component and the circuit board, so that the second electronic component can be mounted onto the circuit board with high precision for a bonding position.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0368">Accordingly, in the electronic component mounting method in a case where a plurality of electronic components different in bonding positional precision from each other, like the first electronic component and the second electronic component, are mixed mounted onto a circuit board, it becomes possible to satisfy both productivity and bonding quality at the same time by changing a mounting method for respective electronic components as required depending on required bonding precision of the respective electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0369">According to the twenty-second aspect or twenty-third aspect of the invention, while electrodes of an electronic component sucked and held on the component holding member by the suction-and-holding mechanism, and electrodes of a circuit board, are kept in contact with bonding members, the bonding members between these electrodes are heated and melted by the heating mechanism, and releasing of the electronic component from the suction and holding on the component holding member by the suction-and-holding mechanism is performed, not at a time during melting of the bonding members as in the conventional local reflow mounting method, but at a time after the bonding members are solidified by cooling by the cooling mechanism, after heating and melting of the bonding members by the heating mechanism. That is, the electronic-component mounting is not performed based on obtainment of a self alignment effect by surface tension of molten bonding members as in the conventional local reflow mounting method, but mounting of the electronic component onto the circuit board is performed at a contact position positioned by the component holding member. As a result of this, there can be eliminated any bonding position shifts of the electronic component due to a vacuum break blow occurring when the electronic component is released from the suction and holding on the component holding member by the suction-and-holding mechanism. Consequently, it becomes possible to achieve mounting onto the circuit board of such electronic components as those of narrowed electrode pitches in which bonding position shifts of the electronic components due to a vacuum break blow at the suction-and-holding mechanism would matter rather than obtainment of the self alignment effect.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">According to the twenty-fourth to twenty-sixth aspects of the invention, it becomes possible to provide an electronic component mounting apparatus capable of obtaining the effects of the seventh to ninth embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0371">According to the twenty-seventh aspect of the invention, it becomes possible to provide an electronic component mounting apparatus capable of obtaining the effects of the tenth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0372">According to the twenty-eighth aspect of the invention, after positional alignment is performed so that electrodes of an electronic component sucked and held by the suction-and-holding mechanism of the component holding member are bondable to electrodes of a circuit board, a pressing load with which the shaft at the component-holding-member tip portion is pressed against the load-detecting surface of the load-detecting section by the elastic member is detected by the load detecting section, and this detected pressing load is outputted to the control part. In the control part, this pressing load is set as a load-zero point in the load detecting section. Thus, even in a case where the pressing load by the component-holding-member tip portion changes in the load detecting section because of changes of elastic characteristics of the elastic member under influence of heat or the like, there are no differences between an actual contact load upon contact between either the electrodes of the electronic component or the electrodes of the circuit board and bonding members, and a detected value of the contact load detected by the load detecting section, thus allowing control of the actual contact load according with a preset contact load to be achieved. Thus, in a case where mounting to the circuit board is iteratively performed for a plurality of electronic components, individual electronic components can be put into association with the circuit board constantly with a preset contact load, so that a stable bonding quality of electronic components to the circuit board can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0373">According to the twenty-ninth aspect of the invention, the suction-and-holding mechanism in the component holding member, the shaft, and the load detecting section have their centers positioned coaxially on one axis that is positioned parallel to the axis of up/down operations of the component holding member performed by the up-and-down moving mechanism. Thus, the suction-and-holding mechanism, the shaft, and the load detecting section are moved up and down on the same axis. Further, in the component holding member, an end portion of the shaft in the component-holding-member tip portion is pressed against the load-detecting surface of the load detecting section by the elastic member, which is fitted to the support portion to support the shaft. Thus, it becomes possible for the load detecting section to detect a load that acts in the coaxial direction of the component-holding-member tip portion. Then, by a contact load occurring between electrodes of an electronic component sucked and held by the suction-and-holding mechanism of the component holding member and electrodes of a circuit board upon contact between these electrodes and bonding members, the end portion of the shaft in the component-holding-member tip portion is pressed against the load-detecting surface of the load detecting section, thus making it possible for the load detecting section to detect the contact load by the load detecting section with reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0374">Therefore, contact between the electrodes of the electronic component or the electrodes of the circuit board and the bonding members can be detected by detection of the contact load in the load detecting section, and moreover, the component holding member is moved down in small steps by the up/down moving mechanism so that the actual contact load can be more accurately controlled so as to become a preset contact load. Accordingly, in a case where mounting to a circuit board is iteratively performed for a plurality of electronic components, the actual contact load can be more accurately controlled so as to become a preset contact load constantly. Thus, a contact position upon contact of each electronic component with the circuit board can be made more uniform, an interval pitch between the electrodes of the electronic component can be made narrower, and mounting onto the circuit board can be achieved while a bonding position relative to the circuit board is kept more stable for electronic components to which high precision for the bonding position relative to the circuit board is required, such as high-end electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375">According to the thirtieth aspect of the invention, the component holding member further includes a pressing mechanism having two pneumatic cylinders different in inner diameter from each other. Therefore, for example, in a case where an electronic component is a general-purpose electronic component to which high bonding precision is not required, and where the general-purpose electronic component is mounted onto a circuit board, a pneumatic cylinder of an inner diameter suitable for a load of use is selected from the pneumatic cylinders, and compressed air is supplied to this selected pneumatic cylinder. By utilizing pressure of this supplied compressed air, the pneumatic cylinder is operated, causing the component-holding-member tip portion to be moved down, so that electrodes of the general-purpose electronic component sucked and held by the suction-and-holding mechanism can be pressed, along with electrodes of the circuit board, against bonding members therebetween. Thus, it becomes possible to operate the pneumatic cylinders by pressure of compressed air, so that the general-purpose electronic component can be mounted with a high mounting speed by the local reflow mounting method of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0376">In addition to this, at least one pneumatic cylinder, out of the two pneumatic cylinders of different inner diameters, includes a restricting mechanism for restricting operations of the one pneumatic cylinder. Therefore, for example, in a case where an electronic component is a high-end electronic component to which high bonding precision is required, and where the high-end electronic component is mounted onto a circuit board, compressed air is supplied to the pneumatic cylinder including the restricting mechanism out of the pneumatic cylinders, thereby activating the pneumatic cylinder, by which the other pneumatic cylinder is pressed and operation of the other pneumatic cylinder is restricted. Further, in this state, restricting operation of the pneumatic cylinder including the restricting mechanism by the restricting mechanism results in a state that operations of the two pneumatic cylinders are restricted, wherein the component-holding-member tip portion and the component-holding-member body portion in the component holding member can each be in an integrated-structure state. As a result, the component holding member can be made in a structural state similar to that of the component holding member of the twenty-first aspect, and therefore, like the effects of the twenty-first aspect, contact between either electrodes of a high-end electronic component or electrodes of a circuit board and bonding members can be detected by detection of a contact load in the load detecting section, and moreover, the component holding member is moved down in small steps by the up/down moving mechanism so that an actual contact load can be more accurately controlled so as to become a preset contact load. Accordingly, in a case where mounting to a circuit board is iteratively performed for a plurality of the high-end electronic components, an actual contact load can be more accurately controlled so as to become a preset contact load constantly. Thus, a contact position upon contact of each high-end electronic component with the circuit board can be made more uniform, an interval pitch between the electrodes of the electronic component can be made narrower, and mounting onto the circuit board can be achieved while a bonding position relative to the circuit board is kept more stable for electronic components for which high precision for the bonding position relative to the circuit board is required, such as high-end electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0377">According to the thirty-first aspect of the invention, the restricting mechanism includes a recessed portion of a rod of a pneumatic cylinder having the restricting mechanism, a guide hole, and a bar member which extends through the hole and which is fittable into the recessed portion. Thus, by inserting the bar member through hole so that the bar member is fitted into the recessed portion, it becomes possible to mechanically restrict operations of the pneumatic cylinder having the restricting mechanism with a simpler mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0378">According to the thirty-second aspect of the invention, a large cylinder is provided in the component-holding-member body portion, and a small cylinder is provided in the component-holding-member tip portion. By this arrangement, increase in weight due to placement of the pneumatic cylinders at the component-holding-member tip portion supported by the component-holding-member body portion via the elastic member can be suppressed. Thus, smaller contact loads can be detected, so that an actual contact load can be controlled with higher controllability so as to become a preset contact load.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0379">Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom. For example, even though the electrodes have been described as being distinct from solder that forms the bonding members, insofar as the appended claims are concerned an “electrode” is considered to be any electrically conductive member that functions as an electrode, including a combination of electrode <b>4</b><i>a </i>and solder portion <b>2</b>, or a combination of electrode <b>1</b><i>a </i>and other electrically conductive material thereon.</p>
