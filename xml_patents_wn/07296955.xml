<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims Paris Convention priority of DE 10 2006 009 422.0 filed on Feb. 23, 2006.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention concerns a device for examining the precision of the motion of a working spindle of an NC-controlled machine tool along a circular path for producing circular cylindrical surfaces on workpieces, in accordance with the preamble of claim <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are conventional devices of this type, which form the subject matter of DE 295 12 250 U1.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The device advantageously avoids the need for different reference cylinders to examine the precision of different diameters of circular cylindrical surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the device is only suited to examine one single circular path diameter due to the defined separation of the link points of the measuring sensor extending radially relative to the axes of the working spindle and the circular cylindrical surface to be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore the underlying purpose of the invention to further develop a device of the above-mentioned type in such a fashion that it can examine the precision of different circular path diameter sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This object is achieved in accordance with the invention by the characterizing features of the independent claim.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The adjustable and fixable mounting of one of the two parts of the measuring value sensor to one of the two device parts, transversely with respect to the axes of the working spindle and the circular cylindrical surface, permits determination, within a predetermined maximum distance of both axes, of the precision of different diameters of circular cylindrical surfaces to be produced or the precision of the travel of the circular path along which the working spindle must be guided about the center of a circular cylindrical surface, without having to mount additional extensions. Extensions are disadvantageous in that they permit examination only of fixed, defined diameters of circular cylindrical surfaces. In accordance with the invention, the mounting must not be adjusted in steps, but can be adjusted continuously up to a diameter of 1200 mm and, in particular, at a separation of 1/100 mm. Thus, the invention can measure circular cylindrical surfaces whose diameters differ in a range of up to 1/100 mm. Towards this end, the device part that can be fixed to the machine table, in particular, by magnetic force, thereby forming an installation unit, must be correspondingly positioned in a radial direction towards the working spindle relative to the other device part which is fixed to the spindle side. The device part may also be fixed using clamping jaws, screws or a clamping device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The particular design of the measuring value sensor for variable installation of the device for circular path examination of the working spindle may vary. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, a clamping device, which receives the partial piece, is provided on the device part which is adjustably connected to the partial piece of the measuring value sensor, the clamping device being pivotable about an axis which is perpendicular to the working spindle axis and to the longitudinal axis of the measuring value sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment of the measuring value sensor in accordance with the invention, a partial piece of the measuring value sensor forms a stable adjustable measuring arm which has a circular cylindrical cross-section, and is cylindrically hollow over at least part of its length for installation of the measuring value sensor components therein.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Threaded adjusting nuts can be provided as adjusting means of the measuring value sensor which can be urged against opposite sides of the clamping device and are guided on an outer thread of its measuring arm. These adjusting means provide exact diameter adjustment of the circular cylindrical surfaces. In a further improvement, the measuring arm and the clamping device are designed such that the measuring arm length which is effective for diameter examination can be easily determined via indices.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the measuring arm of the measuring value sensor can be replaced by others having a different length. The device can thereby be adjusted quickly and easily to different measuring tasks or measuring distances.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one construction variant, the measuring arm can be extended by partial arm pieces that can be axially joined. This is advantageous in that measuring arms of different lengths are not required and in case of damage, the measuring arm can be easily exchanged or replaced by others having different measuring paths, e.g. +1, +2, +5, +10 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Finally, the measuring value sensor may also be combined with a measuring arm, such that only the latter is adjustably held on a device part.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show an embodiment of a measuring value sensor, designated in total with <b>21</b>, of an examination device <b>10</b>, with one device part of the examination device <b>10</b> being fixed to a machine table of a machine tool.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Only one device part is shown and bears a partial piece <b>20</b>′ of the measuring value sensor <b>21</b> forming the measuring arm <b>20</b>. It is thereby noted that further constructive features of the examination device <b>10</b> are given in DE 295 12 250 U1 which discloses all details of the device part, designated in total with <b>24</b>, which is to be mounted on the table side, except for the measuring arm <b>20</b> and its clamping device <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Analogous to this conventional examination device, the device part <b>24</b> (called installation unit below) which is to be provided on the table side (see DE 295 12 250 U1) has an associated clamping member <b>12</b> forming the further device part, which is to be mounted e.g. in clamping jaws of a working spindle in an NC-controlled machine tool.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The measuring arm <b>20</b>, hinged to the clamping member <b>12</b>, extends radially relative to the spindle axis <b>14</b> and is held via the clamping device <b>22</b> on the installation unit <b>24</b>, such that it can be adjusted in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The installation unit <b>24</b> must be oriented on the clamping surface <b>26</b> of a machine table <b>28</b>, which receives it, or optionally on a clamping angle provided thereon, such that the geometrical longitudinal axis <b>30</b> of the installation unit <b>24</b> is exactly located at that position where the geometrical axis of a circular cylindrical workpiece surface to be finished or optionally reworked e.g. through cutting such as milling, is located during processing of the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For processing thereof, the clamping member of the examination device on the clamping jaws of the working spindle must be replaced by a corresponding processing tool.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In view of the positioning requirements of the two device parts for the circular path of tool advance motion to be tested, reference is made to the corresponding very extensive explanations in the above-mentioned utility model.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A shaft encoder <b>32</b>, preferably designed as an angular encoder is integrated in the installation unit <b>24</b>, coaxially with respect to the longitudinal axis <b>30</b>, and preferably has a reference marking and/or direction recognition. It is thereby possible to exactly determine the zero point of the rotary motion of the measuring value sensor <b>21</b> and also the rotary direction and rotary speed. In this fashion, its angular position can be precisely detected.</p>
