The decorative panel has an outer surface and an inner surface and includes a first chemical composition. The support panel has a first surface and a second surface and includes a fiber composition. The fiber composition is incompatible with the first chemical composition. A second chemical composition is integrated into the support panel at the first surface. The second chemical composition is compatible with the first chemical composition. Due to this second chemical composition present at the first surface, the fiber composition in the support panel can be bonded to the inner surface of the decorative panel.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The subject invention generally relates to a shutter assembly. More specifically, the subject invention relates to an impact-resistant shutter assembly that does not fracture upon impact from debris.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As is known in the art, shutters are used for both aesthetic and functional purposes on a dwelling, such as a residential or commercial building. Aesthetically, shutters are utilized to add décor and character to the dwelling. Although these decorative types of shutters typically remain in an open position on the dwelling, they create an appearance of being a functional shutter.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, in a closed position, the shutters are used for functional purposes. These functional shutters typically include a decorative panel and a support panel backing, or supporting, the decorative panel. These functional shutters pivot from the open position to the closed position and operate to protect windows, doors, and other openings of the dwelling during inclement weather, such as precipitation storms, wind storms, and hurricanes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the shutters of the prior art are deficient. More specifically, because the decorative shutters are not intended for functional purposes, they are manufactured from raw materials that do not provide adequate protection to dwellings. The functional shutters of the prior art, even in the closed position, are deficient in that they do not satisfy ASTM Standard Specifications for “Storm Shutters” as required according to the International Building Code (IBC). These shutters are not impact-resistant. Instead, these shutters fracture upon impact from debris, such as windborne debris that is particularly active during the inclement weather. Ultimately, the conventional shutters do not adequately protect the windows, doors, and other openings of the dwelling during the inclement weather.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some shutters have attempted to incorporate certain compositions into the decorative panel and the support panel to bolster the impact resistance provided by the shutter. However, these attempts have not compatibilized the compositions between the decorative panel and the support panel. As a result, the support panel may not be adequately bonded to the decorative panel such that the support panel does not adequately back, or support, the decorative panel, and the decorative panel frequently fractures independent of the support panel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Due to the deficiencies in the shutters of the prior art, including those described above, it is desirable to provide a novel shutter assembly that satisfies the ASTM Standard Specifications as required by the IBC such that the shutter assembly is impact-resistant and does not fracture upon impact from debris.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND ADVANTAGES</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An impact-resistant shutter assembly is disclosed. In one embodiment of the subject invention, the shutter assembly includes a decorative panel having an outer surface and an inner surface and a support panel having a first surface and a second surface. The decorative panel comprises a first chemical composition and the support panel comprises a fiber composition that is incompatible with the first chemical composition.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A second chemical composition is integrated into the support panel at the first surface. The second chemical composition is compatible with the first chemical composition of the decorative panel.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to the Figures, wherein like numerals indicate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views, an impact-resistant shutter assembly is generally disclosed at <b>10</b>. The shutter assembly <b>10</b> is used for both aesthetic and functional purposes on a dwelling <b>12</b>, such as a residential building (as disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or a commercial building. The shutter assembly <b>10</b> is mounted to the dwelling <b>12</b> via a plurality of fasteners, such as hinges and screws and the like. These fasteners are not disclosed in the Figures as they are not pertinent to the subject invention. The shutter assembly <b>10</b> of the subject invention is used functionally to pivot from an open position to a closed position to protect windows, doors, and other openings of the dwelling <b>12</b> during inclement weather, such as precipitation storms, wind storms, and hurricanes. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one shutter assembly <b>10</b> is disclosed in an open position, and the other shutter assembly <b>10</b> is disclosed in the closed position. The shutter assemblies <b>10</b> are pivotable between the open position and the closed position. The shutter assembly <b>10</b> functions to protect the dwelling <b>12</b> by absorbing impact from debris, such as windborne debris that is particularly active during inclement weather.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is to be understood that one shutter assembly <b>10</b> according to the subject invention is a single shutter. That is, one shutter assembly <b>10</b> is one left side shutter or one right side shutter such that two shutter assemblies <b>10</b> are preferred to adequately protect the dwelling <b>12</b>. Referring particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref>, the shutter assembly <b>10</b> is disclosed as a shutter assembly <b>10</b> that is commonly referred to as a raised panel shutter assembly <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref> illustrate various configurations, or styles, of the raised panel shutter assembly <b>10</b>. On the other hand, referring particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3E</figref>, the shutter assembly <b>10</b> is disclosed as a shutter assembly <b>10</b> that is commonly referred to as a board-and-batten shutter assembly <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3E</figref> illustrate various configurations, or styles, of the board-and-batten shutter assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The shutter assembly <b>10</b> includes a decorative panel <b>14</b> and a support panel <b>16</b>. For the descriptive purposes of the subject invention, use of the terminology panel is synonymous with the terminology layer. The decorative panel <b>14</b> has an outer surface <b>18</b> and an inner surface <b>20</b>. Although not required, it is preferred that the decorative panel <b>14</b> has a thickness ranging from 12 to 19, preferably from 13 to 16, mm. Also, the decorative panel <b>14</b> includes a first chemical composition. In preferred embodiments of the subject invention, the first chemical composition is further defined as a first thermoplastic resin composition, including polyvinyl chloride (PVC). As understood by those skilled in the art, a thermoplastic resin composition is capable of softening when heated and hardening, or re-setting, again when cooled. One suitable decorative panel <b>14</b> is commercially available as Komatex® from Kommerling of Huntsville, Ala. It is to be understood that, instead of PVC, the first chemical composition may include chemical and functional equivalents of PVC including, but not limited to, polyvinyl acetate (PVAc).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The support panel <b>16</b> has a first surface and a second surface. For clarification in the Figures, the first and second surfaces of the support panel are disclosed but not numbered. Although not required, it is preferred that the support panel <b>16</b> has a thickness of approximately 0.080 inches, or from 1.5 to 3 mm. Ultimately, the first surface of the support panel <b>16</b> is bonded to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the decorative panel <b>14</b>. This bond is described additionally below. The support panel <b>16</b> includes a fiber composition that is different from, and incompatible with, the first chemical composition of the decorative panel <b>14</b>. The fiber composition of the support panel <b>16</b> is incompatible with the first chemical composition in that the fiber composition cannot be directly bonded to the first chemical composition. The fiber composition comprises at least one of polypropylene fibers, polyester fibers, and aromatic polyamide fibers. These fibers cannot be directly bonded to the first chemical composition, e.g. to the PVC, of the decorative panel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is also preferred that the fiber composition of the support panel <b>16</b> further include glass fibers, i.e., fiber glass. If included, the glass fibers are preferably continuous filament glass fibers to maximize the impact resistance provided by the fiber composition to the decorative panel <b>14</b>. However, although it is not preferred, the glass fibers included in the fiber composition may include common chopped fibers, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment of the subject invention, the fiber composition of the support panel <b>16</b> includes the polypropylene fibers and the glass fibers. In another embodiment of the subject invention, the fiber composition of the support panel <b>16</b> includes the polyester fibers and the glass fibers. In a further embodiment of the subject invention, the fiber composition of the support panel <b>16</b> includes a blend of the polypropylene fibers and the polyester fibers and the glass fibers. In yet a further embodiment of the subject invention, the fiber composition of the support panel <b>16</b> includes the aromatic polyamide fibers. If included in the fiber composition, the aromatic polyamide fibers are formed from poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide, which is a nylon-like polymer commercially available as Kevlar® from DuPont of Wilmington, Del. Of course, aromatic polyamide fibers other than Kevlar® are suitable for use in the fiber composition of the subject invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">One suitable support panel <b>16</b> is commercially available as Bulitex® from U.S. Liner Company, a division of American Made, LLC, of Ambridge, Pa. Bulitex® is a thermoplastic composite having a fiber composition that includes continuous, woven fiberglass. In addition to the continuous, woven fiberglass, the fiber composition of Bulitex® also includes the polypropylene fibers, the polyester fibers, or combinations thereof. Alternatively, Kevlar® panels may also be utilized as the support panel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The shutter assembly <b>10</b> of the subject invention further includes a second chemical composition <b>22</b>. The second chemical composition <b>22</b> is integrated into the support panel <b>16</b> at the first surface of the support panel <b>16</b>. The second chemical composition <b>22</b> is compatible with the first chemical composition of the decorative panel <b>14</b>. As such, the fiber composition of the support panel <b>16</b> can be bonded to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the decorative panel <b>14</b>. The fiber composition bonds to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the decorative panel <b>14</b> as described below. In this position, where the support panel <b>16</b> is bonded to the decorative panel <b>14</b>, the fiber composition in the support panel <b>16</b> provides impact resistance to the decorative panel <b>14</b> thereby preventing fracturing of the decorative panel <b>14</b> upon impact from debris.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In preferred embodiments of the subject invention, the second chemical composition <b>22</b>, which is integrated into the support panel <b>16</b> at the first surface of the support panel <b>16</b>, is further defined as a second thermoplastic resin composition, including PVC. As with the first chemical composition, it is to be understood that, instead of PVC, the second chemical composition <b>22</b> may include chemical and functional equivalents of PVC including, but not limited to, polyvinyl acetate (PVAc). Furthermore, although it is not required, it is most preferred that the first chemical composition and the second chemical composition <b>22</b> are identical to optimize the compatibility between the decorative panel <b>14</b> and the support panel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Although the fiber composition of the support panel <b>16</b> is incompatible with the first chemical composition, the fiber composition is not incompatible with the second chemical composition <b>22</b> because the second chemical composition <b>22</b> is actually integrated into the support panel <b>16</b> at the first surface during manufacturing of the support panel <b>16</b> with the fiber composition. During the manufacturing, the second chemical composition <b>22</b> is embedded into the support panel <b>16</b>. Once embedded, the second chemical composition <b>22</b> is coated on the support panel <b>16</b> at the first surface and at the second surface as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The shutter assembly <b>10</b> further comprises a solvent cement <b>24</b>. Solvent cements <b>24</b> are sometimes generically referred to in the art as PVC cements. The solvent cement <b>24</b> is disposed between the support panel <b>16</b> and the decorative panel <b>14</b> for bonding the fiber composition to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the decorative panel <b>14</b>. The solvent cement <b>24</b> bonds the fiber composition to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the decorative panel <b>14</b> through interaction with the second chemical composition <b>22</b>. More specifically, the solvent cement <b>24</b> actually melt bonds the first surface of the support panel <b>16</b> to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the decorative panel <b>14</b>. The solvent cement <b>24</b> softens the second chemical composition <b>22</b> at the first surface of the support panel <b>16</b> and softens the first chemical composition at the inner surface <b>20</b> of the decorative panel <b>14</b> such that the support panel <b>16</b> and the decorative panel <b>14</b> fuse together. Melt bonding is known in the art as a chemical, as opposed to a mechanical, bond.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In certain embodiments of the subject invention, the solvent cement <b>24</b> generally includes at least one of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetone, and cyclohexanone. Preferably, the solvent cement <b>24</b> includes a blend of MEK, THF, and cyclohexanone. The solvent cement <b>24</b> may further include PVC. If included in the solvent cement <b>24</b>, the PVC operates as a carrier resin for the MEK, THF, acetone, and/or cyclohexanone. One solvent cement <b>24</b> suitable for use in the subject invention is commercially available as Christy's Red Hot Blue Glue or Red Hot Clear Glue from T. Christy Enterprises, Inc. of Anaheim, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the embodiment where the fiber composition of the support panel <b>16</b> includes the polypropylene fibers, the solvent cement <b>24</b> bonds the polypropylene fibers to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the decorative panel <b>14</b> through interaction with the second chemical composition <b>22</b>, which is most preferably PVC. The polypropylene fibers provide the impact resistance to the decorative panel <b>14</b> to prevent fracturing of the decorative panel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the embodiment where the fiber composition of the support panel <b>16</b> includes the polyester fibers, the solvent cement <b>24</b> bonds the polyester fibers to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the decorative panel <b>14</b> through interaction with the second chemical composition <b>22</b>, which is most preferably PVC. The polyester fibers provide the impact resistance to the decorative panel <b>14</b> to prevent fracturing of the decorative panel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the embodiment where the fiber composition of the support panel <b>16</b> includes the blend of the polypropylene fibers and the polyester fibers, the solvent cement <b>24</b> bonds the polypropylene and the polyester fibers to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the decorative panel <b>14</b> through interaction with the second chemical composition <b>22</b>, which is most preferably PVC. The polypropylene and polyester fibers provide the impact resistance to the decorative panel <b>14</b> to prevent the fracturing of the decorative panel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the embodiment where the fiber composition of the support panel <b>16</b> includes the aromatic polyamide fibers, the solvent cement <b>24</b> bonds the aromatic polyamide fibers to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the decorative panel <b>14</b> through interaction with the second chemical composition <b>22</b>, which is most preferably PVC. The aromatic polyamide fibers provide the impact resistance to the decorative panel <b>14</b> to prevent the fracturing of the decorative panel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Ultimately, in preferred embodiments of the subject invention, no matter what the make up of the fiber composition is, the solvent cement <b>24</b> bonds the first surface of the support panel <b>16</b> to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the decorative panel <b>14</b> through interaction with PVC in the decorative panel <b>14</b> and the support panel <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the shutter assembly <b>10</b> of the subject invention further includes a second decorative panel <b>26</b> having an outer surface <b>18</b> and an inner surface <b>20</b>. Ultimately, the second surface of the support panel <b>16</b> is bonded to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the second decorative panel <b>26</b> such that the fiber composition in the support panel <b>16</b> can provide impact resistance to the second decorative panel <b>26</b> to prevent fracturing of the second decorative panel <b>26</b> upon impact from debris. The support panel <b>16</b> is essentially laminated between the decorative panel <b>14</b> and the second decorative panel <b>26</b>. Also, like the decorative panel <b>14</b>, the second decorative panel <b>26</b> includes the first chemical composition. As such, the description set forth above pertaining to the first chemical composition in the decorative panel <b>14</b> is also applicable here relative to the second decorative panel <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The second chemical composition <b>22</b>, most preferably PVC, is also integrated into the support panel <b>16</b> at the second surface. As a result, the fiber composition of the support panel <b>16</b> can be bonded to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the second decorative panel <b>26</b>. The fiber composition, therefore, also provides impact resistance to the second decorative panel <b>26</b> to prevent fracturing of the second decorative panel <b>26</b> upon impact from debris.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">If the second decorative panel <b>26</b> is included in the shutter assembly <b>10</b>, then the solvent cement <b>24</b> is also disposed between the support panel <b>16</b> and the second decorative panel <b>26</b> for bonding the fiber composition to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the second decorative panel <b>26</b>. The solvent cement <b>24</b> bonds the fiber composition to the second decorative panel <b>26</b> through interaction with the second chemical composition <b>22</b>. More specifically, in preferred embodiments of the subject invention where the first chemical composition and the second chemical composition <b>22</b> are PVC, the solvent cement <b>24</b> bonds the first surface of the support panel <b>16</b> to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the decorative panel <b>14</b> through interaction with the polyvinyl chloride in the decorative panel <b>14</b> and the support panel <b>16</b>. Similarly, the solvent cement <b>24</b> bonds the second surface of the support panel <b>16</b> to the inner surface <b>20</b> of the second decorative panel <b>26</b> through interaction with the polyvinyl chloride in the second decorative panel <b>26</b> and the support panel <b>16</b>.</p>
