<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a substrate conveyor system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Glass substrates are being used to fabricate active matrix television and computer displays, or for solar panel applications, among others. In a television or computer display application, each glass substrate can form multiple display monitors each of which contains more than a million thin film transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The processing of large glass substrates often involves the performance of multiple sequential steps, including, for example, the performance of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes, physical vapor deposition (PVD) processes, or etch processes. Systems for processing glass substrates can include one or more process chambers for performing those processes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The glass substrates can have dimensions in the range of, for example, about 370 mm by 470 mm up to about 1870 mm by 2200 mm. Moreover, the trend is toward even larger substrate sizes to allow more displays to be formed on the substrate or to allow larger displays to be produced. The larger sizes place even greater demands on the capabilities of the processing systems, which are growing in size and capability as well to handle the larger substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the current production equipment is getting more costly. For example, cluster tools suitable for vacuum processing of large glass substrates, e.g., 1 m<sup>2 </sup>and larger, require a relatively large floor space and are very costly. As such, the incremental cost of adding additional equipment to the production line to increase throughput is very expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, there is a need for an improved system for processing substrates.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of a vacuum conveyor system are provided herein. In one embodiment, apparatus for conveying a substrate includes a vacuum sleeve and a plurality of rollers disposed within the vacuum sleeve for supporting and transporting the substrate thereupon. The plurality of rollers are adapted to simultaneously support the substrate thereupon at a plurality of elevations. A leading edge of the substrate is supported at an elevation above an adjacent one of the plurality of rollers in the direction of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, apparatus for conveying a substrate includes a vacuum sleeve and a plurality of eccentrically-shaped rollers disposed within the vacuum sleeve for supporting and transporting the substrate thereupon. A first one of the plurality of rollers supports a leading edge of the substrate at an elevation above an adjacent one of the plurality of rollers in the direction of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, apparatus for conveying a substrate includes a vacuum sleeve and a plurality of eccentrically-shaped driven rollers disposed within the vacuum sleeve for supporting and transporting the substrate thereupon. The plurality of eccentrically-shaped driven rollers are rotationally out of phase with respect to each other. A first one of the plurality of rollers supports a leading edge of the substrate at an elevation above an adjacent one of the plurality of rollers in the direction of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect of the invention, a method of conveying a substrate is provided. In one embodiment, a method for conveying a substrate includes moving a substrate on a plurality of rollers in a desired direction and raising a leading edge of the substrate with respect to an adjacent roller in the direction of travel.</p>

The vacuum conveyor system may be connected to any load locks or process chambers, including conventional load locks and process chambers. The process chambers may be any process chambers that operate at a vacuum, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chambers, physical vapor deposition (PVD) chambers, atomic layer deposition (ALD) chambers, or any other deposition or other processing chamber that operates at sub-atmospheric pressures.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> depicts a simplified top view of a vacuum conveyor system <b>100</b>. The vacuum conveyor system <b>100</b> comprises a vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> having one or more ports <b>108</b> and enclosing a plurality of rollers <b>104</b> and one or more substrate handlers <b>106</b>. The size of the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> is minimized to provide the smallest possible volume necessary to allow substrate transport therethrough. The small volume facilitates more easily establishing and maintaining a vacuum within the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> and reduces the time required to pump the pressure down to the desired level of vacuum. The smaller dimensions of the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> further increase the robustness of the vacuum conveyor system <b>100</b> by maintaining a smaller volume of vacuum within the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b>, thereby lessening the forces resultant from the pressure differential between the low interior pressure and atmospheric pressure outside of the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Optionally, and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, one or more volume reducers <b>118</b> may be provided to reduce the interior volume of the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b>. The volume reducer may be a solid or hollow member, for example a hollow box, that occupies space within, i.e., reduces the interior volume of, the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, the volume reducers <b>118</b> may be disposed above the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> and between adjacent ports <b>108</b>. The volume reducers <b>118</b> are sized to not interfere with the transport and handling of a substrate <b>190</b> supported on the plurality of roller <b>104</b> or the substrate handlers <b>106</b>. It is contemplated that volume reducers having any shape or size may be placed in any unobtrusive location within the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> to further reduce the interior volume of the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> that must be evacuated and maintained at a desired vacuum pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, determinant factors for the volume of the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> include factors that affect the height, length, and width of the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b>. For example, the height of the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> is constrained by the height of the plurality of rollers and the height to which the substrate must be raised by the substrate handlers <b>106</b>. In one embodiment, the height of the vacuum sleeve is less than about 30 inches. In another embodiment, the height of the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> is less than about 20 inches. The length of the vacuum sleeve is constrained by the number of process chambers <b>120</b> attached thereto and the spacing between the process chambers. The width of the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> is constrained by the width of the substrate and the extra width required for the lateral movement of the substrate by the substrate handlers <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> has one or more ports <b>108</b> for sealably coupling the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> to one or more process chambers. The process chambers may be sealably coupled to the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> in any suitable manner and the process chambers may be mounted flush with the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b>. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, four process chambers <b>120</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>120</b><sub>2</sub>, <b>120</b><sub>3 </sub>and <b>120</b><sub>n </sub>are shown connected to the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> of the vacuum conveyor system <b>100</b> at respective ports <b>108</b>. The ports <b>108</b> couple the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> to the process chambers around a corresponding aperture, e.g., a process chamber slit valve, to facilitate transferring a substrate between the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> and the process chambers <b>120</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>120</b><sub>n</sub>. Coupling the process chambers close to the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> minimizes the horizontal distance that a substrate must move to be transferred by the substrate handlers <b>106</b> from the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> to the substrate support of the respective process chamber, thereby helping to minimize the volume of the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Optionally, a connector <b>116</b> may be disposed between the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> and one or more of the process chambers. The connector <b>116</b> may be an adapter that facilitates mating the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> with process chambers that are unable to be directly coupled to the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b>. Alternatively or in combination, the connector <b>116</b> may be a spacer for positioning a process chamber in a desired location. For example, the connector <b>116</b> may be utilized to more accurately locate a substrate support disposed within a process chamber at a desired distance from the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> to facilitate alignment with the extended position of a respective substrate handler <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The one or more substrate handlers <b>106</b> are dedicated to a particular process chamber and, as such, one substrate handler <b>106</b> is provided proximate each process chamber coupled to the vacuum sleeve, for example, process chambers <b>120</b><sub>1-n </sub>coupled to the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The substrate handlers <b>106</b> generally have an idle position that does not interfere with the substrates traveling on the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> through the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b>, and at least a transfer position suitable for transferring substrates to and from the process chamber. As such, the substrate handlers <b>106</b> only need to have a range of vertical motion and a range of horizontal motion in a direction towards and away from the process chambers, i.e., perpendicular to the length of the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b>, thereby being substantially less expensive than vacuum transfer robots having additional lateral and/or rotational degrees of freedom. It is contemplated that the position of the substrate handler <b>106</b> may controllably fixed at multiple locations within the vertical and horizontal ranges of motion.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Suitable sensors and control systems (not shown) for the substrate handlers <b>106</b> may be provided and integrated with a controller <b>150</b> that controls the operation of the vacuum conveyor system <b>100</b>.

The sensors and control systems may further detect the position of the substrate handlers <b>106</b>—and/or and substrate supported thereon—when the substrate handlers <b>106</b> are utilized to transfer a substrate into or from a respective process chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> respectively depict top and side views of one embodiment of the substrate handler <b>106</b>. The substrate handler <b>106</b> generally includes a substantially flat surface for supporting a substrate thereupon and is configured to travel between the plurality of rollers <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, the substrate handler <b>106</b> includes a bracket <b>302</b> with a plurality of support fingers <b>304</b> extending horizontally therefrom. The support fingers <b>304</b> are positioned between individual ones of the plurality of rollers <b>104</b>, and in retracted position, lie below the height of the plurality of rollers <b>104</b>, so as not to interfere with the motion of the substrate thereover.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The support fingers <b>304</b> of the substrate handler <b>106</b> are vertically positioned by one or more vertical motion assemblies <b>306</b> coupled to the bracket <b>302</b>.

In one embodiment, the pair of vertical motion assemblies <b>306</b> each comprise a pair of vertically stacked actuators <b>340</b>, <b>342</b> that each have an extended and a retracted position. Control of the actuators <b>340</b>, <b>342</b> allow for a retracted position <b>334</b> (both actuators retracted), a transfer position <b>332</b> (one actuator extended, the other retracted), and a raised position <b>330</b> (both actuators extended). The amount of extension needed will be dependent upon the distance between the retracted position, the height of the bottom of a substrate <b>300</b> extended upon a set of lift pins <b>326</b> in a process chamber <b>120</b><sub>n</sub>, and the height of the top of a slit valve <b>322</b> formed in a wall <b>320</b> of the process chamber <b>120</b><sub>n</sub>.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A controller <b>308</b> is provided to control the vertical actuation of the substrate handler <b>106</b>. AC power from an AC power source <b>350</b> is provided through power line <b>352</b> to the controller <b>308</b>. Control signals may be provided through the AC power line by modulating the control signals at varying frequencies. Thus, multiple substrate handlers <b>106</b> may be independently controlled while being connected to the same power line <b>352</b> and AC power source <b>350</b>. The control signals may be provided by a controller <b>150</b> (described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A horizontal motion assembly <b>318</b> provides for horizontal movement of the substrate handler <b>106</b>, e.g., the movement into and out of the process chambers.

In one embodiment, the horizontal motion assembly <b>318</b> includes a stage <b>312</b> movably coupled to a plurality of horizontal rails <b>310</b>. The stage <b>312</b> is coupled to the bottom of the vertical motion assemblies <b>306</b> such that movement of the stage <b>312</b> moves the bracket <b>302</b> and support fingers <b>304</b>.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-B</figref> are schematic top and side views, respectively, of one embodiment of a magnetic rack and pinion drive mechanism suitable for use with embodiments of the substrate handler. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> is a bottom view of the magnetic pinion of the magnetic rack and pinion drive mechanism of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-B</figref>. Referring simultaneously to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-C</figref> (certain elements of the substrate processing system are not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> for the sake of clarity), each magnetic drive mechanism, e.g., drive mechanism <b>590</b>, includes a wheel-shaped magnetic pinion <b>592</b> positioned beneath the tube <b>316</b> containing the extension <b>314</b> of the substrate handler <b>106</b>. At least a portion of the extension <b>314</b> comprises a magnetic rack <b>548</b> corresponding to the magnetic pinion <b>592</b>. A flange <b>542</b> may be formed on one or both sides of the rack <b>548</b> and one or more rotating supports <b>582</b>, <b>584</b> may be positioned to support the rack <b>548</b> and prevent sagging due to gravity or the magnetic coupling to the pinion <b>592</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The magnetic pinion <b>592</b> may be positioned beneath an associated tube <b>316</b> so that it is located outside the processing environment but positioned directly beneath one of the magnetic racks <b>548</b>. The magnetic pinion <b>592</b> is thus separated from the magnetic rack <b>548</b> by a gap having a width, w, (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). The portion of the tube <b>316</b> disposed between the magnetic rack <b>548</b> and the magnetic pinion <b>592</b> is formed of a material having a low magnetic permeability, such as aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Each magnetic pinion <b>592</b> may be coupled to a motor <b>594</b> by a drive shaft <b>596</b>. The axis of rotation (shown by dashed line <b>98</b>) of the drive shaft <b>596</b> and the magnetic pinion <b>592</b> is generally perpendicular to the longitudinal dimension of the magnetic rack <b>548</b>, i.e., perpendicular to the direction of travel of the substrate handler <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Each magnetic pinion <b>592</b> includes a plurality of interleaved pinion magnets <b>500</b><i>a </i>and <b>500</b><i>b </i>of alternating polarity. Each pinion magnet is aligned so that its magnetic axis passes substantially through the axis of rotation <b>598</b> of the magnetic pinion <b>592</b>. Similarly, each rack <b>548</b> includes a plurality of interleaved rack magnets <b>510</b><i>a </i>and <b>510</b><i>b </i>of alternating polarity. The magnetic axis of each rack magnet is aligned substantially perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the pinion, e.g., along a vertical axis <b>524</b> if the axis of rotation is substantially horizontal. The rack magnets <b>510</b><i>a </i>and <b>510</b><i>b </i>may be recessed so that they are flush with the bottom surface of the rack <b>548</b>, and the pinion magnets may be recessed so that they are flush with the outer rim of the pinion <b>592</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Each magnet in the rack <b>548</b> and the pinion <b>592</b> may be a substantially rectangular plate which is magnetized so that there is a north pole “N” at one face of the plate and a south pole “S” at the opposite face of the plate. For example, pinion magnets <b>500</b><i>a </i>are oriented with their north poles at exterior faces <b>502</b> of the plates and their south poles at interior faces <b>504</b> of the plates. On the other hand, pinion magnets <b>500</b><i>b </i>are oriented with their north poles at interior faces <b>504</b> of the plate and their south poles at exterior faces <b>502</b> of the plates. Similarly, each rack magnet <b>510</b><i>a </i>is oriented with a north pole at an upper face <b>514</b> of the plate and a south pole at a lower face <b>512</b> of the plate. Conversely, each rack magnet <b>510</b><i>b </i>is oriented with a north pole at the lower face <b>512</b> of the plate and a south pole at the upper face <b>514</b> of the plate.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a primary axis of each rack magnet plate (shown by dashed line <b>508</b>) may be arranged with a so-called “helix” angle α between the axis of rotation <b>598</b> and the primary axis <b>508</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the pinion magnet plates may be arranged with the same helix angle α′, between the axis of rotation <b>598</b> of the pinion <b>592</b> and the primary axis <b>508</b>′ of the pinion magnets. The helix angle may be up to about 45 degrees. Alternately, the primary axis of each magnet may be oriented generally parallel to the axis of rotation <b>98</b> of the pinion (α=0 degrees). Thus, the helix angle may be between about 0 and 45 degrees. By positioning the magnets at a helix angle, the variations in the magnetic attraction forces between the rack and pinion magnets as their magnetic fields engage and disengage are reduced, thereby providing a smoother linear motion of the substrate handler <b>106</b>. In either case, at the closest point of approach, the pinion magnet will be substantially coplanar with its associated rack magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The pinion magnets <b>500</b><i>a </i>and <b>500</b><i>b </i>are separated by a pitch P, which is equal to the pitch P′ of the rack magnets <b>510</b><i>a </i>and <b>510</b><i>b</i>. The pitches P and P′ may be about ¼ inch. The specific pitch may be selected based on the strength of the magnets, the weight of the substrate handler and any substrate to be supported thereupon, the width W of the gap between the rack and pinion, and the desired speed at which the substrate handler will move between the sleeve <b>102</b> and the respective process chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the rack and pinion magnets engage as their opposing poles lock together (shown by lines of magnetic force <b>518</b>). If the pinion <b>592</b> is rotating, then as each pinion magnet, e.g., pinion magnet <b>500</b><i>a</i>, moves toward the rack <b>548</b>, it will magnetically couple with the closest magnet of opposing polarity, e.g., rack magnet <b>510</b><i>a</i>. In addition, the adjacent pinion magnets <b>500</b><i>b </i>(of opposite polarity as pinion magnet <b>500</b><i>a</i>) will be magnetically coupled to the adjacent rack magnets <b>510</b><i>b</i>. Thus, as the pinion <b>592</b> rotates, e.g., in the direction shown by arrow <b>506</b>, the substrate handler <b>106</b> will be driven horizontally, i.e., in the direction shown by arrow <b>516</b>. Conversely, if the pinion <b>592</b> rotates in a direction opposite to arrow <b>506</b>, the substrate handler <b>106</b> will be driven in a direction opposite to arrow <b>516</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The alternating polarity of the magnets prevents magnetic coupling slippage between adjacent magnets in the rack and pinion. Also, since the engagement between the rack and pinion is magnetic, there is a slight give in the coupling, so that the motion of the rack is substantially without jittering or mechanical shock. Furthermore, since there are no rotary feedthroughs or direct physical contact between the rack and pinion, the danger of contamination from the drive mechanism is reduced. Specifically, since the motor and pinion are located outside the processing environment of the chambers (i.e., the sealed environment of the vacuum conveyor system and the attached processing chambers and load lock chambers), the processing chambers and load lock chambers should not be contaminated.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, each drive mechanism may include an encoder <b>520</b> which provides input to a control system <b>522</b>, e.g., a general purpose programmable digital computer, to indicate the rotation of the associated drive shaft. The control system <b>522</b> may be the controlled by, or alternatively may be a part of, the controller <b>150</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-B</figref>, in operation, the substrate handler <b>106</b> is initially in the idle position <b>354</b>, wherein the fingers <b>304</b> are disposed below and in between the rollers <b>104</b>. To remove a substrate that may be in a process chamber <b>120</b><sub>n</sub>, the controller raises the vertical motion assemblies <b>306</b> to elevate the fingers <b>304</b> to the transfer position <b>332</b>. The horizontal drive system <b>370</b> then engages the extension <b>314</b> of the horizontal motion assembly <b>318</b> to move the stage <b>312</b> inward toward the processing chamber <b>120</b><sub>n</sub>. The substrate <b>300</b> is raised by the lift pins <b>326</b> on the substrate support <b>324</b> disposed within the process chamber <b>120</b><sub>n</sub>. The fingers <b>304</b> of the substrate handler <b>106</b> in the transfer position <b>332</b> are at a height that allows the fingers <b>304</b> to pass between the bottom surface of the substrate <b>300</b> and the top surface of substrate support <b>324</b>. After moving underneath the substrate <b>300</b>, the substrate handler <b>106</b> is further actuated to the raised position <b>330</b>, which lifts the substrate <b>300</b> off the lift pins <b>326</b>. The substrate handler <b>106</b> may now retract with the substrate <b>300</b> and, once clear of the process chamber <b>120</b><sub>n</sub>, may lower back to the idle position <b>334</b>, which will dispose the substrate <b>300</b> on the surface of the rollers <b>104</b>. A substrate may be placed onto the substrate support <b>324</b> of the process chamber <b>120</b><sub>n </sub>by reversing the above steps.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is contemplated that other ranges of motion may be utilized to transfer substrates into and out of the process chambers. For example, where the substrate lift pins <b>326</b> are controllable to multiple extended positions, the substrate may be lifted off of or placed onto the substrate handler <b>106</b> by raising or lowering the lift pins <b>326</b> rather than by changing the elevation of the substrate handler <b>106</b>. As such, certain embodiments of the substrate handler <b>106</b> may have only two vertical positions, and idle position below the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> and a transfer position suitable for entering and exiting the process chamber <b>120</b><sub>n</sub>.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Although not shown for clarity, the horizontal movement of the inner substrate handler <b>492</b> on a horizontal motion assembly <b>498</b> having a plurality of horizontal rails <b>480</b> is controlled in the same manner as the outer substrate handler <b>490</b>. The plurality of horizontal rails <b>480</b> that support the inner substrate handler <b>492</b> are provided in a position interior of the plurality of horizontal rails <b>410</b> that support the outer substrate handler <b>490</b> to facilitate independent movement and control of the inner and outer substrate handlers <b>490</b>, <b>492</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In operation, substrates may more efficiently be transferred to and from the process chamber <b>120</b><sub>n </sub>by elevating the outer substrate handler <b>490</b> to a transfer position to pick up the substrate <b>400</b>A from within the process chamber <b>120</b><sub>n</sub>. As the outer substrate handler <b>490</b> is picking up substrate <b>400</b>A, substrate <b>400</b>B arrives on the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> in front of the process chamber <b>120</b><sub>n</sub>. The inner substrate handler <b>492</b> then raises the substrate <b>400</b>B and moves into the process chamber <b>120</b><sub>n</sub>. This may be done while the outer substrate handler <b>490</b> is simultaneously withdrawing with the substrate <b>400</b>A just retrieved from the process chamber <b>120</b><sub>n</sub>. The inner substrate handler <b>492</b> may then lower the substrate <b>400</b>B onto the lift pins <b>426</b> of the process chamber <b>120</b><sub>n </sub>and then retract from the process chamber <b>120</b><sub>n</sub>. The inner substrate handler <b>492</b> may then be lowered to the idle position below the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> to allow the outer substrate handler <b>490</b> to lower the substrate <b>400</b>A onto the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> to complete the transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Although described with respect to a vacuum conveyor system, it is contemplated that the substrate handler described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-B</figref> and the nested substrate handler described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref> may be utilized in other systems requiring substrate conveying and transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> facilitate movement of substrates through the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> are driven to control the position of a substrate disposed thereupon. The plurality of rollers <b>104</b> may be driven and controlled by any suitable means and may be “gang” driven (i.e., all driven in concert), driven in independently controllable groups, or independently driven.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> depicts one embodiment of the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> and a drive system therefor. In one embodiment, the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> comprise a plurality of rollers <b>624</b> coupled between bearings <b>604</b>, <b>606</b> disposed at either end of the roller <b>624</b>. The bearing <b>606</b> is coupled to a stanchion <b>608</b> that rests on the bottom of the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b>. Bearing <b>604</b> is coupled to a drive rail <b>602</b> disposed within the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b>. A pulley <b>612</b> is coupled to each of the rollers <b>624</b> and interfaces with a belt <b>610</b> that controls the motion of the rollers <b>624</b>. The pulleys <b>612</b> may also be provided between the rollers <b>624</b> to maintain a proper interface between the pulleys <b>612</b> and the belt <b>610</b>. One or more of the pulleys <b>612</b> may further have a feature, such as grooves or notches <b>614</b> to interface with features formed on the belt (for example, V notches or square teeth formed on the belt) to improve traction between the pulley <b>612</b> and the belt <b>610</b>, and to prevent slippage therebetween. A motor <b>630</b> may be provided to control the motion of the belt <b>610</b>, and thereby the rollers <b>624</b>. The motor <b>630</b> may be coupled to the controller <b>150</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). Each of the rollers <b>624</b> may be controlled by a single motor <b>630</b>. Alternatively, the rollers <b>624</b> may be grouped to provide independent control over substrates traveling in specified regions of the conveyor system.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The rollers <b>624</b> may generally comprise a solid or hollow member. Moreover, the width of the rollers <b>624</b> may be wide enough to support the substrate thereupon using a single roller <b>624</b>. Alternatively, the substrate may be supported at multiple points along the width of the substrate. For example, a single roller <b>624</b> may be “scalloped” or shaped (not shown) or, as shown in the detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, smaller individual rollers <b>622</b> disposed on an axis <b>620</b> may be utilized to support the substrate at multiple spaced-apart locations, thereby reducing the surface contact area between the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> and the substrate. The reduced surface contact area reduces the likelihood of particle generation or damage to the substrate caused by contact between the substrate and the plurality of rollers <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The rollers <b>104</b> are generally spaced close enough to each other to provide adequate support for the substrates being handled to prevent deformation or damage of the substrate. One problem that may arise from such deformation of the substrate is that a leading edge of the substrate may deflect downward due to gravity and come into contact with the subsequent roller of the vacuum conveyer system <b>100</b>, thereby potentially causing damage to the substrate and/or the roller. For example, the leading edge of the substrate may become chipped or fractured upon forceful contact with a subsequent roller. In addition, particles generated by the damage to the substrate or by scraping against the subsequent roller may further damage the substrate. This effect may be exacerbated by the high processing temperatures required in certain processes, which may cause the substrate—particularly a glass substrate—to soften and deflect further downwards.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A through 7C</figref> depict embodiments showing various alignments of the plurality of rollers <b>104</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> are all aligned along a horizontal plane and rotate about an axis <b>704</b>A, such that the substrate <b>700</b> rests flat on the surface of the plurality of rollers <b>104</b>. As the substrate <b>700</b> moves from left to right, as indicated by the arrow, a leading edge <b>702</b> of the substrate <b>700</b> extends past roller <b>710</b>A, and becomes unsupported until the leading edge <b>702</b> reaches roller <b>712</b>A as the substrate <b>700</b> continues to move forward. For applications where the substrate does not appreciably deflect, the arrangement of the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> may be sufficient. However, if the leading edge <b>702</b> of the substrate <b>700</b> deflects downward while unsupported between rollers <b>710</b>A and <b>712</b>A, the leading edge <b>702</b> may come into contact with roller <b>712</b>A, potentially damaging the substrate <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Alternately, the plurality of rollers may be configured to support the substrate in a manner that compensates for any potential sag in the leading edge of the substrate by supporting the substrate in a manner that positions the leading edge of the substrate above any subsequent rollers as the substrate travels along the plurality of rollers. For example, In one embodiment, the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> may be arranged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, wherein the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> comprise eccentric, or cam-shaped rollers. The eccentric rollers support the substrate <b>700</b> at a plurality of elevations due to the non-circular profile of the rollers. The eccentric rollers rotate about an axis <b>706</b>B and may be aligned with respect to one another. Alternatively, the eccentric rollers may be arranged rotationally out of phase with respect to one another such that a plurality of support elevations are provided beneath a given substrate being supported by a subset of the plurality of rollers disposed beneath the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the eccentric rollers may be alternatingly arranged 180 degrees out of phase, such that every other roller (e.g., rollers <b>706</b>B, <b>710</b>B) is aligned with each other, and 180 degrees out of phase with the adjacent rollers (e.g., <b>708</b>B, <b>712</b>B). The eccentric shape of the rollers provide a plurality of support elevations for the substrate <b>700</b> between a first support elevation, for example, the maximum elevation when the eccentricity is pointing upwards, and a second support elevation, for example, the minimum elevation when the eccentricity is pointing downwards. As the substrate <b>700</b> moves from left to right, the leading edge <b>702</b> will be raised by the roller <b>710</b>B, thereby compensating for any downward deflection that may occur to the leading edge <b>702</b> in the unsupported region between roller <b>710</b>B and <b>712</b>B. As such, when the substrate <b>700</b> comes into contact with the roller <b>712</b>B, the leading edge <b>702</b> will not forcibly come into contact with the roller <b>712</b>B. The shape and amount of eccentricity of the roller <b>704</b>B may be controlled to provide smooth transport of the substrate <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition, the position of the substrate <b>700</b> when initially placed on the rollers <b>704</b>B may be controlled in conjunction with the relative rotational position of the rollers <b>704</b>B, such that the leading edge <b>702</b> of the substrate <b>700</b> will always exit and extend from the high portion of a roller as it moves toward an adjacent roller, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. Alternatively, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> may comprise cylindrical rollers mounted on an offset axis <b>704</b>C and disposed eccentrically in an alternating fashion to provide the same raising and lowering effect of the substrate <b>700</b>, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is contemplated that other orientations of eccentric rollers may also be suitably utilized to prevent the leading edge of the substrate from contacting a subsequent roller as the substrate traverses the plurality of rollers. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> depicts a plurality of rollers <b>104</b> similar to those described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, above. However, in this embodiment, the eccentric rollers are sequentially out of phase with respect to each other by illustrative 90 degree increments in a counter-clockwise direction. A roller <b>706</b>D is depicted with the eccentricity facing downwards. Each subsequent roller (rollers <b>708</b>D, <b>710</b>D, and <b>712</b>D, respectively) have the eccentricity extending in a direction 90 degrees counter-clockwise from the previous roller.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The quantity of offset of the eccentricity of the rollers, i.e., rotational degrees out of phase, may be set to a desired angle depending on the spacing of the rollers, the amount of eccentricity of the rollers, and the amount of downward deflection of the substrate. It is contemplated that the quantity of degrees out of phase of the rollers is not limited to 180 and 90 degrees but may be any angle suitable to prevent the leading edge of the substrate from forcefully contacting a roller.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">It is further contemplated that the shape of the eccentric roller is not limited to a single protrusion as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B and 7D</figref>. For example, a roller having any desired profile including single or multiple protrusions may be utilized to control the support elevations of a substrate supported thereon as the roller rotates. In one illustrative embodiment, the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> may comprise oval rollers <b>706</b>E, <b>708</b>E, <b>710</b>E, <b>712</b>E. The oval shape of the rollers may be used to control the support elevation of the substrate <b>700</b>, and particularly of the leading edge <b>702</b> of the substrate, as the substrate traverses, for example, from a leading roller <b>710</b>E to a subsequent roller <b>712</b>E.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It is further contemplated that other configurations of the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> may be utilized to compensate for any sagging of the leading edge of the substrate, such as configurations that control the height of the rollers or that provide a separate mechanism for supporting the leading edge of the substrate. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> depicts a partial schematic side view of one embodiment of the plurality of rollers <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, each of the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> may be coupled to an actuator <b>1102</b>. The actuators <b>1102</b> may be any suitable actuator or mechanism for controlling the support elevation of the plurality of rollers <b>104</b>, such as pneumatic or hydraulic actuators, motors, screws, and the like. Each actuator <b>1102</b> may be individually controlled to selectively and dynamically adjust the position of any of the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> with respect to each other as the substrate traverses the plurality of rollers <b>104</b>. For example, in the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the leading edge <b>702</b> of the substrate <b>704</b> is supported by a roller <b>1110</b> that is raised at least with respect to a subsequent roller <b>1112</b>. Alternatively or in combination, the subsequent roller in the direction of travel, e.g., roller <b>1112</b>, may be lowered, as shown in phantom, to further facilitate the smooth transition of the leading edge <b>702</b> to the roller <b>1112</b>. Although described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B-E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> as incorporated into a vacuum conveyor system, it is contemplated that the roller configurations described may be utilized in other conveying and processing systems where compensation for any sag of the leading edge of a substrate is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a load lock <b>110</b> is coupled to the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> at each of a first end <b>112</b> and a second end <b>114</b> of the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b>. A pressure control system (not shown), including pumps, ports, valves, meters, and the like, may be coupled to the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> to control the pressure within the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> at a desired level. For example, the pressure in the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> may be maintained at or near the pressure as is maintained within the process chambers to minimize changes in pressure upon transferring substrates between the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> and the process chambers, thereby conserving the time required to re-adjust the chamber pressures to appropriate processing levels and further minimizing contamination of the process chamber by any particles that may be carried into the process chamber due to an increase in the chamber pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A controller <b>150</b> is provided to facilitate control and integration of the vacuum conveyor system <b>100</b>. The controller <b>150</b> typically comprises a central processing unit (CPU), memory, and support circuits (not shown). The controller <b>150</b> may be coupled to various components of the vacuum conveyor system <b>100</b> in order to control movement and/or processing of the substrate. For example, the controller <b>150</b> may control the plurality of rollers <b>104</b>, the substrate handlers <b>106</b>, the pressure control system, and the like. The controller <b>150</b> may be coupled to or may be the same as a controller provided to control other components such as any load locks and/or process chambers coupled to the vacuum conveyor system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> discloses another embodiment of a vacuum conveyor system <b>200</b>. The vacuum conveyor system <b>200</b> is similar to the vacuum conveyor system <b>100</b> described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, except that the vacuum conveyor system <b>200</b> has two vacuum sleeves <b>102</b> running parallel to each other. The two vacuum sleeves <b>102</b> have one or more process chambers <b>220</b> disposed therebetween and sealably coupled to the vacuum sleeves <b>102</b> by respective connectors <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The vacuum conveyor system <b>200</b> having two vacuum sleeves <b>102</b> facilitates increased processing throughput. The two vacuum sleeves <b>102</b> also facilitate continued processing in the event of a failure of one of the vacuum sleeves. Optionally, the vacuum sleeves <b>102</b> may be selectively isolatable from each other, for example by a valve or other suitable mechanism, to allow continued processing through the operable vacuum sleeve without maintaining a vacuum in the inoperable vacuum sleeve. In addition, maintenance or inspection of the inoperable vacuum sleeve may be performed while continuing to process substrates through the operable vacuum sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The process chambers <b>220</b> utilized with the vacuum conveyor system <b>200</b> have a pass-through design, i.e., they have slit valves located on opposing sides of the process chamber <b>220</b>, allowing a substrate to enter on one side of the process chamber <b>220</b> and exit on an opposite side of the process chamber <b>220</b>. As such, substrate handlers <b>106</b> are provided on both sides of the process chamber <b>220</b> to facilitate moving the substrate into and out of the process chamber <b>220</b> at either end. In one embodiment, the substrate handlers <b>106</b> may be the substrate handler described herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-B</figref>. Alternatively, the substrate handlers <b>106</b> may comprise the nested substrate handlers as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A connector sleeve <b>202</b> is coupled between at least one end of the vacuum sleeves <b>102</b> to facilitate moving substrates from one vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> to the other without going through the process chambers <b>220</b>. The connector sleeve <b>202</b> contains a plurality of rollers <b>204</b> to facilitate moving the substrate through the connector sleeve <b>202</b>. The plurality of rollers <b>204</b> may be configured similarly to the plurality of rollers <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, the plurality of rollers <b>204</b> are configured similar to the plurality of rollers described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, two connector sleeves <b>202</b> are coupled between the vacuum sleeves <b>102</b>, one connector sleeve <b>202</b> at either end. Although any angle is contemplated, the connector sleeves <b>202</b> are substantially perpendicularly coupled to the vacuum sleeves <b>102</b> for ease of fabrication and operation. A substrate handler <b>206</b> is provided at least at one of the interfaces between vacuum sleeves <b>102</b> and connector sleeves <b>202</b> to facilitate moving the substrate between the rollers <b>104</b> in the vacuum sleeves <b>102</b> and the rollers <b>204</b> in the connector sleeve <b>202</b>. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one substrate handler <b>206</b> is provided at each interface between vacuum sleeves <b>102</b> and connector sleeves <b>202</b>, e.g., at each corner of the vacuum conveyor system <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts one embodiment of a substrate handler <b>206</b> for transferring substrates between the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> contained in the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> and the plurality of rollers <b>204</b> contained in the connector sleeve <b>202</b>, as shown in the corners of the vacuum conveying system <b>200</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In one embodiment, a substrate handler <b>806</b> is configured and positioned in the vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> similar to substrate handler <b>106</b> described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. However, instead of extending and retracting the substrate into the process chamber, the substrate handler <b>806</b> extends and retracts to transfer the substrate onto a plurality of lift pins <b>810</b> provided between the plurality of rollers <b>204</b> of the connector sleeve <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In operation, as the substrate passes over the substrate handler <b>806</b> while in retracted position <b>820</b>, the substrate handler <b>806</b> may rise up to lift the substrate off of the plurality of rollers <b>104</b> and move to an extended position <b>822</b> disposed over plurality of rollers <b>204</b> and lift pins <b>810</b>. From the extended position <b>822</b>, the substrate handler <b>806</b> may then lower the substrate onto lift pins <b>810</b> and proceed back to the retracted position <b>820</b>. Alternatively, the lift pins may be configured to extend to a height that facilitates lifting the substrate off of the substrate handler <b>806</b>, which may then proceed to the retracted position <b>820</b>. The lift pins <b>810</b> may then lower the substrate onto the plurality of rollers <b>204</b>, which then move the substrate to the next desired destination.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the vacuum conveyor system disclosed herein is scalable and may be coupled to as few or as many process chambers as required for particular processing requirements. For example, the length of the vacuum sleeves <b>102</b> and the number of ports <b>108</b> provided may be tailored for a particular application. In addition, the vacuum conveyor system may be segmented to facilitate scalability. For example, a segment could be the width of a single process chamber. Multiple segments may be sealably coupled together as desired to form a vacuum conveying system of the desired length to service the desired number of process chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Alternatively, where known numbers of process chambers are used in combination to perform standard processes on substrates, the segments may be larger in order to reduce the number of components, the amount of work needed to seal the chambers together, and the likelihood of leaks, thereby making the vacuum conveyor system more simple and robust. For example, in applications where a cluster of five CVD chambers are typically provided to perform processing of a substrate, a segment of the vacuum conveying system vacuum sleeve <b>102</b> may be five process chambers in width, rather than piecing together five single-chamber width segments.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Furthermore, the vacuum conveyor system may be modular to separate sections utilizing different processes or operating at different pressures. For example, a first module may comprise a first group of process chambers and a second module may comprise a second group of process chambers. The first group and the second group of process chambers may be running processes having different operating pressures. For example, the first group of process chambers may comprise CVD chambers and the second group of chambers may comprise PVD chambers. The two modules may be independently configured as any of the embodiments of vacuum conveyor systems described herein and may be coupled via a load lock to allow transfer between modules without exposing either the substrate or the vacuum conveyor system modules to atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts a vacuum conveying system <b>900</b> having a first vacuum conveying module <b>950</b><sub>1 </sub>coupled to a second vacuum conveying module <b>950</b><sub>n </sub>by a load lock chamber <b>110</b>. Additional load lock chambers <b>110</b> are provided at either end of the first and second vacuum conveying modules <b>950</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>950</b><i>n </i>to provide entrance to and egress from the vacuum conveying system <b>900</b>. The first vacuum conveying module <b>950</b><sub>1 </sub>comprises a vacuum sleeve <b>902</b> having rollers <b>904</b> and substrate handlers <b>906</b> contained therein. A connector <b>908</b> is provided to interface with one or more process chambers <b>920</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>920</b><sub>n</sub>. A dedicated substrate handler <b>906</b> is provided for each process chamber. The second vacuum conveyor module <b>950</b><sub>n </sub>similarly comprises a vacuum sleeve <b>912</b> having rollers <b>914</b> and substrate handlers <b>916</b> disposed therein, and interfaces with one or more process chambers <b>930</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>930</b><sub>n</sub>. A dedicated substrate handler <b>916</b> is provided for each process chamber <b>930</b><sub>n</sub>. The vacuum sleeves, plurality of rollers, and substrate handlers may comprise any of the embodiments described herein and further include all other components required to operate the vacuum conveyor system, such as the vacuum pumps, controllers, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As the first and the second vacuum conveyor modules <b>950</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>950</b><sub>n </sub>are sealed from each other via load lock <b>110</b>, they may be held at different levels of vacuum. For example, where process chambers <b>920</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>920</b><sub>n </sub>are running a process utilizing a different level of vacuum than process chambers <b>930</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>930</b><sub>n</sub>, the first and second vacuum conveyor modules <b>950</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>950</b><sub>n </sub>may be held at respective vacuum levels correlating to the vacuum level of the particular process chambers connected to that vacuum conveyor module. For example, CVD processes generally operate at a higher pressure than PVD processes. As such, the process chambers <b>920</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>920</b><sub>n </sub>may be a cluster of CVD chambers separated by the load lock <b>110</b> from the process chambers <b>930</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>930</b><sub>n</sub>, which may be a cluster of PVD process chambers. In this example, the pressure maintained in the vacuum conveyor module <b>950</b><sub>1 </sub>may be substantially equal to the pressure maintained in the CVD process chambers <b>920</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>920</b><sub>n</sub>, while the pressure maintained in the vacuum conveyor module <b>950</b><sub>n </sub>may be substantially equal to the lower pressure maintained in the PVD process chambers <b>930</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>930</b><sub>n</sub>.</p>

The system <b>1000</b> generally comprises a first vacuum conveyor module <b>1010</b> coupled to a second vacuum conveyor module <b>1020</b> through a load lock <b>110</b>. Additional load locks <b>110</b> are provided at the opposing ends of the vacuum conveyor modules <b>1010</b> and <b>1020</b> to provide entrance to and egress from the vacuum conveyor modules <b>1020</b> and <b>1020</b>. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an atmospheric conveyor <b>1002</b> is coupled to the first module <b>1010</b> via the load lock <b>110</b>. The atmospheric conveyor <b>1002</b> allows coupling to processing chambers that do not operate at a vacuum.

Process chambers <b>1008</b> may be, for example, pre-deposition cleaning chambers. In one embodiment, the pre-deposition cleaning chambers each run a sixty-second process having an eight-second transfer time, yielding a sixty-eight second total actual cycle time (TACT). The sixty-eight second TACT corresponds to the fifty-two substrates per hour handled by each process chamber <b>1008</b>. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, three pre-deposition cleaning chambers <b>1008</b> are provided and may run in parallel to provide a total substrate throughput of 156 substrates per hour.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As each substrate is finished being processed, it is transferred through the load lock <b>110</b> to the first vacuum conveyor module <b>1010</b>, which is held at a first vacuum pressure. The first vacuum conveyor module <b>1010</b> comprises a vacuum conveyor <b>1012</b> and a plurality of process chambers <b>1014</b>. The vacuum conveyor <b>1012</b> is similar to the vacuum conveyor systems described in the various embodiments detailed above. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, twenty process chambers <b>1014</b> are disposed within the first vacuum conveyor module <b>1010</b>. In one embodiment, the process chambers <b>1014</b> are CVD process chambers. The CVD chambers may be configured to perform various processes, such as depositing a gate silicone nitride layer, amorphous silicone layer, and a doped silicone layer. These processes each may be performed in the same or different process chamber <b>1014</b>, at a throughput of six substrates per hour per chamber. Multiplied by twenty chambers, the total throughput for the first vacuum conveyor module <b>1010</b> equals 120 substrates per hour.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Once the substrates are finished being processed within the first vacuum conveyor module <b>1010</b>, they proceed through the vacuum conveyor <b>1012</b> to load lock <b>110</b> and into the second vacuum conveyor module <b>1020</b>. The second vacuum conveyor module <b>1020</b> comprises a vacuum conveyor <b>1022</b>, as previously described, and a plurality of process chambers <b>1024</b>. In one embodiment, six process chambers <b>1024</b> are provided. The process chambers <b>1024</b> in the second module may be PVD chambers, which operate at a higher vacuum level than the CVD chambers of the first module. As such, the vacuum conveyor <b>1022</b> of the second vacuum conveyor module <b>1020</b> is maintained at a higher level of vacuum than the vacuum conveyor <b>1012</b> of the first vacuum conveyor module <b>1010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The PVD chambers <b>1024</b> may be arranged to perform various vacuum processes on the substrate. In one embodiment, two of the process chambers <b>1024</b> are configured to deposit a layer of molybdenum on the substrate. For example, a 1,000-angstrom thick layer of molybdenum may be deposited on the substrate at a rate of approximately 2,500 angstroms per minute. Such a process generally has a twenty-four second process time, ten seconds of overhead, and an eight second transfer time, yielding a 42 second TACT. The 42 second TACT corresponds to 85 substrates per hour in each chamber, yielding a total substrate throughput for the two chambers of 170 substrates per hour.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Three of the process chambers <b>1024</b> may be configured to deposit a layer of aluminum or other metal on the substrate. For example, a 3,000-angstrom layer of aluminum may be deposited on the substrate at a rate of approximately 3,000 angstroms per minute. Such a process generally has a sixty second process time, ten seconds of overhead, and an eight second transfer time, yielding a total of 78 second TACT. The 78 second TACT corresponds to 48 substrates per hour per chamber, which for three chambers yields a total throughput of 138 substrates per hour.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Finally, a process chamber <b>1024</b> may be configured to deposit a layer of molybdenum on the substrate. For example, a 500-angstrom layer of molybdenum may be deposited on the substrate at a rate of approximately 2,500 angstroms per minute. Such a process generally has a twelve second process time, ten seconds of overhead, and an eight second transfer time, which yields a TACT of 30 seconds. The 30-second TACT corresponds to a throughput of about 120 substrates per hour.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Upon completion of processing of PVD processes in the second vacuum conveyor module <b>1020</b>, process substrate exits the module <b>1020</b> through load lock <b>110</b> to an atmospheric conveyor <b>1004</b>, where the substrate is moved for continued processing. As the total processing throughput depends upon the slowest processing times, the hybrid CVD/PVD processing system <b>1000</b> described above has a total throughput of about 120 substrates per hour.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Thus embodiments, of a vacuum conveyor system have been provided. The vacuum conveyor system may utilize conventional vacuum processing chambers and is scalable, segmented, and/or modular. The vacuum conveyor system has a small volume that is easier to maintain at vacuum pressures and contains dedicated substrate handlers for each process chamber. Modular vacuum conveyor systems may be coupled by load locks and independently maintained at vacuum pressures corresponding to the process chambers attached to the respective module. The vacuum conveyor system contains a roller drive system that controls the movement of substrates through the system. The roller drive system may be configured to compensate for sagging of the leading edge of the substrate in unsupported areas between rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Although the above embodiments mainly refer to linear vacuum conveyor systems, it is contemplated that the vacuum conveyor systems may be parallel with offset axes or linked together non-linearly. For example, the vacuum conveyor system or modules may connect perpendicularly, or be linked together by a vacuum sleeve that provides another angle of alignment, including a “U” shaped configurations. Furthermore, although the above embodiments have been described mainly with respect to glass substrates, it is contemplated that the vacuum conveyor system disclosed herein may be useful for transporting and processing other substrates, for example polymer substrates or semiconductor substrates, that undergo serial vacuum processing.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow.</p>
