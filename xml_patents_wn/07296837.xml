<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to load carriers for vehicles having bed structures, and more specifically, to vehicles having bed structures comprising internal bed rail systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Load carriers, and particularly sports equipment carriers, for vehicles having bed structures are known devices for transporting cargo above the bed structure of a vehicle. Common uses of such load carriers can include the transport of generally elongate objects, such as ladders, piping, lumber, construction materials, etc. Likewise, sport related uses of such load carriers can include the transport of canoes, kayaks, paddles and similar equipment. An example of a particularly commercially successful load carrier for a vehicle having a bed structure is Thule's XSPORTER carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> of the present application, the XSPORTER carrier broadly includes a plurality of upright base support members each configured for securing a generally vertically adjustable upright member. A pair of upright members is shown as securing a load bearing crossbar member therebetween such that cargo can be set and secured thereon. Each upright base support member includes a generally flat, planar lower surface configured for resting and being clampably secured to the top rail of a truck bed side wall. Heretofore, top rails of pickup truck beds were primarily formed from a single ply of relatively rigid sheet metal bent upon itself to form a generally inverted J-shaped structure forming a hollow. To clampably secure a base support member to the top rail, a clamping assembly was used in conjunction with the base support member to apply a clamping force upon the upper and lower surfaces of the top rail.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">While the above-described XSPORTER carrier and associated clamping assemblies remain popular and successful, they are, however, occasionally incapable of securing load carriers upon some types of new vehicles; i.e., pickup trucks having new types of top rail structure and/or internal bed rail systems; examples include the 2006 TOYOTA TACOMA, 2006 HONDA RIDGELINE, AND 2006 NISSAN TITAN AND FRONTIER pickup trucks. In these examples the new top rail structures are not generally J-shaped and/or do not generally allow ready access to the upper and lower surfaces of the top rail. Similarly, current load carriers and clamping assemblies therefor are not configured for being secured to the rails of the internal bed rail systems of these newer vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It should be appreciated that a primary reason that the vehicle manufacturers have changed to these alternative configurations are predominantly cost driven. To reach this goal, more of the truck bed components, including those relied upon for securing load carriers of the type presently addressed, are made from plastic, composites and similar materials that are significantly more flexible than the traditional sheet metal used in pickup bed construction. This loss in structural rigidity further contributes to the difficulties experienced in mounting load carriers of the present type upon pickup trucks where these carriers have traditionally relied heavily upon the fortitude of the top rail of the truck bed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An effect of the truck manufacturers using installed rail systems for receiving such things as load carrier mountings in the pickup truck beds is that the rail configurations on different makes and models of trucks now vary widely. This presents a problem for load carrier manufacturers in that the use of universal mounting hardware is no longer possible and a wide variety of differently configured mounting hardware must be provided in order to accommodate owners of different vehicles. This means that this cost-saving move of the truck manufacturers has resulted in a cost increase to the load carrier manufacturers. Therefore, a goal of the present invention is to minimize this detrimental impact on load carrier manufacturers while at the same time providing a superior truck bed style load carrier to consumers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention satisfies the goals outlined above for the load carrier manufacturers, as well as the consumers that use such vehicle carriers. In a first instance, the invention utilizes mounting hardware comprising three primary components. In this manner, the invention enables the use of substantially universal top and bottom mount assembly pieces, with a intermediate third piece or component that acts as an adapter and which customizes the mounting assembly for a particular vehicle's configuration. The primary benefit of this strategy is that only one part of the mount needs to be supplied in different configurations for accommodating the different truck bed designs. Therefore, the present invention in at least one embodiment takes the form of a mounting arrangement for a truck bed load carrier in which an array of these intermediate pieces may be supplied with a complement of standard top and bottom pieces in order to provide a full array of mounts for a number of differently configured pickup trucks. Not only is this cost savings strategy beneficial to the load carrier manufacturers, but also to their distributors and retailers who can now maintain smaller product inventory while accommodating the same number of vehicle designs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention also derives a benefit from the more flexible construction of the top of the truck's bed wall (top rail), as well in the newly-employed rail assemblies. When the mounting assemblies of the present invention are tightened into a transporting configuration, a substantially rigid component is established. This rigid component which spans between the top rail and rail assembly provides a solid mounting for the carrier components supported thereupon. Because the mounting assembly is anchored at both top and bottom locations, twist with respect to the vehicle is substantially prevented. Moreover, the flexibility of the truck components causes them to bias outwardly against the tightened mounting hardware in the transporting configuration thereby beneficially acting as a takeout mechanism for looseness that may result in the interconnection between the carrier's mounting hardware and the vehicle during use.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In at least one exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a load carrier that is mountable above a bed structure of a vehicle having an upper surface and an internal bed rail system. The load carrier broadly includes an upright base support member, an internal rail clamping assembly, and a clamp adjustment assembly. The upright base support member is connected to the rail clamping assembly and forms a first clamp surface for asserting a clamping force upon the upper surface of the vehicle side wall, or top rail. The rail clamping assembly is releasably securable to a rail of the internal bed rail system and forms a second clamp surface configured to assert a clamping force upon the rail. The rail clamping assembly is also configured for sliding movement with respect to the upright base support member as well as the rail of the internal bed rail system such that the load carrier's position relative to a long axis of the carrying vehicle may be readily adjusted. The clamp adjustment assembly is configured for positionally adjusting the first clamping surface with respect to the second clamping surface between clamped and unclamped positions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a preferred embodiment, the first and second clamping surfaces apply inwardly directed clamping forces upon the upper surface of the top rail and the upper surface of the rail of the internal bed rail system, respectively. In some embodiments of the invention the rail clamping assembly releasably connects to the upright base support member. In some embodiments of the invention the upright base support member and the rail clamping assembly comprise a releasable interlocking joint comprising a tenon and mortise wherein the tenon is fan-shaped. In some embodiments of the invention comprising an interlocking joint, the clamp adjustment assembly is adjustable such that when the clamping force(s) is asserted, a pulling force is applied upon a member of the releasable interlocking joint.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the clamp adjustment assembly comprises a threaded fastener and threaded bore for adjusting between clamped and unclamped positions, but could be formed from other structures that allow the assembly to be adjusted between clamped and unclamped positions. For example, straps and buckle assemblies could be utilized. In some embodiments, the rail clamping assembly and the upright base support member are configured for movement relative to one another such that the rail clamping member can be adjusted along a length of the upright base support member. In some embodiments of the invention, a resilient structure is disposed between the upper surface of the top rail and first clamp surface. In some embodiments, the resilient structure is formed from plastic, rubber, combinations thereof, or other resilient materials that may assist in preventing damage to the vehicle. In some embodiments, the resilient structure is a component of the vehicle; e.g., a portion of a bed liner and/or can be a component of the upright base support member; e.g., a rubber or plastic boot.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments of the invention, the rail clamping assembly includes a foot member configured for substantial complementary fit with a portion of a rail of the internal bed rail system. In some embodiments of the invention, a rail of the internal bed rail system has a generally C-shaped cross-section, a generally I-shaped cross-section, a generally L-shaped cross-section, or other shape, which allows a second clamp surface to be secured to the rail. In embodiments wherein the rail assembly comprises a C-shaped cross section, the rail includes a pair of generally parallel wall structures and a base wall structure, the base wall structure being secured to an inner side wall of the bed structure such that the parallel walls project substantially orthogonal from the side walls of the bed structure. In some embodiments, the rail clamping assembly is releasably securable to one of the generally parallel side wall structures. In some embodiments of the invention, the rail clamping assembly is slidable along a length of a rail.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention will now be described and disclosed in greater detail. It is to be understood, however, that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention and that the invention may be embodied in various and alternative forms. Therefore, specific structural and/or functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the claims, but are merely provided as an example to teach one having ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">At the outset, a description of the structure of a known vehicle bed structure and load carrier therefor is provided for further illustrating the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a load carrier <b>10</b> of known design is illustrated as being fixed to vehicle <b>12</b> having a bed structure <b>14</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, vehicle <b>12</b> is a common pickup-type truck wherein bed structure <b>14</b> broadly comprises side walls <b>16</b> and top rails <b>18</b> having upper surfaces <b>44</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Top rails <b>18</b> are generally formed from a single ply of rigid sheet metal that is bent to form a generally inverted J-shaped structure.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Known load carrier <b>10</b> is illustrated as broadly comprising upright base supports <b>20</b>, clamping assemblies <b>22</b>, upright members <b>24</b> and cross members <b>26</b>. As illustrated more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, each of clamping assemblies <b>22</b> includes upright base support <b>20</b>, L-shaped clamp member <b>28</b> and clamp adjustment assembly <b>33</b>. Upright base support <b>20</b> includes lower surface <b>40</b>, which is configured for resting upon upper surface <b>44</b> of top rail <b>18</b>, and connects with L-shaped clamp member <b>28</b> by means of tenon <b>30</b> and mortise <b>32</b>. Clamp adjustment assembly <b>33</b> is threadably received by L-shaped clamp member <b>28</b>, and includes clamp foot <b>34</b>, threaded rod <b>35</b> and adjustment member <b>36</b>. As illustrated more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, clamp foot <b>34</b> includes foot clamping surface <b>38</b> for abutting lower surface <b>42</b> of top rail <b>18</b>. Consequently, when known load carrier <b>10</b> is secured upon a vehicle <b>12</b>, the lower surface <b>40</b> of upright base support member <b>20</b> asserts a clamping force upon the upper surface <b>44</b> of top rail <b>18</b> and clamping foot <b>34</b> asserts a clamping force upon the lower surface <b>42</b> of top rail <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8B</figref>, load carrier <b>100</b> according to the present invention is illustrated as being detachably secured to vehicle <b>102</b> having bed structure <b>104</b>. Bed structure <b>104</b> can include side walls <b>106</b>, top rails <b>108</b> and an internal rail system <b>110</b>, for example, of a type currently commercially available in the 2006 TOYOTA TACOMA, 2006 HONDA RIDGELINE, AND 2006 NISSAN TITAN AND FRONTIER pickup-type trucks. Internal rail system <b>110</b> generally includes one or more rails <b>111</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7B</figref>) disposed about the side walls <b>106</b> of the bed structure of the vehicle. In the embodiment illustrated, rails <b>111</b> are shown as being generally parallelly disposed with respect to the lower bed surface of the bed structure and are secured upon a plurality of the side walls of the bed structure. Top rails <b>108</b> can include upper surface <b>109</b> and lower surface <b>113</b>, which surfaces are separated by gap <b>117</b>; consequently, it can be difficult to secure known clamping assemblies, for instance those of the type previously described (clamping assembly <b>22</b>) and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. Bed structure <b>104</b> can include bed liner <b>148</b>, of which portions thereof can extend over top rails <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a preferred embodiment, load carrier <b>100</b> is assembled from a plurality of components that include, but are not limited to: upright base support member <b>112</b>, rail clamping assembly <b>114</b>, clamp adjustment assembly <b>140</b>, upright member <b>115</b>, and cross member <b>116</b>. Generally, upright base support member <b>112</b> forms a first clamp surface <b>122</b> and rail clamping assembly <b>114</b> forms a second clamp surface <b>123</b>, which apply inwardly directed clamping forces upon the top rail of the vehicle bed structure and a portion of a rail of an internal rail system <b>110</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Upright base support members <b>112</b> are generally provided for supporting the load carrier upon the vehicle and also serving as base members for the upright members <b>115</b> which extend vertically therefrom. Upright base support member <b>112</b> broadly comprises first clamp surface <b>122</b>, which is a generally planar surface that is configured for being rested upon, or above, the upper surface <b>109</b> of top rail <b>108</b> of bed structure <b>104</b>, and asserting an inwardly directed clamping force upon the top rail <b>108</b>. Base support <b>112</b> further includes mortise <b>124</b> for releasably and slidably receiving rail clamping assembly <b>114</b> therein. In the embodiment illustrated, mortise <b>124</b> comprises a generally fan-shaped channel for receiving complementarily shaped tenon <b>126</b> of rail clamping assembly <b>114</b>. In a preferred embodiment, mortise <b>124</b> extends along the longitudinal length of the upright base support member <b>112</b> such that the upright base support member <b>112</b> and the rail clamping assembly <b>114</b> may slide with respect to one another (when no clamping force is being asserted).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Resilient material <b>150</b> can be disposed between first clamp surface <b>122</b> of the upright base support member <b>112</b> and top rail <b>108</b> of the vehicle to prevent damage to the vehicle and assist in securing the load carrier thereupon. Resilient material <b>150</b> can be a component of the upright base support member <b>112</b>, or may comprise a portion of a bed liner <b>148</b> as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>. Preferably, resilient material <b>150</b> is formed from plastic, rubber or other material.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Upright base support members <b>112</b> can be configured to fixedly secure upright members <b>115</b> thereto; e.g., as by means of welding, or can be configured to detachably secure the upright members thereto. Upright members <b>115</b> are configured for securing cross members <b>116</b>, which may be fixedly attached thereto or detachably secured thereupon.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Rail clamping assemblies <b>114</b> are generally provided for detachably securing the upright support members <b>112</b> and applying an inwardly directed clamping force upon rail <b>111</b> of a vehicle's internal rail system <b>110</b> or similar structural members. In the embodiment illustrated, rail clamping assembly <b>114</b> comprises upper rail clamping member <b>118</b> and lower rail clamping member <b>120</b>. Upper rail clamping member <b>118</b> is substantially L-shaped and includes upper portion <b>119</b> and lower portion <b>128</b>. Upper portion <b>119</b> is generally configured for abutting a side wall of the upright base support member <b>112</b> and lower portion <b>128</b> is generally provided for releasably fastening lower rail clamping member <b>120</b> and a portion of rail <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Intermediate upper portion <b>119</b> has a tenon <b>126</b> that is configured for being detachably and slidably received by mortise <b>124</b> of upright base support member <b>112</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, tenon <b>126</b> is fan-shaped (dovetailed) such that it may be slidably received by the fan-shaped mortise <b>124</b>. It should be appreciated that other shapes of the tenon <b>126</b> and mortise <b>124</b> may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Lower portion <b>128</b> has a generally inverted U-shape and comprises foot portion <b>132</b> and stud portion <b>130</b>. Foot portion <b>132</b> is configured for being substantially complementarily received within recess <b>152</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B-6C</figref>) of rail <b>111</b> such that rotational movement between the foot and the rail can be prevented. Intermediate foot portion <b>132</b> and stud portion <b>130</b> is a threaded bore for receiving therein a threaded portion of adjustment rod <b>142</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, stud portion <b>130</b> includes recess <b>134</b> for receiving the tongue, ridge or abutment <b>136</b> of lower rail clamping member <b>120</b> therein such that rotational movement between the upper rail clamping member and the lower rail clamping member <b>120</b> is prevented by the splined arrangement. In the embodiment illustrated, recess <b>134</b> comprises an elongated channel that extends along the length of the stud portion and abutment <b>136</b> comprises a wall that extends along the length of the lower rail clamping member <b>120</b>, however, abutment <b>136</b> and recess <b>134</b> can comprise other structures; e.g. a pin member and bore.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Lower rail clamping member <b>120</b> is generally U-shaped and includes first leg <b>133</b>, which is configured for being releasably secured to rail <b>111</b> and second leg <b>131</b>, which is configured for mating engagement with stud portion <b>130</b> of upper rail clamping member <b>118</b>. Intermediate the first and second leg <b>133</b>, <b>131</b> is a bore <b>135</b> for receiving rod <b>142</b> of clamp adjustment assembly <b>140</b> therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Clamp adjustment assembly <b>140</b> is generally provided for securing rail clamping assembly <b>114</b> to a rail <b>111</b> of internal rail system <b>110</b> to thereby form a second clamp surface <b>123</b> as well as adjust the distance between the first clamp surface <b>122</b> and the second clamp surface <b>123</b> such that an inwardly directed clamping force can be applied by the upright base support member <b>112</b> and the rail clamping assembly <b>114</b>. Clamp adjustment assembly <b>140</b> generally comprises lower portion <b>128</b> of upper rail clamping assembly <b>118</b>, lower rail clamping assembly <b>120</b>, and adjustment rod <b>142</b>. As illustrated in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>, adjustment rod <b>142</b> includes a threaded portion that is received by a threaded bore <b>144</b> of the upper rail clamping assembly <b>118</b>, and head portion <b>146</b> that abuts the lower rail clamping assembly <b>120</b>. Rotating adjustment rod <b>142</b> in a direction to cause tightening thus causes the upper rail clamping assembly <b>118</b> and the lower rail clamping assembly <b>120</b> to tighten upon one another such that rail <b>111</b> may be secured between foot <b>132</b> and first leg <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B-6C</figref>, the distance between the first clamp surface <b>122</b> of the upright base support member <b>112</b> and lower portion <b>128</b> of the upper rail clamping member <b>118</b> is generally fixed (except for the amount of freedom allowed by the tenon <b>126</b> and mortise joint <b>124</b>), or is adjustably fixable, to form gap <b>152</b> between foot portion <b>132</b> and rail <b>111</b> when the clamping assembly <b>114</b> is in a resting state. Tightening rail clamp adjustment assembly <b>140</b> causes the upper rail clamping member <b>118</b> to be drawn in a downward direction toward the lower rail clamping member <b>120</b> until they abut one another. Prior to their abutment, however, the downward movement of the upper rail clamping assembly <b>118</b> causes tenon <b>126</b> to assert a generally downwardly directed force upon mortise <b>126</b>, which causes upright base support member <b>112</b> and first clamping surface <b>122</b> to move in a generally downward direction toward second clamp surface <b>123</b>. Sufficient downward movement of the upright base support member <b>112</b>, thus, causes first clamp surface <b>122</b> to apply a downwardly (inwardly) directed force upon resilient material <b>150</b> and/or bed liner <b>148</b> such that the upright base support member <b>112</b> can be clampably secured to top rail <b>108</b> of the bed structure <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It should be appreciated that while the figures illustrate that the distance between first clamp surface <b>122</b> and lower portion <b>128</b> of the upper rail clamp member <b>118</b> is generally fixed (except for a limited amount of freedom allowed by interlocking tenon and mortise joint), the invention can be configured such that the distance therebetween is adjustable, primarily by exchange of the intermediate part <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, it should also be appreciated that while the present invention has been described as an assembly for securing a load carrier to a generally C-shaped rail <b>111</b><i>a </i>of an internal rail system wherein the rails have side walls <b>138</b> and base <b>137</b>, which is secured to the sidewall of a bed of a vehicle, the present invention can be secured to rails <b>111</b><i>b </i>and <b>111</b><i>c, </i>which have generally L-shaped and I-shaped structures, respectively. Also, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, while the present invention has been primarily described with upright base supporting member <b>112</b> and upper rail clamping member <b>118</b> secured to one another by means of a tenon and mortise joint, other means for detachably securing the structures to one another are contemplated, e.g., threaded fasteners; alternatively, the two structures may be fixed, e.g., integral with respect to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The beneficial attributes that have been described hereinabove regarding the present invention's exploitation of the newly flexible nature of the pickup truck bed components upon which the mounting hardware of the load carrier is secured are primarily attributable to the manufacture of the top rail <b>108</b> and a rail system <b>110</b> from plastic and similarly flexible materials.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The invention's capability for efficiently providing an array of mounting arrangements for accommodating differently configured pickup trucks can be appreciated from the several different exemplary configurations disclosed for the interchangeable intermediate piece <b>118</b> of the mounting assembly <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While the present invention has been illustrated and described in what is deemed to be the preferred embodiments, it should be understood by those having ordinary skill in the art that various changes and modifications may be made to the invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, it should be appreciated by those skilled persons that the present invention is not to be limited to the particular embodiments disclosed herein, but the afforded protection is instead defined by the patent claims.</p>
