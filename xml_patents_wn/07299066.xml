<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a portable telephone set attaching member and a portable telephone set, more particularly to assembly of a telephone set and an accessory component.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, a portable telephone set having many functions built-in has been widely used. For example, a portable telephone set with a camera can easily send an image photographed by the camera to a person on the other end of the line. However, since the camera is installed inside of the portable telephone set, the camera cannot be used independently or for other purposes by being detached from the portable telephone set (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-198849).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, there is disclosed a portable telephone set with a detachable camera. Examples of the portable telephone set with the detachable camera are described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 2000-252144, 2000-253118, 2002-050978 and the like. Furthermore, a portable telephone set having a detachable liquid crystal display unit is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-208999, and a portable telephone set having a detachable card for data communication is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-209317.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, normally, it is difficult or impossible to carry a portable telephone set having an accessory device attached thereto. Moreover, when an accessory device such as a camera is attached integrally with a portable telephone set, the camera has a shape which makes it difficult for the camera to be used independently based on restrictions on designing of the portable telephone set.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A portable telephone set attaching member according to one example of the present invention includes: a substrate part having a telephone set installation region and an accessory device installation region; a first connector that is connected with a telephone set; a second connector that is connected with an accessory device; and a wiring part that connects the first and second connectors with each other. A portable telephone set according to one example of the present invention includes: a substrate part; and a telephone set and an accessory device that are attached to the substrate parts. The substrate part includes: a first connector that is connected with the telephone set; a second connector that is connected with the accessory device; and a wiring part that connects the first and second connectors with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The telephone set installation region and the accessory device installation region, which are included in the above-described substrate parts, can be connected with each other by use of hinge parts or flexible members. A plate member including an opening can be disposed on an upper surface of at least one of the telephone set and the accessory device. The substrate and the plate member are connected with each other by use of fastenings. The telephone set can be set to be usable by entering predetermined ID information.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">By use of the portable telephone set described above, various functions can be used according to need. Moreover, the accessory device can be attached integrally to the portable telephone set and the portable telephone set can be easily carried around.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref> show portable telephone sets according to embodiments, in which the camera unit <b>32</b>, the data communication unit <b>33</b> and the dummy unit <b>35</b> are attached to the telephone set attaching member, respectively, other than the telephone set <b>10</b> and the display unit <b>31</b>. The telephone set <b>10</b> is connected with the connector <b>4</b> and each of the units is connected with the connector <b>2</b>. The telephone set <b>10</b> and each of the units can be tightly connected with the connectors <b>4</b> and <b>2</b>, respectively. However, actually, the telephone set <b>10</b> and each of the units can be more tightly connected with the substrate parts <b>1</b> by use of fastenings (not shown). For example, the fastening is a U-shaped elastic body made of resin and is attached so as to sandwich the telephone set <b>10</b> (or each of the units described above) and the substrate part <b>1</b>. The fastenings are attached at positions that do not hinder operations of the telephone set. The fastening may be such a thing as a resin belt, other than the example described above.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a portable telephone set according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the portable telephone set is folded at the portions of the two hinge parts <b>6</b>. To the substrate parts <b>1</b>, the telephone set <b>10</b>, the display unit <b>31</b> and the camera unit <b>32</b> are attached. In this case, if the U-shaped resin fastenings (not shown) for connecting the telephone set <b>10</b> and the substrate part <b>1</b> are provided, these fastenings function as spacers between the liquid crystal display part <b>311</b> and the input key part <b>11</b> and between the lens <b>321</b> and the input key part <b>11</b>. Thus, damage of the liquid crystal display part <b>311</b> and the lens <b>321</b> is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a portable telephone set according to another embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the portable telephone set is folded at the portion of the flexible member <b>7</b>.

In this plate member <b>20</b>, an opening <b>21</b> is formed so, that the input key part <b>11</b> and the liquid crystal display part <b>311</b> can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> shows a side of a portable telephone set in which the plate member <b>20</b> is disposed. In this case, the above-described U-shaped resin fastenings can be used to connect the plate member <b>20</b> and the substrate part <b>1</b> with each other. Alternatively, the plate member <b>20</b> and the substrate part <b>1</b> can be connected with each other by use of screws.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>, the plate member <b>20</b> is not a flat plate but has a shape that can be fitted into the portable telephone set. For example, when the input key part <b>11</b> of the telephone set <b>10</b> is not projected from the upper surface of the telephone set, the plate member <b>20</b> as described above can be used. In this case, no fastenings or screws are required.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a plan view of a portable telephone set in which the above-described plate member <b>20</b> is disposed on the upper surface of the telephone set <b>10</b>. The plate member <b>20</b> covers the speaker <b>13</b> included in the telephone set <b>10</b> and the vicinity thereof. Moreover, since the opening <b>21</b> is formed, the input key part <b>11</b> and the microphone <b>14</b> can be used. The plate member <b>20</b> can be disposed also on the upper surface of the respective units.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the telephone set is attached to the telephone set attaching member described above, the portable telephone set is operated as below, for example. First, when a user sets the telephone set <b>10</b> and the respective units and turns on a power of the telephone set, a control part in the telephone set <b>10</b> detects which one of the display unit <b>31</b>, the camera unit <b>32</b> and the data communication unit <b>33</b> is mounted and requests the user to enter a predetermined ID number. Once the user enters a correct ID number, the portable telephone set becomes usable. According to another embodiment, it is requested to enter ID information corresponding to the respective units described above. When a correct ID number is not entered, when the above-described units are not set and when the above-described units are connected to wrong connectors, the telephone set emits an alarm sound.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another example of the portable telephone set described above, the display unit <b>31</b>, the camera unit <b>32</b> and the data communication unit <b>33</b> can be all connected with the connector <b>2</b>. When the display unit <b>31</b> is mounted, the above-described control part can stop functions of the speaker <b>13</b> of the telephone set <b>10</b>.</p>
