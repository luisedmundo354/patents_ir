<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure in general relates to an integration service and domain object for use in connection with telecommunications operational support.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Changes in the laws relating to the telecommunications industry have required certain telephone companies to provide shared access to common telecommunications resources. Often, a single company manages these common telecommunications resources. As a result, this single company provides access to operational support systems to various competitors, customers, consumers, and vendors. However, the current operational support systems are often single-purpose, inflexible systems that are costly to maintain or enhance. In addition, many companies have multiple telecommunications resources supported by many different single-purpose systems for differing regions. Sharing these resources is complicated by the need to support multiple access protocols and diverse resource support systems. In one example, regional laws require that competitive local exchange carriers (CLEC) be given access to operational support systems managed by incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC) to provide billing, fulfillment, and assurance support.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sharing resources is further complicated by mergers and acquisitions of local exchange carriers. With a merger or acquisition, the surviving local exchange carrier faces the problem of supporting multiple diverse legacy systems performing similar functions, or investing considerable capital to replace or standardize the various operational support systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such, many problems exist in providing access to operational support systems. Accordingly, there is a need for improved computer systems for telecommunications operational support.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a particular embodiment, the disclosure is directed to an integration service. The integration service includes an interface layer, a logic layer, an object layer, and a resource layer. The interface layer includes a plurality of communications adapters. The logic layer includes a first interface and has access to a rules engine. The object layer includes a second interface, a transformation service, and an object. The resource layer includes a plurality of resource interface modules. The resource interface modules have access to a plurality of diverse resource systems. The resource interface modules may acquire a first data from the plurality of diverse resource systems. The transformation service transforms the data into the object. The logic layer accesses the object and provides a second data through one of the plurality of communications adapters.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a system associated with telecommunication related service. The system includes a business logic layer, and a transformation service module. The business logic layer has access to at least one object. The transformation service module transforms data acquired from the plurality of diverse telecommunication related resource systems into the object.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a further embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a domain object for use in connection with a telecommunication related integration service. The domain object includes an access interface, and a resource connector interface. The resource connector interface initiates transactions at a plurality of resource connectors associated with remote telecommunication related resource systems.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an additional embodiment, the disclosure is directed to a method for providing an interface to distributed resource systems. The method includes receiving a first communication from an integration service; instantiating an object; initiating interaction with a resource system; and translating a response from the resource system into the object.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosure is also directed to a method for interacting with distributed resource systems. The method includes requesting a transaction associated with a resource system using an object layer; connecting to a resource system using a resource connection layer to facilitate the transaction; and translating a transaction result into a fielded response using the resource connection layer.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An enterprise integration architecture system is described that enables a diverse set of access systems to communicate with a diverse set of resource systems through a common integrated system architecture. The enterprise integration architecture provides a common framework that can be leveraged when integrating a diverse set of telecommunications technologies and vendor equipment. Efficient and accurate data communications are provided using various exemplary embodiments of enterprise integration architectures, business integration services, adaptors, common integration busses, or common network resources.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a particular embodiment of an enterprise integration architecture. The architecture includes a business application service <b>102</b> in communication with a common integration bus <b>106</b> through an adaptor <b>104</b>. In addition, a business integration service <b>108</b>, a business integration service shared workspace <b>114</b>, and a business integration service <b>122</b> are connected to the common integration bus <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The business application service <b>102</b> may take the form of one or more servers and may, for example, include client applications that request services of the business integration services <b>108</b> and <b>122</b>, and the business integration service shared workspace <b>114</b>. Users may use the business application service <b>102</b> to access various data and perform various functions associated with the business integration services tier including the business integration services <b>108</b> and <b>122</b>, and the business integration service shared workspace <b>114</b>. In turn, the business integration services <b>108</b> and <b>122</b> may access distributed resources through various applications <b>112</b>, <b>126</b>, and <b>130</b> and the business integration service shared workspace <b>114</b>. The resource systems may include diverse and distributed operational support systems for local exchange carriers, vendors, competitors, trading partners, data storage systems, and other systems. In effect, the business integration service systems <b>108</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>122</b> function to mediate the disparate data and functions resident in the resource systems by providing a consistent functional interface to client applications. The business integration service systems <b>108</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>122</b> may provide additional functional capabilities not supported by the resource systems.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The business integration services <b>108</b> and <b>122</b> and the business integration services shared workspace <b>114</b> represent one or more server systems providing computing functions and data to the business application service <b>102</b> through the common integration bus <b>106</b> and adaptor <b>104</b>. The business integration services <b>108</b> and <b>122</b> access one or more remote resource systems or applications <b>112</b>, <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> through various adaptors <b>110</b>, <b>124</b> and <b>128</b>. The remote resources may include databases, usage systems, PREMIS systems, ASON systems, TIRKS® systems, Service Order Retrieval Distribution (SORD) systems, and CRIS systems. The business integration services <b>108</b> and <b>122</b> are organized to access such remote resources to acquire data or perform a requested function and to relay the data or result to the business application service <b>102</b>. The business integration services <b>108</b> and <b>112</b> may perform functions such as product management, customer information management, order management, network resource management, service management, location information management, usage management, rating and pricing, bill preparation, and trouble administration.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, the business application service <b>102</b> may access data or functionality associated with the business integration service <b>108</b> through the adaptor <b>114</b> and communications integration bus <b>106</b>. The business integration service <b>108</b> accesses a resource or application <b>112</b> through an adaptor <b>110</b> and provides data or function results to the business application service <b>102</b>. As illustrated in connection with the business integration service <b>108</b>, a single application <b>112</b> may be accessed through an adaptor <b>110</b>. Alternately, one or more applications may be accessed by a given business integration service through various adaptors. For example, business integration service <b>122</b> may access applications <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> through adaptors <b>124</b> and <b>128</b>, respectively. In addition, the business application service <b>102</b> may access the business integration shared workspace <b>114</b>. This business integration shared workspace <b>114</b> may be coupled with data <b>116</b>, process states <b>120</b> and rules <b>118</b>. In this manner, data <b>116</b>, process states <b>120</b>, and rules <b>118</b> may be served or applied from a business integration service tier without accessing a remote resource application.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The business application service <b>102</b> may, for example, provide billing, fulfillment, and customer assurance functionality to various access interfaces. These functionalities are achieved by accessing the business integration services <b>108</b> and <b>122</b> and the business integration shared workspace <b>114</b>. For example, an integrated billing service may be accomplished through a business application service <b>102</b> accessing a business integrated service <b>122</b>, which acquires usage data from various subscriber systems, such as applications <b>126</b> and <b>130</b>. In another example, address verification may be retrieved by a single business integration service <b>108</b> accessing a resource application <b>112</b> associated with the requested address. Business application service <b>102</b> functionality is achieved through interaction with one or more business integration services and the business integration services shared workspace, each having access to various combinations of applications, data, rules, and process states.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In general, users utilizing a variety of communications, protocols and methods access the business application service <b>102</b>. The business application service <b>102</b> accesses an appropriate business integration service or business integration shared workspace to acquire data or to perform a function. The business integration service or business integration shared workspace accesses data in remote distributed systems to provide the desired functionality. In this manner, a common applications interface may be provided through the business application service <b>102</b> while functionality is performed on a variety of remote and diverse resource systems and applications <b>112</b>, <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> and through a shared workspace <b>114</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one exemplary embodiment, a consumer may access a system through a web browser <b>252</b>. The web browser may direct communication with the business application services <b>232</b> such as the consumer care services <b>234</b> (e.g. self service <b>242</b>). This customer care module <b>234</b> may then access a business integration services module, such as the customer information management module <b>214</b>. The customer information management module <b>214</b> may selectively communicate with a business management system <b>204</b>. Using such a communications path, a consumer may change their associated customer information. In this manner, consumers located in differing geographic regions may access a common website to change information on diverse resource systems.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another example, a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) may access a business application service <b>232</b> through an interconnection service <b>256</b>. The CLEC may attempt to validate an address or facilitate a channel facility assignment.

In response to a request, the resource layer may request a transaction, at step <b>1202</b>. The transaction may be a database query, facility assignment, or resource allocation, among others. The resource layer connects to the resource system, at step <b>1204</b>. A response or result from the resource system or transaction may be translated, at a step <b>1206</b>. For example, the response may be translated into fielded data. The translated response may then be provided to the domain object or other layers of the business integration service, at a step <b>1208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> depicts a further example of the layered business integration service system. A business logic layer <b>1302</b> is coupled to a domain object layer <b>1304</b>. The business logic layer <b>1302</b> includes functional modules such as product management (PM) <b>1310</b>, service resource management (SRM) <b>1312</b>, location information management (LIM) <b>1314</b>, billing information management (BIM) <b>1316</b>, network resource management (NRM) <b>1318</b>, service management (SM) <b>1320</b>, availability management (AM) <b>1322</b>, customer information management (CIM) <b>1324</b>, network address management (NAM) <b>1326</b>, resource management (RM) <b>1328</b>, and trouble management (TM) <b>1330</b>. The product management module <b>1310</b> integrates product information into the enterprise. The service request management module <b>1312</b> integrates service request information into the enterprise. The location information management module <b>1314</b> integrates location information into the enterprise. The billing information management module <b>1316</b> integrates billing information into the enterprise. The network resource management module <b>1318</b> integrates network resource information into the enterprise. This network resource management module <b>1318</b> may have similar functions to the network address management module <b>1326</b> and resource management module <b>1328</b>. The service management module <b>1320</b> integrates service information into the enterprise. The availability management module <b>1322</b> integrates product feature and service availability information into the enterprise. The customer information management module <b>1324</b> integrates customer information into the enterprise. The network address management <b>1326</b> integrates network address information into the enterprise. The resource management module <b>1328</b> integrates network resource information into the enterprise. The trouble management module <b>1330</b> integrates trouble report information into the enterprise. These modules function along with the business logic layer <b>1302</b> to determine what data to gather or action to facilitate in response to communication from a business application service. The business logic layer <b>1302</b> and its modules instantiate objects associated with the domain object layer <b>1304</b>. The domain object layer <b>1304</b> then accesses resource connections to acquire the requested data or facilitate the desired action. Information or results may then be transferred back through the domain object layer <b>1304</b> to the business logic layer <b>1302</b> and out to the requesting business application service system.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> represents operation of an exemplary business integration services system in action in response to various business application services events. The business integration services system provides business logic and resource interaction. Events such as BAS <b>1</b> <b>1402</b>, BAS <b>2</b> <b>1404</b>, and BAS <b>3</b> <b>1406</b> are communicated through the communication services <b>1410</b> to various business logic modules such as product management <b>1412</b>, service request management <b>1414</b>, location information management <b>1414</b>, billing information management <b>1418</b>, network resource management <b>1420</b> and service management <b>1422</b>. These business logic modules determine what information or action is needed in response to the business application services event. These modules then communicate through a communications service <b>1430</b> to a business integration services workspace <b>1470</b>. This business integration services workspace <b>1470</b> may be organized into various factory elements. For example, factory elements <b>1432</b>, <b>1434</b>, and <b>1436</b> are connected to domain object models <b>1440</b>, business process management <b>1450</b> and policy management <b>1460</b>, respectively. The business logic modules may, using a domain object, access product data, subscription data, accounting, and inventory data, among others. In addition, the systems may access business process management <b>1450</b> or policy management <b>1460</b>. In this manner, any one business logic module may access one or more of the logical factories <b>1432</b>, <b>1434</b>, and <b>1436</b> to perform the desired action or to acquire the requested data.</p>
