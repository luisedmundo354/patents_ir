<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to microelectronic devices having multiple substrates and methods for manufacturing such microelectronic devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Microelectronic devices, such as memory chips and microprocessor chips, typically include a microelectronic substrate die encased in a plastic, ceramic or metal protective covering. The die includes functional features, such as memory cells, processor circuits, and interconnecting circuitry. The die also typically includes bond pads electrically coupled to the functional features. The bond pads are coupled to terminals, such as pins, that extend outside the protective covering for connecting to buses, circuits and/or other microelectronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional microelectronic devices are typically arranged side-by-side on a circuit board or other support device that is incorporated into a computer, mobile phone or other larger electronic product. One drawback with this arrangement is that the circuit board may have a large surface area to accommodate a large number of microelectronic devices. Accordingly, it may be difficult to fit the circuit board into a housing of a compact electronic product.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One approach to address this problem is to stack one microelectronic die on top of another to reduce the surface area occupied by the dies. Typically, the stacked microelectronic dies are connected to each other with an intermediate adhesive layer that is heat cured to securely bond the dies to each other. However, the adhesive can have several drawbacks. For example, at high temperatures, the adhesive can emit gases that leave deposits on the bond pads of dies. The deposits can inhibit secure electrical connections between the bond pads and the terminals of the die. Another drawback is that the adhesive layer can have a different coefficient of thermal expansion than the dies to which it is attached. Accordingly, the adhesive layer can put stresses on the dies as the ambient temperature changes. In some cases, these stresses can crack or fracture the dies.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is directed toward compound microelectronic devices and methods for manufacturing compound microelectronic devices. A method in accordance with one aspect of the invention includes forming a first microelectronic substrate having a first surface, a second surface opposite the first surface, a first operable microelectronic device, and a first connection terminal coupled to the first microelectronic device. The method further includes forming a second microelectronic substrate having a first surface, a second surface opposite the first surface, a second operable microelectronic device, and a second connection terminal coupled to the second microelectronic device. The first and second microelectronic substrates are bonded together by placing the second surface of the second microelectronic substrate directly against the first or second surface of the first microelectronic substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a further aspect of the invention, the method can further include selecting the first and second microelectronic substrates to include microelectronic dies separated from one or more microelectronic wafers. Alternatively, when the first and second substrates are microelectronic wafers, the method can further include separating the wafers into bonded pairs of dies after bonding the wafers together.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention is also directed toward a compound microelectronic device. In one aspect of the invention, the compound microelectronic device can include a first microelectronic substrate having a first surface, a second surface opposite the first surface, a first functional or operable microelectronic feature or device, and a first connection terminal coupled to the first microelectronic feature or device. The compound device can further include a second microelectronic substrate having a first surface, a second surface opposite the first surface, a second functional or operable microelectronic feature or device, and a second connection terminal coupled to the second feature or device. The second surface of the second microelectronic substrate is bonded directly to the first or second surface of the first microelectronic substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further aspect of the invention, the compound device can include a conductive support member engaged with at least one of the microelectronic substrates and conductive couplings extending between the conductive support member and the connection terminal. In still a further aspect of the invention, the first and second microelectronic substrates can each include an intermediate surface between the first and second surfaces, and the connection terminals of the substrates can be positioned on the intermediate surfaces. The compound device can further include a support member and the microelectronic substrates can be coupled to the support member as a unit with the first and second connection terminals electrically coupled to the support member and with the intermediate surfaces of the microelectronic substrates facing toward the support member.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another aspect of the invention, the compound device can include a packaging material encapsulating the microelectronic substrates in a single enclosure. When one of the microelectronic substrates includes an imaging device, the enclosure can include a lens at least partially transparent to a selected radiation and positioned proximate to the imaging device to allow the radiation to pass to the imaging device.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present disclosure describes microelectronic devices and methods for forming such devices. Many specific details of certain embodiments of the invention are set forth in the following description and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref> to provide a thorough understanding of these embodiments. One skilled in the art, however, will understand that the present invention may have additional embodiments, or that the invention may be practiced without several of the details described below.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a top isometric view of a first microelectronic substrate <b>20</b><i>a </i>bonded to a second microelectronic substrate <b>20</b><i>b </i>(referred to collectively as “microelectronic substrates <b>20</b>”) in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. In one aspect of this embodiment, the first microelectronic substrate <b>20</b><i>a </i>includes a first wafer <b>21</b><i>a </i>and the second microelectronic substrate <b>20</b><i>b </i>includes a second wafer <b>21</b><i>b </i>(referred to collectively as “wafers <b>21</b>”). The wafers <b>21</b> can include silicon or another suitable substrate material. Each wafer <b>21</b> has a first surface <b>22</b> and a second surface <b>23</b> opposite the first surface. The wafers <b>21</b> each have a plurality of operable microelectronic devices, such as memory devices, processors, and/or other microelectronic devices arranged to form separable, stand-alone dies <b>30</b>. For example, when the microelectronic devices are memory devices, the dies <b>30</b> can have memory capacity of 128 megabits or more. Each die <b>30</b> has one or more connection terminals <b>31</b> at the first surface <b>22</b> for coupling to other dies or devices. The dies <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> have six connection terminals <b>31</b>, but can have more or fewer connection terminals in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The wafers <b>21</b> are bonded directly to each other by a technique commonly referred to as “wafer direct bonding.” This technique is described by Andreas Ploessl and Gertrude Krauter in an article entitled “Wafer Direct Bonding: Tailoring Adhesion Between Brittle Materials,” Materials Science and Engineering, R25 (1999) at 1-88 (Elsevier Science S.A.), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Accordingly, the second surfaces <b>23</b> of each wafer <b>21</b> are planarized, polished or otherwise processed to be extremely flat. The second surfaces <b>23</b> are then brought into contact with each other and directly bonded by attractive forces between the wafers <b>21</b> without requiring an intermediate adhesive. In one aspect of this embodiment, the temperature and/or pressure of the wafers <b>21</b> can be elevated while the second surfaces <b>23</b> are in contact with each other to strengthen the bond between the wafers <b>21</b>. Alternatively, the wafers <b>21</b> can be attached without elevated pressure or temperature. In either embodiment, the bond between the wafers <b>21</b> can be extremely strong and can equal the bulk strength of the material comprising the wafers <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the wafers <b>21</b> can be cut along the lines delineating the dies <b>30</b> after the wafers <b>21</b> are bonded to each other. Alternatively, the dies <b>30</b> can be separated from each other before bonding the wafers <b>21</b> together, and pairs of the individual dies <b>30</b> can be bonded together using the direct bonding technique described above. In either embodiment, the result (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is a first die <b>30</b><i>a </i>bonded directly to a second die <b>30</b><i>b </i>without an intermediate adhesive. Each die <b>30</b> has an outwardly facing first surface <b>32</b> (having the connection terminals <b>31</b>), and a second surface <b>33</b> bonded directly to the corresponding second surface <b>33</b> of the adjacent die <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one aspect of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the dies <b>30</b> are mounted to a conductive support <b>40</b> to provide connections between the dies <b>30</b> and other devices. The conductive support <b>40</b> can include a leadframe <b>41</b> having an outer ring <b>43</b> with leadfingers <b>42</b> that extend inwardly toward the dies <b>30</b>. The second die <b>30</b><i>b </i>can be mounted to the leadfingers <b>42</b> with adhesive strips <b>44</b> that extend along opposing edges of the second die <b>30</b><i>b</i>. Alternatively, each leadfinger <b>42</b> can be bonded to the second die <b>30</b><i>b </i>with an individual portion of adhesive. In either of these embodiments, the dies <b>30</b> are then electrically connected to the leadframe <b>41</b> by connecting wire bonds <b>35</b> between the connection terminals <b>31</b> of the dies <b>30</b> and the leadfingers <b>42</b> of the leadframe <b>41</b>. In an alternate arrangement, the dies <b>30</b> can be inverted as a unit so the first die <b>30</b><i>a </i>is mounted to the leadfingers <b>42</b> with the adhesive strips <b>44</b>. The connection terminals <b>31</b> of both dies <b>30</b> can be connected to the same leadfingers <b>42</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or alternatively, the connection terminals <b>31</b> of the first die <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the connection terminals of the second die <b>30</b><i>b </i>can be connected to different leadfingers <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Next, the outer ring <b>43</b> can be separated from the leadfingers <b>42</b> by cutting the leadframe <b>42</b> along line “A.” A protective coating is disposed around the dies <b>30</b> and the leadfingers <b>42</b> up to line “B.” The protective coating can be applied in accordance with one or more known techniques, such as pouring a liquid epoxy directly over the dies <b>30</b>, placing the dies <b>30</b> in a cavity and injecting epoxy into the cavity, or placing the dies within a pre-formed package. In any of these embodiments, the protective coating forms a package enclosure <b>60</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, that protects the dies <b>30</b> from contaminants and contact with other devices. The leadfingers <b>42</b> can be bent downwardly (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) or upwardly to forms pins <b>45</b> for connecting the resulting packaged compound microelectronic device <b>10</b> to other devices and/or other circuits (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">One feature of the processes and devices described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> is that the dies <b>30</b> are bonded directly to each other without an intermediate adhesive layer. By eliminating the adhesive layer, this embodiment is expected to eliminate contamination caused by outgassing of an intermediate layer. Furthermore, some conventional adhesives used to bond the dies <b>30</b> have a different coefficient of thermal expansion than the dies <b>30</b> and may crack the dies <b>30</b> at elevated temperatures. Accordingly, eliminating the adhesive is expected to eliminate this potential source of damage to the dies <b>30</b>. Yet another advantage is that the packaged microelectronic device <b>10</b> will be shorter (in the vertical direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>) than a conventional packaged device because the thickness of the adhesive is eliminated. Accordingly, the microelectronic device <b>10</b> can more easily be placed in locations having limited vertical clearance. Still another advantage is that the first surfaces <b>32</b> of the dies <b>30</b> are more likely to be parallel to each other and to the conductive support <b>40</b> when the dies are directly bonded to each other. This advantage can be particularly important when one or more of the dies <b>30</b> has optical features, as will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a top isometric view of a compound microelectronic device <b>110</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. The microelectronic device <b>110</b> includes a first die <b>130</b><i>a </i>bonded to a second die <b>130</b><i>b </i>(referred to collectively as dies <b>130</b>), either before or after the dies <b>130</b> are separated from corresponding wafers <b>21</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Each die <b>130</b> has an outwardly facing first surface <b>132</b>, an inwardly facing second surface <b>133</b> and an intermediate surface <b>134</b> between the first surface <b>132</b> and the second surface <b>133</b>. The second surface <b>133</b> of the first die <b>130</b><i>a </i>is bonded to the corresponding second surface <b>133</b> of the second die <b>130</b><i>b </i>without an intermediate adhesive in a manner generally similar to that discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first surface <b>132</b> of each die <b>130</b> includes a plurality first connection terminals <b>131</b><i>a </i>and the intermediate surface <b>134</b> of each die <b>130</b> includes one or more second connection terminals <b>131</b><i>b </i>electrically coupled to the first connection terminals <b>131</b><i>a </i>with couplings <b>136</b>. In one aspect of this embodiment, the first connection terminals <b>131</b><i>a </i>are connected to the second connection terminals <b>131</b><i>b </i>when the die or the wafer is fabricated. Alternatively, the first connection terminals <b>131</b><i>a </i>can be connected to the second connection terminals after fabrication. In still another embodiment, the first connection terminals <b>131</b><i>a </i>can be eliminated and the functional microelectronic features within the dies <b>130</b> can be connected directly to the second connection terminals <b>131</b><i>b </i>positioned on the intermediate surface <b>134</b> of the dies <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In any of the above embodiments discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the dies <b>130</b> are positioned on a support member <b>150</b> with the intermediate surfaces <b>134</b> facing the support member <b>150</b> and the second surfaces <b>133</b> extending transversely away from the support member <b>150</b>. The support member <b>150</b> can include connection sites for connecting to the second connection terminals <b>131</b><i>b </i>of the dies <b>130</b>. For example, when the second connection terminals <b>131</b><i>b </i>include solder balls <b>139</b>, the support member <b>150</b> can include solder pads <b>151</b> aligned with the solder balls <b>139</b>. The solder pads <b>151</b> are connected to leads <b>153</b> for coupling the dies <b>130</b> to other devices. Alternatively, the device <b>110</b> can include other arrangements for coupling the second connection terminals <b>131</b><i>b </i>to the support member <b>150</b>. In either embodiment, the device <b>110</b> can include an enclosure surrounding the dies <b>130</b> in a manner similar to that discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or the device <b>110</b> can be coupled to the support member <b>150</b> without an enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One feature of the compound microelectronic device <b>110</b> discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is that the dies <b>130</b> are rotated 90 degrees relative to the dies <b>30</b> discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> before they are attached to the support member <b>150</b>. Accordingly, the intermediate surfaces <b>134</b> of the dies <b>130</b> face the support member <b>150</b>. An advantage of this feature is that the dies <b>130</b> may take up less surface area of the support member than the dies <b>30</b> discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a top isometric view of a compound microelectronic device <b>210</b> that includes a first die <b>230</b><i>a </i>coupled to a second die <b>230</b><i>b</i>, both of which are coupled to a support member <b>250</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. Each die <b>230</b> includes an outwardly facing first surface <b>232</b> having connection terminals <b>231</b>, an inwardly facing second surface <b>233</b>, and an intermediate surface <b>234</b> between the first and second surfaces. In one aspect of this embodiment, the second surfaces <b>233</b> of each of the dies <b>230</b> are bonded to each other with a die adhesive layer <b>238</b><i>a </i>that extends between the two dies <b>230</b>. Alternatively, the dies <b>230</b> can be directly bonded in a manner similar to that discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. In either embodiment, the device <b>210</b> can include a support adhesive layer <b>238</b><i>b </i>that extends between the support member <b>250</b> and the intermediate surfaces <b>234</b> of the dies <b>230</b> to bond the dies <b>230</b> to the support member <b>250</b>. Alternatively, the intermediate surfaces <b>234</b> of the dies <b>230</b> can also include solder balls generally similar to those discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> connected to the support member <b>250</b>. The support member <b>250</b> includes support member pads <b>252</b> connected to the connection terminals <b>231</b> of the dies <b>230</b> by wire bonds <b>235</b>. The support member pads <b>252</b> can be coupled to other devices with leads <b>253</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">One feature of the compound device <b>210</b> discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is that the dies <b>230</b> are connected to each other with an adhesive layer <b>238</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, an advantage of the device <b>210</b> is that the second surfaces <b>233</b> of the dies <b>230</b> need not be made as flat as the corresponding directly bonded surfaces discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. Conversely, an advantage of the directly bonded substrates discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> is that the adhesive layer <b>238</b><i>a </i>is eliminated to reduce the likelihood of contaminating and/or cracking the dies.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Another feature of the compound device <b>210</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is that the connection terminals <b>231</b> are bonded directly to the support member pads <b>252</b> without the need for intermediate connection terminals on the intermediate surface <b>234</b> of the dies <b>230</b>. An advantage of this feature is that it can eliminate the fabrication process required to provide the additional connection terminals. Conversely, an advantage of the arrangement discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is that it may be easier to connect terminals that face directly toward each other than to connect terminals that do not directly face each other.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a top isometric view of a compound microelectronic device <b>310</b> having a first die <b>330</b><i>a </i>and a second die <b>330</b><i>b </i>coupled to a support member <b>350</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. In one aspect of this embodiment, the first die <b>330</b><i>a </i>has a first surface <b>332</b> facing downwardly toward the support member <b>350</b> and a second surface <b>333</b> facing upwardly toward the second die <b>330</b><i>b</i>. The second die <b>330</b><i>b </i>has an upwardly facing first surface <b>332</b> and a downwardly facing second surface <b>333</b> bonded to the second surface <b>333</b> of the first die <b>330</b><i>a </i>in accordance with any of the direct bonding processes discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a further aspect of this embodiment, the first die <b>330</b><i>a </i>has first connection terminals <b>331</b><i>a </i>in the form of solder balls <b>339</b> that are bonded to corresponding solder pads <b>351</b> of the support member <b>350</b>. The second die <b>330</b><i>b </i>has second connection terminals <b>331</b><i>b </i>in the form of bond pads that are coupled to corresponding support member pads <b>352</b> with wire bonds <b>335</b>. The second die <b>330</b><i>b </i>can have a planform shape that is smaller than the planform shape of the first die <b>330</b><i>a </i>(as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). For example, the first die <b>330</b><i>a </i>can include an SRAM device and the second die <b>330</b><i>b </i>can include a flash memory device. Alternatively, the second die <b>330</b><i>b </i>can have a planform shape that is the same as or larger than the planform shape of the first die <b>330</b><i>a</i>. In either of these embodiments, an advantage of the device <b>310</b> compared to an embodiment of the device <b>10</b> discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> is that it may be easier in some cases to bond the solder balls <b>339</b> to the solder pads <b>351</b> than to wire bond the connection terminals <b>31</b> to the leadframe <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a top isometric view of a compound microelectronic device <b>410</b> having a first die <b>430</b><i>a </i>electrically coupled to a second die <b>430</b><i>b </i>and a support member <b>450</b> in accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention. In one aspect of this embodiment, each die <b>430</b> has an upwardly facing first surface <b>432</b> and a downwardly facing second surface <b>433</b> opposite the first surface <b>432</b>. The first die <b>430</b><i>a </i>has first connection terminals <b>431</b><i>a </i>and the second die <b>430</b><i>b </i>has second connection terminals <b>431</b><i>b</i>. In a further aspect of this embodiment, the first and second connection terminals (collectively referred to as “connection terminals <b>431</b>”) can include wire bond pads on the upwardly facing first surfaces <b>432</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one aspect of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the second surface <b>433</b> of the second die <b>430</b><i>b </i>is directly bonded to the first surface <b>432</b> of the first die <b>430</b><i>a </i>using a method generally similar to that discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. For example, when the first surface <b>432</b> of the first die <b>430</b><i>a </i>includes a passivation layer, the passivation layer and the second surface <b>433</b> of the second die <b>430</b><i>b </i>are planarized, polished or otherwise processed to be extremely flat. In another aspect of this embodiment, at least some of the second connection terminals <b>431</b><i>b </i>of the second die <b>430</b><i>b </i>are connected directly to corresponding first connection terminals <b>431</b><i>a </i>of the first die <b>430</b><i>a</i>. At least some of the first connection terminals <b>431</b><i>a </i>of the first die <b>430</b><i>a </i>are connected to support member pads <b>452</b> on the support member <b>450</b> using wire bonds <b>435</b>. Such an arrangement may be suitable where it is advantageous to minimize the lengths of the electrical paths between the first die <b>430</b><i>a </i>and the second die <b>430</b><i>b</i>. For example, when the first die <b>430</b><i>a </i>is a processor and the second die <b>430</b><i>b </i>includes an imaging device, the direct connection between the two dies <b>430</b> can increase the speed and timing accuracy with which signals are transmitted between the processor and the imaging device.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In still another aspect of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the device <b>410</b> can include a package enclosure <b>460</b>, a portion of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In one aspect of this embodiment (for example, when the second die <b>430</b><i>b </i>includes an imaging device), the package enclosure <b>460</b> can include a lens <b>461</b> that transmits radiation to the second die <b>430</b><i>b</i>. Alternatively, the second die <b>430</b><i>b </i>can emit light and the lens <b>461</b> can focus light leaving the package enclosure <b>460</b>. In either embodiment, the package enclosure <b>460</b> can be pre-formed so that the lens <b>461</b> is parallel to the support member <b>450</b>. Accordingly, a feature of directly bonding the second die <b>430</b><i>b </i>to the first die <b>430</b><i>a </i>is that it is more likely that the second die <b>430</b><i>b </i>will remain parallel to the support member <b>450</b> and, therefore, parallel to the lens <b>461</b>. This feature is advantageous because if the second die <b>430</b><i>b </i>is not parallel to the lens <b>461</b>, the device <b>410</b> may not operate properly because the lens <b>461</b> may not accurately focus radiation received by and/or emitted by the second die <b>430</b><i>b. </i></p>
