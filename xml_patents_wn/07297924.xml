<heading id="h-0001" level="1">GENERAL TECHNICAL AREA</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention pertains to devices for day and night vision.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">More precisely, it concerns an optronic device for day and night vision, in particular a portable device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Optronic devices for day and night vision are used in various portable devices for the observation of an environment. The observation devices are installed for example in binoculars and/or the sights of weapons or infantry helmets.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It will be understood that portable observation devices are most preferably of small size and lightweight.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known optronic observation devices generally comprise an integrated day optic pathway and night optic pathway.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An example of said device may therefore comprise two separate pathways. For a video device, this may then comprise two optic pathways and two separate sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferably, the day pathway comprises a known detection matrix of Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) type or a known detection matrix of Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor type (CMOS).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Generally the night pathway comprises either a light intensifier device coupled to a Charge-Coupled Device called an Intensified Charge-Coupled Device (ICCD), or a light intensifier device coupled to a Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor called an Intensified Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (ICMOS), or preferably a known Electronic Bombarded Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (EBCMOS) or a known Electron Bombarded Charge-Coupled Device (EBCCD).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In day and night vision devices of LI type (light intensifier) a photocathode firstly conducts conversion of incident photons derived from the scene into electrons. The electrons are then multiplied in an amplifying plate formed of microchannels before striking a phosphorus screen which in turn conducts conversion of the electrons into emitted photons. The emitted photons are then sent via a taper of optic fibres onto a CCD or CMOS sensor, after which a video image can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows that in night vision devices using EBCMOS or EBCCD technology, a lens focuses the incident photons <b>10</b> derived from the scene onto a photocathode <b>11</b> located in a sealed casing <b>25</b>. As in devices of LI tube type, the material of the photocathode <b>11</b> contains AsGa (gallium arsenide) or is a multi-alkali material. The photocathode converts the photons into electrons <b>13</b>. The latter are accelerated in a chamber <b>12</b> in which a vacuum is set up and in which a difference of potential of absolute value V of several thousand volts is applied. The accelerated electrons <b>13</b> “bombard” a CMOS or CCD matrix <b>14</b> making it possible to obtain a video image via means <b>15</b> at the output of matrix <b>14</b>. Means <b>26</b> enable control and polarisation signals to be sent to the casing <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">EBCMOS or EBCCD tehnologies have the particular advantage of allowing the design of night vision devices to be less costly, more lightweight, less cumbersome and with lower consumption than those using LI tube technology, in particular on account of the absence of an amplifying micro-channel plate and phosphorus screen. Also, the absence of this micro-channel plate minimises gas desorption, thereby facilitating the maintaining of a high quality vacuum that is required inside the casing to guarantee low noise and a long life span of the photocathode.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A day/night observation device may also comprise two semi-separate pathways.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that in this case the device comprises an optic pathway <b>1</b> common to both sensors <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> via a beam separator <b>4</b>. The day sensor <b>2</b> is a CCD matrix for example or CMOS matrix. The night sensor <b>3</b> is an ICCD or ICMOS device for example, or preferably an EBCMOS or EBCCD sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The preceding devices have drawbacks however.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Said observation devices allow day/night observation but they require numerous optical elements and two sensors. The assembly of said elements and sensors is made to the detriment of compactness and lightweight of the observation device. They are therefore cumbersome and relatively heavy, due to the presence of the two separate or semi-separate pathways.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">To solve these problems, it is possible to provide only a single pathway in the observation device.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows that current LI devices can be used during the daytime by positioning a retractable element <b>5</b> between the environment and the objective lens of the optic pathway <b>1</b>. Element <b>5</b> is a diaphragm and/or an optical density positioned on the lens. For night vision element <b>5</b> is retracted. For daytime vision the element is positioned on the lens to allow use of the device, and in particular use of sensor <b>2</b>, without any risk of over-illuminating the photocathode.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Operationally, the use of said observation device is of little interest insofar as image quality is limited by the LI tube and the yield of its conversions. The use of a LI device in daytime mode does not match that of a conventional daytime pathway (CMOS or CCD).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Prior art observation devices do not permit use of EBCMOS or EBCCD technology for daytime vision in an observation device comprising a single optic pathway, in particular due to the degradation of the photocathode under strong daytime illumination and to the need for refocusing between the daytime beam and night beam.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRESENTATION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The invention sets out to overcome at least one of these disadvantages.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">For this purpose, the invention proposes an optronic observation device comprising a detector, the detector comprising a photocathode and a sensor arranged to receive an incident light beam, the device also comprising switching means able to position an optic element opposite said detector on the pathway of the incident beam, or to retract said element, the device comprising means able to focus an incident ray on the photocathode when the element is in retracted position, characterised in that the element, when positioned opposite the detector, is able to focus the beam on the sensor and to filter the beam spectrally to block all or part of the wavelengths for which the responsiveness of the photocathode is greater than a given threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The invention is advantageously completed by the following characteristics either alone or in any technically possible combination thereof:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0023">the responsiveness threshold for which the element is able to filter the wavelengths corresponds to a threshold of thermal non-degradation of the photocathode. It defines a spectral zone for which the photocathode no longer or scarcely interacts with the incident photons and for which sensor responsiveness is sufficient to provide a video signal of good quality;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0024">the photocathode is positioned upstream of the sensor on the beam pathway and comprises gallium arsenide (AsGa) or silicon with multi-alkali deposit,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0025">the sensor is of Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor type or Charge-Coupled type,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0026">the switching means are also able to position an optical balancing plate opposite the detector on the pathway of the incident beam when the optical element is in retracted position, or is able to retract said balancing plate when the element is opposite the detector;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0027">the balancing plate is able to filter the beam spectrally to block certain wavelengths;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0028">the plate comprises at least two zones for filtering wavelengths, the switching means being able to position each zone opposite the detector in relation to use of the device;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0029">the element is able to close the optical aperture of the detector;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0030">the detector is of EBCMOS or EBCCD type, the detection face of the CMOS or CCD sensor being the rear face;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0031">the day and night vision device is adapted in particular so that it can be positioned on an infantry helmet or on a weapon.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0032">The observation device of the invention has numerous advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0033">Firstly, it is compact and lightweight. It only comprises a single optic pathway common to day and night vision. It also allows day and night vision using one same sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0034">In particular it enables the use of EBCMOS or EBCCD technology for night vision, and permits the switching from EBCMOS or EBCCD night technology to CMOS or CCD technology for day vision without having to refocus the incident ray.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0035">In addition, it provides protection for the photocathode during daytime vision without the use of a diaphragm or optical density.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0036">The invention fulfils the same functions as prior art devices while associating therewith good image quality due in particular to good CMOS resolution for example, and is not costly since no LI tube is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0037">The invention is very simple to produce since it only comprises a single optic pathway, a single sensor and a mobile filter also protecting the photocathode. The invention is also very simple to use.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0045">The invention chiefly comprises an optical device intended to equip a sight on an infantry helmet for example or a weapon.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0046">The device advantageously permits day and night vision.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0047">For this purpose, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows that an optronic observation device according to the invention, in night observation position, comprises a detector <b>2</b> comprising a photocathode <b>11</b> and an optic sensor <b>14</b>. The photocathode <b>11</b> is positioned upstream of the sensor <b>14</b> on the pathway of a light beam <b>24</b> derived from the scene to be observed. The incident light beam <b>24</b> is focused by means of a lens <b>23</b> on the photocathode <b>11</b> of the detector in night position.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0048">For this purpose, the photocathode <b>11</b> conducts a conversion of the photons of beam <b>24</b> to covert them into electrons able to be detected by the sensor <b>14</b>. The electrons pass through a chamber <b>12</b> between the photocathode <b>11</b> and the sensor <b>14</b> and come to strike the sensor <b>14</b> to give a night image via processing by means <b>15</b> at the output of the sensor <b>14</b>. Preferably, the chamber <b>12</b> is a vacuum chamber in which a difference of potential in the order of 2000 volts prevails, in order to suitably accelerate the electrons produced by the photocathode <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0049">The detector <b>14</b> may be of Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) type or preferably of Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) type. Preferably, the detection face of the CMOS or CCD sensor <b>14</b> is the rear face. Detection on the rear face makes it possible to improve the detection yield of the sensor and avoids filling-factor problems on the front face of the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0050">It will be understood that the detector <b>2</b> is of EBCCD type or preferably of EBCMOS type. The photocathode <b>11</b> may be a Generation-2 photocathode containing silicon and multi alkali deposit, or preferably a Generation-3 photocathode containing gallium arsenide (AsGa).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows the device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> but this time in position for day vision.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0052">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> it will be noted that the device comprises switching means <b>17</b> able to position an optical element <b>16</b> opposite the detector <b>2</b> on the pathway of the incident beam <b>24</b>. Element <b>16</b> in this position is able to focus the incident beam <b>24</b> on the sensor and no longer on the photocathode <b>11</b>. Element <b>16</b> is also able to filter beam <b>24</b> spectrally to block the wavelengths for which the responsiveness of the photocathode is greater than a given threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows sample curves of standard responsiveness of photocathode <b>11</b> (in dotted lines) for an AsGa photocathode and sensor <b>14</b> (in solid lines) in relation to the wavelength of the incident beam. Evidently the curve in dotted lines may optionally change for different photocathodes depending upon doping.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0054">It is ascertained that for wavelengths of less than 500 nanometres or greater than 950 nanometres, the photocathode <b>11</b> is transparent to the incident beam since its responsiveness it practically zero. On the other hand, for wavelengths lying substantially between 600 nanometres and 850 nanometres (i.e. part of the visible band and near infrared) the responsiveness of the photocathode is optimal. If a photocathode is used in this band of optimal responsiveness with illumination intensities corresponding to daytime intensities, it may be destroyed or seriously damaged (heat destruction and early wear).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0055">Consequently if, in front of the photocathode <b>11</b>, an optical element <b>16</b> is arranged which spectrally filters the beam to block out wavelengths for which the responsiveness of the photocathode is greater than a given threshold, the photocathode will be protected against damage by light that is too intense.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0056">The preferable threshold is one half or less of the maximum responsiveness of the photocathode. This threshold typically corresponds to a value of 100 mA/W for a standard AsGa photocathode.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0057">For wavelengths which are not filtered, the photocathode <b>11</b> is transparent or semi-transparent.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0058">If element <b>16</b>, enabling filtration of the wavelengths which destroy photocathode <b>11</b>, also permits focusing of the transmitted beam onto the sensor <b>14</b>, it then becomes possible to conduct observation of the day environment.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0059">Therefore with a device of the invention it is possible to use the sensor <b>14</b> for day vision with no refocusing of the lens <b>23</b> and without any risk of deteriorating the photocathode. It is recalled that preferably the sensor is of CMOS type and that the detector is generally of EBCMOS type.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0060">Preferably, element <b>16</b> forms an optic filter able to filter the wavelengths for which the responsiveness of the photocathode is at best zero but at least less than a destruction threshold under day illumination. For an AsGa photocathode this corresponds to filtering wavelengths of less than 900 nm and/or filtering wavelengths greater than 530 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0061">Element <b>16</b> may advantageously be a dichroic plate. The transmitted wavelengths may either be in the visible band or in the near infrared band. It is to be noted that visualisation of the daytime pathway in the near IR offers some advantages among which an increase in contrast of the target against vegetation (chlorophyll albedo) and improved atmospheric transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0062">The switching means comprise a motor <b>17</b> for example, driving a shaft <b>20</b> connected to element <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0063">The thickness <b>18</b> of element <b>16</b> is such that the beam <b>24</b> is focused on the sensor <b>14</b> after passing through the lens <b>23</b> and element <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0064">These means <b>17</b> are evidently able to retract element <b>16</b> so that, if it is desired to return to night vision after day vision, the position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> changes to the position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> schematically show a second possible embodiment of a device of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0066">According to this embodiment, to avoid mechanical unbalance of the device, the switching means are able to position a balance plate <b>21</b> opposite the detector on the pathway of the incident beam when the optical element <b>16</b> is in retracted position, as is the case <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. Elements <b>21</b> and <b>16</b> are positioned symmetrically with respect to each other in relation to the longitudinal axis of the arm <b>20</b> coupled to the motor of the switching means <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows that the switching means <b>17</b> are able to retract the plate <b>21</b> when element <b>16</b> is opposite the detector <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0068">The balancing plate advantageously permits the mechanical equilibrium of an element forming a supporting block <b>22</b> for element <b>16</b> should the thickness of element <b>16</b> be too narrow for easy handling and sufficient mechanical resistance. Evidently element <b>16</b> and the support <b>22</b> may be in a single piece. They would then form a single element.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0069">Block <b>22</b> is not necessary if element <b>16</b> is sufficiently thick.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0070">Preferably the balancing plate is also able to filter the beam spectrally to block some wavelengths. The balancing plate <b>21</b> evidently always permits focusing of the incident beam on the photocathode <b>11</b> in association with the lens <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0071">Advantageously the plate <b>21</b> comprises at least two zones for filtering wavelengths. The switching means are able to position each zone opposite the detector in relation to the desired use of the device. The plate <b>21</b> may therefore be a high-pass filter and/or a low-pass filter.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0072">Preferably block <b>22</b> and element <b>16</b> are able to close the optical aperture of the detector. They therefore form a diaphragm.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0073">Block <b>22</b> and element <b>16</b> may comprise at least two zones for filtering wavelengths. The switching means are able to position each zone opposite the detector in relation to the desired use of the device. To position each filtering zone opposite the detector, shaft <b>20</b> needs only to be rotated to a different angle for example.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0074">Closing of the aperture and the positioning of the different filters in day position provide good depth of field for the device.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0075">As a further example, in daytime vision, block <b>22</b> and element <b>16</b> form a band-pass filter the band being centred for example around 500 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0076">It will be understood that optical filters other than those described may be positioned opposite the sensor in relation to the desired applications. In particular filters of different thickness allow the device to ensure day focusing (sensor) or night focusing (photocathode) for different distances to be focused.</p>
