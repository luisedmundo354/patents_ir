<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to controllers for interactively controlling an HVAC system, and more particularly to an integrated system of HVAC controls for interactively controlling various components in the HVAC system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many present HVAC systems employ a network for communicating information utilizing a master/slave network arrangement, in which a thermostat or similar central controller is the master that communicates to various slave components within the HVAC system. Such networks require a central communication control, without which the system components may not communicate or interact to operate the HVAC system. Thus, the various HVAC component controllers rely on the master controller to communicate operating instructions and system diagnostics, and each controller does not independently manage its operation based on diagnostic information obtained by other HVAC controllers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention provides for an interactive control system for controlling the operation of various controllers in an HVAC system. The interactive system comprises a thermostat for initiating the operation of the HVAC system in either a full capacity mode of operation or at least one reduced capacity mode of operation, and a controller for an outside condenser unit having a condenser fan motor and a compressor motor, the controller being capable of operating the compressor in a full capacity mode and at least one reduced capacity mode. The system also comprises a controller for an indoor blower, which is capable of operating a blower fan motor in a full capacity mode and in at least one reduced capacity mode. The interactive system further includes a communication means for transmitting information between the outside condenser unit controller and the indoor blower controller relating to the operation of the condenser unit components and the blower components, where the indoor blower controller responsively controls the operation of the blower fan motor in a full capacity mode or a reduced capacity mode based on the information received from the outdoor unit controller. The outdoor unit controller may responsively control the operation of the compressor in a full capacity mode or a reduced capacity mode based on the information received from the indoor blower controller.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one aspect of the present invention, some embodiments of an interactive system may comprise at least two controllers that communicate with each other to provide a method of controlling the operation of an HVAC system in either a full capacity mode of operation or a reduced capacity mode of operation based on the communication between the at least two controllers of information relating to the operation of various components in the HVAC system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another aspect of the present invention, some embodiments of an interactive system having two or more controllers are provided that are capable of detecting component operating parameters and communicating the operating parameter information to at least one other controller to enable confirming diagnostics for predicting potential component failure or required servicing. These and other features and advantages will be in part apparent, and in part pointed out hereinafter.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One preferred embodiment of a system comprising a plurality of interactive controllers for controlling the operation of an HVAC system in accordance with the principles of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown and described, the HVAC system preferably includes at least one air conditioner comprising an outdoor condenser unit <b>22</b> having a controller <b>24</b>, at least one indoor blower unit <b>26</b> having an indoor blower controller <b>28</b> and at least one thermostat <b>30</b> for controlling the operation of the various units. The HVAC system preferably comprises a heating unit <b>32</b>, such as an electric or gas-fired furnace, and a related furnace controller <b>34</b>. The HVAC system preferably comprises a blower unit <b>26</b> having a blower motor <b>36</b>. The blower motor <b>36</b> may further comprise a blower motor controller <b>38</b>. The thermostat <b>30</b> is capable of sensing the temperature within the space and responsively initiating operation of an air conditioning or furnace unit when the sensed temperature is more than a predetermined amount above or below a set point temperature of the thermostat <b>30</b>. In response to a thermostat signal request for cooling, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> will control the switching of power to both a condenser fan motor <b>40</b> and a compressor motor <b>42</b>, and the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> controls the blower motor <b>36</b> or the blower motor controller <b>38</b> to provide for air conditioning operation. Likewise, when the thermostat <b>30</b> signals a request for heating, the furnace controller <b>34</b> controls the activation of the furnace <b>32</b> and the blower motor controller <b>38</b> controls the blower motor <b>36</b> or the blower motor controller <b>38</b> to provide for heating operation. Each of the various controllers may be connected to either a high voltage power source or a low voltage power source. The outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may be configured to control a multi-capacity compressor motor <b>42</b> and as well as a variable speed condenser fan motor <b>40</b>. Likewise, the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> and the furnace controller <b>34</b> may be configured to establish multiple operating speeds of the blower motor <b>36</b>. The blower motor controller <b>38</b> may also comprise an inverter driver for enabling variable speed control of the blower motor.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In this first embodiment, the various controllers that control individual components within the HVAC system are further capable of bi-directional communication with each other, to interactively control and improve the operation of the HVAC system. For example, an HVAC system may comprise an indoor blower controller <b>28</b> and an outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> that communicate via a network that may or may not be in connection with the thermostat <b>30</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the thermostat <b>30</b> may request low stage cooling by sending a conventional 24 volt signal provided by transformer <b>46</b> via a “Y<b>1</b>” line to the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> and to the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>. During the request for cooling from the thermostat <b>30</b>, the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> may experience a blower motor failure and communicate the fault to the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>, which would responsively discontinue operation of the outdoor unit to protect the compressor <b>40</b> from being damaged. In this example, the communication between the individual controllers <b>24</b> and <b>28</b> mitigate damage by discontinuing operation, regardless of whether the thermostat <b>30</b> is still calling for low stage cooling operation. It should be noted that the indoor and outdoor controllers <b>28</b> and <b>24</b> may be used with either a conventional thermostat <b>30</b>, or a thermostat <b>30</b> that is configured to be connected to a communication network <b>48</b>. Where the thermostat <b>30</b> is configured to be connected to a communication network <b>48</b>, the thermostat <b>30</b> may send a cooling signal request via the network <b>48</b> or through the conventional 24 volt line connections to the indoor blower unit controller <b>28</b> and outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>. In the above example, a thermostat <b>30</b> that is configured to be connected to the communication network <b>48</b> would be capable of receiving the blower motor fault signal, and could responsively discontinue the call for cooling and notify the occupant of the blower motor failure. Additionally, the thermostat <b>30</b> may also communicate the fault signal to an outside location such as a service contractor or a system monitoring service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The communication means in this preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> comprises a two-wire peer-to-peer network <b>48</b>, such as an RS-485 peer-to-peer Local Area Network, but may alternatively comprise any other comparable network suitable for use in a peer-to-peer arrangement. The RS-485 network is a two-wire, multi-drop network that allows multiple units to share the same two wires in sending and receiving information. The two-wire network <b>48</b> connects to a transmitter and receiver of each controller in the HVAC system (up to 32 controller units). The controllers are always enabled in the receiver mode, monitoring the network <b>48</b> for information. Only one transmitter can communicate or occupy the network <b>48</b> at a time, so each individual controller is configured to transmit a fixed time period after the last transmission, where each controller has a time period that is unique to that controller. Thus, after one controller completes its transmission, another controller will wait for the prescribed time period before transmitting its information. In this manner, collisions of data transmission from different controllers may be avoided. The transmissions may also include leader information at the beginning of each transmission to identify the transmitting controller.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The network may also be configured to provide for communication with an outside location <b>50</b> utilizing, for example, a ModBus link <b>52</b>, through either one of the individual controllers such as the thermostat <b>30</b>, or through a separate network controller, which may provide for an interface or gateway with a ModBus link for communicating between the various component controllers and a ModBus network at an outside location. An example of such a controller is a RZ 100E RS-485 peer-to-peer network controller manufactured by Richards Zeta corporation. Where the thermostat <b>30</b> is in communication with the various controllers and also to an external ModBus link <b>52</b>, the thermostat <b>30</b> may transmit specific parameter or diagnostic information relating to the individual controllers and system components to an outside location <b>50</b> such as a monitoring service provider. The outside location <b>50</b> could also send commands to the thermostat <b>30</b> to control the operation of the HVAC system or to request specific operating parameter information. The thermostat <b>30</b> could accordingly function as a gateway for communicating with an outside location <b>50</b>, and could be remotely controlled by the outside location <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may comprise a processor <b>60</b> and a plurality of switching means <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> for controlling the switching of line voltage <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> to the compressor motor <b>42</b> and to the condenser fan motor <b>40</b>. The switching means preferably are relays, and may be a A22500P2 latching relay manufactured by American Zettler. The condenser fan motor relay <b>62</b> and at least one compressor motor relay <b>64</b> are also in connection with the processor <b>60</b>. The processor <b>60</b> may be a 28 pin PIC16F microprocessor manufactured by Microchip. The relays <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> have first and second contacts, at least one of which may be in communication with the processor <b>60</b>, and preferably at least the non-moving contact of which is in communication with the processor. This enables the processor <b>60</b> to activate the relay and sense voltage at the stationary contact, to verify when the contacts are closed, as well as when they are open. Thus, the processor <b>60</b> has the capability of determining, in the absence of activation, when the contacts have stuck.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> can include a low voltage power supply that is preferably a half wave regulated power supply (not shown) comprising a diode in series with a transistor and a regulating capacitor and zener diode for gating the transistor. The power supply may also be a small transformer and zener diode circuit. The low voltage power supply powers the processor <b>60</b>, which includes a plurality of Analog to Digital data inputs for receiving information from various data inputs in connection with the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>. One particular outdoor condenser unit controller <b>24</b> that may be used in the present invention is the 49H22 Unitary Control manufactured by White-Rodgers, a Division of Emerson Electric Co.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> also receives input from a plurality of sensors <b>72</b> through <b>90</b> for monitoring operating parameters of the outdoor unit components. These sensors may include current sensors <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> for sensing the current level in the start winding and run winding of the compressor motor <b>42</b>, and a sensor <b>78</b> for sensing the current in the condenser fan motor <b>40</b>. Other sensors may include a sensor <b>80</b> for sensing the magnitude of the line voltage to the motors, a temperature sensor <b>82</b> for sensing the condenser coil temperature, a temperature sensor <b>84</b> for sensing the outside ambient temperature, and a temperature sensor <b>86</b> for sensing the compressor's refrigerant Discharge Line Temperature (DLT). The compressor of the outdoor unit <b>22</b> is preferably a scroll compressor, and may be for example a two-step scroll compressor manufactured by Copeland Corporation. This scroll compressor includes a high capacity operating level and a solenoid <b>92</b> for actuating a mid-capacity operating level. The outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> controls a switch <b>94</b> for actuating the mid-capacity solenoid <b>92</b> of the compressor. The outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> is configured to provide diagnostic information or codes based on the current values obtained from the current sensors <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> and <b>78</b> for monitoring the current in the condenser fan motor <b>40</b> and the compressor motor <b>42</b>. This current sensing may provide diagnostic information or fault codes such as a repeated motor protector trip fault, welded contacts in the switching relays <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>, an open start winding circuit, an open run winding circuit, or a locked rotor current fault. The outdoor unit controller may communicate these failures through a com-port <b>58</b> to the network connection <b>48</b>, and/or may communicate the failures locally through a flashing multi-color status LED <b>52</b>. Examples of the diagnostic information or fault codes relating to the compressor or condenser fan that may be communicated are shown in the table below.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one situation, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may respond to sensing an open circuit or locked rotor condition in the condenser fan motor <b>40</b> by discontinuing operation of the compressor motor <b>42</b> and communicating via the network <b>48</b> a condenser fan motor failure to the other controllers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>38</b> in the HVAC system. The indoor blower controller <b>28</b> and blower motor controller <b>38</b> could respond by discontinuing operation until the fault condition is removed, regardless of whether the thermostat <b>30</b> may be calling for cooling operation. The outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may also respond to sensing an open circuit or locked rotor condition of the compressor motor <b>42</b> by discontinuing operation of the condenser fan motor <b>40</b> and communicating via the network <b>48</b> a compressor motor failure to the other controllers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>38</b> in the HVAC system. The processor <b>60</b> of the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may also control the speed of the condenser fan motor <b>40</b>, where a variable speed motor is utilized, based on the sensed ambient temperature data received from the temperature sensor <b>84</b>. When the thermostat <b>30</b> is calling for cooling operation and the sensed outside ambient temperature is relatively low, as in an overnight or early morning situations, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may responsively operate the condenser fan motor <b>40</b> at a reduced speed for reducing the operating noise level of the outside unit <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Likewise, in the situation where the thermostat <b>30</b> is calling for cooling and the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> receives a communication via the network connection <b>48</b> of an indoor blower motor failure, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> will respond by discontinuing the operation of the outdoor unit components to protect the compressor motor <b>42</b> from possible damage. Similarly, in the situation where the thermostat <b>30</b> is calling for high capacity “Y<b>2</b>” second stage cooling, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may receive a communication via the network connection <b>48</b> of a reduced speed for the indoor blower motor <b>36</b> due to overheating of the inverter drive circuit <b>96</b> in the blower motor controller <b>38</b>. The outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> will respond by switching relay <b>94</b> for actuating the mid-capacity solenoid <b>92</b> to operate the compressor at a reduced capacity to correspond to the reduced blower motor speed, regardless of whether the thermostat <b>30</b> is calling to high capacity “Y<b>2</b>” second stage cooling. This provides for a limp-along mode that will still provide some degree of cooling, while running the compressor at a capacity corresponding to the reduced speed of the indoor blower motor <b>36</b> to provide safe operation for the compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a situation where the thermostat <b>30</b> is calling for full capacity “Y<b>2</b>” second stage cooling and the line voltage <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> to the compressor motor <b>42</b> is sensed to be significantly below rated operating voltage of the compressor motor <b>42</b>, the outdoor controller <b>24</b> may discontinue compressor operation at full capacity, and switch the relay <b>94</b> for actuating the mid-capacity solenoid <b>92</b> to operate the compressor at the mid-capacity level. The outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may then communicate a high capacity compressor lockout fault via the network <b>48</b> to the indoor unit controller <b>28</b>, which would responsively request the blower motor controller <b>38</b> to operate the blower motor <b>36</b> at the reduced speed corresponding to “Y<b>1</b>” first stage operation, regardless of whether the thermostat <b>30</b> is calling for “Y<b>2</b>” second stage cooling. If the thermostat <b>30</b> is connected to the communication network <b>48</b>, the thermostat <b>30</b> may respond to the high capacity compressor lock-out fault by only calling for low capacity “Y<b>1</b>” second stage cooling, and by notifying the occupant or an outside location <b>50</b> of the low line voltage and high capacity compressor lock-out fault.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may also provide a high side pressure fault, which may be sensed by either a pressure sensor <b>88</b> or by the sensed compressor motor current at <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>. For example, in the Copeland scroll compressor, the sensed motor current is approximately linear with respect to the sensed high side refrigerant pressure, and is also an indirect way of measuring the compressor's high side pressure. In the situation where the compressor's high side pressure is excessive, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may respond by switching the relay <b>94</b> for actuating the mid-capacity solenoid of the scroll compressor to operate the compressor at a mid-capacity level. The outside unit controller <b>24</b> may then communicate a high side pressure fault condition via the network <b>48</b> to the other system controllers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>38</b>. The indoor blower controller <b>28</b> may then respond by requesting the blower motor controller <b>38</b> to operate the blower motor <b>36</b> at the reduced speed corresponding to “Y<b>1</b>” first stage operation, regardless of whether the thermostat <b>30</b> is calling for “Y<b>2</b>” second stage cooling. If the thermostat <b>30</b> is connected to the communication network <b>48</b>, the thermostat <b>30</b> may respond to the high capacity compressor lock-out fault by only calling for low capacity “Y<b>1</b>” second stage cooling. The thermostat <b>30</b> may also notify the occupant or an outside location <b>50</b> of the low line voltage and high capacity compressor lock-out fault. This provides a limp along mode of operation at less than full capacity that will still provide some degree of cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the above situation of a compressor high side pressure fault, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may also provide another limp along mode of operation that limits full capacity compressor operation to a minimum time duration by cycling the compressor on and off. This would still provide some degree of cooling without damaging the compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the situation where the thermostat <b>30</b> is calling for low capacity “Y<b>1</b>” first stage cooling, and the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> senses via the current level that the mid-capacity solenoid <b>92</b> of the scroll compressor is not functioning, the outside unit controller <b>24</b> will switch the compressor to full capacity operation and communicate a low capacity compressor lock-out fault via the network <b>48</b> to the indoor blower controller <b>28</b>. The indoor blower controller <b>28</b> may respond by requesting the blower motor controller <b>38</b> to operate the blower motor <b>36</b> at full speed to correspond with the full capacity compressor operation, regardless of whether the thermostat <b>30</b> is calling for low capacity “Y<b>1</b>” first stage cooling. The outdoor and indoor unit controllers <b>24</b> and <b>28</b> would continue to operate in only high capacity mode until the low-capacity compressor lock-out fault signal is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Where the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> is used in a heat pump application, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may also monitor current of the compressor motor <b>42</b> and the outdoor coil temperature to control defrost operation of the compressor. Specifically, an outdoor coil temperature may provide an indication that frost is building up on the condenser coil. The outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> can also sense frost build up by monitoring the current in the compressor motor <b>42</b>, which steadily decreases as the load is hampered by the buildup of frost on the condenser coil. When the compressor motor current decreases by a predetermined amount, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> can ascertain when to initiate a defrost cycle, in conjunction with or without the temperature value of the outdoor coil. However, a condenser coil temperature sensor is not able to detect the presence of frost across the entire outdoor condenser coil, which may comprise multiple flow circuits. If any portion of the coil still has residual frost, the single coil temperature sensor may not be able to detect the presence of residual frost. When frost has accumulated across the entire outdoor condenser coil, airflow becomes restricted and the current of the condenser fan motor <b>40</b> increases as a result of the restriction. Thus, the current of the condenser fan motor <b>40</b> may be a better predictor for defrost cycle control, and may be monitored to determine when to either initiate or terminate a defrost cycle through activation or deactivation of reversing valve solenoid <b>130</b>. The current of the compressor motor <b>42</b> will increase quickly during defrost of the condenser coil, and may also be used in conjunction with the current of the condenser fan motor <b>40</b> to determine when to either initiate or terminate a defrost cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In yet another situation, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may also monitor the compressor motor current at <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, and <b>76</b>, and the discharge line temperature (DLT) to determine if a low refrigerant charge condition is present. If the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> senses a high relative compressor motor current and a high relative DLT rise immediately after starting the compressor motor <b>42</b>, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> would communicate a possible low refrigerant charge condition via the network <b>48</b> to the other system controllers <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The processor <b>60</b> of the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may further be adapted to continuously obtain the sensed line voltage <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and the sensed current levels at <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, and <b>78</b> of the compressor motor <b>42</b> and condenser fan motor <b>40</b> during the operation of theses components. By obtaining this data from the line voltage and motor current sensors, the processor of the outdoor unit controller can compute the apparent power during the run time of the outdoor unit <b>22</b>, and maintain a running KVA total of the power consumed by the outdoor unit <b>22</b>. This information may be periodically communicated via the network <b>48</b> to other controllers in the system such as a thermostat <b>30</b> connected to the network <b>48</b>. The thermostat <b>30</b> could accordingly report the month-to-date estimated energy consumed, or utility costs, to the occupant or user of the thermostat <b>30</b>. The processor <b>60</b> of the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may also periodically communicate the outside ambient temperature sensed at <b>84</b> via the network <b>48</b> to other controllers such as the thermostat <b>30</b>, for example. The thermostat <b>30</b> could accordingly adjust its temperature set point based on the ambient temperature sensed at <b>84</b> to improve the economic operation of the HVAC system.</p>

When receiving a request for low capacity “Y<b>1</b>” first stage cooling from the thermostat <b>30</b>, the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> communicates a high speed signal via <b>108</b> to the processor <b>110</b> of the blower motor controller <b>38</b>. The processor <b>100</b> of the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> may also receive information input from a return air temperature sensor and a supply air temperature sensor, or from temperature sensors across the evaporator or A-coil. If the blower motor controller <b>38</b> communicates a blower motor failure via the network <b>48</b>, the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> and outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> will respond by discontinuing the operation to protect the compressor and or other components from possible damage. Similarly, in the situation where the thermostat <b>30</b> is calling for high capacity “Y<b>2</b>” second stage cooling and the blower motor controller <b>38</b> communicates a high speed blower motor fault due to an overheated inverter <b>96</b>, the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> will request the blower motor controller <b>38</b> to switch the blower motor <b>36</b> to low speed blower operation and communicate a high speed motor blower fault via the network <b>48</b> to the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>. The outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> will respond by switching the relay <b>94</b> for actuating the mid-capacity solenoid <b>94</b> to operate the compressor at a reduced capacity to correspond to the reduced speed of the indoor blower motor <b>36</b>, regardless of whether the thermostat <b>30</b> is calling to high capacity “Y<b>2</b>” second stage cooling.

The indoor blower controller <b>28</b> and the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may also communicate to each other information that may verify whether a condition with the outdoor unit <b>22</b> and a condition with the indoor blower unit <b>26</b> confirm a diagnostic problem in the HVAC system. For example, upon receiving a communication from the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> of a possible loss of charge fault, the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> will determine the sensed temperatures across the A-coil and compare the temperature difference to a predetermined delta to evaluate whether the difference is out of range. If the temperature difference across the A-coil is below the predetermined delta, the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> may communicate the out of range temperature across the A-coil via the network <b>48</b>, which would confirm that the refrigerant charge is low. This information communicated via the network <b>48</b> may be received by a thermostat <b>30</b> connected to the network <b>48</b>, which could then notify the occupant or and outside location <b>50</b> of the low refrigerant charge condition.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this preferred embodiment of the present invention, a blower motor controller <b>38</b> comprising a processor <b>110</b> and an inverter driver <b>96</b> for a variable speed blower motor <b>36</b> is provided.

The blower motor controller <b>38</b> is capable of sensing an over-temperature condition in the blower motor <b>36</b> or the inverter <b>96</b>, and responsively reducing the speed of the blower motor <b>36</b> to protect the blower motor windings. The blower motor controller <b>38</b> then communicates a reduced speed due to an overheating condition to the other system controllers via the network. The indoor blower will respond to this communication by requesting the blower motor controller <b>38</b> to switch the motor to low speed blower operation, and communicate a high speed motor blower fault via the network to the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Where the blower motor controller <b>38</b> experiences an overheating condition and responsively reduces the blower motor speed during a call for high stage heating, the blower motor controller <b>38</b> communicates the reduced blower speed condition via the network <b>48</b> to the furnace controller <b>34</b>. The furnace controller <b>34</b> responds to this communication by responsively switching the operation of the furnace from high stage “W<b>1</b>” operation to low stage “W<b>2</b>” operation, regardless of whether the thermostat <b>30</b> is calling for “W<b>1</b>” high stage heating. The furnace controller <b>34</b> in this preferred embodiment comprises a processor <b>124</b> for controlling the switching of line voltage to the igniter <b>118</b>, the switching of low voltage to a gas valve relay <b>120</b>, and low voltage to a second stage gas valve relay <b>122</b>.

In one embodiment of the present invention, the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> may be configured for use with a multi-speed blower motor <b>36</b> that is directly switched via at least one relay <b>102</b> by the indoor blower controller <b>28</b>. The indoor blower controller <b>28</b> is capable of determining a malfunction in either the high speed operation or low speed operation of the motor corresponding to the first and second stage operation of the compressor. In the event that a malfunction occurs in the high speed operation or low speed operation, or both, the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> communicates the malfunction via the network to the other system controllers <b>24</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>38</b>. If the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> communicates a complete blower motor failure, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> will respond by discontinuing the operation of the outdoor unit <b>22</b> to protect the compressor from possible damage. Similarly, in the situation where the thermostat <b>30</b> is calling for high capacity “Y<b>2</b>” second stage cooling and the indoor unit senses a high speed blower motor failure, the indoor blower will switch the blower motor <b>36</b> to low speed blower operation and communicate a high speed motor blower fault via the network <b>48</b> to the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>.

This provides for a limp-along mode that will still provide some degree of cooling, while running the compressor at a capacity corresponding to the reduced speed of the indoor blower motor <b>36</b> to provide safe operation for the compressor.

The indoor blower controller <b>28</b> and the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may also communicate to each other to information that may verify whether a condition with the outdoor unit <b>22</b> and a condition with the indoor blower <b>26</b> confirm a diagnostic problem in the HVAC system. For example, upon receiving a communication from the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> of a possible loss of charge fault, the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> will determine the sensed temperatures across the A-coil and compare the temperature difference to a predetermined delta to evaluate whether the difference is out of range.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In various embodiments of the present invention, each of the various controllers <b>24</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> also initially establish a base value for various operating parameters relating to each of the controllers and corresponding components. For example, the blower motor controller <b>38</b> may establish a base value for the line voltage and speed of the blower motor <b>36</b>, and calculate a base Cubic Feet per Minute (CFM) of the blower motor <b>36</b>. When a predetermined reduction in calculated CFM occurs (indicating a dirty air filter), the blower motor controller <b>38</b> may communicate a dirty or clogged air filter condition via the network <b>48</b> to the thermostat <b>30</b>, which may responsively notify the occupant or an outside location <b>50</b> of the dirty filter condition. In another situation, a baseline curve of the compressor discharge pressure versus the compressor motor current relative to the ambient temperature could be obtained. Any subsequent variation from the curve relationship between the discharge pressure and compressor motor current values could be used to indicate a fault or to predict degradation and potential failure of the compressor. Likewise, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> may establish a base value for the DLT <b>86</b> and the sensed current at <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> for the compressor motor <b>42</b> relative to the sensed outside ambient temperature at <b>84</b>. When the DLT at <b>86</b> and the compressor motor current rise significantly above the relative base line values, the outside controller <b>24</b> responsively communicates a possible low charge condition via the network <b>48</b> to the thermostat <b>30</b>. The thermostat <b>30</b> may then notify the occupant or and outside location of the possible low charge condition.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In various embodiments of the present invention, a thermostat <b>30</b> is preferably connected to the network <b>48</b> and is capable of receiving diagnostic and fault information communicated from the various controllers <b>24</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>38</b> in the HVAC system. However, the interactive system is also capable of operating with other conventional thermostats that are not capable of being connected to the network <b>48</b>. The thermostat <b>30</b> preferably comprises an initial set-up mode that will prompt scheduled operation periods of all of the various controllers and components upon installation, to speed the process of obtaining base line parameter information for the various controllers and components within the system. For example, the thermostat <b>30</b> could detect the installation or connection of a compressor via the network <b>48</b>, and enter a learn mode that initiates scheduled operation of the compressor during the day and night, to quickly obtain a baseline curve of the motor current relative to outside ambient temperature. The thermostat <b>30</b> of the present invention is preferably controlled by a processor <b>128</b> and is connected to the peer-to-peer network <b>48</b> via an RS 485 connection for communicating to the other system controllers <b>24</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> in the HVAC system. The thermostat <b>30</b> may further comprise a wireless transmitter and receiver, for receiving transmitted temperature information from a plurality of temperature sensors <b>54</b> for a plurality of zones within the space. The thermostat <b>30</b> may further comprise a communication board (not shown) in the sub-base of the thermostat <b>30</b> that is adapted to provide a gateway connection to an external ModBus communication link <b>52</b>. The thermostat may receive requests through the ModBus network at an external location <b>50</b> to transmit specific parameter information, upon which the thermostat <b>30</b> may prompt the various controllers to obtain parameter information for communication to the external location <b>50</b>. This parameter information can be monitored by an operation monitoring service provider that may predict the possible failure of various components in the system based in degradation in parameter values. One example of an outside monitoring service provider that utilizes a ModBus network is the Emerson Retail Services group which similarly monitors the operation of commercial refrigerator cases.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The thermostat <b>30</b> may be configured to receive diagnostic information or fault signals communicated via the network <b>48</b>, and to display the diagnostic information or fault signal on a display means to alert the occupant. This fault signal may be an icon that flashes, for example synchronously with the signal received from the network <b>48</b>. The thermostat <b>30</b> may also be configured to respond to a fault signal with a standard message such as “FAULT” or “NEEDS SERVICE” that flashes, for example, synchronously with the signal received from the network <b>48</b>. The fault signal may also be an error code or text message specific to the indoor blower controller <b>28</b> or the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>. An example of a parameter that may be monitored is the flame signal obtained from a flame probe within a fuel-fired furnace, which the furnace controller <b>34</b> could communicate via the network through the thermostat <b>30</b>. The service provider would then be able to service the flame probe sensor before the furnace controller <b>38</b> shut down the furnace operation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Another example of parameters the thermostat <b>30</b> may monitor include the rate of temperature change in each of the zones within the space, which may be compared to an initial baseline rate of temperature change. Over time, the cooling system may experience a gradual reduction in capacity that results in a reduced rate of temperature change for the space. The thermostat <b>30</b> may accordingly sense when the rate of temperature change decreases below a predetermined optimum baseline rate of temperature change. The thermostat <b>30</b> may compare this data with data received from the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> concerning high motor current and high discharge line temperature indicative of a possible low refrigerant charge. Likewise, the thermostat <b>30</b> may also obtain data from the indoor blower unit controller <b>28</b> concerning a below normal temperature delta across the A-coil indicating a low refrigerant charge. This comparison of data at various communication nodes provides confirming diagnostics that strengthen predictions of system maintenance and diagnosis. The above situation of a low refrigerant charge could provide notification to a home owner of an inefficiency that often is unnoticed and overlooked. The thermostat <b>30</b> could provide notice to the homeowner, who could then service the system and reduce energy costs.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Some embodiments of an interactive HVAC system may further comprise a plurality of zone dampers <b>56</b> for controlling the supply of conditioned air to the one or more zones within the space. Either the thermostat <b>30</b>, or a damper controller, are capable of opening or closing individual zone dampers <b>56</b> in response to the temperature sensed by the remote temperature sensors <b>54</b> in each zone, to provide conditioned air from the indoor air blower <b>36</b> to each zone requiring heating or cooling. The plurality of zone dampers <b>56</b> are also preferably connected to the network <b>48</b>. In response to a signal from the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> via the network <b>48</b> of a reduced capacity operation malfunction (resulting in full capacity operation of the compressor <b>42</b> and indoor blower motor <b>36</b>), the thermostat <b>30</b> responsively would communicate a request signal to open each zone damper to correspond to a full capacity operation mode. Likewise, in response to a signal from the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b> via the network <b>48</b> of a full capacity operation malfunction (resulting in reduced capacity operation of the compressor <b>42</b> and indoor blower motor <b>36</b>), the thermostat <b>30</b> responsively would communicate a request signals to open only a minimum number of dampers to correspond to the reduced capacity operation mode.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition to the above thermostat <b>30</b>, or where the interactive system operates with a conventional thermostat that is not connected to the network <b>48</b>, a separate interface controller (not shown) may be connected to the network <b>48</b> for providing communication between the various controllers and a user or outside location <b>50</b>. The separate interface controller would be capable of providing the same gateway connection to an external ModBus communication link as in the afore described thermostat embodiment, and may also comprise an interface and display means for user access of system information. The interface controller therefore would allow a user or service technician to obtain diagnostic information and operating parameters relating to the HVAC system components, and would also provide for communication of diagnostic information to an outside location <b>50</b> such as a monitoring service provider. The interface controller would be able to receive information from the various indoor and outdoor unit controllers to provide confirming diagnostics for predicting potential component failure or required servicing, and communicate such information to the user, service technician, or an outside party.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Thus, various embodiments of an interactively controlled HVAC system having a plurality of HVAC components comprise one or more controllers for controlling one or more components of the HVAC system. Some embodiments comprise at least one controller for operating a component of the HVAC system, the controller modifying the operation of the component in response to information received about the operation of a another component of the HVAC system. The table below illustrates how various embodiments of an interactive system can comprise a combination of controllers, which controllers control certain components (indicated by C) and may modify the operation of its respective components in response to information received about the operation of other components (indicated by I) of the HVAC system.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Some embodiments of the present invention may also comprise a Personal Digital Assistant, PALM, or a computer or hand held device <b>134</b> may also be connected to the peer-to-peer network, for receiving operating information relating to the various controllers and components in the HVAC system. Such a device could be connected to the RS-485 network by a service technician during installation or servicing for troubleshooting and diagnosing the various components in the HVAC system. The hand held device <b>134</b> or computer could request parameter information and display the values of various sensors associated with the controllers connected to the network within the HVAC system, and display the information for the service technician. Such a device could include a hand held palm, which could be easily connected and programmed to receive and parse the information being communicated between the various HVAC controllers. It should also be noted that some of the components of the HVAC system may also communicate wirelessly with the network through the use of a transceiver unit in connection with the peer-to-peer network.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a third embodiment of the present invention, the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>′ may comprise a processor <b>60</b> and a means for communicating with a compressor diagnostic unit associated with the compressor. The compressor diagnostic unit comprises current sensing means and voltage sensing means for sensing the level of line voltage as well as the current in the run windings and the start windings of the compressor motor <b>42</b>. The outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>′ of the second embodiment comprises relays (<b>62</b> or <b>64</b>) for switching power to the compressor motor <b>42</b>, and receives current and voltage information from the compressor diagnostic unit rather than directly monitoring the current to the compressor motor <b>42</b>. The compressor diagnostic unit passively monitors the current in the compressor motor <b>42</b> and communicates compressor diagnostic information to the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>′ or directly to the thermostat <b>30</b>. The second embodiment the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>′ can communicate much of the same diagnostic information and faults as described in the first embodiment, to provide diagnostic information to other components on the network <b>48</b> such as the thermostat <b>30</b>. The outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>′ may also switch compressor operation from high capacity to the mid-capacity level, based on information received from the compressor diagnostic unit. The compressor diagnostic unit may also communicate compressor operating parameters and diagnostic information directly to the thermostat <b>30</b>, which may responsively control cooling request signals for activating the compressor motor <b>42</b> and condenser fan motor <b>40</b>. The thermostat <b>30</b> is therefore capable of initiating or activating the compressor motor <b>42</b> and the compressor fan motor <b>40</b>, based on the information received from the compressor diagnostic unit or the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>′. The thermostat <b>30</b> may further request full capacity operation or less than full capacity operation, based on information communicated by the compressor diagnostic unit or outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>′. An example of a thermostat <b>30</b> that may receive direct communication from a compressor diagnostic unit is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/750,113 entitled “Thermostat for use with compressor health indicator”, which is incorporated herein by reference. An example of a compressor diagnostic unit that may sense compressor operating parameters is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/625,979 entitled “Compressor Diagnostic System For Communicating With An Intelligent Device, which is incorporated herein by reference. The compressor diagnostic unit may also communicate a high side pressure fault condition, which may be sensed by either a pressure sensor <b>88</b> or by the compressor motor current. For example, the compressor diagnostic unit may sense a compressor motor current that may indirectly indicate a compressor high side refrigerant pressure, and may respond by communicating this high side pressure fault to either the outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>′ or the thermostat <b>30</b>. The thermostat <b>30</b> may respond by subsequently providing a request signal for high capacity of “Y<b>2</b>” second stage, rather than a request signal for low capacity operation of “Y<b>1</b>” first stage. The thermostat <b>30</b> may accordingly perform the switching of the compressor operation from high capacity to the mid-capacity level based on information received from the compressor diagnostic unit. Thus, this second embodiment of an outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>′ provides for passive control of the compressor, through the interactive communication with a compressor diagnostic unit of various operating parameters and faults to the thermostat <b>30</b> or outdoor unit controller <b>24</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Advantages of the above described embodiment and improvements should be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, as to enabling interactive communication between various controllers for controlling and improving the operation of an HVAC system. Additional design considerations may be incorporated without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the invention be limited by the particular embodiment or form described above, but by the appended claims.</p>
