<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Reference will now be made to the drawings to describe the preferred embodiments in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a supporting member <b>3</b> for a portable DVD player according to a first embodiment of the present invention are shown. The supporting member <b>3</b> is used for pivotally supporting a housing (not shown) of the portable DVD player, and the housing accommodates a plurality of components of the portable DVD player, such as a screen, a host etc. The supporting member <b>3</b> has a base <b>40</b> and a rotatable member <b>30</b> assembled on the base <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The rotatable member <b>30</b> includes a rotatable seat <b>32</b>, two washers <b>38</b>, two elastic members <b>34</b> and two fasteners <b>36</b>. The rotatable seat <b>32</b> is a hollow half-cylinder, which has a circular arc circumference surface and two elongated through holes <b>322</b> are formed thereon. The two elastic members <b>34</b> and the two fasteners <b>36</b> are used to locate the rotatable seat <b>32</b>, and the washers <b>38</b> is used to lessen the friction between the rotatable seat <b>32</b> and the elastic members <b>34</b>. Each of the two washers <b>38</b> and the elastic members <b>34</b> has a through hole (not labeled). In this embodiment, the elastic member <b>34</b> is a spring, which may be any other elements having elastic characteristics, such as elastic plate. The fastener <b>36</b> may be a screw or a nut.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The base <b>40</b> has a notch <b>42</b> for accommodating the rotatable seat <b>32</b> and a bottom plate <b>70</b> screwing on a bottom surface of the base <b>40</b>. The notch <b>42</b> is in a shape of half cylinder, having an inner surface (not labeled) corresponding to the circular arc circumference surface of the rotatable seat <b>32</b>. The notch <b>42</b> further has two protruding pole <b>44</b> extending outwardly from the inner surface, corresponding to the two elongated through holes <b>322</b> of the rotatable seat <b>32</b>. Each protruding pole <b>44</b> has an aperture, which has a size matching with that of the fasteners <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In assembly, the rotatable seat <b>32</b> of the rotatable member <b>30</b> is accommodated in the notch <b>42</b> of the base <b>40</b> and fixed thereon by the two protruding poles <b>44</b> of the notch <b>42</b> drilling through the two elongated through holes <b>322</b> of the rotatable seat <b>32</b>, respectively. The two washers <b>38</b> and the two elastic members <b>34</b> are set on the two protruding poles <b>44</b> through their through holes, respectively. In addition, the two fasteners are fixed on the two protruding poles <b>44</b> by screwing on the apertures of the two protruding poles <b>44</b>, respectively, which press the elastic members <b>34</b> and make the elastic members <b>34</b> produce elastic deformation and provide an elastic force to the rotatable seat <b>32</b>. After the rotatable member <b>30</b> and the base <b>40</b> are assembled together, the housing of the portable DVD player can be fixed on the supporting member <b>3</b> by a plurality of screws <b>50</b>, which screws in the corresponding elongated through holes <b>422</b> of the base <b>40</b>, the rotatable member <b>30</b> and the housing. Thus, the angle adjustment of the portable DVD player can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When a force is provided on the housing of the DVD player for adjusting the angle, the rotatable seat <b>32</b> rotates around its rotating axis and drives the housing to rotate to an ideal angle. In addition, the two elastic members <b>34</b> apply an adequate pressure to locate the housing of the portable DVD player in the ideal angle. The range of the adjustable angle can be controlled by the radian or the length of the elongated through holes <b>322</b> and <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The supporting member <b>3</b> for the portable DVD player utilizes the rotatable member <b>30</b> cooperating with a base <b>40</b> to realize the angle adjustment of the portable DVD player. The rotatable member <b>30</b> provides the rotatable seat <b>32</b>, the elastic member <b>34</b> and the fastener <b>36</b> instead of conventional hinge <b>2</b> having complex structure. Thus, the supporting member <b>3</b> has a simple structure and a low cost. In addition, the range of the adjustable angle degree can be controlled by the radian or the length of the elongated through hole <b>322</b>, which makes the manufacturing process simple and improves the productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In alternative embodiments, the amount of the protruding pole <b>32</b> can be decided by the size of the housing of the portable DVD player, which may be three, four or more.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The above description is given by way of example, and not limitation. Given the above disclosure, one skilled in the art could devise variations that are within the scope and spirit of the invention disclosed herein, including configurations ways of the recessed portions and materials and/or designs of the attaching structures. Further, the various features of the embodiments disclosed herein can be used alone, or in varying combinations with each other and are not intended to be limited to the specific combination described herein.
