<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to gaming machines and, more particularly, to a gaming machine having integrated video and non-video displays.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Gaming machines, such as slot machines, video poker machines and the like, have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally, the popularity of such machines with players is dependent on the likelihood (or perceived likelihood) of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing machines and the expectation of winning each machine is roughly the same (or believed to be the same), players are most likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting of the machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To enhance the entertainment value of a gaming machine, gaming machines may include features such as an enhanced payoff and a “secondary” or “bonus” game which may be played in conjunction with a “basic” game. The bonus game may comprise any type of game, either similar to or completely different from the basic game, which is entered upon the occurrence of a selected event or outcome of the basic game. Generally, the features provide a greater expectation of winning than the basic game. Additionally, more attractive or unusual video displays and/or audio may accompany the basic and bonus games. The fanciful and visually appealing displays offer tremendous advantages in player appeal and excitement relative to other known games. Such games are attractive to both players and operators. Thus, there is a continuing need to develop new features for the displays and the basic and bonus games to satisfy the demands of players and operators. Preferably, such new features will maintain, or even further enhance, the level of player excitement. The present invention is directed to satisfying these needs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with the foregoing, a gaming apparatus for conducting a wagering game comprises a video screen for displaying a dynamic video image and a structure for displaying non-video artwork. The video and non-video artworks are visually linked to form an integrated image associated with the wagering game. The structure covers a portion, but not all, of the video screen. Thus, video images on conventional video screens may effectively be blended with non-video artwork to create entertaining and attractive displays.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additional aspects of the invention will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the detailed description of various embodiments, which is made with reference to the drawings, a brief description of which is provided below.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail herein. However, it should be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Turning now to the drawings and referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a gaming machine <b>10</b> for conducting a wagering game in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The gaming machine <b>10</b> comprises a primary display <b>12</b> and an integrated secondary display <b>14</b>. The display <b>12</b> may be a mechanical reel slot display or a video display. In accordance with the present invention, the integrated display <b>14</b> includes a video screen <b>14</b><i>a </i>for displaying a dynamic video image and a rectangular structure <b>14</b><i>b </i>for displaying non-video artwork. The display <b>12</b> (if implemented in video) and the video screen <b>14</b><i>a </i>may comprise a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), plasma, or generally any other type of video display known in the art. In the illustrated embodiment, the gaming machine <b>10</b> is an “upright” version in which the display <b>12</b> is oriented vertically relative to the player. It will be appreciated, however, that any of several other models of gaming machines are within the scope of the present invention including, for example, a “slant-top” version in which the display <b>12</b> is slanted at about a thirty-degree angle toward the player.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the structure <b>14</b><i>b </i>is preferably a flat plastic panel or “template” for displaying non-video artwork. The artwork covers a portion, but not all, of the video image on the video screen <b>14</b><i>a</i>. For example, if the video screen <b>14</b><i>a </i>is of a conventional type and has a generally rectangular shape, the artwork on the structure <b>14</b><i>b </i>preferably covers and conceals corner portions of the video screen <b>14</b><i>a</i>. The structure <b>14</b><i>b </i>may have a physical or “virtual” hole <b>16</b> for exposing a central portion of the video screen <b>14</b><i>a</i>. If the hole <b>16</b> is virtual, the structure <b>14</b><i>b </i>is solid throughout but has a central transmissive area for exposing the central portion of the video screen <b>14</b><i>a</i>. The transmissive area may be transparent or translucent depending upon the desired aesthetic effect. In the illustrated example, there is a single hole <b>16</b> having an oval shape. Alternatively, there may be multiple holes arranged in a regular or irregular formation. The holes may have the same shape or different shapes, and the shapes may be regular and/or irregular. For example, the holes may be circular, hexagonal, rectangular, square, triangular, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the gaming machine <b>10</b> is operable to play a game entitled Monopoly Money™ (MONOPOLY is a trademark of Hasbro, Inc. for its property trading game and equipment). The game features a basic reel slot game conducted on the display <b>12</b> with three mechanical reels <b>30</b> and a bonus game conducted on the integrated display <b>14</b>. The video image on the video screen <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the non-video artwork on the structure <b>14</b><i>b </i>are visually linked or blended to form an integrated image associated with the wagering game. The term “integrated image” refers to a single image that is divided into portions (e.g., the video image and the non-video artwork) that are shown on the video screen <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the structure <b>14</b><i>b</i>. For example, if the integrated image is a Monopoly™ bill, a bill pattern may be printed in black on the front of the structure <b>14</b><i>b </i>and a bill value (e.g., $5, $10, $20, $50, etc.) may be shown on the video screen <b>14</b><i>a</i>. Although the following description describes the Monopoly Money game on the gaming machine <b>10</b>, it will be appreciated that the gaming machine <b>10</b> may be implemented with different games and/or with any of several alternative game themes.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of a control system suitable for operating the gaming machine <b>10</b>. Money/credit detector <b>18</b> signals a central processing unit (CPU) <b>20</b> when a player has inserted a number of coins or played a number of credits. Then, the CPU <b>20</b> operates to execute a game program which causes the display <b>12</b> to display the basic game that includes mechanical reels with symbols displayed thereon (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The player may select a wager amount via input keys on a button panel <b>22</b>. The basic game commences in response to the player activating a switch <b>24</b> (e.g., by pulling a handle or pushing a button), causing the CPU <b>20</b> to set the reels in motion, randomly select a game outcome and then stop the reels to display symbols corresponding to the pre-selected game outcome. In one embodiment, certain of the basic game outcomes cause the CPU <b>20</b> to enter a bonus mode causing the integrated display <b>14</b> to show a bonus game. In addition to the CPU <b>20</b>, the control system may include one or more additional slave control units for operating one or more of the displays <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. The bonus game is described in detail below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A system memory <b>26</b> stores control software, operational instructions and data associated with the gaming machine <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, the system memory <b>26</b> comprises a separate read-only memory (ROM) and battery-backed random-access memory (RAM). However, it will be appreciated that the system memory <b>26</b> may be implemented on any of several alternative types of memory structures or may be implemented on a single memory structure. A payoff mechanism <b>28</b> is operable in response to instructions from the CPU <b>20</b> to award a payoff of coins or credits to the player in response to certain winning outcomes which might occur in the basic game or bonus game. The payoff is determined by one or more math tables stored in the system memory <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to play the Monopoly Money basic game, a player places a wager using a “bet one” key or a “max bet” key on the button panel <b>22</b>. In response to pressing the “max bet” key, or a “spin reels” key for a wager less than the maximum, the CPU spins and randomly stops the plurality of symbol-bearing reels <b>30</b> to place symbols on the reels <b>30</b> in visual association with at least one pay line <b>32</b>. Other mechanisms, such as a handle <b>33</b>, may be used to set the reels <b>30</b> in motion. Additional pay lines may be provided, in which case the player is allowed to select which pay lines to activate and the wager amount for each activated pay line. The number of illustrated reels is three but a different number of reels may be provided if desired. In the illustrated example, the reels <b>30</b> are physical and rotatably driven by stepper motors. If, however, the display <b>12</b> is video, the reels are simulated with moving graphics.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The CPU uses a random number generator to select a game outcome (e.g., “basic” game outcome) corresponding to a particular set of reel “stop positions.” The CPU then causes each of the reels <b>30</b> to stop at the appropriate stop position. Symbols are displayed on the reels <b>30</b> to graphically illustrate the reel stop positions and indicate whether the stop positions of the reels <b>30</b> represent a winning game outcome.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Winning basic game outcomes (e.g., symbol combinations resulting in payment of coins or credits) are identifiable to the player by a pay table. The pay table may be affixed to the machine <b>10</b> and/or displayed by the video screen <b>14</b><i>a </i>in response to a command by the player (e.g., by pressing a “pay table” key on the button panel <b>22</b>). A winning basic game outcome occurs when the symbols appearing on the reels <b>30</b> along the pay line <b>32</b> correspond to one of the winning combinations on the pay table. A winning combination could, for example, be two or more matching symbols along the pay line <b>32</b>, where the award is greater as the number of matching symbols along the pay line <b>32</b> increases. If the displayed symbols stop in a winning combination, the game credits the player an amount corresponding to the award in the pay table for that combination multiplied by the number of wagered credits. The player may collect the amount of accumulated credits by pressing a “collect” key on the button panel <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Included among the plurality of basic game outcomes are one or more start-bonus outcomes for triggering play of bonus games. A start-bonus outcome may be defined in any number of ways. For example, a start-bonus outcome may occur when a special start-bonus symbol or a special combination of symbols appears on one or more of the reels <b>30</b>. A start-bonus outcome may require the combination of symbols to appear along the pay line <b>32</b>, or may alternatively require that the combination of symbols appear anywhere on the display regardless of whether the symbols are along the pay line <b>32</b>. The appearance of a start-bonus outcome causes the CPU to shift operation from the basic slot game to the bonus game associated with that start-bonus outcome. In the illustrated example, a Money symbol <b>34</b> along the pay line <b>32</b> with a maximum wager (e.g., 3 credits) triggers the Money bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the Money bonus game is conducted on the integrated display <b>14</b>. The display <b>14</b> presents an integrated image of a Monopoly™ bill. The integrated image of the bill is formed by (i) non-video artwork of a bill pattern that is printed in black on the front of the structure <b>14</b><i>b </i>and (ii) a video image of a bill value (e.g., $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $200, $500, and $1000) that is shown on the video screen <b>14</b><i>a</i>. The artwork on the structure <b>14</b><i>b </i>preferably covers corner portions of the video screen <b>14</b><i>a </i>and has an oval hole <b>16</b> for exposing a central portion of the video screen <b>14</b><i>a</i>. The video screen <b>14</b><i>a </i>depicts a video image of the bill value in this exposed central portion.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The structure <b>14</b><i>b </i>is preferably made of clear acrylic that has a series of computer-controlled light-emitting diodes (LEDs) around its border. The series of LEDs include red (R), blue (B), and green (G) LEDs. The CPU controls which LEDs are “on” and which LEDs are “off” so that the acrylic can take on any RGB color. The bill pattern is printed in black on the front of the acrylic. Below the integrated display <b>14</b> is a row of eight Monopoly bills <b>36</b> of different denominations. The bills <b>36</b> are printed on the acrylic in colors corresponding to their respective denominations. The bills <b>36</b> are backlit with respective shadowboxes individually controlled by the CPU.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The Money bonus game proceeds as follows. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the CPU controls the LEDs to randomly cycle the structure <b>14</b><i>b </i>through all the colors. The colors may, for example, include pink for $5, yellow for $10, light green for $20, light blue for $50, goldenrod for $100, purple for $200, yellow-gold for $500, and dark green for $1000. In synchronicity with the cyclic changes in the colors of the structure <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the CPU controls the video screen <b>14</b><i>a </i>to change the bill value (number) of the bill to correspond with the color currently displayed on the structure. The CPU also controls the bills <b>36</b> to illuminate the bill currently displayed on the integrated display <b>14</b> (by the video screen <b>14</b><i>a </i>and structure <b>14</b><i>b</i>). Thus, the value and color of the bills flash in synchronicity with each other and preferably at a rate of approximately five bills per second. To further integrate the video image of the bill value on the video screen <b>14</b><i>a </i>with the non-video artwork of the colored bill pattern on the structure <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the exposed oval portion of the video screen <b>14</b><i>a </i>also depicts a background color corresponding to the color currently displayed on the structure <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The player is then prompted to press a “play bonus” button on the button panel <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to attempt to stop the cycling bill on a specific value. While the player may perceive that he or she has the ability to stop the bill on a specific value, the random outcome is actually predetermined and out of the player's control. In response to the player pressing the “play bonus” button, the bill stops on a bill value with associated color.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the illustrated example the bill stops on a $50 Monopoly bill. The CPU, in turn, awards the value of that bill in credits to the player. The CPU then causes the integrated display <b>14</b> to resume the synchronized cycling of the bill between different values and their associated colors. The player is again prompted to press the “play bonus” button on the button panel <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the illustrated example the bill stops on a $100 Monopoly bill. The CPU, in turn, awards the value of that bill in credits to the player. The CPU then causes the integrated display <b>14</b> to again resume the synchronized cycling of the bill between different values and their associated colors. The player is again prompted to press the “play bonus” button on the button panel <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The bonus game continues in the above manner until a character such as Mr. Monopoly™ is shown in jail on the video screen <b>14</b><i>a </i>as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The appearance of the jailed character is a termination event that first awards 5 additional credits but then terminates the bonus game. In the illustrated example, the bonus game awarded a total of 155 credits (i.e., 50+100+5).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, if at any time during the bonus game a Chance or Community Chest appears on the video screen <b>14</b><i>a</i>, the value of all the bills in the bonus game are doubled or tripled, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for example, depicts a Community Chest that triples the value of all the bills in the bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The bonus game algorithm preferably works as follows. At the beginning of the bonus game, the game software selects all bill outcomes (i.e., values on which the bill stops) that are to occur during the bonus game. Each bill is selected from a weighted table and, depending upon the outcome of the bill, the software branches to a different weighted table. After determining how many bills will be in the bonus game, the order of the bill outcomes is randomized. The bonus game preferably awards between one and seven bills prior to termination. If a double or triple pay is to occur, it is preferably never the last bill in the order. At the conclusion of the bonus game, the CPU shifts operation back to the basic slot game.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, there is shown a gaming machine <b>50</b> for conducting a wagering game in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. The gaming machine <b>50</b> comprises a primary display <b>52</b> and an integrated secondary display <b>54</b>. The display <b>52</b> may be a mechanical reel slot display or a video display. If the display <b>52</b> is implemented in video, it is preferably outfitted with a touch screen so that game options may be selected via the touchscreen and/or a button panel <b>56</b>. In accordance with the present invention, the integrated display <b>54</b> includes a video screen <b>54</b><i>a </i>for displaying a dynamic video image and various structures <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<i>d </i>for displaying non-video artwork. The display <b>52</b> (if implemented in video) and the video screen <b>54</b><i>a </i>may comprise a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), plasma, or generally any other type of video display known in the art. In the illustrated embodiment, the gaming machine <b>50</b> is a “slant-top” version in which the display <b>52</b> is slanted at about a thirty-degree angle toward the player. It will be appreciated, however, that any of several other models of gaming machines are within the scope of the present invention including, for example, an “upright” version in which the display <b>52</b> is oriented vertically relative to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the structures <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<i>d </i>are preferably sculptures, figurines, appliques, flat artwork panels, or decals that display non-video artwork and cover respective areas, but not all, of the video image on the video screen <b>54</b><i>a</i>. The structures <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<i>d </i>may, for example, be suspended in front of the video screen <b>54</b><i>a</i>, affixed to the video screen <b>54</b><i>a</i>, or affixed to a transparent panel that is in turn mounted in front of the video screen <b>54</b><i>a</i>. In the case of the latter arrangement, if the structures <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<i>d </i>are affixed to a rear surface of the transparent panel, the transparent panel is spaced from the video screen <b>54</b><i>a </i>by a sufficient distance to provide space for the structures <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<i>d </i>between the panel and the screen <b>54</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, the gaming machine <b>10</b> is operable to play a game entitled Gold Fi$h™. The game features a basic reel slot game conducted on the display <b>52</b> with five simulated reels <b>60</b> and a bonus game conducted on the integrated display <b>54</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the video image on the video screen <b>54</b><i>a </i>and the non-video artwork on the structures <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<i>d </i>are visually linked or blended to form an integrated image associated with the wagering game. For example, if the integrated image is a fish bowl, some contents of the fish bowl (e.g., fish, water, plants, sand, gravel, etc.) may be shown on the video screen <b>54</b><i>a </i>and other contents of the fish bowl (e.g., ornaments or portions thereof) may be formed by the structures <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<i>d</i>. In the illustrated example, the structures <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<i>d </i>include a castle <b>54</b><i>b </i>(except for the door <b>55</b>), a treasure chest <b>54</b><i>c </i>(except for the lid <b>57</b>), and a clam shell <b>54</b><i>d </i>(except for the interior <b>59</b>). The remainder of the fish bowl, as well as the door <b>55</b> of the castle <b>54</b><i>b</i>, the lid <b>57</b> of the treasure chest <b>54</b><i>c</i>, and the interior <b>59</b> of the clam shell <b>54</b><i>d</i>, are implemented with the video screen <b>54</b><i>a</i>. Although the following description describes the Gold Fi$h game on the gaming machine <b>50</b>, it will be appreciated that the gaming machine <b>50</b> may be implemented with different games and/or with any of several alternative game themes.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the Gold Fi$h basic game includes five simulated reels <b>60</b> and a number of pay lines <b>62</b>. In the illustrated example, the number of reels <b>60</b> is five and the number of pay lines <b>62</b> is nine. The number of reels <b>60</b> and pay lines <b>62</b> may, however, be varied to be more or less than the number illustrated. Each of the pay lines <b>62</b> extends through one symbol on each of the reels <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Generally, game play is initiated by inserting money or playing a number of credits, causing the CPU to activate a number of pay lines <b>62</b> corresponding to the amount of money or number of credits played. In one embodiment, the player selects the number of pay lines <b>62</b> (between one and nine) to play by pressing a “Select Lines” key <b>64</b>. The player then chooses the number of coins or credits to wager on the selected pay lines <b>62</b> by pressing a “Bet Per Line” key <b>66</b>. After selecting a number of pay lines <b>62</b> and a wager amount, the reels <b>60</b> may be set in motion by touching a “Spin Reels” key <b>68</b> or, if the player wishes to bet the maximum amount per line, by using a “Max Bet Spin” key <b>70</b>. Alternatively, other mechanisms such as a lever or push button may be used to set the reels <b>60</b> in motion.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As discussed above in connection with the Monopoly Money game, the CPU uses a random number generator to select a game outcome (e.g., “basic” game outcome) corresponding to a particular set of reel “stop positions” and then causes each of the reels <b>60</b> to stop at the appropriate stop position. Winning basic game outcomes (e.g., symbol combinations resulting in payment of coins or credits) are identifiable to the player by a pay table. In one embodiment, the pay table is affixed to the machine <b>50</b> and/or displayed by the video display <b>52</b> in response to a command by the player (e.g., by pressing a “Pay Table” button <b>72</b>). The player may collect the amount of accumulated credits by pressing a “Collect” button <b>74</b>. Included among the plurality of basic game outcomes are one or more start-bonus outcomes for triggering play of bonus games. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in the illustrated example the appearance of a Chest symbol <b>76</b>, a Castle symbol <b>78</b>, and a Clam symbol <b>80</b> in any position on the first, third, and fifth reels <b>60</b> triggers a Fish Bowl bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The Fish Bowl bonus game proceeds as follows. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the player is prompted to select one of the three triggering symbols <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, and <b>80</b>. In the illustrated example, the player selects the Castle symbol <b>78</b>. The player is then prompted to look up at the fish bowl formed by the integrated display <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, in the illustrated example the video door <b>55</b> of the castle structure <b>54</b><i>b </i>in the fish bowl opens to reveal an award of <b>45</b> credits. As noted above, the structures <b>54</b><i>b </i>include the castle <b>54</b><i>b </i>(except for the door <b>55</b>), a treasure chest <b>54</b><i>c </i>(except for the lid <b>57</b>), and a clam shell <b>54</b><i>d </i>(except for the interior <b>59</b>). The door <b>55</b> of the castle <b>54</b><i>b</i>, however, is implemented with the video screen <b>54</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the door <b>55</b>, the opening thereof, and the award are shown in video. Alternatively, the door <b>55</b> may be a physical component concealing a portion of the video screen <b>54</b><i>a </i>and operatively connected by a hinge to the castle <b>54</b><i>b</i>. When the door <b>55</b> opens about the hinge, the door <b>55</b> reveals the previously concealed portion of the video screen <b>54</b><i>a </i>which, in turn, displays the award. In a similar manner, if the player had selected the Chest symbol <b>76</b> or the Clam symbol <b>80</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an award would have been revealed by the video lid <b>57</b> of the treasure chest <b>54</b><i>c </i>or the video interior <b>59</b> of the clam <b>54</b><i>d</i>, respectively. In addition, other bonus games may utilize the integrated display <b>54</b> to display animations and award bonuses. At the conclusion of the bonus game, the CPU shifts operation back to the basic slot game.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, there is shown a gaming machine <b>100</b> for conducting a wagering game in accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention. The gaming machine <b>100</b> comprises a primary display <b>102</b> and an integrated secondary display <b>104</b>. The display <b>102</b> may be a mechanical reel slot display or a video display. In accordance with the present invention, the integrated display <b>104</b> include a video screen <b>104</b><i>a </i>for displaying a dynamic video image and an assembled clock structure <b>104</b><i>b </i>for displaying non-video artwork. The display <b>102</b> (if implemented in video) and the video screen <b>104</b><i>a </i>may comprise a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), plasma, or generally any other type of video display known in the art. In the illustrated embodiment, the gaming machine <b>100</b> is an “upright” version in which the display <b>102</b> is oriented vertically relative to the player. It will be appreciated, however, that any of several other models of gaming machines are within the scope of the present invention including, for example, a “slant-top” version in which the display <b>102</b> is slanted at about a thirty-degree angle toward the player.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the clock structure <b>104</b><i>b </i>preferably includes a rotatable disc <b>106</b> and a bezel/bell assembly <b>112</b>. The rotatable disc <b>106</b> is mounted in front of the video screen <b>104</b><i>a </i>and is preferably comprised of a clear plastic disc with an integrated opaque pointer or hand <b>108</b>. The pointer <b>108</b> is molded with the disc. Because the disc <b>106</b> is clear (except for the pointer <b>108</b>), the disc <b>106</b> exposes the underlying video screen <b>104</b><i>a</i>. The video screen <b>104</b><i>a </i>may display a video image of a marked dial that, in conjunction with the pointer <b>108</b>, indicates “time”. Thus, the physical pointer <b>108</b> points at a position on the video dial. To transmit rotating motion to the disc <b>106</b>, a plurality of gears <b>110</b> are positioned adjacent to the toothed periphery of the disc <b>106</b>. The teeth of the gears <b>110</b> mesh with the teeth along the disc's periphery.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The bezel/bell assembly <b>112</b> includes a molded opaque plastic bezel <b>114</b> and a bell ringing assembly <b>116</b>. The bezel <b>114</b> is mounted in front of both the video screen <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the rotatable disc <b>106</b>. In the illustrated example, the bezel <b>114</b> divides the video screen <b>104</b><i>a </i>into two parts: the video dial and a rectangular message area. A round window <b>114</b><i>a </i>in the bezel <b>114</b> reveals the video dial, and a rectangular window <b>114</b><i>b </i>in the bezel <b>114</b> reveals the message area.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in one embodiment the gaming machine <b>100</b> is operable to play a game entitled Beat the Clock™ based on the popular, classic TV game show of the same name. BEAT THE CLOCK is a trademark of FremantleMedia North America, Inc for its TV game show. The game features a basic reel slot game conducted on the display <b>102</b> with five simulated reels <b>120</b> and a bonus game conducted on the integrated display <b>104</b>. The video image on the video screen <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the non-video artwork on the clock structure <b>104</b><i>b </i>are visually linked or blended to form an integrated image associated with the wagering game. For example, if the integrated image is an alarm clock, such clock elements as a marked dial with countdown effect may be shown on the video screen <b>104</b><i>a </i>and other clock elements such as a clock hand <b>108</b>, bezel <b>114</b>, and bell ringer <b>116</b> may be formed by the structure <b>104</b><i>b</i>. The video screen <b>104</b><i>a </i>may also display other animated features, reel symbols, bonus amounts, etc. The message area may, for example, display a game logo, instructions, bonus amounts, and other messages. Although the following description describes the Beat the Clock game on the gaming machine <b>100</b>, it will be appreciated that the gaming machine <b>100</b> may be implemented with different games and/or with any of several alternative game themes.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the Beat the Clock basic game includes five simulated reels <b>120</b> and a number of pay lines <b>122</b>. In the illustrated example, the number of reels <b>120</b> is five and the number of pay lines <b>122</b> is nine. The number of reels <b>120</b> and pay lines <b>122</b> may, however, be varied to be more or less than the number illustrated. Game play generally proceeds as described in connection with the Gold Fi$h game except that the Beat the Clock basic game utilizes its own artwork and math. Included among the plurality of basic game outcomes are one or more start-bonus outcomes for triggering play of bonus games. In the illustrated example the appearance of three, four, or five scattered Beat the Clock symbols <b>124</b> triggers a Challenge bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The Challenge bonus game proceeds as follows. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the video display <b>102</b> replaces the image of reels with an image of an array of cards <b>126</b>. The player is prompted to select one of the cards <b>126</b>. In the illustrated example, the selected card is a “Bell Ringin' Challenge” card. In this challenge, the player is awarded a number of free spins of the reels. The number of free spins varies with the number of Beat the Clock symbols <b>124</b> that triggered the bonus game: three symbols awards four free spins; four symbols awards eight free spins; and five symbols awards twelve free spins. If the player can “collect” seven Bell symbols along the horizontal center pay line during the free spins, the player is awarded a bonus (e.g., 60× line bet). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, for example, depicts a free spin that results in two Bell symbols <b>128</b> along the horizontal center pay line. The challenges and bonuses may vary according to the symbol shown on the selected card. In addition to being awarded a bonus for winning the Challenge round, any winning symbol combinations that would yield payoffs if they occur during the basic slot game yield such payoffs if they occur during the free spins.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the Challenge round begins with time placed on the clock display <b>104</b>. The amount of time put on the clock display <b>104</b> varies with the number of Beat the Clock symbols <b>124</b> that triggered the bonus game: 20 seconds for three symbols; 40 seconds for four symbols; and 60 seconds for five symbols. Because each free spin in the bonus round lasts 5 seconds, the number of seconds is equivalent to four, eight, and twelve free spins, respectively. The Challenge round continues until the time on the clock display <b>104</b> runs out.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the illustrated example, the bonus game was triggered by three scattered Beat the Clock symbols <b>124</b>, and therefore 20 seconds (equivalent to 4 free spins) are placed on the clock display <b>104</b>. To represent 20 seconds, the disc <b>106</b> (and therefore the hand <b>108</b> molded thereto) rotates clockwise until the hand <b>108</b> points to the 20 second mark, and the video screen <b>104</b><i>a </i>fills the pie-shaped area between the zero second mark and the 20 second mark with a color. As the clock display <b>104</b> counts down to zero, the disc <b>106</b> rotates counterclockwise and the video screen <b>104</b><i>a</i>, in turn, displays a countdown effect of vanishing colored pie-shaped segments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, for example, depicts the clock display <b>104</b> with 10 seconds remaining. At the conclusion of the bonus game, the CPU shifts operation back to the basic slot game.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">While the present invention has been described with reference to one or more particular embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that many changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">For example, the structures <b>14</b><i>b</i>, <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<i>d</i>, <b>104</b><i>b </i>for displaying non-video artwork may be two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D), or a combination thereof. The structures may be stationary, movable, or a combination thereof. A structure may have a stationary component and a component movable relative to the stationary component. If movable, the structure may be movable in one, two, or three dimensions and in one or more directions.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Instead of positioning the structures <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<i>d </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in front of the video screen <b>54</b><i>a</i>, the positions may be reversed such that the video screen is positioned in front of the structures. In this case, the video screen is of the transmissive type (e.g., transmissive LCD) as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,517,433 to Loose et al., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The transmissive video screen may display video images that are selectively superimposed, in whole or in part, over the structures <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<i>d </i>to create the desired visual effects. The superimposed video image may be interactive with the structures <b>54</b><i>b</i>-<i>d</i>, may be static or dynamic, and may include such graphics as bonuses, special effects, thematic scenery, and instructional information.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The basic game need not comprise a reel slot game, but may comprise virtually any type of wagering game or combination of wagering games having outcomes and presentations with an integrated image formed by integrated video and non-video displays. The basic game may, for example, be video or mechanical slots, poker, keno, bingo, blackjack, or roulette. Additionally, the basic game may trigger a win of a progressive jackpot and bonus games and events in addition to the ones that present the integrated image. Such other bonus games and events may be conducted on the primary display, one or more secondary displays, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Each of these embodiments and obvious variations thereof is construed as falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed invention, which is set forth in the following claims.</p>
