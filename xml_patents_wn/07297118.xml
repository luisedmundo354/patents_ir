<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and apparatus for acquiring multi-line acquisition ultrasound data. Ultrasound signals are transmitted into an area of interest. Echo signals are acquired and analyzed to produce a first data stream associated with a first receive beam. The first data stream is decimated by removing at least two consecutive data samples therefrom, while passing at least two consecutive data samples to form a first decimated data stream. Using this decimation pattern, a bandwidth of one-half to three-quarters of the data sampling rate after decimation may be achieved.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The application relates to and claims priority from provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/477,826, titled “Ultrasound Method and Apparatus for Multi-Line Acquisition”, filed Jun. 12, 2003, the complete subject matter of which is expressly hereby incorporated herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to diagnostic ultrasound systems. In particular, the present invention relates to method and apparatus for acquiring and processing ultrasound data streams to reduce the bandwidth of the data without deteriorating the performance of the beamformer, and to share the bandwidth between two or more data streams belonging to different beams in multi-line acquisition.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a typical configuration of a receive beamformer <b>200</b>. Digitized channel signals are input to a number of identical signal processing devices (beamformer ASICs) <b>202</b>-<b>206</b>, that are interconnected in a beamsum pipeline. The ASIC <b>202</b> performs a partial beam formation of channels <b>1</b>-<b>8</b>. The partial beamsum <b>208</b> is then input to ASIC <b>204</b> and added to the partial beamsum of channels <b>9</b>-<b>18</b> within ASIC <b>204</b>. This process is continued down the beamsum pipeline until the final beamsum <b>210</b> is coming out of the last ASIC <b>206</b> in the chain.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For a time-delay beamformer, such as receive beamformer <b>200</b>, the data may typically be 20 bit wide and have a data rate of 40 MHz per beam, i.e. 800 Mbit/s data bandwidth. With simultaneous reception of parallel beams, or multi-line acquisition (MLA), this data rate is multiplied by the number of parallel beams. The cost of the interconnect infrastructure within the ultrasound system increases with data bandwidth, as more pins are required on integrated circuits for signal processing, more pins on circuit board connectors, or a faster clock rate of the data paths.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the contents of the partial beamformer ASICs <b>202</b>-<b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. An input data rate (sampling rate) of 40 MHz is assumed, although other data rates may be used. Each channel <b>1</b>-<b>8</b> is processed through a per-channel beamformer <b>212</b>-<b>216</b>. The per-channel beamformers <b>212</b>-<b>216</b> perform per-channel beamforming (time delay and optionally per-channel amplitude weighting).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The output from the beamsummer <b>218</b>, the partial beamsum <b>208</b>, is then passed through a low-pass anti-aliasing filter <b>220</b> that cuts off frequencies above 10 MHz, reducing the bandwidth of the signal. Data output from the low-pass anti-aliasing filter <b>220</b> is represented as data stream A <b>224</b>, following a sequence of samples A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 . . . and so on. A decimator <b>222</b> then reduces the data rate by throwing away every other sample of the data stream A <b>224</b> to produce data stream B <b>226</b>, giving the sample sequence of A1 X A3 X A5 X . . . and so on. The X's in data stream B <b>266</b>, and all subsequent data streams discussed herein, represent data samples which have been thrown away. Data stream B <b>226</b> is then summed by summer <b>228</b> with a cascading input <b>230</b>. The cascading input <b>230</b> may be supplied through an optional delay line <b>232</b> to allow for summing with a subsequent device. The delay line <b>232</b> may not be required for certain beamformer architectures.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Alternatively, the cutoff-rate of the anti-aliasing filter <b>220</b> may be 20 MHz/n, wherein n=1,2,3,4 . . . , allowing for a data output rate of 40 MHz/n by throwing away (n-1) samples for every sample that is retained. A larger value of n results in a greater reduction of the data rate. Unfortunately, the maximum usable frequency of the receive beamformer <b>200</b> becomes reduced by a factor n, for example, from 20 MHz to 20 MHz/n.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, a system and method are desired to acquire data with a maximum frequency which is not limited to one-half the data sampling rate of the output stream that addresses the problems noted above and others previously experienced.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an ultrasound system <b>100</b> formed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The ultrasound system <b>100</b> includes a transmitter <b>102</b> which drives an array of elements <b>104</b> within a transducer <b>106</b> to emit pulsed ultrasonic signals into a body. A variety of geometries may be used. The ultrasonic signals are back-scattered from structures in the body, like blood cells or muscular tissue, to produce echoes which return to the elements <b>104</b>. The echoes are received by a receiver <b>108</b>. The received echoes are passed through a beamformer <b>110</b>, which performs beamforning and outputs an RF signal. The RF signal then passes through an RF processor <b>112</b>. Alternatively, the RF processor <b>112</b> may include a complex demodulator (not shown) that demodulates the RF signal to form IQ data pairs representative of the echo signals. The RF or IQ signal data may then be routed directly to RF/IQ buffer <b>114</b> for temporary storage. A system controller <b>120</b> controls the operation of the components of the ultrasound system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The ultrasound system <b>100</b> also includes a signal processor <b>116</b> to process the acquired ultrasound information (i.e., RF signal data or IQ data pairs) and prepare frames of ultrasound information for display on display system <b>118</b>. The signal processor <b>116</b> is adapted to perform one or more processing operations according to a plurality of selectable ultrasound modalities on the acquired ultrasound information. Acquired ultrasound information may be processed in real-time during a scanning session as the echo signals are received. Additionally or alternatively, the ultrasound information may be stored temporarily in RF/IQ buffer <b>114</b> during a scanning session and processed in less than real-time in a live or off-line operation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The ultrasound system <b>100</b> may continuously acquire ultrasound information at a frame rate that exceeds <b>50</b> frames per second—the approximate perception rate of the human eye. The acquired ultrasound information is displayed on the display system <b>118</b> at a frame-rate that may be different than that of the acquired data. An image buffer <b>122</b> is included for storing processed frames of acquired ultrasound information that are not scheduled to be displayed immediately. Preferably, the image buffer <b>122</b> is of sufficient capacity to store at least several seconds worth of frames of ultrasound information. The frames of ultrasound information are stored in a manner to facilitate retrieval thereof according to its order or time of acquisition. The image buffer <b>122</b> may comprise any known data storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an ultrasound system formed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The system includes a transducer <b>10</b> connected to a transmitter <b>12</b> and a receiver <b>14</b>. The transducer <b>10</b> transmits ultrasonic pulses and receives echoes from structures inside of a scanned ultrasound volume <b>16</b>. Memory <b>20</b> stores ultrasound data from the receiver <b>14</b> derived from the scanned ultrasound volume <b>16</b>. The volume <b>16</b> may be obtained by various techniques (e.g., 3D scanning, real-time 3D imaging, volume scanning, 2D scanning with an array of elements having positioning sensors, freehand scanning using a Voxel correlation technique, 2D or matrix array transducers and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The transducer <b>10</b> is moved, such as along a linear or arcuate path, while scanning a region of interest (ROI). At each linear or arcuate position, the transducer <b>10</b> obtains scan planes <b>18</b>. The scan planes <b>18</b> are collected for a thickness, such as from a group or set of adjacent scan planes <b>18</b>. The scan planes <b>18</b> are stored in the memory <b>20</b>, and then passed to a volume scan converter <b>42</b>. In some embodiments, the transducer <b>10</b> may obtain lines instead of the scan planes <b>18</b>, and the memory <b>20</b> may store lines obtained by the transducer <b>10</b> rather than the scan planes <b>18</b>. The volume scan converter <b>20</b> may store lines obtained by the transducer <b>10</b> rather than the scan planes <b>18</b>. The volume scan converter <b>42</b> receives a slice thickness setting from a control input <b>40</b>, which identifies the thickness of a slice to be created from the scan planes <b>18</b>. The volume scan converter <b>42</b> creates a data slice from multiple adjacent scan planes <b>18</b>. The number of adjacent scan planes <b>18</b> that are obtained to form each data slice is dependent upon the thickness selected by slice thickness control input <b>40</b>. The data slice is stored in slice memory <b>44</b> and is accessed by a volume rendering processor <b>46</b>. The volume rendering processor <b>46</b> performs volume rendering upon the data slice. The output of the volume rendering processor <b>46</b> is passed to the video processor <b>50</b> and display <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The position of each echo signal sample (Voxel) is defined in terms of geometrical accuracy (i.e., the distance from one Voxel to the next) and ultrasonic response (and derived values from the ultrasonic response). Suitable ultrasonic responses include gray scale values, color Doppler values, and angio or power Doppler information.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the contents of a partial beamformer for a single beam in accordance with the present invention. ASIC <b>250</b> comprises a programmable anti-aliasing (a-a) filter <b>252</b>. Elements corresponding to the elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> have the same item numbers. Their function is similar to the previous discussion regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and thus will not be further discussed. The a-a filter <b>252</b> has a pass-band that is either “low-pass” or low-band <b>260</b>, i.e. from 0-10 MHz, “band-pass” or mid-band <b>262</b> from 5-15 MHz, or “high-pass” or high-band <b>264</b> from 10-20 MHz. The a-a filter <b>252</b> provides three discrete modes of operation for the beamformer <b>110</b>, with a useable frequency range corresponding to the selected pass-band of the associated a-a filter <b>252</b>. The data stream A <b>256</b> output by the a-a filter <b>252</b> follows a sequence of A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 . . . and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A decimator <b>254</b> functions differently for the different modes of the a-a filter <b>252</b>. For the low-band <b>260</b> and high-band <b>264</b> modes, the decimator <b>254</b> decimates every other data sample in the data stream A <b>256</b>, and outputs data stream C <b>258</b> following a sequence of A1 X A3 X A5 X . . . and so on. Mathematically, the data stream C <b>258</b> corresponds to multiplication of the sample stream [A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 . . . ] with the sequence [101010101010. . . ]. The spectrum of the resultant waveform has frequency components centered around 0 Hz and 20 MHz, so the spectra of the a-a filtered signals in the low-band <b>260</b> and high-band <b>264</b> modes will not overlap after decimation. Those skilled in the art will recognize that all of the information in the a-a filtered signal (data stream A <b>256</b>) will be fully preserved through the decimation process even for the high-band <b>264</b> filtered signal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the applicable data stream C <b>258</b> for the associated a-a filter <b>252</b> mode. Data stream C <b>266</b> is associated with the low-band <b>260</b> mode, and data stream C <b>270</b> is associated with the high-band <b>264</b> mode.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">When the a-a filter <b>252</b> is in the mid-band <b>262</b> mode, the a-a filter <b>252</b> outputs the data stream A <b>256</b> following the pattern of A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 A10 . . . and so on. The decimator <b>254</b> passes two consecutive data samples of the data stream A <b>256</b>, and decimates two consecutive data samples of the data stream A <b>256</b>. The decimator <b>254</b> therefore outputs the data stream C <b>258</b> following a sequence of A1 A2 X X A5 A6 X X A9 A10 . . . and so on. Mathematically, the data stream C <b>258</b> corresponds to multiplication of the sample stream [A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 . . . ] with the sequence [110011001100110 0 . . . ]. The spectrum of the resultant waveform has frequency components centered around 0 Hz and 10 MHz only, so even in this case the spectrum of the a-a filtered signals will not overlap after decimation. Those skilled in the art will recognize that all of the information in the a-a filtered signal (data stream A <b>256</b>) will be fully preserved through the decimation process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the data stream C <b>268</b> for the associated mid-band <b>262</b> mode.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">From the previous description, it is clear that the entire frequency range from 0 to 20 MHz is now covered with three overlapping frequency bands with a (real) data rate of only 20 MHz. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a 40 MHz sampling frequency, it should be understood that sampling frequencies other than 40 MHz may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Reducing the data rate by decimation does not affect the delay or phase of different data streams. Therefore, the decimation process may be performed at any stage of the beamforming process. Alternatively, the a-a filter <b>252</b> and decimator <b>254</b> may be moved up within the process and replicated as a part of the per-channel beamformer <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates how the data streams from two partial beamformers can be multiplexed into a single 40 MHz data stream. Each single beam partial beamformer <b>270</b> and <b>272</b> comprises a set of per-channel beamformers <b>212</b>-<b>216</b>, such as for 8 or 16 channels. The number of per-channel beamformers <b>212</b>-<b>216</b> in each single beam partial beamformer <b>270</b> and <b>272</b> is determined by the hardware implementation. Therefore, single beam partial beamformers <b>270</b> and <b>272</b> receive signals through channels as discussed previously in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The single beam partial beamformers <b>270</b> and <b>272</b>, however, receive signals from the same set of channels, and are typically receiving beams that are spatially different. The single-beam partial beamformers <b>270</b> and <b>272</b> output data stream A <b>276</b> and data stream B <b>278</b>, respectively. Data stream A <b>276</b> follows a sequence of A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 A10 . . . and so on. Data stream B <b>278</b> follows a sequence of B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 A6 B7 B8 B9 B10 . . . and soon.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The function of the a-a filter <b>252</b> and decimator <b>254</b> remain the same as previously discussed for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and have been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> as a-a filter/decimators <b>282</b> and <b>284</b>. A mode select line <b>280</b> provides an input to the a-a filter/decimators <b>282</b> and <b>284</b> from the system controller <b>120</b> that selects the band-pass mode, either low-band <b>260</b>, mid-band <b>262</b>, or high-band <b>264</b>. The input indicates to the ultrasound system <b>100</b> which band to operate for a given beam.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When either low-band <b>260</b> or high-band <b>264</b> are selected, the data streams C <b>286</b> and D <b>288</b> follow the patterns: C=A1 X A3 X A5 X A7 X A9 X . . . and so on, and D=B1 X B3 X B5 X B7 X B9 X . . . and so on. The data streams C <b>286</b> and D <b>288</b> are input to a MUX/FIFO <b>290</b>. The MUX/FIFO <b>290</b> multiplexes the two inputs and outputs data stream E <b>292</b>, which follows the pattern of A1 B1 A3 B3 A5 B5 A7 B7 A9 B9 . . . and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">If the mid-band <b>262</b> mode is selected, the data streams C <b>286</b> and D <b>288</b> follow the sequences: C=A1 A2 X X A5 A6 X X A9 A10 . . . and so on, and D=B1 B2 X X A5 A6 X X A9 A10 . . . and so on. The data streams C <b>286</b> and D <b>288</b> are input to the MUX/FIFO <b>290</b>, which multiplexes the two inputs and outputs data stream E <b>292</b>, which follows the sequence of E=A1 A2 B1 B2 A5 A6 B5 B6 A9 A10. and so on. The data streams A <b>276</b>, B <b>278</b>, C <b>286</b>, D <b>288</b>, and E <b>292</b> for the mid-band <b>262</b> mode are illustrated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> for clarity. It should be understood that other forms of multiplexing that provide equivalent function also exist, for example data stream E <b>292</b> may be E=A1 B1 A2 B2 A5 B5 A6 B6 A9 B9 A10 B10 . . . and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The data stream E <b>292</b> is sent to the summer <b>228</b>, which sums the data stream E <b>292</b> with the cascading input <b>230</b>. As previously discussed, the delay line <b>232</b> is optional. Typically, a single ASIC <b>274</b> may be used to perform the function of one or more of the single-beam partial beamformers <b>270</b>-<b>272</b>, a-a filter/decimators <b>282</b>-<b>284</b>, and MUX/FIFO <b>290</b>. The complete multi-beam beamformer topology comprises a plurality of partial beamformers <b>270</b>-<b>272</b>, or ASICS <b>274</b>, in cascade, interconnected with a single 40 MHz data stream in the same way as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, i.e. using a single data stream connecting the partial beamformers <b>270</b>-<b>272</b> or ASICS <b>274</b>. Therefore, a 2-factor reduction of the interconnect data rate between the partial beamformers <b>270</b>-<b>272</b>, or ASICS <b>274</b>, may be accomplished without compromising the operating frequency range of the beamformer <b>110</b>, as two (or N) single-beam partial beamformers <b>270</b>-<b>272</b> or ASICs <b>274</b>, each having a data rate of 20 MHz, may be multiplexed into the 40 MHz output data stream.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a complex demodulator <b>300</b> which may be used in connection with the systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The complex demodulator <b>300</b> may be included in the RF processor <b>112</b>. The beamsum output data streams <b>308</b> from the last partial beamformer in the cascade topology is input to the multiplier <b>304</b>, such as data stream C <b>258</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) or data stream E <b>292</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the case of low-band <b>260</b> or high-band <b>264</b>, data demodulation can be done in the following way. The input data stream <b>308</b> may be either low-band <b>260</b> or high-band <b>264</b> data and comprise data samples from data streams C <b>286</b> and D <b>288</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). A RAM table <b>302</b> provides a complex, time dependent demodulation waveform to a multiplier <b>304</b>. For example, the waveform may be M=exp (−j*2*pi*f*k/fs/2), k=0,1,2 . . . , where a constant demodulation frequency f and a demodulation amplitude of 1 has been assumed for simplicity. The sampling frequency fs=40 MHz and k is the running time index. Therefore, assume that the desired demodulation data stream for the decimated data stream C <b>286</b> is Mc1 Mc2 Mc3 Mc4, and that the desired demodulation data stream for data stream D <b>288</b> is Md1 Md2 Md3 Md4. The multiplier <b>304</b> interleaves M, input from the RAM table <b>302</b>, with data streams C <b>286</b> and D <b>288</b>, and outputs data stream F <b>314</b>, where F=Mc1 Md1 Mc2 Md2 Mc3 Md3 Mc4 Md4 . . . and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The data stream F <b>314</b> is filtered by a FIR filter <b>306</b>, typically with real coefficients. For simplicity, assume that the desired impulse response of the FIR filter <b>306</b> is the same for both data streams, such as h1 h2 h3 h4 . . . , h(N). The desired operations if the demodulator in this case are, therefore, c=h conv (C*Mc) and d=h conv (D*Md) where “conv” means “convolved with”. By selecting the FIR filter <b>306</b> coefficients as the desired impulse response interleaved with zeros, H={h1 0 h2 0 h3 0 . . . h(N)}, one who is skilled in the art will realize that the output demodulation data stream G <b>310</b> then becomes G=c1 d1 c2 d2 c2 d3 c3 d3 . . . and so on, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The following applies if the beamsum input data stream <b>308</b> is mid-band <b>262</b> data, such as data stream C <b>268</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Mathematically demodulation can be done by inserting two zero samples between the mid-band <b>262</b> sample pairs, such that input data stream <b>308</b> may be represented by Cz=A1 A2 0 0 A5 A6 0 0 A9 A10 0 0 . . . and so on. The RAM table <b>302</b> provides the complex, time dependent signal to the multiplier, for example Mz=exp (−j*2*pi*f*k/fs), k=0,1,2, . . . where a constant demodulation frequency f and a demodulation amplitude of 1 has been assumed for simplicity. The demodulation waveform Mz has been sampled at the original sampling frequency, such as fs=40 MHz. The data stream F <b>314</b> output by the multiplier <b>304</b> is then filtered by the FIR filter <b>306</b> with the desired coefficients {h(k)}, k=1,2,3, . . . N. The output of the filter is decimated by two by throwing away every other sample to give a data output rate that is the same as the input data rate of 20 MHz. The 20 MHz output demodulation data stream G <b>310</b> will be G=g1 g2 g3 g4 g5 . . . .</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It may be noted in the above example that one-half of the samples of the sequence Mz*Cz (or data stream F <b>314</b>) are zeros that don't contribute to the output sum. Moreover, because the bandwidth of the input data stream <b>308</b> is limited to 10 MHz, the sampling rate of the complex data output can be reduced to 10 MHz without loss of information.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Therefore, an alternative demodulation sequence requiring only half the data rate in the FIR filter <b>306</b> /multiplier <b>304</b> may be accomplished even when the beamsum input data stream <b>308</b> is mid-band <b>262</b> data. The input data stream <b>308</b> may be represented by Cz=A1 A2 A5 A6 A9 A10 . . . and so on. The input data stream <b>308</b> is input at a <b>20</b> MHz rate. The multiplier <b>304</b> interleaves the input data stream <b>308</b> and the samples of Mz from the RAM table <b>302</b> that correspond to the non-zero samples of Cz, i.e. {Mz(k)}, k=1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, . . . and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The FIR filter <b>306</b> filters the data stream F <b>314</b> with a coefficient set that is different for the odd and even numbered time index. Assuming for simplicity that N=4*m−2, where m is an integer, the odd-sample coefficients are {ho}={h1 h2 h5 h6 h9 h10 . . . h(N−1) h(N)} and the even-sample {he}={h7 h8 h11 . . . h(N−2) 0} Thus, the coefficients of the FIR filter <b>306</b> toggle back and forth between {ho} and {he} for every other sample. The output becomes G=g1 g2 g3 g4 g5 . . . as in the previous example. If the output rate is limited to 10 MHz, the complication of using time dependent coefficients can be avoided. It is then possible to use only one coefficient set, such as {ho}, and use only the odd numbered output data from the FIR filter <b>306</b>. The even samples need to be thrown away by the decimator <b>312</b>, so the output becomes G=g1 x g3 x g5 x . . . .</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The following example illustrates demodulating multiplexed mid-band <b>262</b> data, such as data stream E <b>292</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), wherein the data are interleaved two and two as discussed previously. For simplicity, assume that the desired demodulation waveform for data stream C <b>286</b> is Mc1 Mc2 Mc3 Mc4 . . . and so on, and that the desired demodulation waveform for data stream D <b>288</b> is Md1 Md2 Md3 Md4 . . . and so on. Moreover, assume that the desired impulse response of the FIR filter <b>306</b>, {h1 h2 h3 h4 . . . , h(N)} is the same for both data streams C <b>286</b> and D <b>288</b>. The desired operations are, in other words, c=h conv (C*Mc) and d=h conv (D*Md) where conv means “convolved with”.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Complex demodulation will result by making M an interleaved version of data streams C <b>286</b> and D <b>288</b>, taking two samples of each at a time, M=Mc1 Mc2 Md1 Md2 Mc3 Mc4 Md3 Md4 . . . and so on, and selecting the FIR filter <b>306</b> coefficients as the desired impulse response interleaved with zeros. Assuming a 10 MHz output rate (decimation by two on the output) only one set of coefficients is necessary. These coefficients become Ho={ho(1) ho(2) 0 0 ho(3) ho(4) 0 0 ho(5) ho(6) 0 0 . . . ho(N−1) ho(N))} The demodulation data stream G <b>310</b> output from the FIR filter <b>306</b> will be {x c1 x d1 x c3 x d3 x c5 x d5 x c7 x d3 . . . }. For clarity, x indicates that a data sample is thrown away by the decimator <b>312</b>, and the output data are {c1 c3 c5 . . . }and {d1 d3 d5 . . . }, and G=c1 d1 c3 d3 . . . and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be noted that the data streams C <b>258</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and E <b>292</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) may be sent to a common complex demodulator, such as the complex demodulator as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Therefore, the same FIR filter <b>306</b> may be used for data streams having every other data sample removed, and for data streams having two or more consecutive data samples removed by changing the coefficients of the FIR filter <b>306</b> through software, without modifying any hardware within the beamformer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Thus, by using the decimation and multiplexing system as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, namely, by decimating at least two consecutive data samples, an additional bandwidth (mid-band <b>262</b> of 5-15 MHz), or data sampling rate of one-quarter to three-quarters of the data sampling rate after decimation, may be achieved. Therefore, the maximum usable frequency range of the beamformer in a decimating mode may be expanded while maintaining the data rate at 20 MHz, for example. As overlapping frequency bands may be obtained, the image performance of transducers <b>10</b> having a center frequency close to 10 MHz is improved. As stated previously, transducers <b>10</b> having other center frequencies may also be used and achieve improved image performance.</p>
