<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a smoke generating device for a model train, and, more specifically, the invention provides a smoke generating device that can change the rate of smoke generated in response to load changes experienced by the engine of the model train.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Model train engines having smoke generating devices are well known. However, current smoke generating devices for model trains do not mimic the generation of smoke of a real train as closely as desired. Real trains generate smoke at a rate proportional to the loading of the engine of the train notwithstanding the speed at which the train is moving. This characteristic is not available in model toy trains. The heat generated by known smoke generator can cause the smoke generator to fail. The present invention solves these and other problems with the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention provides an apparatus for generating smoke for a model toy train. The invention includes a smoke generator having a support member for supporting a smoke generating element. The smoke generating element can be braided fiber glass. The support member can be solid or hollow. The support member can be any formed with any desirable cross-section, including rectangular or tubular.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention also provides a method for generating smoke from a model train. Smoke is generated with the smoke generating element connected to the train. A blower generates an air stream to move smoke out of the train. A controller controls the blower to generate the air stream at a particular rate in response to a signal corresponding to the load on the train.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other applications of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art when the following description of the best mode contemplated for practicing the invention is read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention provides a smoke generator for a model train. The smoke generator includes a smoke generating element operably associated with a support member. Generally, the smoke generating element can be wound around the support member such that the support member acts as a core to a helix defined by the smoke generating element. However, the support member can be used to support a substantially linear smoke generating element. The support member can support substantially the entire length of the smoke generating element or a portion of the smoke generating element. The smoke generating element can be a nickel chromium wire. The nickel chromium wire is held in place with fasteners engaged with ends of the wire. The support element supports the wire, enhancing wire life and performance.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, the invention includes a housing <b>10</b>, a smoke generating element <b>12</b> and a blower <b>14</b> for emitting smoke from a model train <b>22</b>. The housing <b>10</b> includes a first sub-housing <b>16</b> and a second sub-housing <b>18</b>. First sub-housing <b>16</b> is mounted to an interior surface <b>20</b> of the model train model train <b>22</b> and houses oil used in a smoke generating process. Oil is directed through an aperture <b>24</b> of model train <b>22</b>. While an oil burning smoke element is shown, the invention can be practiced with any type of smoke generator and any type of smoke generating process known in the art. For example, the smoke generator can be an ultrasonic wave nebulizer, a device for generating smoke-filled bubbles, or any other method disclosed by the references cited.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first sub-housing <b>16</b> is shown as generally rectangular. First sub-housing <b>16</b> can be any geometric shape, such as circular or irregularly shaped. The shape of first sub-housing <b>16</b> can be limited only to the extent that the first sub-housing <b>16</b> is preferably mounted in the interior of model train <b>22</b> and smoke generating element <b>12</b> can be extendable into first sub-housing <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">First sub-housing <b>16</b> includes an opening <b>28</b>. Opening <b>28</b> of first sub-housing <b>16</b> is aligned with an opening <b>30</b> of second sub-housing <b>18</b>. Openings <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> place the first and second sub-housing <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> in fluid communication with each other. Openings <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref> as generally rectangular in cross-section, however, the openings <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> can be any geometric configuration. While the first and second sub-housings <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> are shown positioned adjacent to each other, the invention can be practiced with first and second sub-housings positioned spaced apart relative to each other. A conduit can be positioned between the first and second sub-housings <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> to place the first and second sub-housings <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> in fluid communication with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Second sub-housing <b>18</b> can be shaped to correspond to the shape of fan <b>32</b>.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The second sub-housing <b>18</b> is mounted to an interior surface <b>20</b> of model train <b>22</b> and houses a fan <b>32</b> of blower <b>14</b> for directing an air stream through the housing <b>10</b>. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, fan <b>32</b> is a squirrel cage fan.

Fan <b>32</b> is positioned internally with respect to the second sub-housing <b>18</b>. A motor <b>34</b> for rotating the fan <b>32</b> is positioned externally with respect to the second sub-housing <b>18</b>.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a schematic circuit diagram is provided showing the preferred electric circuit of an embodiment of the present invention. Controller <b>46</b> is a micro-controller operable to receive input signals and emit output signals and can be an PIC12C508 chip. The controller <b>46</b> is in communication with the engine of the train through a serial communication line <b>53</b> including the input connector <b>52</b>. Serial communication line <b>53</b> transmits a wide variety of information with regard to model train <b>22</b>. This information can include but is not limited to the velocity of train <b>22</b>. Communication between the controller <b>46</b> and the input connector <b>52</b> can be enhanced with a protection resistor <b>66</b>. The voltage across the engine of the train is communicated to the controller <b>46</b> with serial communication line <b>53</b>. Based on a program stored in memory, the controller <b>46</b> can control the operation of the motor <b>34</b> to control an airstream generated by the fan. The controller <b>46</b> can control a rate of the airstream. The direction of the motor <b>34</b> can be controlled by alternating the voltage across the motor <b>34</b> with an H-bridge formed with a pair of chips <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>. The chips <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> can be XN4316 chips and can be controlled by the controller <b>46</b>. The velocity of the motor <b>34</b> can be changed by changing the level of voltage across the motor <b>34</b> with the controller <b>46</b>. The circuit also includes a voltage stabilizer defined by diode <b>56</b>, capacitor <b>58</b> and regulator <b>64</b>. The circuit also includes an element <b>50</b> that can control a lamp or relay when a command is received.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the method for generating smoke begins at step <b>70</b>. At <b>76</b>, the loading on the train is determined. The controller <b>46</b> can receive input from the communication line corresponding to the loading on the engine model train. The loading on the model train can correspond to a voltage across an engine of the model train or a speed at which the model train is moving. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, The controller <b>46</b> can communicate with a sensor <b>47</b> engaged with a wheel <b>49</b> of the model train <b>22</b>. The sensor <b>47</b> can sense the angular velocity of the wheel <b>49</b> and communicate the speed of the wheel <b>49</b> to the controller <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, At <b>78</b>, the appropriate angular velocity of the fan is determined by the controller in accordance with a control program stored in memory. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an illustrative graph is provided to show movement of the fan over time to produce a puffing pattern of smoke. A puff of smoke is emitted from an aperture of the model train. The time period lasting from T<b>1</b> to T<b>2</b> is the duration of a puff of smoke. The time period lasting from T<b>2</b> to T<b>3</b> is the interval between puffs of smoke. Preferably, the fan can be engaged at velocity V<b>1</b> in as short a period of time as possible, represented by a substantially vertical line L<b>1</b> on the graph. Also, the fan <b>32</b> can preferably be disengaged from velocity V<b>1</b> to zero velocity in as short a period of time as possible, represented by a substantially vertical line L<b>2</b> on the graph. More specifically the smoke unit stops the fan by temporarily reversing the current to motor. By temporarily reversing the current the fan stops abruptly thereby enhancing the puffing action of the smoke unit. As the time periods required to engage the fan up to velocity V<b>1</b> and disengage the fan <b>32</b> down from velocity V<b>1</b> decrease, a relatively more well defined puff of smoke will be emitted from the aperture of the train.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As the loading on the train increases, the controller can move the fan at a greater angular velocity, or increase the duration of puffs of smoke, or shorten the duration between puffs of smoke. For example, for a train modeled after a steam locomotive that puffs smoke, the puffs of smoke can be generated at increasing intervals as train speed increases and can be generated at decreasing intervals as the train speed decreases. Alternatively, the puffs of smoke can be generated at increasing intervals as engine load increases and can be generated at decreasing intervals as the engine load decreases. For a train modeled after a diesel engine that does not emit smoke in a puffing pattern, more smoke can be generated as the train speed increases and less smoke can be generated as the train speed decreases. Alternatively, more smoke can be generated as engine load increases and less smoke can be generated as engine load decreases. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, graphs are provide to show that the time between puffs decreases as loading on the train increases. Also, the duration of individual puffs of smoke increases as loading on the engine increases.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, at step <b>80</b> the controller engages the motor to rotate the fan at the desired angular velocity. After the fan has been engaged at the desired velocity, the process returns to step <b>76</b> to determine loading on the engine. The controller can continuously monitor the loading on the engine or can monitor the loading on the engine at predetermined intervals. For example, the controller can be operable to monitor the loading on the train every five seconds, every ten seconds or any time period desired.</p>

However, the invention is not so limited. In particular, the smoke generating element <b>116</b> can be formed to extend beyond an end <b>124</b> of the support member <b>114</b>. In such an embodiment of the invention, the support member <b>114</b> would be in contact with the smoke generating element <b>116</b> less than the entire length of the smoke generating element <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">To the extent that the support member <b>114</b> contacts the smoke generating element <b>116</b>, the contact occurs at portion <b>120</b> of the outer surface.

The smoke generating element <b>116</b> is shown having a generally circular cross-section (shown elliptical in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> due to the choice of cross-sectional plane). Portion <b>120</b> is shown as a point. However, the smoke generating element <b>116</b> can have a non-circular cross-section including a portion <b>120</b> having a predetermined width.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a smoke generating element <b>116</b> extends along a generally helical path around a support member <b>114</b>.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The support member <b>114</b> has a predetermined length and can have a rectangular cross-section. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the support member <b>114</b><i>a </i>can have a circular cross-section including an aperture <b>126</b> extending the length of the support member <b>114</b><i>a. </i>The aperture <b>126</b> can be formed to extend a predetermined distance through the support member <b>114</b><i>a, </i>a distance less than the length of the support member <b>114</b><i>a, </i>or can be formed to extend the length of the support member <b>114</b><i>a. </i>The support member <b>114</b> can be formed having any cross-section, including an irregular geometric cross-section.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The length and cross-section of the support member <b>114</b> can be varied to enhance the resistive properties of the apparatus <b>112</b>.

A relatively thicker support member <b>114</b> can support a relatively longer smoke generating element <b>116</b> having a greater resistance than a relatively shorter smoke generating element <b>116</b>.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The smoke generating element <b>116</b> can extends along a generally helical path around the support member <b>114</b>.
