<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Laser levels have been used in construction for many years. They typically seek to produce a plane of light for a reference for construction projects. Laser levels have been used for large scale construction projects like commercial excavating, laying foundations, and installing drop ceilings. Laser levels save considerable time during initial layout of a construction job compared to other tools such as beam levels, chalk lines, or torpedo levels. Some examples of jobs where laser levels would be useful include laying tile, mounting cabinets, installing counter tops, and building outdoor decks. Because these laser levels can typically cost thousands of dollars, only those who regularly land larger construction projects can justify purchasing a laser level. Laser levels have not achieved widespread adoption by the general public despite the time savings because of their initial cost of ownership. The expense can be attributed to the cost of suitable laser sources such as He-Neon laser and associated optical system used to manipulate the beam generated by the laser source.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In accordance with the present invention, an improved laser level is employed. The laser level comprises a motor, a shaft driven by the motor, a housing fixedly disposed on the shaft, the housing having a bore therein, a barrel pivotally connected to the housing, a laser diode module disposed within the barrel, and a screw disposed on the housing and contacting the barrel for adjusting the pivotal position of the barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also disclosed is a light detector, which comprises a housing having front and rear walls, a light receiving section disposed on the front wall, and displays disposed on the front and rear walls for showing the location of received light relative on the light receiving section.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additional features and benefits of the present invention are described, and will be apparent from, the accompanying drawings and the detailed description below.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The invention is now described with reference to the accompanying figures, wherein like numerals designate like parts. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a laser level <b>10</b> preferably comprises a frame assembly <b>30</b>, an engine assembly <b>40</b> rotatably attached to frame assembly <b>30</b>, a laser diode assembly <b>410</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) disposed within engine assembly <b>40</b>, a protective assembly <b>20</b> connected to frame assembly <b>30</b>, a shoe assembly <b>50</b> slidably attached to protective assembly <b>20</b>, a clamp assembly <b>80</b> disposed on shoe assembly <b>50</b>, and a multi-battery adapter assembly <b>70</b> for receiving a battery <b>60</b>. These assemblies are discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Preferably, protective assembly <b>20</b> has at least one protective bar <b>22</b> flexibly connected to the frame assembly <b>30</b>. Such bar <b>22</b> may be made of aluminum, or other suitable material. Preferably, the bar <b>22</b> is made of a plastic, such as ABS or polypropylene. The bar <b>22</b> may be injection-molded. Alternatively, the plastic may be injected into a mold (preferably about half the volume needed to complete fill the mold and thus filling half of the mold), then air or gas is blown therein, pushing the plastic into the other half of the mold, forming a hollow tube. This process is known as gas-assist injection molding.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The entire protective assembly <b>20</b> may be constructed as discussed above. Preferably, the protective assembly <b>20</b> surrounds and/or is disposed on both sides of frame assembly <b>30</b>. A handle <b>21</b> may be disposed between bars <b>22</b>. Handle <b>21</b> may be fixedly attached to the bars <b>22</b> via, e.g., screws (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Preferably, the shape of protective assembly <b>20</b> and handle <b>21</b> is such that the frame assembly <b>30</b> and/or engine assembly <b>40</b> cannot be contacted by anything wider than the handle <b>21</b> and/or protective assembly <b>20</b>. Such construction minimizes the risk of damage to frame assembly <b>30</b> and/or engine assembly <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As mentioned above, the protective assembly <b>20</b> may be flexibly connected to the frame assembly <b>30</b>. Such connection is achieved via the connector assemblies <b>23</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a connector assembly <b>23</b> is disposed between the protective assembly <b>20</b> and a wall <b>31</b> of frame housing <b>30</b>. The connector assembly <b>23</b> comprises a flexible isolator <b>23</b>G, which is preferably made of a flexible, resilient material such as rubber or an elastomer. The isolator <b>23</b>G may be connected to the protective assembly <b>20</b> and wall <b>31</b> via a screw <b>23</b>S, which may extend through one of the protective assembly <b>20</b> and/or wall <b>31</b> and threadingly engage the other of the protective assembly <b>20</b> and/or wall <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Alternatively, a isolator <b>23</b>G′ may be connected to protective assembly <b>20</b> via a screw <b>23</b>S′ extending through the protective assembly <b>20</b> and entering into isolator <b>23</b>G′, or vice versa, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Screw <b>23</b>S′ may then threadedly engage a nut <b>23</b>SN. The isolator <b>23</b>G′ in turn may be connected to the wall <b>31</b> via a screw <b>31</b>S extending through the wall <b>31</b> and entering into isolator <b>23</b>G′, or vice versa. Screw <b>31</b>S may then threadedly engage a nut <b>31</b>SN. Isolator <b>23</b>G′ may be molded over screws <b>23</b>S′, <b>31</b>S and/or nuts <b>23</b>SN, <b>31</b>SN. Such construction minimizes the shock received by frame assembly <b>30</b> and/or engine assembly <b>40</b>, and thus by the circuitry and components mounted within, when laser level <b>10</b> is dropped.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>6</b>, shoe assembly <b>50</b> may be slidably connected to protective assembly <b>20</b>. Protective assembly <b>20</b> may have two rails <b>24</b> surrounding shoe assembly <b>50</b>. Shoe assembly <b>50</b> may have a plate <b>51</b>, with tabs <b>51</b>T extending therefrom. Plate <b>51</b> is preferably made of plastic. Preferably, each rail <b>24</b> has a groove <b>24</b>G for receiving tab <b>51</b>T. Accordingly, shoe assembly <b>50</b> can slide relative to protective assembly <b>20</b> via the groove/tab connection. Persons skilled in the art should recognize that the same result would be achieved if protective assembly <b>20</b> and shoe assembly <b>50</b> had tabs and channels disposed respectively thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Shoe assembly <b>50</b> may have at least one rack <b>51</b>R (and preferably two racks <b>51</b>R) disposed on plate <b>51</b>. Such rack <b>51</b>R engages pinion <b>24</b>P disposed on a shaft <b>24</b>S, which may extend between rails <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Shaft <b>24</b>S preferably carries rotatable knob <b>24</b>RK at one end of the shaft. Rotatable knob <b>24</b>RK is fixedly connected to shaft <b>24</b>S. Accordingly, a user can rotate the pinions <b>24</b>P by rotating rotatable knob <b>24</b>RK. As the pinions <b>24</b>P rotate, the plate <b>51</b> will move forwardly or rearward. Travel of plate <b>51</b> may be limited by disposing enlarged teeth <b>51</b>RT at the beginning and/or the end of rack <b>51</b>R. Because pinion <b>24</b>P will not be able to mesh with enlarged teeth <b>51</b>RT, pinion <b>24</b>P will not rotate any further and travel of plate <b>51</b> in that direction is limited.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Shaft <b>24</b>S may also carry locking knob <b>24</b>LK at its other end of the shaft. Locking knob <b>24</b>LK may threadingly engage shaft <b>24</b>S. Accordingly, when a user rotates locking knob <b>24</b>LK, the knob will pinch rails <b>24</b> between locking knob <b>24</b>LK and rotatable knob <b>24</b>RK, locking plate <b>51</b> in place. Therefore, the user can fix and lock the shoe assembly <b>50</b> relative to protective assembly <b>20</b> by rotating locking knob <b>24</b>LK.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Plate <b>51</b> may also have strengthening ribs <b>51</b>SR for strengthening the plate <b>51</b>. Plate <b>51</b> may also have an opening <b>51</b>O for reducing the weight of and/or the amount of materials used in plate <b>51</b>. Opening <b>51</b>O may also allow viewing of the cast laser beam on a floor or work surface. Plate <b>51</b> may also have a threaded tripod mount <b>51</b>TM.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Plate <b>51</b> may also have wall mount holes <b>51</b>WM for receiving at least one nail or screw mounted on a wall, allowing the user to hang the laser level <b>10</b> from a wall. The verticality of laser level <b>10</b> can then be adjusted by rotating knob <b>51</b>K. Knob <b>51</b>K preferably extends through and threadingly engages plate <b>51</b>. A pad <b>51</b>KP may be disposed at the end of knob <b>51</b>K. Pad <b>51</b>KP may be made of plastic or rubber. Pad <b>51</b>KP may be fixed or captured on knob <b>51</b>K via a screw <b>51</b>KPS and/or washer (not shown), or may snap into a feature of rotating knob <b>51</b>K. Accordingly, the distance between plate <b>51</b> and the wall may be adjusted by rotating knob <b>51</b>K. Because pad <b>51</b>KP may be free to swivel about knob <b>51</b>K, it can be used on uneven or non-level surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>, plate <b>51</b> may also support clamp assembly <b>80</b>. Clamp assembly <b>80</b> may be used for clamping laser level <b>10</b> onto a ceiling, etc. Preferably, plate <b>51</b> has a vertical wall <b>51</b>W, which is pivotally connected to clamping wall <b>81</b>. Clamping wall <b>81</b> may have protrusions <b>81</b>P for enhancing the clamping of a surface. Similarly, wall <b>51</b>W may have protrusions (not shown) for enhancing the clamping of a surface. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that a surface will be clamped between wall <b>51</b>W and clamping wall <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Preferably, clamp assembly <b>80</b> can be opened and closed. This can be accomplished in different manners. One such manner provides clamping wall <b>81</b> with an extension arm <b>81</b>A, which may be substantially perpendicular to wall <b>81</b>. A shaft <b>85</b> may extend through arm <b>81</b>A and is pivotally connected to a cam <b>83</b> via a pin <b>85</b>P. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that arm <b>81</b>A may be contacted underneath by the head <b>85</b>H of shaft <b>85</b> and/or spring <b>84</b>, which may be captured between arm <b>81</b>A and shoulder <b>85</b>S of shaft <b>85</b>. Because of this, arm <b>81</b>A (and thus wall <b>81</b>) will move when shaft <b>85</b> moves upwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Cam <b>83</b> may fixedly attached to shaft <b>82</b>, which may be rotated by lever <b>86</b>. Accordingly, when shaft <b>82</b> is rotated in one direction, cam <b>83</b> is rotated is rotated in the same direction, moving shaft <b>85</b> upwardly, which in turn moves arm <b>81</b>A upwardly, rotating clamping wall <b>81</b> towards wall <b>51</b>W. In other words, clamp assembly <b>80</b> is thus closed. If shaft <b>85</b> bottoms out, spring <b>84</b> can move arm <b>81</b>A further.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Preferably, a torsion spring <b>81</b>S may be disposed between clamping wall <b>81</b> (or arm <b>81</b>A) and wall <b>51</b>W. When cam <b>83</b> is rotated in the other direction, the force pressed onto arm <b>81</b>A by shaft <b>85</b> and/or spring <b>84</b> is diminished. Torsion spring <b>81</b>S then forces the wall <b>81</b> (or arm <b>81</b>A) away from wall <b>51</b>W. In other words, clamp assembly <b>80</b> is thus opened. Therefore, clamp assembly <b>80</b> may be opened or closed by rotation of shaft <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It is preferable to provide shaft <b>82</b> with a pin <b>82</b>P traveling along a channel <b>51</b>C in plate <b>51</b> to limit the range of rotation of shaft <b>82</b>. This prevents a user from over tightening clamp assembly <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Preferably, wall <b>51</b>W has zero markings <b>51</b>ZI. Plate <b>51</b> may also have indicia <b>51</b>I to indicate the distance between the clamping wall <b>81</b> and/or wall <b>51</b>W (or zero marking <b>51</b>ZI) and the frame assembly <b>30</b>. Accordingly, the user can precisely determine whether the frame assembly <b>30</b> and/or engine assembly <b>40</b> is at, e.g., two inches from the clamping wall <b>81</b> and/or wall <b>51</b>W.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As mentioned above, engine assembly <b>40</b> is pivotally attached to frame assembly <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 8</figref>. In other words, engine assembly <b>40</b> may be rotated from a substantially vertical position for radiating a laser beam LB along a horizontal plane to a substantially horizontal position (shown in dotted lines) for radiating laser beam LB along a vertical plane. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that, if the vertical position is 0° and the horizontal position is 90°, it is preferable to allow rotation of engine assembly <b>40</b> from about −5° to 140°.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>8</b>-<b>10</b>, a shaft <b>32</b> extends through frame assembly <b>30</b> and engine assembly <b>40</b>, allowing engine assembly <b>40</b> to rotate thereabout. Engine assembly <b>40</b> may have a rack <b>49</b>R which meshes with a pinion <b>35</b> supported by frame assembly <b>30</b>. Accordingly, the user can precisely rotate engine assembly <b>40</b> by rotating pinion <b>35</b>. It is preferable to provide a pointer <b>31</b>P and indicia <b>42</b>I on wall <b>31</b> and engine assembly <b>40</b> to indicate the angle of engine assembly <b>40</b> relative to frame assembly <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a first locking mechanism for fixing the angular position of engine assembly <b>40</b>. As mentioned above, shaft <b>32</b> extends through right wall <b>31</b>R, engine assembly <b>40</b>, and left wall <b>31</b>L. A cam <b>33</b> may be pivotally attached to shaft <b>32</b> via pin <b>33</b>P. When a user rotates cam <b>33</b> via handle <b>33</b>H, camming portion <b>33</b>C increases the distance between pin <b>33</b>P and left wall <b>31</b>L. Such action locks engine assembly <b>40</b> by pinching engine assembly <b>40</b> between walls <b>31</b>R, <b>31</b>L. Alternatively, if engine assembly <b>40</b> is fixedly connected, no pinching is necessary, as the camming portion <b>33</b>C will prevent rotation of shaft <b>32</b> until released.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a second locking mechanism for fixing the angular position of engine assembly <b>40</b>, where like numerals refer to like parts. As mentioned above, shaft <b>32</b> extends through right wall <b>31</b>R (not shown), engine assembly <b>40</b> and left wall <b>31</b>L. Engine assembly <b>40</b> is preferably fixedly attached to shaft <b>32</b>. A detent mechanism <b>34</b> may be pivotally attached to shaft <b>32</b> via pin <b>34</b>P. Detent mechanism <b>34</b> preferably has a detent protrusion <b>34</b>D, which may engage a notch <b>31</b>N in left wall <b>31</b>L.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Accordingly, the angular position of engine assembly <b>40</b> may be fixed by the location of the notch <b>31</b>N engaged by protrusion <b>34</b>D. To unfix the angular position, the user needs to move handle <b>34</b>H until protrusion <b>34</b>D clears notch <b>31</b>N. The user can then change the angular position of engine assembly <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Persons skilled in the art should recognize that multiple angular positions of engine assembly <b>40</b> may be available by providing multiple notches <b>31</b>N at different angles. Persons skilled in the art shall recognize that detent protrusion and notches could have been disposed alternatively on the wall <b>31</b>L and detent mechanism <b>34</b> to achieve the same result.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Persons skilled in the art should also recognize that it is preferable to provide a spring <b>34</b>S between detent mechanism <b>34</b> (preferably handle <b>34</b>H) and wall <b>31</b>L to bias the protrusion <b>34</b>D into engagement with notch <b>31</b>N. Preferably, spring <b>34</b>S is an extension spring. Alternatively, spring <b>34</b>S could be a compression spring if disposed in the appropriate manner.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A preferred embodiment of the engine assembly <b>40</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-25</figref>. Persons skilled in the art should refer to U.S. Pat. No. 5,754,582, which is wholly incorporated by reference herein. Engine assembly <b>40</b> may include a laser assembly <b>400</b>. Laser assembly <b>400</b> may include a laser diode assembly <b>410</b>, a driving assembly <b>420</b> for rotating the laser diode assembly <b>410</b>, and a powering assembly <b>430</b> for powering the laser diodes in the laser diode assembly <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Laser diode assembly <b>410</b> preferably includes a laser diode housing <b>411</b>, which is preferably made of aluminum. Laser diode housing <b>411</b> may have two cylindrical bores <b>412</b>, which are preferably coplanar. (Persons skilled in the art should recognize that the number of bores <b>412</b> provided may match the number of laser diodes modules disposed in the housing. In the preferred embodiment, two laser diode modules are to be disposed in laser diode housing <b>411</b>, for reasons further explained below.)</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Laser diode assembly <b>410</b> may also include a barrel <b>413</b> inserted into each bore <b>412</b>. Barrels <b>413</b> carry the laser diode modules <b>415</b>. Preferably, the present invention employs a low cost laser diode module such as that used in laser pointers. These laser diode modules include a laser diode source and an optical system <b>415</b>L disposed on barrel <b>413</b>, which is preferably made of aluminum. The optical components are inexpensive and the alignment process is quick and simple. A standard low cost laser diode module consists of a laser diode <b>415</b>D and a printed circuit board <b>415</b>P for mounting the diode <b>415</b>D. Preferably, diode <b>415</b>D is Sanyo part numbers DL-3148-033 or DL-3148-034.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Printed circuit board <b>415</b>P may carry a power regulation integrated circuit for limiting the power sent to laser diode <b>415</b>D and/or limiting the brightness of laser diode <b>415</b>D. One suitable laser diode module <b>415</b> may be the VLM-670 available from Quarton Company of Taipei, Taiwan. In a typical manufacturing process for these laser diode modules, the laser diode <b>415</b>D is glued or soldered to the printed circuit board <b>415</b>P.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition, barrel <b>413</b> may be pivotally attached to laser diode housing <b>411</b> via a pin <b>414</b>, which is preferably disposed substantially horizontally. Accordingly, barrel <b>413</b> may be adjusted rotationally about pin <b>414</b>, allowing the pitch of barrel <b>413</b> to be adjusted. This may be accomplished by disposing barrel <b>413</b> between a spring <b>417</b> and a set screw <b>416</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">To adjust the barrel <b>413</b> (and thus laser diode module <b>415</b>), the assembler needs only to rotate set screw <b>416</b>. If screw <b>416</b> is rotated for downward movement, barrel <b>413</b> will move downwardly. On the other hand, if screw <b>416</b> is rotated for upward movement, barrel <b>413</b> will move upwardly due to spring <b>417</b>. Preferably, set screw <b>416</b> is locked in place with a quick drying adhesive, such as Loc-Tite, etc. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that this adjustment methodology is preferable so that the position of the laser diode module <b>415</b> is not susceptible to disturbance due to vibration during the transportation of the laser level <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Persons skilled in the art will recognize that laser diode housing <b>411</b> may have a bore <b>417</b>B for receiving spring <b>417</b> therein, as well as a hole <b>417</b>H for facilitating insertion of spring <b>417</b> therein.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Laser diode housing <b>411</b> is preferably disposed on a shaft <b>419</b>, which may be electrically charged, as explained below. Preferably, shaft <b>419</b> is made of metal, such as aluminum or steel, and carries a positive charge. A wire <b>419</b>P may connect the shaft <b>419</b> to the laser printed circuit board <b>415</b>P. Alternatively, laser printed circuit board <b>415</b>P may be connected to barrel <b>413</b>, which in turn is electrically connected to laser diode housing <b>411</b> (and shaft <b>419</b>) via pin <b>414</b>, screw <b>416</b> and/or spring <b>417</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Shaft <b>419</b> may be hollow to carry a negative wire <b>415</b>N. Negative wire <b>415</b>N preferably extends through shaft <b>419</b> and barrel <b>413</b>, and is connected to the laser printed circuit board <b>415</b>P.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Shaft <b>419</b> may be rotatably supported by a vial assembly <b>450</b>, which includes vial plate <b>451</b>. Preferably, a bearing <b>419</b>B is disposed on vial plate <b>451</b>. Bearing <b>419</b>B may rotatably receive shaft <b>419</b> therethrough. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that bearing <b>419</b>B minimizes friction between shaft <b>419</b> and vial plate <b>451</b>. In addition, bearing <b>419</b>B may be pre-loaded axially to reduce clearances within the bearing itself. Lack of bearing pre-load may result in calibration drift, affecting the accuracy of laser assembly <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition, an insulating layer <b>4191</b> may be disposed between bearing <b>419</b>B and vial plate <b>451</b>. In this manner, the electrical charge of shaft <b>419</b> will not be conducted to vial plate <b>451</b> and/or vial assembly <b>450</b>. Alternatively, electro-static discharge (ESD) from exposed metal surfaces will not be conducted to the diodes <b>415</b>D, which may be sensitive to ESD.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It is preferable to provide a cap <b>418</b> on laser housing <b>411</b> to prevent users from touching and/or viewing wires <b>415</b>N, <b>419</b>P. Preferably, cap <b>418</b> is made of an insulating material, such as rubber or plastic, and is designed so that it snaps onto housing <b>411</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Persons skilled in the art will recognize that the laser beam LB may have a cross-section that is longer along a first axis than along a substantially perpendicular axis. In other words, its height may be larger than its width (see, e.g., beam spot LBV in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>), etc. This is because the laser emission is generated by light oscillating at resonance within an active semiconductor layer that is sandwiched between two internally highly reflective semiconductor faces. Collimating optics in the laser diode module <b>415</b> may reshape this light into a more equal-dimensioned beam. However, even after collimation, the laser beam LB is not perfectly circular.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">It is preferable thus to align the laser diode module <b>415</b> so that the longer axis of the beam spot is disposed substantially horizontally, i.e., along and/or coplanar to the laser light plane generated by the laser level <b>10</b> (see, e.g., beam spot LBH in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). This minimizes the height of the laser beam, providing for a more exact, or “crisper”, laser light plane.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Such result can be achieved, for example, as follows. First, the orientation of the semiconductor material layers within the laser crystal must be identified. The orientation is typically fixed with respect to three electrical pins on the laser diode <b>415</b>D. Once the orientation of the layers and pins has been identified, the printed circuit board <b>415</b>P may be designed to receive the laser diode <b>415</b>D in a certain rotational position. Printed circuit board <b>415</b>P may also be provided with an indexing tab <b>415</b>I. This tab <b>415</b>I fits in a slot (not shown) in barrel <b>413</b>, fixing the rotational position of the laser diode module <b>415</b> relative to the laser diode housing <b>411</b>. Accordingly, the laser diode module <b>415</b> can be consistently installed so that the longer axis of the beam spot is disposed substantially horizontally, i.e., along and/or coplanar to the laser light plane generated by the laser level <b>10</b>. Persons skilled in the art shall recognize that the tab and slot may be alternative provided on barrel <b>413</b> and printed circuit board <b>415</b>P, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Persons skilled in the art should recognize that wall <b>41</b> of engine assembly <b>40</b> substantially encloses and/or protects laser assembly <b>400</b>. Slots <b>41</b>S may be disposed on wall <b>41</b> to allow laser beam LB to exit therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Preferably, laser assembly <b>400</b> has two diode modules <b>415</b>. One reason for such arrangement is the added intensity of the resulting laser beam plane.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Another reason is that having two diode modules <b>415</b> will prevent any unlighted spots on the laser beam plane. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the slots <b>41</b>S are preferably separated by posts <b>41</b>P. Preferably the width of posts <b>41</b>P is such that, when one laser diode module <b>415</b> is blocked by one post <b>41</b>P, the other laser diode module <b>415</b> projects a laser beam LB that exists through slot <b>41</b>S.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As mentioned above, powering assembly <b>430</b> provides power to laser diode modules <b>415</b>. Powering assembly <b>430</b> may include a slip ring <b>431</b>, which is preferably integrated. Preferably, slip ring <b>431</b> is fixedly disposed to a floor <b>441</b>. A bracket <b>432</b> may be used to fix slip ring <b>431</b> unto floor <b>441</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Slip ring <b>431</b> may receive power through positive wire <b>431</b>WP and negative wire <b>431</b>WN. The slip ring <b>431</b> may be electrically connected to a shaft <b>433</b>, via brushes <b>431</b>B, rendering shaft <b>433</b> with a particular electrical potential. Shaft <b>433</b> is preferably made of metal, such as steel or aluminum. Preferably, shaft <b>433</b> has a positive voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Slip ring collar <b>434</b> may be disposed at and electrically connected to the upper end of shaft <b>433</b>. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that slip ring collar <b>434</b> is also electrically charged. A dual constant velocity joint (or universal joint) may connect the slip ring collar <b>434</b> to a pulley <b>422</b>, as explained below. A light spring <b>435</b> may bridge the electrical gap between the slip ring collar <b>434</b> and pulley <b>422</b>. Spring <b>435</b> may also slightly preload the joint to eliminate backlash.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As mentioned above, driving assembly <b>420</b> is provided for rotating laser assembly <b>410</b>. Driving assembly <b>420</b> may include a motor <b>424</b> driving a shaft <b>424</b>S and a pulley <b>424</b>P disposed thereon. Pulley <b>424</b>P may drive a belt <b>423</b>, which drives pulley <b>422</b>. Pulley <b>422</b> is preferably fixedly attached to shaft <b>419</b>. Accordingly, when motor <b>424</b> rotates shaft <b>424</b>S, it will drive pulley <b>422</b> and rotate shaft <b>419</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Motor <b>424</b> may be supported by vial assembly <b>450</b>, plate <b>451</b> and/or by a bracket connected thereto. The motor <b>424</b> is preferably controlled and/or driven by a pulse width modulation (PWM) circuit, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35A</figref> as a block diagram, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35B</figref> as a circuit schematic.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The user adjustable voltage <b>601</b> includes a potentiometer <b>601</b>P, which can be moved by a user. The potentiometer <b>601</b>P varies the selected voltage between a top voltage representative of the top rotational speed of motor <b>424</b>, and a bottom voltage, where the motor <b>424</b> does not rotate. Preferably, the bottom voltage is slightly negative.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The selected voltage is then fed to a summer <b>602</b>, which subtracts the motor's back electromotive force (emf) feedback voltage from the selected voltage. The emf voltage is determined by the sample and hold <b>605</b> as follows. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that motor <b>424</b> is driven by pulses. The longer and/or the more frequent the pulses, the longer the motor <b>424</b> runs on electricity, allowing it to accelerate.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">When the motor <b>424</b> is not driven by a pulse, the motor <b>424</b> acts as an inductor and creates a flyback (negative) voltage. This flyback voltage is then shunted.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">When the flyback voltage is shunted, motor <b>424</b> is freewheeling and generating voltage. In particular, motor <b>424</b> generates back emf voltage, which is relatively proportional to the rotational speed of motor <b>424</b>. The sample and hold <b>605</b> then samples the back emf voltage, holds it and then sends it summing junction <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Summing junction <b>602</b> generates an error signal which goes into controller <b>603</b>. Controller <b>603</b> then sends a drive signal to the PWM motor drive <b>604</b>, which sends out the drive pulses to drive motor <b>424</b>. The PWM motor drive <b>604</b> also sends a signal indicating that it is driving motor <b>424</b> to the sample and hold <b>605</b>. In this manner, sample and hold <b>605</b> does not sample the voltages created by motor <b>424</b> at the same time the PWM motor drive <b>604</b> is driving the motor <b>424</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Sample and hold <b>605</b> also has another circuit that monitors the flyback voltage, to prevent sampling thereof. Once the flyback voltage is shunted, sample and hold <b>605</b> can sample the back emf voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Persons skilled in the art should recognize that controller <b>603</b> may require both positive and negative supply voltages. Since the laser level <b>10</b> is preferably battery powered, a voltage inverter <b>606</b> has been provided to invert the battery voltage, thus providing the negative supply voltage to controller <b>603</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Persons skilled in the art will recognize that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35B</figref> illustrates one possible implementation of the circuit diagrammed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35A</figref>.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Persons skilled in the art will recognize that in the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35B</figref>, integrated circuits U<b>2</b>A, U<b>2</b>B and U<b>1</b> are configured as a switched capacitor voltage converter to generate a negative voltage for the operational amplifier U<b>2</b> and the low end of the command signal (to ensure head rotation stops when the speed adjustment potentiometer, R<b>18</b>, is turned off). Q<b>1</b>, U<b>4</b> and U<b>6</b> are configured as a PWM drive. The duty cycle is controlled by the controller output (the voltage at U<b>6</b>, pin <b>2</b>). Q<b>3</b> is the motor drive transistor and Q<b>2</b> combined with R<b>8</b> limit the drive current to approximately 230 mA. U<b>3</b>D and C<b>9</b> are a sample and hold circuit. Sampling is allowed when the drive pulse is off (U<b>2</b>, pin <b>8</b>) and when the motor coil flyback pulse is over (controlled by D<b>4</b>, D<b>5</b>, D<b>6</b> and Q<b>4</b>). R<b>21</b> and C<b>8</b> forms low pass filter to reduce sampling noise. U<b>5</b>D buffers the feedback voltage. U<b>5</b>C buffers the command voltage. U<b>5</b>A subtracts the feedback from the command to create an error signal. U<b>5</b>B is a proportional and integral controller that commands the PWM circuitry to drive the error signal to zero. This holds the rotary head speed constant at a speed controlled by the user adjusting R<b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Persons skilled in the art should recognize that most of the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> should be disposed within frame assembly <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In addition, driving assembly <b>420</b> may include a coupling link <b>421</b>, which is preferably disposed on slip ring collar <b>434</b>. Link <b>421</b> may be made of a non-conductive material, such as plastic. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18</figref>, link <b>421</b> has at least one upper protrusion <b>421</b>P and at least one lower protrusion <b>421</b>LP extending from a shaft <b>421</b>S.

Similarly, link <b>421</b> may have four lower protrusions <b>421</b>LP extending in a cross formation from shaft <b>421</b>S. Preferably, link <b>421</b> is injection molded to obtain the desired shape.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Lower protrusions <b>421</b>LP may be disposed in a similarly shaped area of slip ring collar <b>434</b>. Preferably, a gap <b>434</b>G exists between lower protrusion <b>421</b>LP and slip ring collar <b>434</b> to allow some rotational play therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Similarly, upper protrusions <b>421</b>P may be disposed in a similarly shaped area of pulley <b>422</b>. Preferably, a gap <b>422</b>G exists between lower protrusion <b>421</b>LP and pulley <b>422</b> to allow some rotational play therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Because of the shape of the protrusions <b>421</b>P, <b>421</b>LP, the shape of the slots in pulley <b>422</b> and slip collar <b>434</b>, and the gaps <b>422</b>G, <b>434</b>G therebetween, rotary motion between shaft <b>419</b> and pulley <b>422</b> is transmitted through link <b>421</b> to shaft <b>433</b>. Accordingly, this system behaves like a double-knuckle joint, compensating for misalignment between the slip ring <b>431</b>, the shaft <b>433</b> and pulley <b>422</b> via six degrees of freedom (three translational degrees and three rotational degrees). This also minimizes stress on the slip ring <b>431</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, as mentioned above, slip collar <b>434</b> is electrically charged. This charge may be transmitted to pulley <b>422</b> via a spring <b>435</b>. Shaft <b>419</b> is then charged due to the electrical connection between pulley <b>422</b> and shaft <b>419</b>. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that spring <b>435</b> may also serve to maintain alignment between slip collar <b>434</b> and pulley <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">On the other hand, a wire <b>431</b>N exiting slip ring <b>431</b> may carry the opposite charge to laser diode module <b>415</b>. If shaft <b>419</b> is charged positively, then wire <b>431</b>N carries the negative charge. Wire <b>431</b>N preferably bypasses shaft <b>433</b> and slip collar <b>434</b>, and enters shaft <b>419</b> through pulley <b>422</b>. As mentioned above, shaft <b>419</b> is hollow, allowing wire to extend therethrough until it is electrically connected to wire <b>415</b>N.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-21</figref>, manual adjustment assemblies <b>460</b>, <b>460</b>′ may be provided on engine assembly <b>40</b>, for manually rotating laser assembly <b>410</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a plate <b>462</b> may be fixedly attached to wall <b>41</b> of engine assembly <b>40</b>. Preferably, plate <b>462</b> is riveted unto wall <b>41</b>. An adjustment knob <b>461</b> may be disposed between wall <b>41</b> and plate <b>462</b>, and extend through the top of engine assembly <b>40</b>. A spring <b>463</b> is preferably disposed between knob <b>461</b> and plate <b>462</b>. A plunger <b>465</b> may be disposed under knob <b>461</b>. Plunger <b>465</b> may extend through plate <b>462</b> for contacting laser diode housing <b>411</b>. Preferably, the plunger areas that contact laser diode housing <b>411</b> are rubberized, or covered with a high friction material. Alternatively, plunger <b>465</b> is made of rubber. Tabs <b>465</b>T may capture plunger <b>465</b> between plate <b>462</b> and knob <b>461</b>. A spring <b>464</b> may be disposed between plunger <b>465</b> and knob <b>461</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Accordingly, if the user wants to adjust the location of laser diode housing <b>411</b>, the user needs only to press knob <b>461</b> downwardly, forcing plunger <b>465</b> into contact with laser diode housing <b>411</b>. The user can then rotate laser diode housing <b>411</b> by rotating knob <b>461</b>. The user cannot overload the laser diode housing <b>411</b> because the spring preferably <b>464</b> maintains a controlled contact force between plunger <b>465</b> and laser diode housing <b>411</b>. In addition, adjustment knob <b>461</b> and/or spring <b>463</b> preferably bottom out on plate <b>462</b> before spring <b>464</b> is fully compressed.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, adjustment assembly <b>460</b>′ is similar to adjustment assembly <b>460</b>, where like numerals refer to like parts. The main difference between the two embodiments is tha plunger <b>465</b> is retained by retaining pin <b>466</b>, rather than tabs <b>465</b>T contacting plate <b>462</b>. Preferably, pin <b>466</b> is fixedly attached to knob <b>461</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>14</b>-<b>15</b> and <b>23</b>, vial assembly <b>450</b> preferably has a vial plate <b>451</b> and pedestals <b>452</b> for supporting vial plate <b>451</b> on floor <b>441</b>. Preferably, an insulation pad <b>4521</b> is disposed between pedestals <b>452</b> and floor <b>441</b> for electrically insulating vial assembly <b>450</b> from floor <b>441</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Vial plate <b>451</b> may carry multiple spirit vials thereon to indicate whether vial plate <b>451</b> and/or laser diode modules <b>415</b> are in a substantially horizontal plane. Preferably, vial plate <b>451</b> carries at least three horizontal vials <b>454</b>VF, <b>454</b>VS, <b>454</b>VR and one vertical vial <b>455</b>V. The horizontal vials <b>454</b>VF, <b>454</b>VS, <b>454</b>VR are preferably disposed on the front, right and rear walls of engine assembly <b>40</b>. Vertical vial <b>455</b>V may be disposed on the rear wall of engine assembly <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Suitable vials for this application may be parts nos. 0349 and/or 0224 made by Empire Level Mfg. Corp. of Milwaukee, Wis. Alternatively, the vials can be custom made by bending or grinding, as is well known in the art, so long as the desired dimensional requirements are met.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the present case, the main dimensional requirements for the vials are length, diameter, and angular sensitivity. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that length and diameter are dependent upon the size of the desired vial.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As to angular sensitivity, persons skilled in the art will recognize that the angular sensitivity of the vials is identified by “minutes”, as in “one-minute vials”. The vials used in laser level <b>10</b> may be more accurate, equally accurate, or less accurate than one-minute vials. Preferably, the vials used in the laser level <b>10</b> are one-minute vials, five-minute vials, six-minute vials, or any other vials with an angular sensitivity between the one-minute vials and the six-minute vials.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Such arrangement is advantageous for several reasons. First, when engine assembly <b>40</b> is in the vertical position, the user may want to check vials <b>454</b>VS and <b>454</b>VF and/or <b>454</b>VR to determine whether the laser diode modules <b>415</b> are level. However, when engine assembly <b>40</b> is in the horizontal position, the user may not be able to check vials <b>454</b>VS and/or <b>454</b>VF. The user can nevertheless confirm whether laser diode modules <b>415</b> are substantially vertical, or “plumb,” by checking vials <b>454</b>VR and <b>455</b>V, which are now laying substantially horizontally on the rear face.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Another reason for providing parallel vials <b>454</b>VF, <b>454</b>VR is to provide redundant alignment indication. In other words, both vials may be calibrated to indicate level when the laser beam plane is horizontal. If the laser level <b>10</b> is disturbed violently enough for one of the vials to become uncalibrated with respect to the laser beam plane, the user can notice such problem by comparing both vials <b>454</b>VF, <b>454</b>VR.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, vials <b>454</b>VR, <b>455</b>V may be attached to vial holders <b>454</b>, <b>455</b>. Preferably, the vials <b>454</b>VR, <b>455</b>V are glued with optical glue to the vial holders <b>454</b>, <b>455</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Vial holder <b>454</b> may be pivotally attached to vial plate <b>451</b> via pin <b>454</b>P. Alternatively, vial holder <b>454</b> may be flexibly attached to vial plate <b>451</b> via a flexible junction or flexure. The flexible junction may be integral with vial holder <b>454</b> and/or vial plate <b>451</b>, or it may be bonded to vial holder <b>454</b> and/or vial plate <b>451</b>. Persons skilled in the art should recognize that the flexure may be mounted to the vial plate, and a vial may be bonded on the flexure.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">An adjustment screw <b>454</b>B may extend through vial plate <b>451</b> and threadingly engage vial holder <b>454</b>. A spring <b>454</b>S may be disposed between vial plate <b>451</b> and vial holder <b>454</b>. Preferably, spring <b>454</b>S is a compression spring. Spring <b>454</b>S may be disposed along or outside screw <b>454</b>B. Accordingly, when the screw <b>454</b>B is rotated, vial holder <b>454</b> will pivot about pin <b>454</b>P. Spring <b>454</b>S will maintain the vial holder <b>454</b> in the desired position.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Persons skilled in the art will recognize that screw <b>454</b>B may threadingly engage and extend through vial holder <b>454</b> and contact (rather than extend through) vial plate <b>451</b>. Alternatively, screw <b>454</b>B may extend through vial holder <b>454</b> and threadingly engage vial plate <b>451</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Similarly, vial holder <b>455</b> may be pivotally attached to vial plate <b>451</b> via a pin <b>455</b>P. Alternatively, vial holder <b>455</b> may be flexibly attached to vial plate <b>451</b> via a flexible junction or flexure. The flexible junction may be integral with vial holder <b>455</b> and/or vial plate <b>451</b>, or it may be bonded to vial holder <b>455</b> and/or vial plate <b>451</b>. Persons skilled in the art should recognize that the flexure may be mounted to the vial plate, and a vial may be bonded on the flexure.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">A pedestal or protrusion <b>453</b> may extend downwardly from vial plate <b>451</b>. A screw <b>455</b>B may extend through protrusion <b>452</b> and threadingly engage vial holder <b>455</b>. A spring <b>455</b>S may be disposed between vial plate <b>451</b> and vial holder <b>455</b>. Preferably, spring <b>455</b>S is a compression spring. Spring <b>455</b>S may be disposed along or outside screw <b>455</b>B. Accordingly, when the screw <b>455</b>B is rotated, vial holder <b>455</b> will pivot about pin <b>455</b>P. Spring <b>455</b>S will maintain the vial holder <b>455</b> in the desired position.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Persons skilled in the art will recognize that screw <b>455</b>B may threadingly engage and extend through vial holder <b>455</b> and contact (rather than extend through) vial plate <b>451</b>. Alternatively, screw <b>455</b>B may extend through vial holder <b>455</b> and threadingly engage vial plate <b>451</b>. Once the vials are adjusted, the screws <b>454</b>B, <b>455</b>B may be locked in place with a quick-drying adhesive, such as LOCTITE. Persons skilled in the art should recognize that the other vials may be adjusted in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-25</figref>, persons skilled in the art should also recognize that a leveling mechanism <b>440</b> is preferably provided for adjusting the plane upon which laser assembly <b>410</b> rests, in order to ensure that the laser beam plane is substantially horizontal or substantially vertical. Leveling mechanism <b>440</b> includes floor <b>441</b> upon which laser assembly <b>410</b> and/or vial assembly <b>450</b> rest thereon. Floor <b>441</b> may be disposed over a plate <b>443</b>. Plate <b>443</b> may have holes <b>443</b>S for receiving shaft <b>32</b> therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Preferably, floor <b>441</b> and plate <b>443</b> are connected. A screw <b>448</b> may threadingly engage floor <b>441</b> and contact plate <b>443</b>. A spring <b>448</b>S may be disposed between the head <b>448</b>H of screw <b>448</b> and floor <b>441</b> for biasing floor <b>441</b> downwardly towards plate <b>443</b>. Similarly, a screw <b>446</b> may threadingly engage plate <b>443</b> and contact floor <b>441</b>. A spring <b>446</b>S may be disposed between the head <b>446</b>H of screw <b>446</b> and plate <b>443</b> for biasing plate <b>443</b> upwardly towards floor <b>441</b>. Accordingly, the distance between floor <b>441</b> and plate <b>443</b> may be adjusted by rotating screws <b>448</b> and/or <b>446</b>. A spring <b>447</b> may also be disposed between floor <b>441</b> and plate <b>443</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Preferably, floor <b>441</b> carries a pitch shaft <b>442</b>PS, which can be rotated via pitch knob <b>442</b>P. Shaft <b>442</b>PS may be threadingly engaged to moveable pitch cam <b>442</b>PC, so that when shaft <b>442</b>PS is rotated, moveable pitch cam <b>442</b>PC travels along the longitudinal axis of pitch shaft <b>442</b>PS. Moveable pitch cam <b>442</b>PC preferably contacts fixed pitch cam <b>443</b>PC of plate <b>443</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, at least one of pitch cams <b>442</b>PC, <b>443</b>PC may have ramps for forcing moveable pitch cam <b>442</b>PC (and floor <b>441</b>) to move upwardly or downwardly. Persons skilled in the art should recognize that pitch shaft <b>442</b>PS and moveable pitch cam <b>442</b>PC may be disposed on plate <b>443</b>, while fixed pitch cam <b>443</b>PC may be disposed on floor <b>441</b>. Such arrangement allows the user to change the pitch angle of floor <b>441</b>, i.e., to move the front of floor <b>441</b> upwardly while moving the rear of floor <b>441</b>, or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Persons skilled in the art will recognize that fixed pitch cam <b>443</b>PC may be replaced by a pitch pin <b>443</b>PP supported by walls extending from plate <b>443</b>. Pitch pin <b>443</b>PP would function in the same manner as fixed pitch cam <b>443</b>PC, except that pitch pin <b>443</b>PP would be less sensitive to any rotational or angular variance of moveable pitch cam <b>442</b>PC.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Floor <b>441</b> may also carry a roll shaft <b>442</b>RS, which can be rotated via roll knob <b>442</b>R. Shaft <b>442</b>RS may be threadingly engaged to moveable roll cam <b>442</b>RC, so that when shaft <b>442</b>RS is rotated, moveable roll cam <b>442</b>RC travels along the longitudinal axis of pitch shaft <b>442</b>RS. Moveable roll cam <b>442</b>RC preferably contacts fixed roll cam <b>443</b>RC of plate <b>443</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, at least one of roll cams <b>442</b>RC, <b>443</b>RC may have ramps for forcing moveable roll cam <b>442</b>RC (and floor <b>441</b>) to move upwardly or downwardly. Persons skilled in the art should recognize that roll shaft <b>442</b>RS and moveable roll cam <b>442</b>RC may be disposed on plate <b>443</b>, while fixed roll cam <b>443</b>RC may be disposed on floor <b>441</b>. Such arrangement allows the user to change the roll angle of floor <b>441</b>, i.e., to move the left side of floor <b>441</b> upwardly while moving the right side of floor <b>441</b>, or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Persons skilled in the art will recognize that fixed roll cam <b>443</b>RC may be replaced by a roll pin <b>443</b>RP supported by walls extending from plate <b>443</b>. Roll pin <b>443</b>RP would function in the same manner as fixed roll cam <b>443</b>RC, except that roll pin <b>443</b>RP would be less sensitive to any rotational or angular variance of moveable roll cam <b>442</b>RC.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27-29</figref>, laser level <b>10</b> preferably has a bump sensor assembly <b>650</b> for indicating that the laser level <b>10</b> has been hit or bumped, and potentially knocked out of level alignment. Bump sensor assembly <b>650</b>, and its circuit, are preferably disposed on frame assembly <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Bump sensor assembly <b>650</b> preferably has a sensor <b>651</b>. Sensor <b>651</b> is preferably a thin piezoelectric element firmly mounted inside wall <b>32</b> of frame assembly <b>30</b>. Such element is typically used in piezoelectric buzzers, and may consist of a thin slice of piezoceramic material sandwiched between two electrical contact plates. When the piezoceramic element is stressed mechanically, it generates an electrical charge across the contact plates. Piezoelectric elements do not typically respond to steady-state stress.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Accordingly, when laser level <b>10</b> is bumped, the piezoceramic element is stressed, which in turn generates an electrical charge across the contact plates. An amplifier <b>652</b> with a preferably high input impedance may electrically buffer, low-pass filter and/or amplify the output of sensor <b>651</b>. A voltage at the amplifier output exceeding a predetermined threshold, such as approximately 70% of the circuit supply voltage, may trigger the timing circuit <b>653</b> to activate the alarms. Timing circuit <b>653</b> may include a flip-flop. Accordingly, if the amplifier output voltage is above the threshold, the flip-flop may be tripped and latched.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The timing circuit <b>653</b> then may cause a light emitting diode (LED) <b>656</b> to flash until manual reset button <b>654</b> is activated. Similarly, timing circuit <b>653</b> may disable motor <b>658</b> (which preferably is motor <b>424</b>) and/or may cause laser <b>657</b> (which preferably is laser diode module <b>415</b>) to flash. Such alarms would indicate to the user that the laser level <b>10</b> may be out of alignment. Again, the motor <b>658</b> and/or laser <b>657</b> may be reset when manual reset button <b>654</b> is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Bump sensor assembly <b>650</b> may also include a manual enable/disable button <b>655</b> for allowing the user to enable and/or disable the bump sensor as desired.</p>

<p id="p-0139" num="0138">It may be preferable to mount a mechanical amplifier assembly <b>660</b> unto sensor <b>651</b>. This is because piezoelectric sensor <b>651</b> typically responds only to high frequency strain caused by bumps or taps. The mechanical amplifier assembly <b>660</b> would increase the sensor's sensitivity to low frequencies by converting low frequency, i.e., slow, motions into high frequency taps which can be sensed by sensor <b>651</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The mechanical amplifier <b>660</b> preferably includes a base <b>661</b> disposed on the piezoelectric element or wall <b>32</b>, a shaft <b>662</b> extending therefrom, a spring <b>664</b> connected at one end to the end of shaft <b>662</b>, and a mass <b>663</b> connected to the other end of spring <b>664</b>. Preferably, spring <b>664</b> is trapped between head <b>662</b>H and trap <b>662</b>T of shaft <b>662</b>. Also, spring <b>664</b> may be trapped by mass <b>663</b> via screws <b>663</b>S.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Accordingly, mass <b>663</b> is preferably suspended by spring <b>664</b>. Preferably, shaft <b>662</b> extends through mass <b>663</b> so that mass <b>663</b> is centered along shaft <b>662</b>. This makes the system sensitive to disturbances in all lateral directions, which would cause mass <b>663</b> to tap shaft <b>662</b>, creating a high frequency tap. In addition, the shaft <b>662</b> may limit the motion of mass <b>663</b>, which prevents over-stretching of spring <b>664</b>. Mass <b>663</b> may also travel vertically along shaft <b>662</b> to make the sensor <b>651</b> sensitive to vertical motion. Preferably, mass <b>663</b> is disposed close to base <b>661</b> so that mass <b>663</b> can contact base <b>661</b> directly.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Referring to FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>11</b>-<b>13</b>, laser level <b>10</b> may be powered by a battery <b>60</b>. Battery <b>60</b> may be connected to laser level <b>10</b> via terminals <b>31</b>T. Frame assembly <b>30</b> may have an opening <b>31</b>F which allows protrusion <b>61</b> of battery <b>60</b> to enter frame assembly <b>30</b> and contact terminals <b>31</b>T.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Preferably, battery <b>60</b> is one that is used with other power tools. Persons skilled in the art are referred to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,391,972 and 5,144,217, which are wholly incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Preferably, an adapter assembly <b>70</b> is used to accept differently-shaped battery packs, especially those that may have the same terminal configuration, but different pack (<b>62</b>) or protrusion (<b>61</b>) shapes. Adapter assembly <b>70</b> may include a plate <b>71</b>, which is preferably made of plastic. Plate <b>71</b> may have two opposite curved sides, which have substantially the same radius. Plate <b>71</b> may have a flange <b>71</b>F on each of the curved sides. Flange <b>71</b>F may be disposed along about 55°-60° of each curved side. Preferably, flange <b>71</b>F is captured by capture walls <b>31</b>C in frame assembly <b>30</b>. Preferably, plate <b>71</b> has a pivot boss <b>71</b>P, which may be captured between two clamshell halves of frame assembly <b>30</b>, for allowing plate <b>71</b> to pivot thereabout.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Plate <b>71</b> may have a first opening <b>72</b> and a second opening <b>73</b>, which allow a first battery <b>60</b> and a second battery (not shown), respectively, to extend therethrough. Accordingly, if a user wants to insert a first battery, the user would align first opening <b>72</b> with opening <b>31</b>F. Alternatively, if the user wants to insert a second opening, the user would rotate plate <b>71</b> to align second opening <b>73</b> with opening <b>31</b>F.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Plate <b>71</b> may be provided with detent protrusions <b>71</b>D, which engage notches (not shown) disposed on frame assembly <b>30</b>. Detent protrusions <b>71</b>D may be disposed on tabs <b>71</b>T, which preferably resiliently bias protrusions <b>71</b>D towards engagement with the frame assembly notches. Accordingly, the two desired positions of plate <b>71</b> can easily be located.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Persons skilled in the art shall recognize that the protrusions and notches may alternatively be disposed on frame assembly <b>30</b> and plate <b>71</b>, respectively. Persons skilled in the art should also recognize that a spring can be used, instead of tabs <b>71</b>T, to bias protrusions <b>71</b>D towards the notches.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Plate <b>71</b> may also have latch notches <b>72</b>L, <b>73</b>L to engage the latches <b>63</b> of the first battery <b>60</b> and the second battery (not shown), respectively. Preferably, latch notches <b>72</b>L, <b>73</b>L are disposed so that they cannot engage the latches <b>63</b> of the second battery (not shown) and the first battery <b>60</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">A battery ejector assembly <b>74</b> may be provided to prevent the wrong battery, i.e., the one that cannot engage the proper latch notch, from contacting terminals <b>31</b>T. Battery ejector assembly <b>74</b> may include a button <b>74</b>B, which is biased by spring <b>74</b>S towards the battery pack. Preferably, button <b>74</b>B extends through pivot boss <b>71</b>B. A clip <b>71</b>C may trap button <b>74</b>B within pivot boss <b>71</b>B. Accordingly, button <b>74</b>B pushes the wrong battery pack away from pivot plate <b>71</b>, frame assembly <b>30</b> and terminals <b>31</b>T if the battery pack cannot engage the proper latch notch.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Another aspect of the invention is laser detector <b>500</b>. Light detectors have been heretofore applied in a variety of fields, which are constituted such that light rays are photoelectrically detected and a measurement result is displayed to measure the intensity of the light, a light-projected location, etc. For example, light detectors have widely been used in a surveying field, which are constructed such that a laser beam is ejected from a surveying instrument body and received at an object to be measured, and the center of the laser beam-projected location is located. In the light detectors of this kind, the light-receiving section for receiving the light and the display section for displaying the measurement results on the basis of a signal from the light-receiving section are ordinarily arranged together in the same plane.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">However, since the display section for displaying the measurement result and the light-receiving section are arranged in the same plane in the conventional light detectors thus constituted, a surveying person is required to stand exactly opposed to the display section to accurately read the measurement result. As a result, there occurred an extremely inconvenient problem that the measuring light entering the light-receiving section is interrupted by the surveying person himself.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Persons skilled in the art are hereby referred to U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,934,812 and 5,486,690, which are wholly incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">According to the present invention, the light detector <b>500</b> according to the present invention is used, for instance, in combination with a laser level <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the laser level <b>10</b> is placed on a tripod <b>11</b>. As the laser diode assembly <b>410</b> rotates around a perpendicular axis thereof, laser beam LB is emitted from the laser diode assembly <b>410</b> as a measuring light beam scanned in a horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The light detector <b>500</b> which is to receive the laser beam LB emitted from the laser level <b>10</b> is adapted to be attached to an appropriate upright face, such as a wall face, or a grade rod <b>504</b>, held by a user. The light detector <b>500</b> may be moved along the rod <b>504</b> to detect the height and the location of the center of the laser beam flux with reference to a standard plane F.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Thereby, the height and the location of a point or beam to be measured are measured by measuring the height and/or the location of the light detector <b>500</b>, or a standard horizontal plane in which the laser beam LB is to be scanned is determined by appropriately marking the center of the light flux of the laser beam LB on the grade rod <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A-C</figref> show the light detector <b>500</b> in detail. Light detector <b>500</b> may have a front face <b>501</b>F and a rear face <b>501</b>R. A light-receiving section <b>502</b> may be provided on front face <b>501</b>F for photoelectrically converting the light beam LB entering therein. Preferably, light-receiving section <b>502</b> recognizes changes in intensity, rather than the actual intensity, of the laser beam LB as it sweeps across light-receiving section <b>502</b>. A light-receiving face of the light-receiving section <b>502</b> may be contained in substantially the same plane as the front face <b>501</b>F.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In addition, display segments <b>503</b>F, <b>503</b>R may be respectively formed on front and rear faces <b>501</b>F, <b>501</b>R. Preferably, the displaying face of each of the display segments <b>503</b>F, <b>503</b>R is substantially coplanar to front and rear faces <b>501</b>F, <b>501</b>R, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The light-receiving section <b>502</b> may be constituted by a pair of upper and lower light-receiving segments <b>502</b>A. A boundary portion between the light-receiving segments <b>502</b>A, that is, the central position of the light-receiving section <b>502</b>, is a zone through which a standard horizontal plane of the laser beam LB is to pass. Light detector may have an operation switch <b>504</b> to be actuated when in use.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> shows a circuit construction of the light detector <b>500</b>. A pair of photoelectric elements <b>506</b> constituting the light-receiving segments <b>502</b>A may be connected to a processor <b>507</b>. Processor <b>507</b> is adapted to compare the magnitudes of received light amounts of the photoelectric elements <b>506</b> and to output a discrimination result thereof. The processor <b>507</b> may be connected to a display control unit <b>508</b>, which is adapted to select a display pattern in compliance with the output from the processor <b>507</b>. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that display control unit <b>508</b> may be integrated into processor <b>507</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The display control unit <b>508</b> may be connected to a display section <b>509</b> adapted to display the display pattern responsive to the output from the display control unit <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The following constitutes an exemplary use of the light detector <b>500</b>. While carefully observing an indication of the display section <b>509</b>, a surveying person moves the light detector <b>500</b> along grade rod <b>504</b> along a substantially vertical direction, which is substantially perpendicular to the substantially horizontal plane of the laser beam LB. At the same time, the center position of the laser beam LB is determined by the following procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32A</figref>, when the light flux of the laser beam LB equally enters both the light-receiving segments <b>502</b>A, that is, when the center of the light flux-passing zone P of the laser beam LB passes through an intermediate point between both the light-receiving segments <b>502</b>A, i.e., the center point <b>502</b>C of the light-receiving section <b>502</b>, a first display pattern H<b>1</b> may be indicated in the display section <b>503</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33A</figref>) to show that the center of the light flux of the laser beam LB coincides with the center point <b>502</b>C of the light-receiving section <b>502</b> of the light detector <b>500</b>. Preferably, detector <b>500</b> will have notches or tabs <b>503</b>T disposed thereon to indicate to the user where center point <b>502</b>C is relative to the light detector <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32B</figref>, when the light flux-passing zone P of the laser beam LB is deviated into the upper light-receiving segment <b>502</b>A, a second display pattern H<b>2</b> may be indicated in the display section <b>503</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33B</figref>) to show that the center of the light flux of the laser beam LB deviates above the center point <b>502</b>C of the light receiving section <b>502</b>. Therefore, in this case, the light detector <b>500</b> should be moved upwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32C</figref>, when the light flux-passing zone P of the laser beam LB deviates into the lower light-receiving segment <b>502</b>A, a third display pattern H<b>3</b> may be indicated in the display section <b>503</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33C</figref>) to show that the center of the light flux of the laser beam LB deviates under the center point <b>502</b>C of the light-receiving section <b>502</b> of the light detector <b>500</b>. Therefore, in this case, the light detector <b>500</b> should be moved downward.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Persons skilled in the art will recognize that, in each of the above cases, the surveying person M can read the beam incidence results (the display patterns H<b>1</b>, H<b>2</b>, and H<b>3</b>) indicated in the display section <b>503</b> on either front face <b>501</b>F or rear face <b>501</b>R. Therefore, the measurement could be accurately performed from any direction without fear of the interruption of the measuring light beam as occurred in the conventional detectors. Thus, the present invention largely contributes to the prevention of measuring errors and enhancement of the measuring efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, laser detector <b>500</b> may have a sound control unit <b>510</b> that responds to the output of processor <b>507</b>. Sound control unit <b>510</b> may control a speaker <b>511</b> and/or a piezoelectric element <b>512</b>. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that sound control unit <b>510</b> may be integrated into processor <b>507</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Such arrangement provides an aural feedback to the surveying person. For example, processor <b>507</b> and/or sound control unit <b>510</b> may be programmed so that speaker <b>511</b> and/or piezoelectric element <b>512</b> will sound only when the center of the light flux-passing zone P of the laser beam LB passes through the center point <b>502</b>C of the light-receiving section <b>502</b>. In addition, processor <b>507</b> and/or sound control unit <b>510</b> may be programmed so that speaker <b>511</b> and/or piezoelectric element <b>512</b> will provide a different sound when laser beam LB passes outside center point <b>502</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In addition, laser detector <b>500</b> may have a signal generator <b>513</b> for generating a signal indicating that the laser beam LB has reached detector <b>500</b>. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that the signal generator <b>513</b> may react to the output of processor <b>507</b>, and/or may be integrated into processor <b>507</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The signal generated by signal generator <b>513</b> may be transmitted via an RF transmitter <b>514</b>, a light source <b>515</b>, or any other kind of transmitter <b>516</b>, including, but not limited to, audio transmitter, microwave transmitter, infrared transmitter, etc. For example, transmitter <b>516</b> may have an infrared source <b>505</b>, which converts the signal to be transmitted into infrared light. The resulting transmission is then sent towards laser level <b>10</b>, which may be received by receptor <b>10</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">When laser level <b>10</b> receives the transmission, the laser level <b>10</b> will oscillate shaft <b>219</b> (and laser diode module <b>415</b>), thus oscillating laser beam LB. Preferably, laser level <b>10</b> will oscillate laser beam LB so that it forms an angle Z, which encloses laser detector <b>500</b>. Angle Z may be between about 1° and about 180°. Accordingly, a user that is only interested in indicating a part of the laser beam plane can now do so by placing a laser detector <b>500</b> in the desired portion of the plane.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Preferably, laser level <b>10</b> will have a control knob <b>10</b>CK for controlling the amplitude of angle Z. Alternatively, laser level <b>10</b> could just reverse the rotational direction of shaft <b>419</b> when it receives the transmission. Laser detector <b>500</b> may have a delay programmed between the time laser beam LB contacts the detector <b>500</b> and the time it sends the transmission to laser level <b>10</b>. This would allow the laser beam LB to move past laser detector <b>500</b> before laser level <b>10</b> reverses direction. This generates an arc with an angle Z that could be adjusted by changing the delay time or the rotational velocity of the shaft <b>419</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Laser level <b>10</b> could be programmed to ignore every n<sup>th </sup>transmission, e.g., every third transmission. Accordingly, the laser level <b>10</b> would rotate past laser detector <b>500</b>, reverse its direction and rotate past laser detector <b>500</b>, and reverse its direction and rotate past laser detector <b>500</b> for a third time. Rather than reverse a third time, laser level <b>10</b> would continue rotating shaft <b>419</b> until it contacts laser detector <b>500</b>, or a second laser detector. Accordingly, laser level <b>10</b> would highlight one laser detector <b>500</b>, then the other, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Persons skilled in the art may recognize other alternatives to the means disclosed herein. However, all these additions and/or alterations are considered to be equivalents of the present invention.</p>
