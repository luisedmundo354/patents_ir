<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A pair of swimming/diving goggles includes a goggle body, a buckle, and a head strap. A wall delimiting a through-hole in the goggle body includes a pressing face. A pin is mounted to the buckle. An end of the head strap extends through the through-hole, a gap between the pin and an inner face of the buckle, and then extending through the through-hole again. When an outer portion of the head strap is pulled and then released, a clamping force provided by an inner portion of the head strap moves the pin to a position in which the head strap is tightly clamped between the pin and the pressing face. When the buckle is moved toward an inner end of the through-hole, a gap between the pin and the pressing face becomes larger to allow loosening of the head strap.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a length-adjusting device for a head strap. More particularly, the present invention relates to a length-adjusting device for a head strap of a pair of swimming/diving goggles.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A pair of typical swimming/diving goggles includes a buckle mounted to each side of a body of the pair of swimming/diving goggles or to a head strap at a location behind the head of the wearer to allow adjustment of the length of the head strap. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a pair of swimming/diving goggles using a conventional buckle <b>1</b>′ to adjust the length of a head strap <b>3</b>′. The rigid buckle <b>1</b>′ includes a connecting portion <b>11</b>′ on an end thereof for connecting with the body <b>2</b>′ of the pair of swimming/diving goggles. A tying portion <b>12</b>′ is provided on the other end of the buckle <b>1</b>′ and includes two posts <b>121</b>′ and <b>122</b>′. The head strap <b>3</b>′ is wound around the posts <b>121</b>′ and <b>122</b>′ for fixing the length of the head strap <b>3</b>′. Adjustment of the length of the head strap <b>3</b>′ is not easy, as the user has to loosen the head strap <b>3</b>′ from the posts <b>121</b>′ and <b>122</b>′. Further, the buckle <b>1</b>′ is separate from the body <b>2</b>′ and thus could not provide an integral appearance. Further, the connecting portion <b>11</b>′ is liable to disengage from the body <b>2</b>′ when subjected to external impact. Further, the rigid buckle <b>1</b>′ is in tight contact with a side of the user's head and thus causes discomfort. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a buckle for a pair of swimming/diving goggles disclosed in Applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 6,691,378. The buckle comprises a body <b>4</b>′ having a pressing portion <b>41</b>′, a clamping portion <b>42</b>′, and a connecting portion <b>43</b>′ connecting the pressing portion <b>41</b>′ with the clamping portion <b>42</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The pressing portion <b>41</b>′ includes a post <b>411</b>′ and a release section <b>412</b>′ on an end thereof. An end of the clamping portion <b>42</b>′ includes a clamping hole <b>421</b>′ through which a head strap <b>5</b>′ extends. A retaining edge <b>422</b>′ is formed on a top edge of each lateral wall delimiting the clamping hole <b>421</b>′ for retaining the head strap <b>5</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In assembly, the connecting portion <b>43</b>′ is wound around a body <b>6</b>′ of the pair of swimming/diving goggles, with the pressing portion <b>41</b>′ pressing against an outer side of the body <b>6</b>′. An end of the head strap <b>5</b>′ is extended through the clamping hole <b>421</b>′ and wound around the post <b>411</b>′ and then extended out of the body <b>6</b>′ via the clamping hole <b>421</b>′. The distal end of the head strap <b>5</b>′ can be pulled until the required tightness and length of the head strap <b>5</b>′ are obtained, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, when loosening the head strap <b>5</b>′, the pressing portion <b>41</b>′ is moved until the post <b>411</b>′ is disengaged from the retaining edge <b>422</b>′. An inner portion <b>52</b>′ of the head strap <b>5</b>′ can be moved to loosen the head strap <b>5</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although the buckle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref> allows easy adjustment and provides stable clamping, the buckle body <b>4</b>′ is separate from the body <b>6</b>′ of the pair of swimming/diving goggles and thus could not provide an integral appearance. Further, the inner side of the clamping portion <b>42</b>′ of the buckle body <b>4</b>′ is in tight contact with a side of the user's head and thus causes discomfort.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref> illustrate a pair of swimming/diving goggles disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,446,272. The pair of dimming/diving goggles comprises a pair of lens parts <b>71</b>′, a pair of lens frames <b>72</b>′, two separate buckle assemblies, and an elastic strap <b>75</b>′. Each buckle assembly includes a buckle body <b>73</b>′ having a strap-supporting portion <b>731</b>′ around which the strap <b>75</b>′ is wrapped, and a slider <b>74</b>′ which is slidable between a first position (see FIG. <b>14</b>) and a second position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) with respect to the strap-supporting portion <b>731</b>′. When the slider <b>74</b>′ is moved toward the buckle body <b>73</b>′, a strap-pressing piece <b>741</b>′ of the slider <b>74</b>′ presses against the strap <b>75</b>′, and an end <b>742</b>′ of the strap-pressing piece <b>741</b>′ is engaged with a transverse ridge <b>751</b>′ on the strap <b>75</b>′, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. On the other hand, when the slider <b>74</b>′ is moved away from the buckle body <b>73</b>′, the strap-pressing piece <b>741</b>′ no longer presses the strap <b>75</b>′ and thus allows adjustment to the length of the strap <b>75</b>′, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The strap <b>75</b>′ is fixed by moving the slider <b>74</b>′ inward. However, when an excessive pulling force is applied to the strap <b>75</b>′, the slider <b>74</b>′ slides and thus could not provide a reliable pressing/positioning effect to the strap <b>75</b>′. Further, the buckle body <b>73</b>′ and the slider <b>74</b>′ are separate from each other and have to be coupled with the lens parts <b>71</b>′ and lens frames <b>72</b>′, resulting in troublesome assembly. Further, the assembled buckle body <b>73</b>′ and slider <b>74</b>′ may be disengaged from the lens parts <b>71</b>′ and lens frames <b>72</b>′ when subjected to impact.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a pair of swimming/diving goggles disclosed in Taiwan Utility Model Publication No. M263132. The pair of swimming/diving goggles includes two separate buckle members <b>81</b>′ and <b>82</b>′ for coupling with a body <b>83</b>′ of the pair of swimming/diving goggles. The buckle member <b>82</b>′ includes a transverse rod <b>821</b>′ around which a head strap <b>84</b>′ is wound. The buckle member <b>81</b>′ includes a resilient piece <b>811</b>′ and a positioning block <b>812</b>′ that can be biased by the resilient piece <b>811</b>′ to press against the head strap <b>84</b>′ at an end. The positioning block <b>812</b>′ can be pressed to disengage from the head strap <b>84</b>′ for adjusting the length of the head strap <b>84</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, the head strap <b>84</b>′ could not be reliably positioned when the resilient piece <b>81</b>″ fatigues. Further, troublesome assembling is required, as there are many elements involved. Further, the buckle members <b>81</b>′ and <b>82</b>′ are separate from the body <b>83</b>′ of the pair of swimming/diving goggles and thus could be disengaged from the body <b>83</b>′ when subjected to impact.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A pair of swimming/diving goggles in accordance with the present invention comprises a goggle body, a buckle, and a head strap. The goggle body comprises an end including a coupling section that has a through-hole. A wall delimiting the through-hole includes a pressing face. The buckle comprises a buckle body including two lateral sides and an inner face. Two lugs respectively extend from the lateral sides of the buckle body. A pin extends between the lugs. A first gap is defined between the pin and an inner face of the buckle body. A second gap is defined between the pin and the pressing face of the goggle body when the buckle is mounted to the goggle body.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The head strap is made of soft material and comprises an end extending from an inner side of the goggle body through the through-hole of the goggle body, the first gap, and then extending back to the inner side of the goggle body via the through-hole, with the head strap including an outer portion and an inner portion after assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">When the outer portion of the head strap is pulled by a wearer, the head strap is tightened to a head of the wearer, and when the outer portion of the head strap is released, a clamping force provided by the inner portion of the head strap moves the pin to a position in which the head strap is tightly clamped between the pin and the pressing face.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">When the buckle is moved toward an inner end of the through-hole, the second gap between the pin and the pressing face becomes larger to allow loosening of the head strap. Preferably, the buckle body covers the through-hole.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, another wall delimiting the through-hole of the goggle body comprises an abutting face. Each of the lugs comprises an abutting face. A space is defined between the abutting faces of the lugs and the abutting face of the goggle body and allows movement of the buckle body.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the end of the head strap comprises a first, outer protrusion and a second, inner protrusion spaced from the first, outer protrusion. The second, inner protrusion has a height greater than that of the first, outer protrusion. The first, outer protrusion and the second, inner protrusion flex and pass through the first gap between the pin and the inner face of the buckle body when the end of the head strap is passed through the first gap. The first, outer protrusion only allows slight flexure of the second, inner protrusion and thus prevents the head strap to move in a reverse direction after the second, inner protrusion has passed through the first gap.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, the head strap further comprises a plurality of teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Other objectives, advantages, and novel features of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a pair of swimming/diving goggles in accordance with the present invention comprises a goggle body <b>1</b>, two buckles <b>2</b> (only one is shown in the drawings), and a head strap <b>3</b>. The goggle body <b>1</b> comprises a coupling section <b>11</b> on each of two sides thereof for coupling with an associated one of the buckles <b>2</b>. Each coupling section <b>11</b> comprises a through-hole <b>12</b> through which an end of the head strap <b>3</b> is extends and folded in two. Two opposite walls delimiting the through-hole <b>12</b> respectively include a pressing face <b>13</b> and an inclined abutting face <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Each buckle <b>2</b> is made of rigid material and comprises a buckle body <b>21</b> that covers an associated one of the through-holes <b>12</b> of the goggle body <b>1</b>. The buckle body <b>21</b> comprises an anti-slide outer face <b>22</b>. The buckle body <b>21</b> further comprises two lugs <b>23</b> respectively extending from two lateral sides thereof. The lugs <b>23</b> include aligned holes <b>25</b> through which a pin <b>26</b> extends. Each lug <b>23</b> includes an abutting face <b>24</b> facing the abutting face <b>14</b> of an associated side of the goggle <b>1</b>. A gap <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) exists between the pin <b>26</b> and an inner face of the buckle body <b>21</b> to allow passage of the head strap <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the buckle <b>2</b> is mounted to an associated side of the goggle body <b>1</b>, a gap <b>27</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is extended between the pin <b>26</b> and the associated pressing face <b>13</b> of the goggle body <b>1</b> to allow passage of the head strap <b>3</b>, and a space <b>29</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is defined between the abutting faces <b>24</b> of the lugs <b>23</b> of the buckle <b>2</b> and the associated abutting face <b>14</b> of the goggles <b>1</b>, allowing movement of the buckle <b>2</b> in the space <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The head strap <b>3</b> is made of soft material and includes a first, outer protrusion <b>31</b> and a second, inner protrusion <b>32</b> on each of two ends thereof. The second inner protrusion <b>32</b> is spaced from the first, outer protrusion <b>31</b> and has a height greater than that of first, outer protrusion <b>31</b>. The head strap <b>3</b> further includes a plurality of ridges <b>33</b> on an outer face thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref>, in assembly, an end of the head strap <b>3</b> is extended from an inner side of the goggle body <b>1</b> through an associated through-hole <b>12</b>, the gap <b>28</b> between the pin <b>26</b> of the associated buckle <b>2</b> and the inner face of the associated buckle <b>2</b> and then extended back to the inner side of the goggle body <b>1</b> via the associated through-hole <b>12</b>. When extending the end of the head strap <b>3</b> through the gap <b>28</b> between the pin <b>26</b> of the associated buckle <b>2</b> and the inner face of the associated buckle <b>2</b>, the protrusions <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> of the head strap <b>3</b> flex and thus pass through the gap <b>28</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. After the protrusions <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> have passed through the gap <b>28</b>, movement of the head strap <b>3</b> in the reverse direction is not allowed. This is because the first, outer protrusion <b>31</b> only allows slight flexure of the second, inner protrusion <b>32</b>. Hence, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the second, inner protrusion <b>32</b> is stopped by the end face of the buckle body <b>21</b> and thus prevents reverse movement of the head strap <b>3</b>. Improved assembling stability is thus provided.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when wearing the pair of swimming/diving goggles in accordance with the present invention, the buckle <b>2</b> is moved by the pulling force applied to the head strap <b>3</b> to a position covering the through-hole <b>12</b> of the goggle body <b>1</b>. The buckle <b>2</b> is not in contact with the head of the wearer, thereby providing wearing comfort. Further, adjustment of the length of the head strap <b>3</b> is achieved while pulling an outer portion <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the head strap <b>3</b>. The pin <b>26</b> may pivot during pulling of the head strap <b>3</b> to allow smooth pulling operation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the outer portion <b>34</b> of the head strap <b>3</b> is released, a clamping force provided by the inner portion <b>35</b> of the head strap <b>3</b> moves the pin <b>26</b> (and the buckle <b>2</b>) to move toward an outer end of the through-hole <b>12</b> along a direction indicated by the arrow. The head strap <b>3</b> is thus tightly clamped between the pin <b>26</b> and the pressing sidewall <b>13</b> of the goggle body <b>1</b> to thereby fix the length of the head strap <b>3</b>. The teeth <b>33</b> of the head strap <b>3</b> enhance the clamping effect. The greater the clamping force is, the greater travel of the pin <b>26</b> and the buckle <b>2</b> has, and the tighter the head strap <b>3</b> is clamped. The clamping reliability is thus improved.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In brief, the head strap <b>3</b> is tightened to a head of a wearer when the outer portion <b>34</b> of the head strap <b>3</b> is pulled.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when releasing the head strap <b>3</b> is required, the wear moves the buckle <b>2</b> toward an inner end of the associated through-hole <b>12</b> by the anti-slide outer face <b>22</b> of the buckle body <b>21</b>. Displacement of the buckle <b>2</b> is limited by the abutting faces <b>24</b> of the buckle <b>2</b> and the abutting face <b>14</b> of the goggle body <b>1</b>. The gap <b>27</b> between the pin <b>26</b> and the pressing face <b>13</b> becomes larger and thus allows adjustment of the length (loosening) of the head strap <b>3</b> by pulling the inner portion <b>35</b> of the head strap <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, after assembly, the buckle <b>2</b> is mounted in the coupling section <b>11</b> of the goggle body <b>1</b>, with the lugs <b>23</b> located in the through-hole <b>12</b>, providing an integral design while preventing the buckle <b>2</b> from abutting against the wearer's head. The wearing comfort is improved. Further, the cost of the pair of swimming/diving goggles is cut, as fewer elements are used. Further, disengagement of the head strap <b>3</b> and the buckle <b>2</b> is difficult after assembly. Namely, the buckle <b>2</b> can be reliably mounted to the goggle body <b>1</b> while allowing easy adjustment of the length of the head strap <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The pin <b>26</b> can be fixed between the lugs <b>23</b> of the buckle <b>1</b> without pivotal movement. Further, the teeth <b>33</b> of the head strap <b>3</b> can be omitted. Further, the pair of swimming/diving goggle may include only one buckle mounted to only one side of the goggle body <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described, numerous modifications and variations are still possible without departing from the essence of the invention. The scope of the invention is limited by the accompanying claims.</p>
