<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates generally to lighting, and more particularly to a ceramic discharge chamber for a discharge lamp, such as a ceramic metal halide lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Discharge lamps produce light by ionizing a filler material such as a mixture of metal halides and mercury with an electric arc passing between two electrodes. The electrodes and the filler material are sealed within a translucent or transparent discharge chamber which maintains the pressure of the energized filler material and allows the emitted light to pass through it. The filler material, also known as a “dose”, emits a desired spectral energy distribution in response to being excited by the electric arc. For example, halides provide spectral energy distributions that offer a broad choice of light properties, e.g. color temperatures, color renderings, and luminous efficacies.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventionally, the discharge chamber in a discharge lamp was formed from a vitreous material such as fused quartz, which was shaped into desired chamber geometries after being heated to a softened state. Fused quartz, however, has certain disadvantages which arise from its reactive properties at high operating temperatures. For example, in a quartz lamp, at temperatures greater than about 950-1000° C., the halide filling reacts with the glass to produce silicates and silicon halide, which results in depletion of the filler constituents. Elevated temperatures also cause sodium to permeate through the quartz wall, which causes depletion of the filler. Both depletions cause color shift over time, which reduces the useful lifetime of the lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although quartz lamps can be operated below 950° C. for increased lifetime, the quality of the light produced is compromised, because the light properties produced by the lamp depend on the operating temperature of the discharge chamber. The higher the temperature, the better the color rendering, the smaller the color spread lamp to lamp, and the higher the efficacy.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Ceramic discharge chambers were developed to operate at higher temperatures for improved color temperatures, color renderings, and luminous efficacies, while significantly reducing reactions with the filler material. European Patent Application No. 0 587 238 A1, for example, discloses a high pressure discharge lamp which includes a discharge chamber made of a ceramic such as translucent gastight aluminum oxide. Typically, ceramic discharge chambers are constructed from a number of parts which are extruded or die pressed from a ceramic powder. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>e </i>illustrate five parts which are used to construct a ceramic discharge chamber for a metal halide lamp. The two end plugs with a central bore in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>d </i>are fabricated by die pressing a mixture comprising a ceramic powder and an organic binder. The central cylinder (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>) and the two legs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>e</i>) are produced by extruding a ceramic powder/binder mixture through a die. Assembly of the discharge chamber involves the placement and tacking of the legs to the end plugs, and the end plugs into the ends of the central cylinder. This final assembly is then sintered to form four cosintered joints which are bonded by controlled shrinkage of the individual parts.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The conventional ceramic discharge chamber and method of construction depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>e, </i>however, have a number of disadvantages. For example, the number of component parts is relatively large and introduces a corresponding number of opportunities for variation and defects. Also, the conventional discharge chamber includes four bonding regions, each of which introduces an opportunity for lamp failure by leakage of the filler material if the bond is formed improperly. Each bonding area also introduces a region of relative weakness, so that even if the bond is formed properly, the bond may break during handling or be damaged enough in handling to induce failure in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another disadvantage relates to the precision with which the parts can be assembled and the resulting effect on the light quality. It is known that the light quality is dependent to a substantial extent on the voltage across the electrode gap, which in turn is dependent upon the size of the gap. For example, in 70 watt metal halide lamp, a difference in 1 mm in the gap size produces a voltage difference of about 12-15 volts, which significantly affects the light quality. The number of parts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>e </i>makes it difficult to consistently achieve a gap size within an acceptable tolerance without significant effort devoted to optimizing the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It would be desirable, therefore, to have a ceramic discharge chamber for a discharge lamp which could be manufactured precisely to achieve consistently high quality light, while reducing the opportunities for manufacturing defects to occur.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A ceramic discharge chamber for a lamp, according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, comprises a first member which includes a leg portion and a transition portion, wherein the leg portion and the transition portion are integrally formed as one piece from a ceramic material, and a second member which includes a body portion, wherein the body portion is bonded to the transition portion of the first member. The ceramic discharge chamber can be formed by injection molding a ceramic material to form the first member, the first member forming a first portion of the ceramic discharge chamber, and bonding the first member to a second member which forms a second portion of the ceramic discharge chamber. The second member may be an extruded cylinder to which is bonded a third member comprising another leg portion and transition portion. Alternately, the second member may comprise a body portion, a transition portion, and a leg portion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The members which form the ceramic discharge chamber can greatly facilitate assembly of the chamber, because the discharge chamber can be constructed with only one or two bonds between the members. The reduction in the number of bonds also has the advantages of reducing the number of potential bond defects during manufacturing, and reducing the possibility of breakage of the discharge chamber at a bond region during handling. One or more of the members may also include a radially directed flange which allows the members to be precisely aligned during assembly to improve the quality of the lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Exemplary embodiments of the invention can be used to improve the performance of various types of lamps, such as metal halide lamps, high pressure mercury vapor lamps, high pressure sodium vapor lamps, and white high pressure sodium lamps.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a discharge lamp <b>10</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention The discharge lamp <b>10</b> includes a discharge chamber <b>50</b> which contains two electrodes <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> and a filler material. The electrodes <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are connected to conductors <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> which apply a potential difference across the electrodes. In operation, the electrodes <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> produce an arc which ionizes the filler material to produce a plasma in the discharge chamber <b>50</b>. The emission characteristics of the light produced by the plasma depend primarily on the constituents of the filler material, the voltage across the electrodes, the temperature distribution of the chamber, the pressure in the chamber, and the geometry of the chamber. For a ceramic metal halide lamp, the filler material typically comprises a mixture of Hg, a rare gas such as Ar or Xe, and a metal halide such as NaI, lII, or DyI<sub>3</sub>. For a high pressure sodium lamp, the filler material typically comprises Na, a rare gas, and Hg. Other examples of filler materials are well known in the art. See, for example, Alexander Dobrusskin, Review of Metal Halide Lamps, 4th Annual International Symposium on Science and Technology of Light Sources (1986).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the discharge chamber <b>50</b> comprises a central body portion <b>60</b> and two leg portions <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>. The ends of the electrodes <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are typically located near the opposite ends of the body portion <b>60</b>. The electrodes are connected to a power supply by the conductors <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, which are disposed within a central bore of each leg portion <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>. The electrodes typically comprise tungsten and are about 3-4 mm in length. The conductors typically comprise niobium and molybdenum which have thermal expansion coefficients close to that of alumina to reduce thermally induced stresses on the alumina leg portions <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The discharge chamber <b>50</b> is sealed at the ends of the leg portions <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> with seals <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>. The seals <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> typically comprise a dysprosia-alumina-silica glass and can be formed by placing a glass frit in the shape of a ring around one of the conductors, e.g. <b>56</b>, aligning the discharge chamber <b>50</b> vertically, and melting the frit. The melted glass then flows down into the leg <b>62</b>, forming a seal between the conductor <b>56</b> and the leg <b>62</b>. The discharge chamber is then turned upside down to seal the other leg <b>64</b> after being filled with the filler material. The leg portions <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are provided to lower the temperature of the seals <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> during operation, e.g. to about 600° C., so that the filler material does not react with the glass seals <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The leg portions <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> extend axially away from the center of the discharge chamber <b>50</b>. The dimensions of the leg portions <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are selected to lower the temperature of the seals <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> by a desired amount with respect to the center of the discharge chamber <b>50</b>. For example, in a 70 watt lamp, the leg portions have a length of about 10-15 mm, an inner diameter of about 0.8-1.0 mm, and an outer diameter of about 2.5-3.0 mm to lower the temperature at the seals <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> to about 600-700° C., which is about 400° C. less than the temperature at the center of the discharge chamber. In a 35 watt lamp, the leg portions have a length of about 10-15 mm, an inner diameter of about 0.7-0.8 mm, and an outer diameter of about 2.0-2.5 mm. In a 150 watt lamp, the leg portions have a length of about 12-15 mm, an inner diameter of about 0.9-1.1 mm, and an outer diameter of about 2.5-3.0 mm. These dimensions, and others throughout the specification, are of course given as examples and are not intended to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The body portion <b>60</b> of the discharge chamber is typically substantially cylindrical. For a 70 watt lamp, the body portion typically has an inner diameter of about 7 mm and outer diameter of about 8.5 mm. For a 35 watt lamp, the body portion typically has an inner diameter of about 5 mm and outer diameter of about 6.5 mm. For a 150 watt lamp, the body portion typically has an inner diameter of about 9.5 mm and outer diameter of about 11.5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>illustrate two components of a discharge chamber according to a first exemplary embodiment of the invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, a body member <b>100</b> is depicted which includes a body portion <b>102</b>, a transition portion <b>104</b>, and a leg portion <b>106</b>. The transition portion <b>104</b> connects the relatively narrow leg portion <b>106</b> to the wider body portion <b>102</b>, and may be generally in the shape of a disc. The leg portion <b>106</b> and the transition portion <b>104</b> both include a central bore <b>107</b> which houses the electrode and the conductor (not shown). The body portion <b>102</b> defines a chamber in which the electrodes produce a light-emitting plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>, the leg member <b>110</b> is depicted which includes a leg portion <b>112</b> and a transition portion <b>114</b>. Both the leg portion <b>112</b> and the transition portion <b>114</b> include a central bore <b>109</b> which houses the second electrode and the conductor. The transition portion <b>114</b> may be generally in the form of a plug which fits inside the end of the body member <b>100</b>. The transition portion <b>114</b> typically has a circumference which is greater than the circumference of the leg portion <b>112</b>. The transition portion <b>114</b> typically includes a radially directed flange <b>115</b> which projects radially outwardly from the transition portion <b>114</b>. The radially directed flange <b>115</b> provides a shoulder <b>117</b> which rests against the end <b>119</b> of the body member <b>100</b> during assembly to fix the relative axial position of the leg member <b>110</b> with respect to the body member <b>100</b>. “Axial” refers to an axis through the central bores <b>107</b>, <b>109</b> of the leg portions <b>106</b>, <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The radially directed flange <b>115</b> provides the advantage that the total length of the assembled discharge chamber, e.g. measured from the end <b>118</b> of the body member <b>100</b> to the opposite end <b>116</b> of the leg member <b>110</b>, can be maintained to within a tight dimensional tolerance. The total length of the discharge chamber typically affects the separation between the electrodes, since the electrodes are typically referenced to the ends <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> of the leg portions <b>112</b>, <b>106</b> during assembly. For example, the conductor may be crimped at a fixed distance from the end of the electrode, which crimp rests against the end of the leg portion to fix the axial position of the electrode with respect to the leg portion. Because the axial position of the electrodes is fixed with respect to the leg portions, the separation of the electrodes is determined by the position of the leg member <b>110</b> with respect to the body member <b>100</b>, which can be precisely controlled by the radially directed flange <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The separation between the electrodes in turn affects the voltage drop across the electrodes, which can have a significant effect on the quality of light produced. The radially directed flange <b>115</b> thus allows the electrodes to be consistently positioned to have a precise separation distance, which improves the consistency and quality of the light produced. By contrast, in the conventional design of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>e </i>which includes five individual parts, the relative axial position of the legs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>e</i>) is subject to variation during assembly, because there is no mechanism to fix the relative axial position of the legs.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To quantify the advantage of the radially directed flange <b>115</b>, standard deviations were calculated for the total length of 30 randomly selected conventional discharge chambers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>e</i>) and the total length of 30 randomly selected discharge chambers assembled from the components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c</i>. The standard deviation for the total length of the conventional discharge chamber was +/−0.22 mm, whereas the standard deviation for the total length of discharge chambers assembled from the components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c </i>was +/−0.06 mm. These length variations translate into voltage standard deviations of 3.3 volts for the conventional design and only 0.9 volts for the design shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, the body member <b>100</b> and the leg member <b>110</b> are each preferably formed as a single piece of a ceramic material such as alumina, rather than being assembled from a number of sub-parts. In this way, there are no bond regions between the various portions of the body member <b>100</b> and the leg member <b>110</b>. For example, there is preferably no bond region between the leg portion <b>106</b> and the transition portion <b>104</b>, or between the transition portion <b>104</b> and the body portion <b>102</b> of the body member <b>100</b>. Similarly, there is preferably no bond region between the leg portion <b>112</b> and the transition portion <b>114</b> of the leg member <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The exemplary body and leg members <b>100</b>, <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>can greatly facilitate manufacturing of the discharge chamber, since the body member <b>100</b> includes a leg portion <b>106</b>, a transition portion <b>104</b>, and a body portion <b>102</b> formed as a single piece, and the leg member <b>110</b> includes a leg portion <b>112</b>, a transition portion <b>114</b>, and a radially directed flange <b>115</b> formed as a single piece. The components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>allow the discharge chamber to be constructed with a single bond between the leg member <b>110</b> and the body member <b>100</b>, whereas the five conventional components of the discharge chamber shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>e </i>require four bonds to be made. The reduction in the number of bonds has the advantages of expediting assembly of the discharge chamber, reducing the number of potential bond defects during manufacturing, and reducing the possibility of breakage of the discharge chamber at a bond region during handling.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The body member <b>100</b> and the leg member <b>110</b> can be constructed by die pressing a mixture of a ceramic powder and a binder into a solid cylinder. Typically, the mixture comprises 95-98% by weight ceramic powder and 2-5% by weight organic binder. The ceramic powder may comprise alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) having a purity of at least 99.98% and a surface area of about 2-10 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The alumina powder may be doped with magnesia to inhibit grain growth, for example in an amount equal to 0.03%-0.2%, preferably 0.05%, by weight of the alumina. Other ceramic materials which may be used include non reactive refractory oxides and oxynitrides such as yttrium oxide, lutecium oxide, and hafnium oxide and their solid solutions and compounds with alumina such as yttrium-aluminum-garnet and aluminum oxynitride. Binders which may be used individually or in combination include organic polymers such as polyols, polyvinyl alcohol, vinyl acetates, acrylates, cellulosics and polyesters.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A exemplary composition which has been used for die pressing a solid cylinder comprises 97% by weight alumina powder having a surface area of 7 m<sup>2</sup>/g, available from Baikowski International, Charlotte, N.C. as product number CR7. The alumina powder was doped with magnesia in the amount of 0.1% of the weight of the alumina. The composition also comprised 2.5% by weight polyvinyl alcohol, available from GE Lighting as product number 115-009-018, and ½% by weight Carbowax 600, available from Interstate Chemical.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Subsequent to die pressing, the binder is removed from the green part, typically by thermal pyrolysis, to form a bisque-fired part. The thermal pyrolysis may be conducted, for example, by heating the green part in air from room temperature to a maximum temperature of about 900-1100° C. over 4-8 hours, then holding the maximum temperature for 1-5 hours, and then cooling the part. After thermal pyrolysis, the porosity of the bisque-fired part is typically about 40-50%.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The bisque-fired part is then machined. For example, a small bore may be drilled along the axis of the solid cylinder which provides the bore <b>107</b> of the leg portion <b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>. Next a larger diameter bore may be drilled along a portion of the axis to form the chamber <b>101</b>. Finally, the outer portion of the originally solid cylinder may be machined away along part of the axis, for example with a lathe, to form the outer surface of the leg portion <b>106</b>. The leg member <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b </i>may be formed in a similar manner by first drilling a small bore which provides the bore <b>109</b> through the leg portion <b>112</b>, machining the outer portion of the originally solid cylinder to produce the leg portion <b>112</b>, and machining the transition portion <b>114</b>, leaving the radially directed flange <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The machined parts <b>100</b>, <b>110</b> are typically assembled prior to sintering to allow the sintering step to bond the parts together. According to an exemplary method of bonding, the densities of the bisque-fired parts used to form the body member <b>100</b> and the leg member <b>110</b> are selected to achieve different degrees of shrinkage during the sintering step. The different densities of the bisque-fired parts may be achieved by using ceramic powders having different surface areas. For example, the surface area of the ceramic powder used to form the body member <b>100</b> may be 6-10 m<sup>2</sup>/g, while the surface area of the ceramic powder used to form the leg member <b>110</b> may be 2-3 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The finer powder in the body member <b>100</b> causes the bisque-fired body member <b>100</b> to have a smaller density than the bisque-fired leg member <b>110</b> made from the coarser powder. The bisque-fired density of the body member <b>100</b> is typically 42-44% of the theoretical density of alumina (3.986 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), and the bisque-fired density of the leg member <b>110</b> is typically 50-60% of the theoretical density of alumina. Because the bisque-fired body member <b>100</b> is less dense than the bisque-fired leg member <b>110</b>, the body portion <b>102</b> shrinks to a greater degree (e.g. 3-10%) during sintering than the transition portion <b>114</b> to form a seal around the transition portion <b>114</b>. By assembling the two components <b>100</b>, <b>110</b> prior to sintering, the sintering step bonds the two components together to form a discharge chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sintering step may be carried out by heating the bisque-fired parts in hydrogen having a dew point of about 10-15° C. Typically the temperature is increased from room temperature to about 1300° C. over a two hour period. Next, the temperature is held at about 1300° C. for about 2 hours. Next, the temperature is increased by about 100° C. per hour up to a maximum temperature of about 1850-1880° C. Next, the temperature is held at 1850-1880° C. for about 3-5 hours. Finally, the temperature is decreased to room temperature over about 2 hours. The inclusion of magnesia in the ceramic powder typically inhibits the grain size from growing larger than 75 microns. The resulting ceramic material comprises a densely sintered polycrystalline alumina.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to another method of bonding, a glass frit, e.g. comprising a refractory glass, can be placed between the body member <b>100</b> and the leg member <b>110</b> which bonds the two components together upon heating. According to this method, the parts can be sintered independently prior to assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The body member <b>100</b> and leg member <b>110</b> typically each have a porosity of less than or equal to about 0.1%, preferably less than 0.01%, after sintering. Porosity is conventionally defined as a unitless number representing the proportion of the total volume of an article which is occupied by voids. At a porosity of 0.1% or less, the alumina typically has a suitable optical transmittance or translucency. The transmittance or translucency can be defined as “total transmittance”, which is the transmitted luminous flux of a miniature incandescent lamp inside the discharge chamber divided by the transmitted luminous flux from the bare miniature incandescent lamp. At a porosity of 0.1% or less, the total transmittance is typically 95% or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to another exemplary method of construction, the component parts of the discharge chamber are formed by injection molding a mixture comprising about 45-60% by volume ceramic material and about 55-40% by volume binder. The ceramic material can comprise an alumina powder having a surface area of about 1.5 to about 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g, typically between 3-5 m<sup>2</sup>/g. According to one embodiment, the alumina powder has a purity of at least 99.98%. The alumina powder may be doped with magnesia to inhibit grain growth, for example in an amount equal to 0.03%-0.2%, preferably 0.05%, by weight of the alumina.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The binder may comprise a wax mixture or a polymer mixture. According to one example, the binder comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">33⅓ parts by weight paraffin wax, melting point 52-58° C.;</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">33⅓ parts by weight paraffin wax, melting point 59-63° C.;</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">33⅓ parts by weight paraffin wax, melting point 73-80° C.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">The following substances are added to the 100 parts by weight paraffin wax:</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">4 parts by weight white beeswax;</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">8 parts by weight oleic acid;</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">3 parts by weight aluminum stearate.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">The above paraffin waxes are available from Aldrich Chemical under product numbers 317659, 327212, and 411671, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the process of injection molding, the mixture of ceramic material and binder is heated to form a high viscosity mixture. The mixture is then injected into a suitably shaped mold and subsequently cooled to form a molded part.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Subsequent to injection molding, the binder is removed from the molded part, typically by thermal treatment, to form a debindered part. The thermal treatment may be conducted by heating the molded part in air or a controlled environment, e.g. vacuum, nitrogen, rare gas, to a maximum temperature, and then holding the maximum temperature. For example, the temperature may be slowly increased by about 2-3° C. per hour from room temperature to a temperature of 160° C. Next, the temperture is increased by about 100° C. per hour to a maximum temperature of 900-1100°° C. Finally, the temperature is held at 900-1100° C. for about 1-5 hours The part is subsequently cooled. After the themial treatment step, the porosity is about 40-50%.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The bisque-fired parts are typically assembled prior to sintering to allow the sintering step to bond the parts together. Typically, the densities of the bisque-fired parts used to form the body member <b>100</b> and the leg member <b>110</b> are selected to achieve different degrees of shrinkage during the sintering step. The different densities of the bisque-fired parts may be achieved by using ceramic powders having different surface areas, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Sintering of the bisque-fired parts typically reduces the porosity to less than 0.1%, and increases the total transmittance to at least 95%. The sintering step may be carried out by heating the bisque-fired parts in hydrogen having a dew point of about 10-15° C. Typically the temperature is increased from room temperature to about 1300° C. over a two hour period. Next, the temperature is held at about 1300° C. for about 2 hours. Next, the temperature is increased by about 100° C. per hour up to a maximum temperature of about 1850-1880° C. Next, the temperature is held at 1850-1880° C. for about 3-5 hours. Finally, the temperature is decreased to room temperature over about 2 hours. The inclusion of magnesia in the ceramic powder typically inhibits the grain size from growing larger than 75 microns. The resulting ceramic material comprises a densely sintered polycrystalline alumina.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to one example, an article was formed from a mixture comprising 48% by volume alumina and 52% by volume binder. The alumina had a surface area of 3 m<sup>2</sup>/g and was doped with magnesia in the amount of 0.05% of the weight of the alumina. The wax binder described above was used. The article, which had a thickness of about 3 mm, was sufficiently translucent that when pressed against newsprint, the newsprint could be read without difficulty through the article.</p>

The porosity of the various components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-18</figref> after sintering is preferably less than 0.1%, and the total transmittance is preferably at least 95%, as described above. As with the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-18</figref> can be used with discharge lampes of conventional power outputs, such as 35, 70, and 150 watts.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c </i>illustrate components of a discharge chamber formed from three components.

The body member <b>122</b> can also be formed conventionally by extrusion. The composition used for extrusion may comprise, for example, 75% by weight alumina powder, 22% by weight of a water-soluble polyacrylamide, and 3% by weight of a stearate. The alumina powder may be doped with magnesia in the amount of 0.05% by weight of the alumina. The leg members <b>120</b>, <b>124</b> are typically bonded to the body member <b>122</b> by sintering with preselected differential shrinkage, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a leg member <b>160</b> which may be bonded to a body member as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>or <b>4</b><i>b. </i>In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the leg member <b>160</b> includes a curved portion <b>162</b> between the leg portion <b>164</b> and a radially directed flange <b>168</b> of the transition portion <b>166</b>. The curved portion <b>162</b> significantly increases the strength of the leg member, in particular, its resistance to breakage at the junction between the leg portion <b>164</b> and the transition portion <b>166</b>. This feature is advantageous in substantially reducing the incidence of breakage in handling during assembly of the discharge chamber. The curved portion <b>162</b> typically has a radius at curvature of about 1-3 mm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also illustrates that the leg portion <b>164</b> may be tapered slightly. For example, the angle indicated at <b>165</b> may be 1-2 degrees. The taper provides the advantage that the leg member may be easily removed from the mold after injection molding.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the invention which includes a recess <b>172</b> on the inner side <b>174</b> of the transition portion <b>176</b> of a leg member <b>170</b>. The recess <b>172</b>, which is typically substantially cylindrical, is provided to capture reaction products, such as tungsten, produced at a tungsten electrode tip, for example, during operation of the lamp. By capturing reaction products in the recess <b>172</b>, the majority of reaction products are prevented from reaching the walls of the body portion of the discharge chamber which decreases the lumens output of the lamp. The diameter “a” of the recess <b>172</b> is typically about 20-50% of the outer diameter “b” of the transition portion <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a leg member <b>180</b> which includes a leg portion <b>182</b> and a transition portion <b>184</b>.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b </i>illustrate a cross section and a perspective view, respectively, of another embodiment of a leg member. The leg member <b>190</b> includes a transition portion <b>192</b> and a leg portion <b>194</b>. The transition portion <b>192</b> has an outer surface which is substantially cylindrical. The transition portion <b>192</b> includes a recess <b>196</b> having a concave surface. The concave surface may be in the form of a portion of an ellipsoid or a cone, for example. When the leg member <b>190</b> is bonded to a body member, the inner surface of the assembled discharge chamber is rounded at the ends, rather than flat, which can improve the temperature distribution, light quality, and intensity produced by the discharge chamber. For example, the concave nature of the recess <b>196</b> can make the temperature distribution of the discharge chamber more uniform, which eliminates colder regions of the discharge chamber to improve the light quality.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a leg member <b>200</b> which includes a transition portion <b>202</b> having a cylindrical recess <b>204</b> defining an inner surface <b>208</b>. The cylindrical recess has a relatively large diameter “a”, for example about 50-80% of the outer diameter “b” of the transition portion <b>202</b>. In forming the discharge chamber, the outer surface of the transition portion <b>202</b> is bonded to the inner surface of the body portion <b>206</b>. The recess <b>204</b> provides a reservoir area for the filler material to reside during operation. Typically, a substantial portion of the filler material remains in a liquid phase during operation. By providing the recess <b>204</b> as a reservoir area, the liquid filler material is kept away from the body portion <b>208</b>, which reduces reactions between the filler material and the relatively thin body portion <b>206</b>, which increases the lifetime of the lamp. The recess <b>204</b> also reduces the thickness of the transition portion <b>202</b>, allowing more light to pass through the transition portion in an axial direction.</p>
