<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is directed to magnetic recording and more specifically to a notched trailing shield for perpendicular recording.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Perpendicular write heads are well known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. RE 33,949 granted to Mallary et al. describes a vertical recording arrangement in which a downstream magnetic shield is integrally formed with a write pole section having a tip to make up the magnetic recording head. This patent is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Mallary states that the face of his shield is designed to be many times as large as the face of the write pole section. Hence Mallary's shield appears to serve as a return path for the magnetic flux. In contrast, a single pole write head design uses a return path pole that is located far away, while using a trailing edge adjacent to the single pole to intercept magnetic flux fringing from the single pole. See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,920,449 granted to Tagawa that is also incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is possible to fly longitudinal heads backwards to write perpendicular media. Such heads may have a notched pole tip. However, there appears to be no known description of how a notched trailing shield is to be fabricated for a perpendicular write head as discussed below.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">During fabrication of a perpendicular write head in several embodiments of the invention, at least two sides of a write pole are defined (e.g. by ion milling) while a third side of the write pole is protected by a masking material. At this stage, a material that is to be located above the pole (also called “gap material”) is already present between the write pole and the masking material. After definition of the write pole surfaces, a layer of dielectric material is deposited. During this deposition, the masking material is still present. In some embodiments, the masking material is used as a shadow mask during dielectric deposition, so that the dielectric layer forms a valley adjacent to the masking material. Thereafter, the masking material (and any dielectric material thereon) is removed (e.g. by mechanical shearing) to form a hole in the dielectric material. This structure, of a valley with a hole therein, is used as a form into which a magnetic material is deposited to form a trailing shield or alternatively a non-magnetic material is deposited to form a pseudo-trailing shield which is later recessed from an air bearing surface followed by deposition of trailing shield material.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A trailing shield resulting from the above-described process has at least one portion of the trailing shield located in the hole, and another portion of the trailing shield is located over the dielectric material, in an area adjacent to the hole. The gap material is now sandwiched between the portion of the trailing shield in the hole, and the write pole. Note that since the same masking material that is used during definition of the write pole is also used to form the hole in which a portion of the trailing shield is located, the write pole and the trailing shield are automatically aligned to one another.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A single pole notched write head in several embodiments of the invention has a pole tip <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and a notched trailing shield <b>101</b> that is located adjacent thereto. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, shield <b>101</b> has a notched portion <b>101</b>N that is separated from pole tip <b>102</b> by a small gap <b>104</b>. Shield <b>101</b> also has another portion <b>101</b>F that, in some embodiments, is formed integrally with and connected to notched portion <b>101</b>N. During normal operation, magnetic flux from pole tip <b>102</b> fringes substantially vertically downwards (opposite to direction <b>2</b>) to record information into media <b>105</b>, in the manner normal for a perpendicular write head. Shield <b>101</b> has a depth Dts (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) from the air bearing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Notched trailing shield <b>101</b> is fabricated in many embodiments of this invention starting with a structure <b>200</b> of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Specifically, structure <b>200</b> includes a layer <b>201</b> of dielectric material such as alumina over which is located a layer <b>202</b> of magnetic material that is to form pole tip <b>102</b>. Structure <b>200</b> also includes another layer <b>203</b> of dielectric material that is to be located above the pole (also called “gap material”). In many embodiments, the just-described layers <b>201</b>-<b>203</b> extend across most areas of a wafer which is being processed to form numerous write heads.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, structure <b>200</b> that is to form a single write head also includes a layer <b>204</b> of masking material (such as Durimide) and a layer <b>205</b> of photoresist that is used to etch layer <b>204</b> into an appropriate shape, of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates an elevation view in the direction <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> (and also in the direction <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Structure <b>200</b> may be formed by performing any of a number of fabrication steps well known in the art as described in, for example, US patent application entitled “Perpendicular Pole Tip And Method Of Fabrication” by Richard Hsiao, Wipul Pemsiri Jayaekara and Jeffrey S. Lille, with filing date Feb. 23, 2004 and application Ser. No. 10/785,236. This patent application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The specific manner in which structure <b>200</b> is formed is not a critical aspect of the current invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Next, the photo resist in layer <b>205</b> is stripped off, and ion milling is performed, as shown in directions <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Ion milling removes dielectric material layer <b>203</b> and also removes the magnetic material layer <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) in all areas outside of the above-described shape. Moreover, depending on the angle at which ion milling is performed (e.g. 10 degrees) most of the magnetic material of layer <b>202</b> underneath masking material layer <b>204</b> remains intact except for small portions that are removed from the two sides of pole tip <b>102</b> (thereby notching the pole tip <b>102</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Note that the above-described ion milling defines not only the two sides of pole tip <b>102</b> but also the two sides of masking material layer <b>204</b> (and also two sides of dielectric material layer <b>203</b>), thereby to make them coplanar with one another. Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, side <b>102</b>S of pole tip <b>102</b> is made coplanar with side <b>204</b>S of masking material layer <b>204</b> because these two sides <b>102</b>S and <b>204</b>S are formed simultaneously by the same process (ion milling in this example) in the direction <b>5</b>. Note that the same observation is true for direction <b>6</b>. Such co-planarity of the sides of pole tip <b>102</b> and the sides of masking material layer <b>204</b> ensures that pole tip <b>102</b> is automatically aligned with a notched portion of a trailing shield (formed as discussed below).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thereafter, the milled areas <b>201</b>A and <b>201</b>B of layer <b>201</b> are refilled by depositing a layer <b>207</b> of dielectric material such as alumina, e.g. by performing angled Ion Beam Deposition (IBD) which is a technique well known to the skilled artisan. During IBD, an ion beam is used to sputter alumina from a target. The plume of species sputtered from the target impinge on the substrate or wafer at an angle of between 10 and 70 degrees with respect to the wafer normal. Note that during the alumina deposition step, mask material layer <b>204</b> is still in place, and hence the profile of alumina surface being formed is affected by a shadow cast by mask material layer <b>204</b>, as well as the deposition angle. Hence, mask material layer <b>204</b> acts as a shadow mask relative to a direction <b>7</b> from which alumina deposition occurs. Needless to say, the surfaces of layer <b>207</b> in contact with mask material layer <b>204</b> conform to its sides (e.g. side <b>204</b>S in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) defined by ion milling. Note that direction <b>7</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> by only two sets of inclined arrows (from the left and from the right), although during alumina deposition the wafer's normal is tilted with respect to direction <b>7</b> and the wafer is rotated about the wafer normal.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Specifically, the mask material layer <b>204</b> causes layer <b>207</b> of dielectric material to be formed in a three-part profile as described next. A first part <b>207</b>A is distant from pole tip <b>102</b>, and is fully exposed to the deposition, so that it has uniform thickness. A second part <b>207</b>B is located within a shadow of mask material <b>204</b> and hence it is not fully exposed to deposition. Hence although second part <b>207</b>B is of the same thickness as first part <b>207</b>A at locations adjacent thereto, second part <b>207</b>B becomes gradually thinner as pole tip <b>102</b> is reached. For this reason, second part <b>207</b>B forms a valley around the mask <b>204</b>. Finally, layer <b>207</b> also includes a third part <b>207</b>C that is formed on the almost vertical (although angled) sides of and also over the mask material layer <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, layer <b>207</b> is shown as being located over another layer <b>206</b> which is also formed of dielectric material, e.g. also alumina. One difference between layers <b>206</b> and <b>207</b> is that layer <b>206</b> is formed first, and it is adjacent to the pole tip <b>102</b> and layer <b>207</b> is formed next and it is adjacent to gap material layer <b>203</b> and mask material layer <b>204</b>. Note that depending on the embodiment, only one layer could be used (in place of layers <b>206</b> and <b>207</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>), although in many embodiments two layers are used to allow for dielectrics with different properties to be deposited immediately adjacent to the regions <b>201</b>A and <b>201</b>B and further from it. The number of layers of dielectric are not a critical aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the mask material <b>204</b> is next removed, as well as any dielectric material thereon (i.e. the third part of layers <b>206</b> and <b>207</b>) is removed, leaving a hole <b>208</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>) at the former location of the mask material. In many embodiments, this removal is performed by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) wherein mask material layer <b>204</b> (and layers <b>206</b> and <b>207</b> thereon) are mechanically sheared off. At this stage, in some embodiments gap material <b>203</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) is exposed at the bottom of hole <b>208</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>). Gap material <b>203</b> may be selected to have an appropriate property to act as a stop for the removal process. Note that although in some embodiments, the same material, e.g. carbon may be used as gap material and also as CMP stop, in alternative embodiments, there are two layers, wherein an upper layer acts as a stop for the removal process and a lower layer fills the write gap.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">At this stage, hole <b>208</b> has two sides (that are almost vertical but angled) formed of dielectric material (e.g. of layers <b>206</b> and <b>207</b>) and hence hole <b>208</b>'s sides are also coplanar with the sides of write pole <b>102</b>. Note that in order for the above-described mechanical shearing off to happen, the thickness of layers <b>206</b> and <b>207</b> is kept sufficiently small (i.e. a sufficient portion of the item to be sheared off is elevated over the surrounding region). For more details, see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/785,236 which was incorporated by reference above.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Next, gap material layer <b>203</b> is removed to the extent necessary. Thereafter, a layer <b>209</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>) of magnetic material that is to form the trailing shield is placed in the hole <b>208</b> and also over the dielectric layer <b>207</b> thereby to form the notched trailing shield <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Note that since the mask material layer <b>204</b> was used twice (a) once to define the sides of the pole tip <b>102</b> and (b) another time to define the shape of the valley and to form the hole <b>208</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>), for this reason corresponding two portions of the trailing shield <b>101</b> become self aligned relative to the underlying pole tip <b>102</b>. Specifically, a notched portion of trailing shield <b>101</b> is located inside hole <b>208</b>, and this notched portion has sides that are coplanar with the corresponding sides of write pole <b>102</b>. Moreover, another portion of the trailing shield <b>101</b> is located over the dielectric material in an area adjacent to hole <b>208</b>, and this portion has sides defined by the above-described valley.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some alternative embodiments, instead of depositing magnetic material (in hole <b>208</b> and in areas adjacent to hole <b>208</b>) over the structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, a layer <b>209</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>) of non-magnetic material that is dry etchable is deposited thereon. This layer <b>209</b> is also referred to herein as a “pseudo” trailing shield. Next, a layer <b>210</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>) of photoresist is formed and patterned appropriately for a specific shape that the trailing shield is to have (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>). Then, the exposed portion of the pseudo trailing shield is removed, by reactive ion etching (RIE), followed by deposition of the magnetic material <b>211</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>) that is to form the trailing shield <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Material <b>211</b> may be deposited in any manner well known to the skilled artisan, e.g. by sputtering or by plating. If sputtering is used, then an additional CMP step may be necessary to remove the magnetic material from unwanted areas (e.g. over photoresist <b>210</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one alternative embodiment, a “pseudo” trailing shield is created as described above in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D-2F</figref>, followed by cutting the wafer into rows, and lapping to expose the air bearing surface (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>). In such an embodiment, lapping may be stopped (to define the air bearing surface) based on the read sensor performance or resistance. Once the air bearing surface is defined, a mask is used to protect the read sensor and open up a window around the pseudo trailing shield. Note that the mask may be “non critical” because the dimension of the feature is determined by the material being etched out—the pseudo shield. The mask simply has to cover other areas which may be sensitive to the etch chemistry, such as the sensor. For more details, see U.S. patent application entitled “Perpendicular Magnetic Recording Head Built Using An Air-Bearing Surface Damascene Process” by Ian Robson McFadyen, Neil Leslie Robertson and Scott MacDonald, filing date Feb. 16, 2004 and application Ser. No. 10/778,265 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thereafter, the pseudo trailing shield is recessed from the air bearing surface using reactive ion etching that is selective to the pseudo trailing shield material. (e.g. F RIE which is well known to the skilled artisan as Reactive Ion Etching using Fluorine based chemistry, and which can be used to selectively remove Ta (Tantalum), W (Tungsten) or Si (Silicon) materials). The amount of recess, Dts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is selected based on the depth to which the trailing shield <b>102</b> is to extend from the air bearing surface. Next, a desired magnetic material is vacuum deposited into the recess, and onto the air bearing surface and/or resist. Then light kiss polish or CMP is performed to remove the magnetic material outside of the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the just-described process, optionally, a polish or CMP stop layer can be deposited prior to the magnetic material. This stop layer provides more process tolerance in the CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) process. Furthermore, an adhesion promotion layer (Cr, NiCr, . . . ) could be applied prior to magnetic material deposition.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although the present invention is illustrated in connection with specific embodiments for instructional purposes, the present invention is not limited thereto. Various adaptations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, although two or more layers (such as layers <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) are in contact with one another in some embodiments, in other embodiments one or more additional layers are present therebetween. As another example, the trailing shield throat height can be defined either after the air bearing surface is formed or during wafer fabrication. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the foregoing description.</p>
