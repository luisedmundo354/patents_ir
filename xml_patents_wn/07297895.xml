<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for removing minute particles from a surface. More particularly, the invention relates to a method and apparatus for removing minute particles from a surface using thermophoresis to prevent particle redeposition.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Particle contamination of surfaces is a concern in many areas of technology. Two areas where such contamination can be a very significant problem are optics, particularly those with critical optical surfaces, and electronic device fabrication. The effect of contaminants on critical optical surfaces (coated or uncoated, dielectric or metal), for example in high power laser optics, can lead to increased optical absorption and a decreased laser damage threshold. As minute particles contaminate optical surfaces, they can serve as sinks for optical power incident on the optical surfaces and thus produce localized heating and possible damage. Large telescope mirrors, and space optics are other applications which require highly decontaminated critical optical surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the electronics industry, particle contamination is an important factor in the manufacture of high density integrated circuits. Even in relatively conventional technology using micron or larger circuit patterns, submicron size particle contamination can be a problem. Today the technology is progressing into submicron pattern sizes, and particle contamination is even more of a problem. For device fabrication, particles serve as âkiller defectsâ for only the device that is particle contaminated. The term âdeviceâ includes electronic devices, including masks/reticles, optical devices, medical devices, and other devices where particle removal could be advantageous. A particle contaminated mask/reticle prints every device with a defect. At the shorter wavelengths being developed for the next generation of lithography, materials for a protective pellicle for the mask are not available, making particle removal techniques an essential technology in the future. Contaminant particles larger than roughly 10% of the pattern size can create damage, such as pinholes, which interfere with fabrication processes (such as etching, deposition and the like), and defects of that size are a sufficiently significant proportion of the overall pattern size to result in rejected devices and reduced yield. As an example, it has been found that the minimum particle size which must be removed in order to achieve adequate yield in a one Megabit chip (which has a pattern size of one micron) is about 0.1 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Filtration (of air and liquid), particle detection, and contaminant removal are known techniques used in contamination control technology in order to address the problems outlined above. For example, semiconductor fabrication is often conducted in clean rooms in which the air is highly filtered, the rooms are positively pressurized, and the personnel allowed into the room are decontaminated and specially garbed before entry is allowed. In spite of that, the manufactured devices can become contaminated, not only by contaminants carried in the air, but also by contaminants created by the processes used to fabricate the devices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Removal techniques for contaminants should provide sufficient driving force for removal but without destroying the substrate. Moreover, acceptable removal techniques should provide a minimum level of cleanliness in a reliable fashion. As the particle size decreases, the particle weight becomes less significant as compared to other adhesive forces binding the particle to the surface which it contaminates. Removal of such small particles can potentially damage the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In general, it has been found that submicron particles are the most difficult to remove. Many of the processes developed to clean integrated circuits, such as ultrasonic agitation, are not effective for micron and submicron particles and indeed, sometimes add contaminants to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Laser assisted particle removal has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,987,286 issued to Susan D. Allen on Jan. 22, 1991, which is hereby incorporated by reference. U.S. Pat. No. 4,987,286 discloses a method and apparatus for removing minute particles from a surface to which they are adhered using laser technology, and further teaches the use of an energy transfer medium to effect efficient laser assisted particle removal (LAPR). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a condensed liquid or solid energy transfer medium <b>23</b>, such as water, is interposed under and around a contaminant particle <b>22</b> to be removed from a substrate <b>20</b> to which the particle is adhered. Thereafter, the medium <b>23</b> is irradiated using laser energy <b>25</b> at a wavelength which is strongly absorbed by the medium <b>23</b> causing explosive evaporation of the medium <b>23</b> with sufficient force to remove the particle <b>22</b> from the surface of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another particle removal technique has been to direct the laser energy into the substrate. The laser heated substrate then transfers energy into the energy transfer medium via conduction causing explosive evaporation sufficient to remove the particle from the surface of the substrate. The laser energy can also be directed into the particle(s) to be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Both direct absorption by the energy transfer medium, and substrate and/or particle(s) absorption with subsequent heating of the energy transfer medium can result in efficient LAPR. However, advances in technology have decreased the critical dimensions of various devices, such as, for example, magnetic hard drives, semiconductor devices, masks to make semiconductor devices, etc., and have also increased the surface quality specifications for devices such as large telescope mirrors, space optics, high power laser optics, etc. Therefore, the ability to remove particulate contamination in a noncontact clean fashion becomes ever more important.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One of the challenges of LAPR and other particle removal methods is keeping the particles from redepositing on the surfaces, particularly for very small particles that are not significantly affected by gravity. Several options are available for preventing removed minute particles from redepositing on the cleaned surface. For example, when particles are removed in a vacuum, the mean free path of the particle is long enough to keep it from redepositing and a cooled surface can serve as a particle trap. Also, gas jets parallel to the surface can be used to entrain particles and transport them away from the critical surface.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/909,993, which is hereby incorporated by reference, discusses and proposes methods and apparatus that efficiently remove minute particles from the surface of a substrate. The methods and apparatus according to the invention of Co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/909,993 overcome the shortcomings of the prior art. However, as discussed above, one of the challenges of LAPR and other particle removal methods is keeping the particles from redepositing on the surfaces, particularly for very small (for example, micrometer and nanometer size) particles that are not significantly affected by gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As previously discussed, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows, in cross-section, a portion of a substrate <b>20</b> bearing contaminant particles <b>22</b> which are adhered to a surface <b>21</b>. The particles <b>22</b> are bound to the surface <b>21</b> by any of a number of forces. The particles are deposited usually by a complex process which may include diffusion, sedimentation, inertia, and electrical or electrostatic attraction. When the particles are very small, gravity is a minor source of adhesion, and other sources of greater significance are Van der Waals forces, electrostatic forces, capillary forces, and the like. Adhesion forces and the factors necessary for dislodging particles held by such forces will be considered in greater detail below. As the particles become smaller, the adhesion force per particle contact surface area increases rapidly, and removal of such particles becomes a rather significant problem.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An energy transfer medium (ETM) may be interposed under and around the particles <b>22</b>, such medium being illustrated in the drawing as layer <b>23</b>, which occupies interstices <b>24</b> formed between the adhered particles <b>22</b> and the surface <b>21</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref> illustrates the introduction of an ETM onto a surface bearing a contaminant particle.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">After preparing the surface for cleansing, energy is impinged upon the surface to be cleaned. The energy may be targeted into, that is, at a wavelength which is absorbed by, the particle, the substrate, or the ETM, or some combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a laser beam <b>25</b> is directed at the surface <b>21</b>, which carries the contaminant particles, and the interposed layer <b>24</b>. A quantity of energy is absorbed in the ETM, either directly or from the laser heated particle or substrate, which is sufficient to cause explosive evaporation on the medium. The quantity of material interposed under and around the particle is such that, when explosive evaporation occurs, the particle is driven from the surface by the force of the explosion, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. In effect, the laser energy incident on the surface is converted by the ETM from potential to kinetic energy, and is transferred to the particle, driving it from the surface to which it had been adhered.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The methods and apparatus according to the invention use thermophoresis to prevent the redeposition of dislodged particles onto the surface of a sample or substrate. It has been known that a temperature gradient in a gas causes small particles suspended in the gas to migrate in the direction of decreasing temperature. This phenomenon is called thermophoresis. The methods and apparatus according to the invention combine thermophoresis with laser assisted particle removal (LAPR) to remove difficult to remove particles from a surface of a sample and to prevent their redeposition.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Thermophoresis was discovered in the steel industry in 1910. A thermal gradient produces a net force on a particle small enough to exhibit Brownian motion toward the colder side of the gradient. This force exists because the hotter gaseous molecules near the surface that is being protected have more kinetic energy to impart to the small particle, tending to force it toward the colder part of the gas.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It has been demonstrated by Lenny Klebanoff, Dan Radar, and Daniel Dedrick at Sandia National Laboratories that a temperature gradient of approximately 15K/cm will prevent approximately 0.2 Î¼m polystyrene particles flowing from a âshowerheadâ from depositing on a mask surface. This temperature gradient can be produced, for example, by cooling a plate above the surface to be protected, by heating the surface to be protected, or by some combination thereof. Pressures as low as approximately 30 mT can be utilized to create a thermophoretic force.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Experiments were also conducted by Klebanoff et al. for approximately 10K/cm temperature gradients in which a test wafer, protected by thermophoresis, was exposed to class Ë7 million Ar gas at approximately 1 Torr pressure and laden with approximately 0.24 micron diameter particles. Post exposure scans of the wafer indicated particle protection factors in excess of Ë10<sup>6</sup>. The model used by Klebanoff et al. indicated that the technique would work down to approximately 50 nm particles.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Obviously, there is no thermophoresis in vacuum, but there are many processes with particle surface contamination problems that operate in a gaseous environment at atmospheric, low or high pressure. The readily executable redeposition prevention process for use with LAPR according to the invention in atmosphere would be advantageous for many processes, including but not limited to cleaning semiconductor wafers and masks, cleaning high resolution optics such as large telescope mirrors, cleaning critical surfaces in space, cleaning high power laser optics, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref> schematically illustrate three exemplary ways in which the invention can be implemented. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a temperature control unit <b>98</b> is provided which controls the temperature of a plate <b>98</b>A on which a sample or substrate <b>20</b> is placed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a plate <b>99</b>A and corresponding temperature control unit <b>99</b> are disposed above, or at a predetermined distance D from a sample or substrate <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates an embodiment, which is a combination of the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref>. By controlling the temperature control units <b>98</b> and/or <b>99</b>, a temperature gradient can be created which will draw dislodged contaminant particles away from the surface of a sample or substrate <b>20</b> and ensure that they do not redeposit.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, temperature control units, such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref>, can also be used to create a âparticle gunâ. That is, the temperature control units could be manipulated to control the velocity and direction of particle flow. The velocity of the particles would be dependent on the temperature gradient as well as the size of the respective particles being manipulated. Such a particle gun concept could be used to accelerate particles toward a desired target.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an apparatus configured for practice according to one embodiment of the invention. The apparatus includes a chamber <b>50</b>. Mounted on a support (not shown) in the chamber <b>50</b> is a substrate <b>54</b> to be cleaned. The substrate <b>54</b> has a surface <b>55</b> which contains contaminant particles (not shown in the scale of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) which are to be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For the purpose of controlling the adsorption and the description of liquid materials such as water, a cooling source <b>56</b> is coupled by conduit <b>57</b> to the substrate <b>54</b>. As noted above, the temperature of the substrate <b>54</b> may be reduced to enhance water absorption to the surface <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An ETM can be applied as a liquid or gas. For the purpose of dosing the surface with a liquid ETM, for example, water or an alcohol/water mixture, a liquid source <b>60</b> is provided and is coupled by a dosing tube <b>61</b> to the surface <b>55</b> of the substrate <b>54</b>. Liquid supplied by source <b>60</b> travels through the dosing tube <b>61</b> and is applied to the surface <b>55</b> at the appropriate temperature to assure adsorption on the surface and in interstices under and around the contaminant particles. After water dosing, the temperature of the substrate <b>54</b> can be maintained by the cooling source <b>56</b>, such that adsorption of surface water occurs while maintaining water in the interstices under and around the contaminant particles and the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A plate <b>99</b>A and a corresponding temperature control unit <b>99</b> are provided at a predetermined distance from the substrate <b>54</b> to create a temperature gradient according to this embodiment of the invention. A laser source <b>64</b> is provided with means <b>66</b> for steering a laser beam <b>65</b>, if necessary. Additional beam guiding means can be provided to guide the laser energy to the substrate despite obstacles.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">After a sample is prepared for cleaning, the laser source <b>64</b> is energized, and outputs pulses of energy in a beam illustrated at <b>65</b> to the surface <b>55</b>. As an alternative, the sample itself can be moved within the chamber <b>50</b> to direct the laser beam to the desired area of the surface <b>55</b>. In any event, the beam <b>65</b> is focused on areas of the surface <b>55</b> to be cleaned and the laser <b>64</b> pulsed to couple adequate energy to the surface <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the sample <b>54</b> is mounted such that particles which are driven from the surface <b>55</b> can fall gravity assisted without redepositing on the surface. Additionally, the temperature control unit <b>99</b> creates a temperature gradient that ensures that the particles do not redeposit on the surface of the sample <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The present invention can also be used to form a particle gun, as mentioned briefly above, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-6</figref>, which would deposit particles onto a target substrate. This can be useful in the manufacture of, for example, computer monitors. Particles interposed between a mask and a polymer, during imprinting of a polymer based diode, will create rows of pillars, creating a photonic bandgap material. See âDusty Lab May Revolutionize LEDs,â Photonics Technology World, September 2000, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Fine control of the height and distribution of the pillars allows control of colors emitted by an LED, which are determined by microcavities in the polymer. See id. Instead of manufacturing each color with different light-emitting materials, the entire range of color can be produced with one material by controlling the height and distribution of the pillars. See id.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The particle gun according to the invention, discussed above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-6</figref>, can be used to deposit particles on a substrate in a predetermined pattern and/or in layers. For example, transparent tape can be used with different kinds, sizes, etc. of particles disposed on the tape at different portions thereof. The tape can then be moved into the path of the laser energy to expose different portions of the tape to the laser energy.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The particle gun <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes a substrate <b>120</b>, and an energy transfer medium <b>123</b> with particles <b>122</b> deposited thereon. Laser energy <b>125</b> provided by a laser (not shown) is directed at the substrate/ETM combination. The particles <b>122</b> are accelerated from the surface of the substrate <b>120</b> towards a target substrate <b>140</b>, upon which the particles <b>122</b> adhere as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The temperatures of the substrate <b>120</b> and the target substrate <b>140</b> can be altered to affect particle deposition density and particle deposition distribution patterns. For example, the substrate <b>120</b> can be cold relative to a warm target substrate <b>140</b>, preventing ETM redeposition on the target substrate <b>140</b> resulting in dry particle deposition.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses. The description of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims. Many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents but also equivalent structures.</p>
