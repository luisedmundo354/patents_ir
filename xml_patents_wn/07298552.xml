<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to an observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The article “A 50” time-multiplexed autostereoscopic display”, by N. A. Dodgson et al. in proceedings of SPIE 3957, “Stereoscopic Displays &amp; Applications XI”, Jan. 2000, describes a CRT-based observer-adaptive autostereoscopic system that comprises a set of lenses which have a size substantially equal to the size of the CRT. The system can be considered to be two superimposed optical systems:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0003">a compound “image transfer lens” which transfers an image of the CRT into a plane of a liquid crystal display (LCD). This LCD operates like a shutter.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0004">A Fresnel lens which projects an image of the shutter into space.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0005">The “image transfer lens” does not project a real image: rather the observer looks through both Fresnel and projection lenses and directly views the CRT faceplate, like looking through a magnifying class. The system works by displaying each view in turn on the CRT. The LCD is placed approximately in the focal point of the projection lenses of the “image transfer lens”. One of the LCD segments of the shutter is made transparent in synchronization with the image display. This directs the light from the CRT to a specific window in the eye box, i.e. location in the space where the observer is located. In terms of geometric optics, the “image transfer lens” transfers the image on the CRT face to a plane in free space. The Fresnel lens is placed at this plane, so that an image of the CRT appears to lie on its surface. The shutter is controlled in such a manner that for a predetermined period of time only the right eye can look through the superimposed optical systems to the CRT and alternatingly the left eye for the same time, and so on. The main disadvantage of the system is that it is rather bulky.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0006">It is an object of the invention to provide an observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display that is less bulky. To this end, the invention provides an observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display system and unit as defined by the independent claims. The dependent claims define advantageous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0007">The main difference to the prior art is that in the display system according to a preferred embodiment of the invention the optical system is replaced by a large number of smaller optical modules which are placed in a grid structure. The optical modules operate only on light originating from groups of pixels while the former optical system operates on light originating from the entire screen. The number of pixels of a group is substantially less than the number of pixels of an entire image. The number of pixels of a group may e.g. be equal to one, or equal to the number of pixels of one column of an image or equal to the number of pixels of one row of an image. The depth of the optical modules is substantially less than the depth of the former optical system. Another advantage is that with the display system according to the invention a better separation of views is achieved. Besides that the display system according to the invention supports viewing stereo images by multiple users simultaneously by using only one display device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">In an embodiment of the observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display system according to the invention, the segments have a width that is substantially smaller than the pixel width. The size of the segments is related to positional accuracy of the projection of the light-beam. This means that the separation of views is related to the size of the segments. Preferably the width of the segments is approximately hundred times smaller than the pixel width.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">In an embodiment of the observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display system according to the invention, the lenses are linear. Normal full, i.e. circular lenses bend light both in x and y direction. Linear lenses are strips, e.g. cylindrical, that bend light either in x or y direction and do not bend the light in the other direction. Both full and linear lenses can be used, but linear lenses are preferred because usage of these lenses reduces costs: the number of lenses is reduced. Preferably the linear lenses extent from top to bottom of the screen. Alternatively the linear lenses extent from left to right of the screen. As a consequence one linear lens is related to pixels of one column of the image respectively one row of the image.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">In an embodiment of the observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display system according to the invention, the segments have a length that is substantially equal to a size of the screen. It is preferred that both the lenses in the first grid and the lenses in the second grid are linear. It is preferred that in the case that linear lenses are used, the segments are also rectangular. Then the number of segments is limited, resulting in a less complex shutter which is less expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">An embodiment of the observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display system according to the invention comprises a light-separation device. It is important that light passing a particular lens of the first grid also passes the corresponding lens of the second grid and not, or as little as possible, passes another lens of the second grid. In other words cross-talk and distortions must be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">In an embodiment of the observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display system according to the invention, the light-separation device comprises a grid of mirrors. A first approach to prevent cross-talk is to reflect light. An advantage of applying mirrors is that only relatively few light is lost.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">In another embodiment of the observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display system according to the invention, the light-separation device comprises a grid of black boxes. A second approach to prevent cross-talk is to absorb light. An advantage of this embodiment of the separation device is its simplicity.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">In another embodiment of the observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display system according to the invention, the light-separation device comprises a Fresnel lens. A third approach to prevent cross-talk is to bend light. An advantage of applying a Fresnel lens is that only relatively few light is lost.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">An embodiment of the observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display system according to the invention is characterized in that the first grid, the shutter and the second grid are located in a solid transparent box with a relatively high refraction index. The advantage of this embodiment is that the viewing angle is extended.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">Modifications of the observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display system and variations thereof may correspond to modifications and variations thereof of the observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display unit described.</p>

The observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display system <b>100</b> is capable of displaying M original 3D video or TV programs in a time multiplex composite input video stream signal VSS to n=1, 2, . . . or N observers on an observer and image selective basis, as will be explained in more detail hereinafter. Each of those M original 3D video or TV programs entering the display system <b>100</b> is composed of e.g. K original 3D images formed by 2D left and right eye views, each of those 2D left and right eye views being focused at the corresponding eyes of predetermined viewers VP<b>1</b>-VP<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">Such time multiplex composite input video stream signal VSS which is provided at the input connector <b>105</b>, comprises a periodic sequence of pairs of images carrying pixel data of two dimensional (2D) left and right eye views Vlij and Vrij of a 3D image IMij, in which i=1, 2 . . .

In front of the display device <b>102</b> are directivity optics <b>104</b>, that can change the direction of the light-rays and optionally block the light-rays in order to enter one, several, or all viewers eyes. The directivity driver <b>106</b> decides for each of the eyes independently whether it can see the display or not. The 3D eye localisator <b>107</b> provides the directivity driver <b>106</b> with xyz co-ordinates of all eyes, so that the directivity optics <b>104</b> can properly be adjusted by the directivity driver <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">For the sake of clarity, the invention shall be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> on the basis of a single 3D video or TV program being constituted of a series of 3D images IM<b>1</b> to IMK, which is to be transmitted to three observers or viewers VP<b>1</b>-VP<b>3</b>. Suppose each of the 3D images IM<b>1</b> to IMK consists of 2D left and right eye views Vl<b>1</b> to VlK and Vr<b>1</b> to VrK, respectively, supplied by the display device <b>102</b> in an alternate sequence of even and odd images occurring in even time slots t=0, 2, 4, . . . and odd timeslots t=1, 3, 5, . . . , respectively, of the above time multiplex composite input video stream signal VSS. Then in the even timeslots the display device <b>102</b> is set in a left view mode to deal with left eye views Vli (i=1 . . . K) only, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. In the odd timeslots the display device <b>102</b> is set in a right view mode to deal with right eye views Vri (i=1 . . . K) only, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. For the display of a single 3D image IMk, the 2D left and right eye views Vlk and Vrk thereof occurring in timeslots 2(k−1) and 2k−1 respectively, the directivity driver <b>106</b> controls the directivity optics <b>104</b> to focus all lightbeams carrying pixel data of the left eye views Vlk in the even timeslot 2(k−1) into a left view focus point or apex coinciding with the left eye viewpoints of observers VP<b>1</b>-VP<b>3</b> and to focus all lightbeams carrying pixel data of the right eye views Vlk in the odd timeslot 2k−1 into a right view apex coinciding with the right eye viewpoints of the observers VP<b>1</b>-VP<b>3</b>. Synchronization in the alternate switching of the display device <b>102</b> from the left view mode into the right view mode and vice versa, with time multiplexed transmission of the 2D left and right eye views Vli and Vri from the display device <b>102</b> to the directivity optics <b>104</b> is achieved with the view index data i supplied by the display device <b>102</b> to the directivity driver <b>106</b>. By using the above view point indicative control signal provided by the viewpoint tracker VT to dynamically adapt the left and right view apex to the actual position of the eyes of each viewer, a correctly distinct focus of the 2D left and right eye views Vl and Vr of all 3D images IM<b>1</b> to IMK to the eyes of each of the viewers VP<b>1</b>-VP<b>3</b> is obtained, resulting in a correct 3D image perception of the complete 3D video or TV program at all three view points VP<b>1</b>-VP<b>3</b>, independent from the viewers position and movement within the viewing range of the display device.</p>

The directivity optics <b>104</b> can be considered to comprise for a group of pixels a first lens, e.g. <b>208</b>, a barrier <b>204</b> and a second lens, e.g. <b>218</b>. The barrier is a portion of the shutter <b>204</b> or in other words a number of segments of the total number of segments which the shutter comprises. The shutter may be an LCD or a Polymer LC/gel type. The display device <b>102</b> may be any type of display, e.g. CRT, PDP, TFT or LCD. The working of the optical modules is as follows. Light from the display device <b>102</b> is focused by the first lens, e.g. <b>208</b>, of the particular module. At a distance which is approximately equal to the focal length of this first lens the shutter <b>204</b> is located. Light can only pass this shutter <b>204</b> through the transparent segments and is blocked for all other segments. One segment per viewer is transparent per time slot. The position of the eyes of the viewers determine which segments are transparent and which are not. Light passes the shutter through a transparent segment and is subsequently directed through the corresponding second lens, e.g. <b>218</b>. This second lens <b>218</b> directs the light to e.g. the particular position <b>112</b> in which eye <b>114</b> is located.</li>

<p id="p-0031" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> schematically shows a perspective view of a part of an embodiment of the observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display system according to the invention. The first grid <b>202</b> comprising a plurality of lenses <b>208</b>-<b>216</b> which are disposed in a direction which is substantially vertical. The second grid <b>206</b> is substantially aligned with the first grid <b>202</b> and comprises a plurality of lenses <b>218</b>-<b>226</b>.

The first <b>202</b> and the second grid <b>206</b> together with the shutter <b>204</b> are placed in front of a screen of a standard display device <b>102</b>. In principle, this display device <b>102</b> does not have to be modified for this purpose. The dimensions of the first grid <b>202</b>, the second grid <b>206</b>, the shutter <b>204</b> and the screen of the display device <b>102</b> are substantially mutually equal. In the case of a standard CRT display with size 80×60 cm and with CCIR resolution of approximately 700×600, the pixel size is approximately 1 mm. In that case each lens is approximately 1 mm by 60 cm. The focal length of the lenses is approximately 2 mm. The depth of the directivity optics <b>104</b> is less than 1 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically shows an embodiment of the observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display system <b>300</b> comprising a light-sepration device <b>302</b>. The light-separation device <b>302</b> is located between the first grid <b>202</b> and the shutter <b>204</b>. Alternatively the light-separation device <b>302</b> is located between the second grid <b>206</b> and the shutter <b>204</b>. The purpose of the light-separation device <b>302</b> is to prevent that light from a particular lens, e.g. <b>208</b> does not pass to a second lens, e.g. <b>220</b> which does not correspond to the particular lens. Otherwise image distortions will appear.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> schematically shows the principle of the light-separation device <b>302</b> based on mirrors <b>401</b>-<b>407</b>. If no precautions are set then an observer who views with his eye <b>114</b> from a point which is not inside the viewing angle will notice image distortions. This will be described hereinafter with rays in reverse direction. That means from an eye <b>114</b> of the observer to the display device <b>102</b>. A ray <b>409</b> would subsequently pass lens <b>220</b>, the transparent segment <b>210</b> of the shutter <b>204</b> and lens <b>212</b>. However lens <b>212</b> and <b>220</b> are not lenses that correspond to each other, i.e. belong to the same module. But the mirror <b>405</b> reflects the ray. The ray <b>410</b> passes lens <b>210</b> in the direction of the appropriate pixel of the display device <b>102</b>. Hence ray <b>408</b> continues as ray <b>410</b>. Several techniques are available to construct these “micro”-mirrors, e.g. damping of metal.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> schematically shows the principle of the light-separation device <b>302</b> based on black boxes with light-absorbing walls <b>411</b>-<b>417</b>. In this case ray <b>409</b> is substantially absorbed by wall <b>415</b> of a black box of the separation device. Some light will be lost but distortions are prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> schematically shows the principle of the light-separation device <b>302</b> based on a Fresnel lens <b>430</b>. In this case ray <b>409</b> is bent by lens <b>430</b>. Hence ray <b>408</b> continues as ray <b>410</b> in the direction of the appropriate pixel of the display device <b>102</b>. The Fresnel lens <b>430</b> has a focal length which is less then the focal length of the lenses <b>218</b>-<b>222</b> and <b>208</b>-<b>212</b>. Typically the focal length will be twice as small. Optionally a grid of lenses is used instead of a Fresnel lens <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically shows an embodiment of a part of the observer-adaptive autostereoscopic display system in which the first grid <b>202</b> with lenses <b>218</b>-<b>222</b>, the shutter <b>204</b> and the second grid <b>206</b> with lenses <b>208</b>-<b>212</b> are located in a solid transparent box <b>500</b> with a relatively high refraction index. Optionally a light-separation device <b>302</b> is included in the transparent box <b>500</b> too. Of course the lenses have a refraction index which is higher than the refraction index of the material of the solid transparent box <b>500</b>. The effect of the box is that light is also bent at the borders of the solid transparent box <b>500</b>. As a consequence the total viewing is extended compared to an embodiment without the solid transparent box <b>500</b>. An extension of the viewing angle with a factor of two is feasible.</p>
