<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT/EP03/12670, filed on Nov. 13, 2003, which claims priority to German Patent Application No. 102 56 052.8, filed on Nov. 30, 2002. The disclosures of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention refers to a covering device for covering mounting recesses in the cover strips of a vehicle roof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">These mounting recesses are provided with cover strips at the locations where, for example, anchoring points for possible fastening of the support feet of roof luggage carriers are found in the roof channel beneath. As long as the locations are not being utilized and there is no need for the channels to be open, the recesses are, as a rule, closed by a corresponding cover, not only for the protection of the fastening site but also for visual reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A generic covering device is known from DE 198 40 294 C2, in which the hinged cover filling the recess in the closed position has bearing journals, projecting in the strip longitudinal direction, which are shaped as a straight extension of the pivoting cover edge. This results in the bearing shells below the recess being located close to the edge of the recess, and the cover, when pivoted up, of necessity narrows the recess corresponding to its cover thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The goal of the invention is to design the generic covering device so that the hinged cover does not hinder access to the recess when open.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This goal is attained according to the invention in that the bearing journals are shaped on the hinged cover via a U-shaped element, which is dimensioned such that the edge of the recess, when the hinged cover is in the open position, projects into the open space of the U-shaped element.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">By means of this arrangement of the journal rotation point in the insertion part and the U-shaped formation of the hinged element, the roof strip recess can be almost completely opened. The roof hinge is then tilted back far enough from the recess, in the open position, that the feet of the roof luggage carrier can be easily guided to the fastening sites and be fastened there.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The covering device shown in the figures is used to close a mounting recess <b>4</b> in a cover strip <b>3</b> of a vehicle roof, as long as the fastening site for a roof luggage carrier, or other mechanism, found under the recess <b>4</b> is not needed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">This covering device consists of an insertion part <b>1</b>, which can be positioned in the cover strip <b>3</b>, and a hinged cover <b>2</b>, which is supported so that it can pivot around an axis in the longitudinal direction of the cover strip <b>3</b> and covers the recess <b>4</b> in the closed position. The hinged cover <b>2</b> is connected to the insertion part <b>1</b> via a U-shaped element <b>5</b> with bearing journals <b>6</b> at each end. The bearing journals <b>6</b> are supported so they can pivot in bearing shells <b>7</b> shaped on the insertion part <b>1</b> when the hinged cover <b>2</b> is connected thereto. The U-shaped element <b>5</b> is shaped such that the edge <b>8</b> of the recess, when the hinged cover <b>2</b> is in the open position, projects into the open space <b>9</b> of the U-shaped element <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The bearing shells <b>7</b> embrace the bearing journals <b>6</b> over slightly more than half of their circumference. The bearing shells <b>7</b> elastically flex while the bearing journals <b>6</b> are being inserted and, after the bearing journals <b>6</b> have been completely inserted in the bearing shells <b>7</b>, spring together again and thereby embrace the bearing journals <b>6</b> in a clamping manner. On the sides facing one another, the bearing shells <b>7</b> are provided with lateral stop walls <b>10</b> by means of which the bearing journals <b>6</b> are positioned, after insertion at opposing ends in the longitudinal direction of the bearing shells <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The bearing journals <b>6</b> have the so-called catch pin <b>11</b> on the ends directed away from one another. These catch pins <b>11</b> work together with the spring elements <b>12</b> shaped on the insertion part <b>1</b> in the open and closed positions of the hinged cover <b>2</b> so that this cover <b>2</b> is held securely in both end positions. In the present embodiment, these spring elements <b>12</b> are shaped like spring ribs <b>13</b> which are formed at one end on the insertion part <b>1</b>. The other, elastically springy end, is guided in an arc pointing toward the catch pin <b>11</b>, and shaped on its front side <b>14</b> with a catch edge <b>15</b> that catches in correspondingly shaped catch grooves <b>16</b> in the catch pin <b>11</b> in the aforementioned end positions of the hinged cover <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The insertion part <b>1</b>, holding the hinged cover <b>2</b>, consists of an elongated basic body made of hard elastic plastic, which is built in the following manner:</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">On both ends, there are bearing bodies <b>17</b> with two side walls <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> and a bottom plate <b>20</b> and a front wall <b>21</b>. These bearing bodies <b>17</b> are connected laterally with one another by ribs <b>22</b>, shaped on the bottom plate <b>20</b>, which are fixed with respect to one another by transverse ribs <b>23</b> in the middle.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The bearing bodies <b>17</b> are shaped in cross section such that they have a place in the roof channel below the cover strip, and can be elastically connected to the strip edges <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> of the roof channels, which have been flanged all around toward the inside (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>). For this purpose, hooks <b>24</b>, which project to the outside, are shaped on the upper edge of a side wall <b>18</b>, for engaging in the strip edge <b>25</b>, and on the upper edge of the side wall <b>19</b>, lying opposite, catch hooks <b>27</b> are also shaped in a region slit on both sides, these springing inwards while being inserted into cover strip <b>3</b>, and then again catching above the strip edge <b>26</b>. The other areas of the side wall <b>19</b> are dimensioned such that during the latching of the hooks <b>27</b> they bear against the cover strip <b>3</b> from below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The two bearing shells <b>7</b> are found on the upper edge of the side wall <b>18</b> on the sides of the bearing bodies <b>1</b> facing one another, whereas the spring ribs <b>13</b> on the bearing body <b>17</b> are shaped such that the front sides <b>14</b> with the catch edges <b>15</b>, bent outwards, are directed toward the catch pins <b>11</b>. The distance between the bearing shell <b>7</b> and the spring rib <b>13</b> is dimensioned such that the U-shaped element <b>5</b> can pivot in between. The inside transverse wall <b>29</b> between the side walls <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> has a support edge <b>30</b> for support of the hinged cover <b>2</b> in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Mounting of the covering device is easy. The insertion part <b>1</b> is introduced, from below, with its catching hooks <b>24</b>, behind the strip edge <b>25</b> of the cover strip <b>3</b>, at an incline, and then pressed upwards with the catch hooks <b>27</b> until they latch in the opposite strip edge <b>26</b>. One has merely to ensure that the hinged cover <b>2</b>, previously pressed into the bearing shells <b>7</b>, is oriented centrally in the mounting recess <b>4</b> of the cover strip <b>3</b>.</p>
