<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is related to the following co-pending application, and incorporated herein by reference:</p>
<p id="h-0002" num="0000">(1) U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/006,125 titled “AUTOMATED SELECTION OF A BACKUP RECIPIENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF AN INSTANT MESSAGING REQUEST TO THE BACKUP RECIPIENT”.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates in general to improved messaging systems and in particular to improving automated responses when an intended recipient is not available. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to automated distribution of a messaging request initiated for communication with an intended recipient to a backup recipient, wherein the intended recipient is updated with the message log from any resulting communication between the requester and the backup recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of electronic messaging and communications, such as electronic mail (e-mail), instant messaging, and text messaging has expanded rapidly over the last few years. Typically, an e-mail application, such as Lotus Notes (Lotus Notes is a registered trademark of International Business Machines Corporation), provides a user interface between the user and an e-mail server that sends and receives e-mail via a network, such as the Internet. In addition, typically, instant messaging applications and chat applications, such as AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) (AOL and AIM are registered trademarks of AOL, Inc.), provide a user interface between the user and an instant messaging server that opens a communication channel between at least two users and facilitates distribution of messages through that communication channel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since instant messaging is essentially “real-time” communication, this type of electronic communication is often used when users need to communicate immediately about a particular topic. As it evolves, instant messaging is commonly used as a substitute for telephone calls because the conversation can happen in “real-time” but all parties to the messaging session can remain at their computer system and respond when needed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As much as the “real-time” communication element is a characteristic of instant messaging communications, many instant messaging applications and devices that facilitate instant messaging now allow users to set an “availability setting” indicating that the user is “logged off”, “away from the desk”, “available”, and other settings that indicate a level of availability. In one example, a user may designate for a particular availability setting to be automatically selected when no user activity at a particular device is detected over a particular period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When an intended recipient of a messaging request is unavailable, the intended recipient may have a designated backup recipient. Currently, however, messaging systems are limited because a requester will have to search for the designated backup recipient for the intended recipient in a directory and then initiate another messaging session with the designated backup recipient. Further, messaging systems are limited because when the requester initiates another messaging session, the initial intended recipient is left out of the communication. Moreover, as described with reference to co-pending patent application titled “AUTOMATED SELECTION OF A BACKUP RECIPIENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF AN INSTANT MESSAGING REQUEST TO THE BACKUP RECIPIENT”, Ser. No. 11/006,125, herein incorporated by reference, messaging systems are limited because a requester searching for a backup recipient is typically limited to a single backup in a business directory, where that backup is only a backup for business subject matter, however, requesters may need a backup recipient for other types of subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, in view of the foregoing, it would be advantageous to provide a method, system, and program for automated distribution of a message request initiated by a requester to a backup recipient when an intended recipient is unavailable, wherein the intended recipient is updated with a message log of any resulting communication between the requester and the backup recipient.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, the present invention provides an improved messaging systems and in particular to provides an improved method, system, and program for filing electronic messages within messaging systems. Still more particularly, the present invention provides a method, system, and program for improving automated responses when an intended recipient is not available. Additionally, the present invention provides a method, system, and program automated distribution of a messaging request initiated for communication with an intended recipient to a backup recipient, wherein the intended recipient is updated with the message log from any resulting communication between the requester and the backup recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, a chat support system detects a particular messaging request from a requester for initiating a communication with an intended recipient who is unavailable to respond to the messaging request and, in response, the chat support system selects a backup recipient designated to receive the particular messaging request. The chat support system then directs the opening of a communication channel for a messaging session between the requester and the backup recipient. Then, the chat support system detects a message log of at least one message entry for the messaging session between the requester and the backup recipient. The chat support system then updates the intended recipient with the message log, such that even though the intended recipient is unavailable to respond to the messaging request, the intended recipient is enabled to monitor the resulting messaging session between the requester and the backup recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To select a backup recipient designated to receive the particular messaging request, the chat support system searches at least one from among a directory entry for the intended recipient and a schedule for the intended recipient to identify a backup recipient from among multiple available backup recipients, wherein at least one characteristic of the particular messaging request matches at least one from among a current time period, a requester identity, and an intended subject matter specified in association with the backup recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one example, opening a communication channel for a messaging session between the requester and the backup recipient may include adding the backup recipient to the messaging session initiated by the messaging request, wherein the messaging session participants are the requester, the intended recipient, and the backup recipient. In another example, opening a communication channel for a messaging session between the requester and the backup recipient may include opening a new communication channel between the requester and the backup recipient that is monitored and logged for updating the intended recipient. In yet another example, the chat support system may update the intended recipient with the message log entries as each message entry is sent or may update the intended recipient with the complete message log after the messaging session is complete. Further, if the intended recipient is not logged onto a system during the messaging session where a messaging agent can receive the message log, then the chat support system stores the message log, detects when the intended recipient logs in at a messaging agent, and passes the message log to the messaging agent.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When the chat support system opens the communication channel for the messaging session between the requester and the backup recipient, in one example the requester is updated with the distribution of the messaging request to the backup recipient with the identity of the backup recipient blocked. In another example, the identity of the backup recipient is disclosed. When the chat support system updates the requester with the distribution of the messaging request to the backup recipient, the chat support system may block the requester from sending a message entry to the backup recipient until after the backup recipient has sent a first message entry in the messaging session.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to the drawings and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is depicted one embodiment of a system through which the present method, system, and program may be implemented. The present invention may be executed in a variety of systems, including a variety of computing systems and electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Computer system <b>100</b> includes a bus <b>122</b> or other communication device for communicating information within computer system <b>100</b>, and at least one processing device such as processor <b>112</b>, coupled to bus <b>122</b> for processing information. Bus <b>122</b> preferably includes low-latency and higher latency paths that are connected by bridges and adapters and controlled within computer system <b>100</b> by multiple bus controllers. When implemented as a server system, computer system <b>100</b> typically includes multiple processors designed to improve network servicing power.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Processor <b>112</b> may be a general-purpose processor such as IBM's PowerPC™ processor that, during normal operation, processes data under the control of operating system and application software accessible from a dynamic storage device such as random access memory (RAM) <b>114</b> and a static storage device such as Read Only Memory (ROM) <b>116</b>. The operating system preferably provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to the user. In a preferred embodiment, application software contains machine executable instructions that when executed on processor <b>112</b> carry out the operations depicted in the flowcharts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B, and other operations described herein. Alternatively, the steps of the present invention might be performed by specific hardware components that contain hardwired logic for performing the steps, or by any combination of programmed computer components and custom hardware components.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention may be provided as a computer program product, included on a machine-readable medium having stored thereon the machine executable instructions used to program computer system <b>100</b> to perform a process according to the present invention. The term “machine-readable medium” as used herein includes any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor <b>112</b> or other components of computer system <b>100</b> for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including, but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Common forms of non-volatile media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, a hard disk, magnetic tape or any other magnetic medium, a compact disc ROM (CD-ROM) or any other optical medium, punch cards or any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a programmable ROM (PROM), an erasable PROM (EPROM), electrically EPROM (EEPROM), a flash memory, any other memory chip or cartridge, or any other medium from which computer system <b>100</b> can read and which is suitable for storing instructions. In the present embodiment, an example of a non-volatile medium is mass storage device <b>118</b> which as depicted is an internal component of computer system <b>100</b>, but will be understood to also be provided by an external device. Volatile media include dynamic memory such as RAM <b>114</b>. Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire or fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus <b>122</b>. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio frequency or infrared data communications.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Moreover, the present invention may be downloaded as a computer program product, wherein the program instructions may be transferred from a remote computer such as a server <b>140</b> to requesting computer system <b>100</b> by way of data signals embodied in a carrier wave or other propagation medium via a network link <b>134</b> (e.g. a modem or network connection) to a communications interface <b>132</b> coupled to bus <b>122</b>. Communications interface <b>132</b> provides a two-way data communications coupling to network link <b>134</b> that may be connected, for example, to a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or directly to an Internet Service Provider (ISP). In particular, network link <b>134</b> may provide wired and/or wireless network communications to one or more networks.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Network link <b>134</b> in turn provides data communication services through network <b>102</b>. Network <b>102</b> may refer to the worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use a particular protocol, such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), to communicate with one another. Network link <b>134</b> and network <b>102</b> both use electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link <b>134</b> and through communication interface <b>132</b>, which carry the digital data to and from computer system <b>100</b>, are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When implemented as a server system, computer system <b>100</b> typically includes multiple communication interfaces accessible via multiple peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus bridges connected to an input/output controller. In this manner, computer system <b>100</b> allows connections to multiple network computers.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, computer system <b>100</b> typically includes multiple peripheral components that facilitate communication. These peripheral components are connected to multiple controllers, adapters, and expansion slots coupled to one of the multiple levels of bus <b>122</b>. For example, an audio output device <b>128</b> and audio input device <b>129</b> are connectively enabled on bus <b>122</b> for controlling audio outputs and inputs. A display device <b>124</b> is also connectively enabled on bus <b>122</b> for providing visual, tactile or other graphical representation formats and a cursor control device <b>130</b> is connectively enabled on bus <b>122</b> for controlling the location of a pointer within display device <b>124</b>. A keyboard <b>126</b> is connectively enabled on bus <b>122</b> as an interface for user inputs to computer system <b>100</b>. In alternate embodiments of the present invention, additional input and output peripheral components may be added.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the hardware depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may vary. Furthermore, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the depicted example is not meant to imply architectural limitations with respect to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a block diagram depicts a distributed network system for facilitating distribution of electronic messages between a requester, an intended recipient, and a backup recipient for facilitating one embodiment of the present invention. Distributed network <b>200</b> is a network of computers in which one embodiment of the invention may be implemented. It will be understood that the present invention may be implemented in other embodiments of systems enabled to communicate via a connection.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the embodiment, distributed network <b>200</b> contains network <b>102</b>, which is the medium used to provide communications links between various devices and computers connected together within distributed network <b>200</b>. Network <b>102</b> may include permanent connections such as wire or fiber optics cables and temporary connections made through telephone connections and wireless transmission connections, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the depicted example, a communication server <b>204</b> is communicatively connected to network <b>102</b> and three client systems <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b> are communicatively connected to network <b>102</b>. It will be understood that each of communication server <b>204</b> and client systems <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b> may be distributed in geographically disparate locations throughout heterogeneous types of computing systems operating within disparate local networks. In addition, it will be understood that distributed network <b>200</b> may include additional services, clients, and other devices that are not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, distributed network <b>200</b> includes a client/server environment where communication server <b>204</b> performs as a server for responding to requests and client systems <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b> perform as clients requesting services from communication server <b>204</b>. The client/server environment of distributed network <b>200</b> may be implemented within many network architectures. In one example, distributed network <b>100</b> is the Internet with network <b>102</b> representing a worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use the TCP/IP suite of protocols to communicate with one another. The Internet is enabled by millions of high-speed data communication lines between major nodes or host computers. In another example, distributed network <b>200</b> is implemented as an intranet, a local area network (LAN), or a wide area network (WAN). Moreover, distributed network <b>200</b> may be implemented in networks employing alternatives to a traditional client/server environment, such as a grid computing environment.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Within distributed network <b>200</b>, each of client systems <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b> and communication server <b>204</b> may function as both a “client” and a “server” and may be implemented utilizing a computer system such as computer system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Further, while the present invention is described with emphasis upon communication server <b>204</b> facilitating the transfer of electronic messages, the present invention may also be performed by clients <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b> engaged in peer-to-peer network communications via network <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In particular, communication server <b>204</b> may provide communication services for facilitating multiple types of messaging sessions including, but not limited to, e-mail communications, instant messaging communications, chat room communications, text messaging and other forms of communication supported within distributed network <b>200</b>. Communication server <b>204</b> may facilitate messaging through text, voice, video and other types of communication media.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each of client systems <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b> may include messaging applications or agents, such as messaging agents <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, and <b>224</b> that enable a user at each of client systems <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b>, through a supported user interface, to initiate a messaging session through communication server <b>204</b> to another one of the client systems <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b> and enable a user at each of client systems <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b> to receive messaging session requests and respond to messaging session requests.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one example, a user may be continuously logged on at a client system through a messaging agent, such as client system <b>208</b> through messaging agent <b>220</b>, such that any messaging requests received by communication server <b>204</b> for initiating communication with that user are automatically distributed to messaging agent <b>220</b>. In another example, a user may be temporarily logged on at a client system through a messaging agent, such that communication server <b>204</b> must first determine which messaging agent is receiving communications for the user before distributing the message request to the messaging agent through a client system. If a user cannot be located logged in at a particular client system, then communication server <b>204</b> may store messaging requests for the user until a messaging agent communications with communication server <b>204</b> to authenticate the user at a particular client system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Even though a user is logged in at one of client systems <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, or <b>212</b>, whether continuously or temporarily, the user may not be available to receive or respond to all messaging requests. As will be further described in detail, according to an advantage of the invention, when a user is not available to receive or respond to messaging requests, communication server <b>204</b> automatically selects a backup recipient for the messaging request and distributes the messaging request to the backup recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, a user logged in at one of client systems <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, or <b>212</b> may select an availability status indicator of the user's availability through one of messaging agents <b>220</b>, <b>222</b> or <b>224</b>. In general, a user may select an availability of “available” or “unavailable” and may specify messages to further clarify why the user is “available” or “unavailable”. In addition, a user may select to log off communication server <b>204</b>, through one of the messaging agents, as a way to select an availability status indicator of “unavailable”.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is important to note in distributing a message request to the backup recipient, communication server <b>204</b> may set up different types of communication channels. In one example, communication server <b>204</b> may designate the messaging request from the requester to the intended recipient as a chat session request and add the backup recipient to the chat session, such that all three parties are part of the chat based messaging session. In another example, communication server <b>204</b> may open a messaging session between the requester and the backup recipient and update the intended recipient with a real-time message log or a stored message log from the messaging session between the requester and the backup recipient. In addition, other messaging session configurations may be implemented depending on the types of communication channels and number of participants in a messaging session supported by communication server <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It will be understood that for electronic communications, a user may be identified by a user identifier (user ID) in multiple forms including, but not limited to, an e-mail address, an IM name, a chat name, a telephone number, and other electronic location identifiers. Further, it will be understood that a single user may be identified by multiple user IDs of the same and different forms.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is depicted a block diagram of a communication server accessing a directory system, a calendar system, and a backup system to select a backup recipient for a messaging request for an intended recipient who is unavailable to receive or respond to messaging requests in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As depicted, communication server <b>204</b> is enabled to communicate with a directory system <b>304</b>, a calendar system <b>306</b>, and a backup system <b>308</b> via network <b>102</b> to determine an availability of an intended recipient of a messaging request and to select a backup recipient if the intended recipient is unavailable. It will be understood that communication server <b>204</b> may also communicate with other servers and may access other databases to determine an availability of an intended recipient of a messaging request and to select a backup recipient. For example, in determining an availability of an intended recipient, communication server <b>204</b> may also query a messaging agent or a device on which a messaging agent executes to determine an availability status of an intended recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, communication server <b>204</b> includes at least one communication controller <b>312</b> that facilitates at least one type of communication stream or session. For example, communication controller <b>312</b> may facilitate instant message based communications. As previously described, client systems <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b> may include additional software, such as messaging agents <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, and <b>224</b>, that enables sending and receiving of instant message based communications via communication controller <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, in one embodiment, communication server <b>204</b> includes a query support system <b>314</b>. In one example, a user at a client system may need to initiate a communication with an intended recipient whose user ID is unknown to the user. The user may submit information that is known, such as a subject matter of the communication, a group name, or a telephone number to communication controller <b>312</b>. Communication controller <b>312</b> may pass the information to query support system <b>314</b>, wherein query support system <b>314</b> then attempts to identify a user ID for the intended recipient based on the information. Query support system <b>314</b> may first parse the information and specify the classification of information. For example, if a user enters “manager of product A”, then query support system <b>314</b> may parse the information phrase into “manager” which is a role classification and “product A” which is an intended subject matter classification. In addition, query support system <b>314</b> may search directory system <b>304</b>, calendar system <b>306</b>, and backup system <b>308</b> with the parsed information to determine a user ID for the intended recipient. Further, as will be further described, the parsed information may be used to search directory system <b>304</b>, calendar system <b>306</b>, and backup system <b>308</b> to select a backup recipient for the intended recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to an advantage, communication server <b>204</b> also includes a chat support system <b>310</b>. Chat support system <b>310</b> monitors whether an intended recipient is available to receive or respond to messaging requests; if the intended recipient is not available, then chat support system <b>310</b> automatically selects a backup recipient for the messaging request and automatically controls distribution of the messaging request to the backup recipient. As previously referenced, chat support system <b>310</b> may distribute the messaging request to the backup recipient by directing communication controller <b>312</b> to add the backup recipient to the messaging session or directing communication controller <b>312</b> to open a new messaging session between the requester and the backup recipient. Further, chat support system <b>310</b> may intervene as an additional participant in the messaging session to query the requester for additional information and to inform the requester, intended recipient, and backup recipient about the distribution of the messaging request to a backup recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one example, when chat support system <b>310</b> distributes the messaging request to the backup recipient, chat support system <b>310</b> informs the requester of the distribution and of the identity of the backup recipient. In another example, chat support system <b>310</b> may inform the requester of the distribution, but not inform the requester of the identity of the backup recipient. Further, in another example, chat support system may not inform the requester of the distribution or of the identity of the backup recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When chat support system <b>310</b> informs the requester of the distribution to a backup recipient, chat support system <b>310</b> may allow the requester to send the initial message entry to the backup recipient. In another example, chat support system <b>310</b> may block the requester from sending the initial message entry, and may only allow the requester to respond to an initially message entry by the backup recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, directory system <b>304</b> includes static and dynamic contact information about multiple users. Static information may include, for example, a user name, user instant messaging identifier, user email address, user work telephone number, user work cell phone number, user work group, user address, and other information that identifies a user and identifies contact information for the user. Dynamic information may include, for example, past and current projects for a user, a user location, a user holiday schedule, and other information about a user that the user or others may update and that identifies a user and identifies contact information for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition, in one embodiment, calendar system <b>306</b> includes task entries that indicate the availability of a recipient of a communication. Within calendar system <b>306</b>, for a time period, a user may designate a location, a subject matter, a general availability, which communication devices at which a user can receive communications, which requesters the user will receive communications from, other participants in the task, and other information collected from other systems and entered by the user to indicate current activity. Further, according to an advantage, a time period entry in a calendar system <b>306</b> for a user may indicate backup recipients for communications received by the user during the time period, where backup recipients may be further specified according to multiple factors including, but not limited to, the subject matter of the intended communication and the requester of the intended communication.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, in one embodiment, a backup directory system <b>308</b> includes general backup recipients for a user. Backup recipients may be identified by user ID or by a general grouping. Further, backup recipients may be specified according to multiple factors such as the subject matter of the intended communication and requester of the intended communication.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is important to note that a single user may register information at multiple directory systems, calendar systems, and backup systems. For example, a single user may register for multiple IM IDs, each supported by a different instant messaging communication controller and by a different messaging agent at a client system. In another example, a single user may maintain a business calendar on a calendar system that is a remote server and a personal calendar on a calendar system that is a client system. Thus, query support system <b>314</b> and chat support system <b>310</b> may access multiple directory systems, calendar systems, and backup systems to identify a userID for an intended recipient and to identify backup recipients for communications when an intended recipient is unavailable.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, it is important to note that communication controller <b>312</b> and chat support system <b>310</b> may operate independent of any single messaging service carrier and may operate independent of one another. For example, chat support system <b>310</b> may be implemented within a business network to detect messaging requests from multiple communication systems controllers operating outside the business network.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, it is important to note that chat support system <b>310</b> may determine whether an intended recipient or backup recipient is available or unavailable by checking the selected status availability indicator, as received from a client system, and searching calendars for current scheduled activity. In addition, chat support system <b>310</b> may detect actual activity of an intended or backup recipient by detecting which devices (not depicted) accessible to the intended or backup recipient are in use and by detecting other actual activity through devices that monitor a user's activity. Then, chat support system <b>310</b> may adjust an availability setting for an intended or backup recipient based on the recipient's actual activity and scheduled activity. For example, if a user sets a status availability indicator to “available”, but chat support system <b>310</b> receives an indication that the user is on the phone, chat support system <b>310</b> may change the user's status to “unavailable” and add a time delay to the user's unavailability based on the user's actual activity. In another example, if a user sets a status availability indicator to “available”, but chat support system <b>310</b> detects a scheduled conference call, then chat support system <b>310</b> may change the user's status to “unavailable”.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is depicted a block diagram illustrating entries in a directory system, calendar system, and backup system for a particular intended recipient in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Chat support system <b>310</b> may identify at least one directory entry, such as directory system entry <b>404</b>. In the example, directory system entry <b>404</b> includes the user ID listings for a user named “John Adler”. In particular, an email address, a personal IM ID, a business IM ID, a work phone number, and cell phone number are listed as user IDs for “John Adler”. In addition, dynamic information about the user's job description, such as the current projects and business role for “John Adler” are listed. As previously described, query support system <b>314</b> may search directory system entry <b>404</b> to find a user ID for “John Adler” for the type of messaging request of which he is an intended recipient. In addition, as previously described, query support system <b>314</b> may search directory system entry <b>404</b> with parsed search information to determine if “John Adler” fits the profile for an intended recipient of a messaging request. It is important to note that directory system entry <b>404</b> may be collected from a single directory system or compiled from results returned from multiple directory systems.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition, chat support system <b>310</b> may identify at least one calendar entry specified for a current time period, such as calendar system entry <b>406</b>. In the example, calendar system entry <b>406</b> includes a time period specification of “Monday” from “10 AM-1 PM”. During this time period specification, the user “John Adler” is designated to be located at a doctor's appointment and available for communications requests received by cell phone, but not for messaging requests. In an alternate embodiment, a calendar system entry <b>406</b> that indicates that a user is away from the office may be analyzed by chat support system <b>310</b> which infers, based on the user's location or current activity, that the user is not available for responding to messaging requests.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In particular, during this time period specification in calendar system entry <b>406</b>, backups are designated for chat messaging requests where “John Adler” is the intended recipient based on the identity of the requester of the chat messaging session. For example, if the chat request is received from “Dr. Smith”, then the backup recipient is “wife” and if the chat request is received from “James Davis”, then the backup recipient is “employee C”, where “employee C”.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, during this time period specification in calendar system entry <b>406</b>, backups are designated for chat messaging requests where “John Adler” is the intended recipient based on the intended subject matter for the chat communication. For example, if the intended subject matter of the request is “project XY”, then the backup recipient is “employee A” and if the subject matter of the request is “project Z”, then the first backup recipient is “employee D” and the second backup recipient is “administrator A”.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When a user specifies a backup recipient preference based on the requester identity or the intended subject matter of the communication, the user may also specify whether to disclose the identity of the backup recipient to the requester when the messaging request is distributed to the backup recipient. In the example, backup recipient “wife” and “employee A” are designated as “(blind)” to indicate that the user does not want the requester notified of the backup recipient's identity.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In addition, when a user specifies a backup recipient preference, the user may also specify whether to disclose to the requester that the messaging request is distributed to a backup recipient. In the example, backup recipient “employee C” is designated as “(no disclose)” to indicate that the user does not want the requester notified that the chat messaging request was distributed to a backup recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, when a user specifies a backup recipient preference, the user may also specify what level of available depth to allow for a distribution of a messaging request to a backup recipient. In particular, the level of available depth indicates whether to distribute the messaging request to a backup recipients' backup if the user's first backup recipient is not available. In the example, following each backup recipient designation is a number in parenthesis that indicates the level of available depth to allow in searching for a backup recipient. For example, for the backup recipient “wife” includes a level of available depth of “0”, “employee C” includes a level of available depth of “2”, “employee A” includes a level of available depth of “1” and “employee D” and “administrator A” both have a level of available depth of “0”. Thus, for “wife”, “employee D”, and “administrator A”, if the backup recipient is not available, then no additional action is taken to distribute the messaging request. If “employee C” is not available, however, then a calendar system entry and backup system entry for “employee C” may be accessed and a backup for “employee C” selected to receive the messaging request. If the backup for “employee C” is not available, then another level of backups may be accessed. It will be understood that a user may further specify, with the level of available depth, whether to bar certain backup recipients and may assign a particular security clearance level requirement to any potential backup where a level of available depth of one or more is allowed. Further, it will be understood that if no backups are available, then chat support system <b>310</b> may select a default backup.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Additionally, when a user specifies a backup recipient preference, the user may also specify what priority to give a particular backup recipient when more than one backup recipient is specified for a particular criteria. For example, for messaging requests with an intended subject matter of “project Z”, two backup recipients are specified, where “employee D” is given first priority as a backup recipient and “administrator A” is given second priority as a backup recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, when a user specifies a backup recipient preference, the user may also specify whether the requester is blocked from initiating a first reply message entry once the messaging request from the requester is distributed to the backup recipient. For example, the user has selected that the requester will be blocked from initiating the first reply entry if the backup recipient is “employee D” as indicated by “(BLOCK REPLY)”.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, in the example, a backup system entry <b>408</b> includes backup designations independent of a calendar time period. In the example, backups are specified for phone calls and chat communications according to requester. In one example, if “John Adler” is not available to take a phone call, then those users designated in “employee group A” are searched for availability and the phone call is distributed to a backup recipient. In another example, if “John Adler” is not available to respond to a chat message detected from an internal address, then the chat messaging request is distributed to a backup “SamJones”. In particular, a business may implement a chat communication controller within the business network, where each employee is assigned a chat ID and an employee may specify a backup recipient for all messaging requests generated from an internal employee chat ID.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is depicted an illustrative example of a backup preference interface through which a user may select backup preferences in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As depicted, a chat backup specification window <b>502</b> is an interface through which a user may interact by entering keystrokes, voice commands, pointer controls, and other inputs as will be understood in the art of user interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In particular, a user may select chat messaging request criteria, such as who the chat request is from, as depicted at reference numeral <b>504</b>, the intended subject matter of the chat request, as depicted at reference numeral <b>508</b>, and other criteria specifiable by the user. In specifying the “from” criteria at reference numeral <b>504</b>, a user may specify multiple requesters and may specify requesters by individual name, group name, or other distinguishable criteria. In specifying the “subject matter” criteria at reference numeral <b>506</b>, a user may specify multiple subject matter criteria and may specify subject matter by topic, keyword, phrase, project, or other distinguishable criteria. In addition, it will be understood that additional criteria and types of criteria specifications may be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Next, a user may select a backup recipient, as depicted at reference numeral <b>510</b>. In particular, in specifying the “backup recipient”, the user may specify multiple recipients and assign a priority to each recipient. Further, the user may specify a backup recipient by an individual name or may specify a group of recipients, where the first available person in the group will then be selected as the backup recipient. It will be understood that an additional window may depict a directory of available backup recipients and that a user may select backup recipients to fill in at reference numeral <b>510</b> from the additional directory window.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, a user may select whether to keep the identity of the backup recipient undisclosed to the requester by selecting the “blind” preference depicted at reference numeral <b>512</b>. In addition, a user may select whether to disclose that the chat request is distributed to a backup by selecting the “no disclose” preference depicted at reference numeral <b>516</b>. Moreover, a user may select whether to allow a requester who is notified of the distribution of the messaging request to a backup recipient to initiate a first message entry to the backup recipient by selecting the “block reply” preference depicted at reference numeral <b>515</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Additionally, a user may select whether to associate a time period with the chat backup preference. In the example, a user may select a button to “open calendar” as depicted at reference numeral <b>518</b>, which will trigger a calendar window in which the user may highlight a portion of the schedule to associated with the chat backup preference. Alternatively, although not depicted, a user may trigger chat backup specification window <b>502</b> from a calendaring application, where the chat backup preferences selected within chat backup specification window <b>502</b> are then associated with a selected time period by the calendaring application.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref>, there is depicted an illustrative example of a distribution of a messaging request to a backup recipient selected based on the intended subject matter of the communication. As illustrated, a requester “SALSON” initiates a communication to intended recipient “JOHNAD” via chat start window <b>602</b>. In the initial messaging request, SALSON includes a message <b>606</b> and selects to send the message by selecting send button <b>608</b>. A particular communication server or group of communication servers may support a communication channel between a client system used by requester “SALSON” and a client system used by the intended recipient “JOHNAD”.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A communication controller receives the messaging request to initiate a messaging session from the requester messaging agent facilitating chat start window <b>602</b> and distributes the messaging request to a intended recipient messaging agent at a client system logged on to by “JOHNAD”. The intended recipient messaging agent then facilitates display of a window <b>630</b> depicting the messaging request. As illustrated, window <b>630</b> includes an indicator of who the request is from and to, as depicted at reference numeral <b>632</b>. Further, window <b>630</b> includes the message entered by the requester, as depicted at reference numeral <b>634</b>, an area to enter a reply as illustrated at reference numeral <b>636</b>, and a selectable send button <b>638</b>. In particular, in this embodiment, it is assumed that intended recipient “JOHNAD” is not available to respond to the messaging request, but is logged on via the intended recipient messaging agent so that messaging requests are still passed to the intended recipient messaging agent as the messaging requests occur.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition, chat support system <b>310</b> detects the messaging request initiated through chat start window <b>602</b> from the requester messaging agent and determines whether intended recipient “JOHNAD” is available. As previously described, chat support system <b>310</b> may reference directory system entry <b>404</b>, calendar system entry <b>406</b>, backup system entry <b>408</b> to determine the availability and backups for “JOHNAD”. Alternatively, chat support system <b>310</b> may be initiated when a communication controller determines that the intended recipient is unavailable. In the example, assuming that the time period during which the messaging request is initiated is within the time period referenced in calendar system entry <b>404</b>, chat support system <b>310</b> will (1) determine that the intended recipient “JOHNAD” is not available for chat communications; and (2) return a request to the requester for an intended subject matter of the communication. In particular, in the example, chat support system <b>310</b> may control prompting a requester for an intended subject matter by becoming a participant in the messaging session or by opening a separate messaging session to prompt the requester, for example. Chat support system <b>310</b> then uses the intended subject matter provided by the requester to select a backup recipient for the subject matter requested.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one example, window <b>610</b> indicates that the communication is from “chatsupport” to “SALSON” with a next message entry depicted at reference numeral <b>612</b> prompting “SALSON” to indicate an intended subject matter. As depicted at reference numeral <b>614</b>, “SALSON” enters a reply of “the timeline for project Z” and selects to send the message entry through selection of send button <b>616</b>. In particular, in the example depicted, window <b>610</b> may be a new window or window <b>610</b> may be an updated version of window <b>602</b> with the next message entry depicted at reference numeral <b>612</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Chat support system <b>310</b> receives the reply and (1) parses the reply from “SALSON”; (2) compares the parsed message with the subject matter backup criteria; (3) detects “employee D” as the designated backup for chat requests about “project Z”; and (4) distributes the message request to “employee D”, “JOHNAD”, and “SALSON”.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the example, chat support system <b>310</b> directs communication controller <b>312</b> to distribute the messaging session to “employee D” and to update the messaging windows for “JOHNAD” and “SALSON” to indicate the distribution. As depicted, window <b>620</b> indicates that the messaging request has been distributed to a backup recipient and the identity of the backup recipient as indicated at reference numeral <b>622</b>. Further, a message entry indicated at reference numeral <b>624</b> indicates from “chatsupport” that the messaging request was distributed and provides a reply block <b>626</b> and a selectable send button <b>628</b>. Further, as depicted, window <b>640</b> updates window <b>630</b> with the message entries exchanged between “chatsupport” and “SALSON” as illustrated at reference numeral <b>642</b>. In addition, as depicted, window <b>650</b> is displayed to “employee D” with the complete message log, as illustrated at reference numeral <b>652</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In particular, in the example, chat support system <b>310</b> detects that the backup recipient is designated as one with which the requester is blocked from initiating. As illustrated in reply block <b>626</b>, the requester is notified that replies are blocked, however, once “employee D” initiates a first message entry, then the requester reply block is removed, as illustrated at reference numeral <b>662</b> in window <b>660</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Next, “employee D” responds with an initial message entry, as depicted at reference numeral <b>654</b> and through selection of send button <b>656</b>, and communication controller <b>312</b> directs the response to “SALSON” as depicted in window <b>660</b> and to “JOHNAD” as depicted in window <b>670</b>. Additionally, window <b>680</b> shows the updated message log for the view of “employee D”.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It is important to note that while in the depicted example the message log displayed for the intended recipient is concurrently updated with the message entries by the requester and the backup recipient, in alternate embodiments, the message log may be stored during the messaging session and then at the conclusion of the messaging session or at different periods throughout the messaging session, the intended recipient messaging agent is updated with the message log. Further, it is important to note that throughout the messaging session depicted, additional updates to message logs displayed at the requester messaging agent, intended recipient messaging agent, and the backup recipient messaging agent may occur which were not depicted herein.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7B</figref>, there is depicted an illustrative example of a distribution of a messaging request to a blind backup recipient selected based on the identity of the requester. As illustrated, a requester “DR. SMITH” initiates a communication to intended recipient “JOHNAD” via chat start window <b>702</b>. In the initial messaging request, “DR. SMITH” adds a message entry <b>706</b> and selects to send the message by selecting send button <b>708</b>. A particular communication server or group of communication server may support a communication channel between a client system used by requester “DR. SMITH” and a client system used by the intended recipient “JOHNAD”.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A communication controller receives the request to send the messaging request initiated through chat start window <b>702</b> facilitated by a requester messaging agent and distributes the messaging request to an intended recipient messaging agent logged on to by “JOHNAD”. The intended recipient messaging agent enables display of a window <b>730</b> depicting the messaging request. As illustrated, window <b>730</b> includes an indicator of who the request is from and to and that the message request is distributed to a backup recipient, as depicted at reference numeral <b>732</b>. Further, window <b>730</b> includes the message entered by the requester, as depicted at reference numeral <b>734</b> and an area to enter a reply as illustrated at reference numeral <b>736</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In addition, when chat support system <b>310</b> detects the messaging request, chat support system <b>310</b> determines whether intended recipient “JOHNAD” is available. For purposes of example, chat support system <b>310</b> references directory system entry <b>404</b>, calendar system entry <b>406</b>, and backup system entry <b>408</b> to determine the availability and backups for “JOHNAD”. In the example, assuming that the time period during which the messaging request is initiated is within the time period referenced in calendar system entry <b>404</b>, chat support system <b>310</b> will (1) determine that the intended recipient “JOHNAD” is unavailable for chat communications; (2) selects “wife” as the designated backup for chat requests from “Dr. Smith”, where “wife” is a blind backup; and (3) distributes the chat request to “wife” and updates “Dr. Smith” that the messaging request is distributed, but does not indicate the backup recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As depicted, a window <b>750</b> includes an updated message log as depicted at reference numeral <b>752</b> with a message entry that informs “Dr. Smith” that the message has been distributed to a backup recipient, but does not indicate the identity of the backup recipient. In one embodiment, “Dr. Smith” may blindly direct a reply to the backup recipient or wait for the backup recipient to reply.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As illustrated, a window <b>740</b> depicting the messaging request is displayed via a client system accessible to “wife”. As illustrated at reference numeral <b>742</b>, the backup recipient “wife” receives a messaging request indicating that the messaging request was originally directed to “JOHNAD”. In addition, a message log depicted at reference numeral <b>744</b> is updated with the message entry by “chatsupport” indicating that the message has been distributed to a backup recipient. As illustrated at reference numeral <b>746</b>, backup recipient “wife” enters a reply message and upon selecting selectable send button <b>748</b>, initiates sending the reply message entry to “Dr. Smith”.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As depicted, responsive to backup recipient “wife” entering a reply, the addressing area of window <b>760</b> is updated with the identity of the backup recipient, as indicated at reference numeral <b>762</b>, and the message log in window <b>760</b> for the requester is updated with the reply message entry, as indicated at reference numeral <b>764</b> and the message log in window <b>770</b> is updated for the intended recipient “JOHNAD” with the reply message. In one embodiment, the sender may select the backup recipient identifier within window <b>760</b> to access additional information about the backup recipient identifier or request authentication of the backup recipient, for example. In addition, the message log of window <b>780</b> is updated with the reply message entry.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the example depicted, when “wife” replies to the messaging request, the identity of “wife” is unblinded. It will be understood, however, that in alternate embodiments, the identity of a blind backup recipient may not be revealed when the blind backup recipient replies to the messaging request.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there is depicted a high level logic flowchart for the process and program for managing messaging requests in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As illustrated, the process which may be performed by a communication system for facilitating messaging service starts at block <b>800</b> and thereafter proceeds to block <b>802</b>. Block <b>802</b> depicts a determination whether a messaging request is detected. Once a messaging request is detected, then the process passes to block <b>804</b>. Block <b>804</b> depicts searching calendars, devices, and messaging settings for availability indicators for the intended recipient of the messaging request. Availability indicators may include explicit indicators of whether an intended recipient is available or not and implicit indicators based on the intended recipient's current activity or lack of activity. Next, block <b>806</b> illustrates a determination of whether the intended recipient is available. If the intended recipient is available, then the process passes to block <b>808</b>. Block <b>808</b> depicts distributing the messaging request to the intended recipient, and the process ends. Otherwise, at block <b>806</b>, if the intended recipient is not available, then the process passes to block <b>810</b>. Block <b>810</b> depicts setting the unavailability flag for the messaging request, and the process ends. In particular, although not depicted, setting the unavailability flag may automatically trigger a chat support system. Further, selections of steps or all of the steps of the process described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may be performed by a chat support system.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9B</figref>, there is depicted a high level logic flowchart of a process and program for facilitating distribution of messaging requests intended for a recipient who is unavailable to a particular backup recipient in accordance with the method, system, and program of the present invention. As depicted, the process, which may be performed by a chat support system, starts at block <b>900</b> and thereafter proceeds to block <b>902</b>. Block <b>902</b> depicts a determination whether the chat support system detects a messaging request for an unavailable intended recipient. In particular, the chat support system may detect when the unavailability flag is set in the process described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> or the chat support system may perform an independent analysis of availability indicators for each messaging request to determine the availability of the intended recipient. Once the chat support system detects a messaging request for an unavailable intended recipient, the process passes to block <b>904</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Block <b>904</b> depicts searching directory systems, calendar systems, and backup directory systems for backup recipients for the intended recipient. Next, block <b>930</b> depicts a determination whether there is a designated backup selected because the current requester identity matches a specified requester identity. If there is a designated backup based on the current requester identity matching a specified requester identity, then the process passes to block <b>906</b>. Otherwise, at block <b>930</b>, if there is not a designated backup based on the current requester identity matching a specified requester identity, then the process passes to block <b>932</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Block <b>932</b> depicts a determination whether there are designated backups specified according to subject matter. If there are not designated backups specified according to subject matter, then the process passes to block <b>942</b>. Block <b>942</b> depicts a determination of whether there are other applicable designated backups. If there are other applicable designated backups, then the process passes to block <b>906</b>. Otherwise, if there are not other applicable designated backups, then the process passes to block <b>916</b>. Block <b>916</b> illustrates a determination whether the intended recipient is logged on. If the intended recipient is logged on, then the process passes to block <b>920</b> which depicts requesting distribution of the message request to the intended recipient, and the process ends. If the intended recipient is not logged on, then the process passes to block <b>918</b>, which illustrates storing the message request in a message request queue for the intended recipient, and the process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Returning to block <b>932</b>, if there are designated backups specified according to subject matter, then the process passes to block <b>934</b>. Block <b>934</b> depicts prompting the requester with a request for the intended subject matter of the communication. Next, block <b>936</b> illustrates a determination whether the intended subject matter of the communication is received in a communication from the requester. If the intended subject matter of the communication is not received, then the process passes to block <b>942</b>, and the process continues, as previously described. Otherwise, if the intended subject matter of the communication is received, then the process passes to block <b>938</b>. Block <b>938</b> depicts parsing the intended subject matter communication for subject keywords. Next, block <b>940</b> depicts a determination whether there is a backup designated for the intended subject matter. If there is a backup designated for the intended subject matter, then the process passes to block <b>906</b>. If there is not a backup designated for the intended subject matter, then the process passes to block <b>942</b>, and the process proceeds, as previously described. It is important to note that in the present process, the backup order preference is set first for requester identity based criteria matches, second for intended subject matter based criteria matches, and third for all other criteria matches. In alternate embodiments, however, the backup order preference may designate a different order for the criteria used for selecting a backup recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Turning now to block <b>906</b>, block <b>906</b> depicts selecting a first designated backup from the search. In particular, the first designated backup is selected either at block <b>930</b>, block <b>940</b>, or block <b>942</b>, in that order. However, it will be understood that in alternate embodiments, the order in which a first designated backup is selected may vary. Next, block <b>908</b> depicts searching calendars, devices, and message settings for availability indicators for the selected backup recipient. Therefore, block <b>910</b> illustrates a determination whether the designated backup is available. If the designated backup is available, then the process passes to block <b>912</b>. Block <b>912</b> depicts a determination whether a next backup is allowed. If a next backup is not allowed, then the process proceeds to block <b>916</b>. If a next backup is allowed, then the process passes to block <b>914</b>. Block <b>914</b> illustrates selecting a next designated backup discovered during the previous search or performing an additional search to select a next designated backup, and the process passes to block <b>908</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Returning to block <b>910</b>, if the designated backup is available, then the process passes to block <b>950</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. Block <b>950</b> depicts specifying the distribution of the messaging request to the designated backup and the intended recipient. In one example, specifying the distribution of the messaging request requires the chat support system to designate the type of messaging session and participants that needs to be initiated. Next, block <b>952</b> depicts passing the distributing messaging requests to the communication controller. Thereafter block <b>954</b> illustrates a determination whether a “no disclose” is set for the backup recipient. If a “no disclose” is set for the backup recipient, then the requester is not informed of the distribution, and the process passes to block <b>960</b>. If a “no disclose” is not set for the backup recipient, then the process passes to block <b>956</b>. Block <b>956</b> depicts a determination whether a “blind ID” is set for the backup recipient. If a “blind ID” is not set for the backup recipient, then the process passes to block <b>962</b>. Otherwise, at block <b>956</b>, if a “blind ID” is set for the backup recipient, then the process passes to block <b>958</b>. Block <b>958</b> depicts blocking the backup recipient identifier in the requester update message, and the process passes to block <b>962</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Block <b>962</b> depicts a determination whether the “block reply” is set. If the “block reply” is not set, then the process passes to block <b>960</b>. If the “block reply” is set, then the process passes to block <b>964</b>. Block <b>964</b> depicts blocking the sender from sending a message entry until after the backup recipient sends a message entry, and the process passes to block <b>960</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Block <b>960</b> illustrates passing the distribution request and distribution settings to the communication controller, and the process ends. In particular, the distribution request specifies the type of communication channel to open and the distribution setting specifies the disclosure, blind ID and block reply settings. In specifying the type of communication channel, the chat support system may designate whether to open a new messaging session, add the backup recipient to the existing messaging session, or create other types of messaging and communication channels available for enabling a messaging session between the requester and the backup recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
