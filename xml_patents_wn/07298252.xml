<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates generally to alarm systems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an example of a conventional MP3 player. MP3 player includes an interface <b>106</b>, nonvolatile solid state memory <b>102</b>, a decoder <b>110</b>, a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter <b>147</b>, an audio output <b>116</b>, a key pad <b>108</b>, a display <b>112</b>, a controller <b>104</b>, RAM <b>144</b> and ROM <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Controller <b>104</b> controls the operation of the MP3 player in accordance with a set of programmed instructions. Programmed instructions for controller <b>104</b> are stored in nonvolatile memory or ROM <b>145</b>, and RAM <b>144</b> is provided as the working memory for controller <b>104</b></p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Typically, MP3 data, which is a digital compressed format representing music data, is initially stored on a personal computer <b>50</b> and is subsequently transferred to the MP3 player via interface <b>106</b>, under control of controller <b>104</b>. The MP3 data is stored in nonvolatile solid state memory <b>102</b>. Interface <b>50</b> can implemented by a standard parallel port, serial port, USB and the like. Nonvolatile solid state memory <b>102</b> may be implemented as flash memory. Generally, for a music quality recording, a nonvolatile solid state memory having 64 Mbytes can store about 1 hour of music. Flash memory provides the capability of retaining the stored digital data even when the MP3 player is powered down. Once the digital data has been transferred to the MP3 player, it no longer needs to be connected to personal computer <b>50</b>, and the MP3 player can play back the MP3 data autonomously from personal computer <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Decoder <b>110</b> functions to decode and decompress the MP3 data file stored in nonvolatile solid state memory <b>102</b>. Decoder <b>110</b> decompresses the MP3 music file in accordance controller <b>104</b> according to the MP3 format, and decodes the decompressed music file into a bit stream form. The bit stream is then converted into analog form by digital to analog converter <b>147</b> for connection to a speaker, earphone and the like. A decoding program for the MP3 decoder function is stored in the ROM <b>145</b> and loaded to RAM <b>144</b> by controller <b>104</b> as required.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The MP3 player comprises a keypad <b>108</b> for allowing user control and interaction with the MP3 player. Such control may include power on/power off, music selection and volume. The MP3 also comprises a display <b>112</b> for displaying characters or graphics, such as a battery indicator, a play mode indicator, a volume indicator, available memory size and the title of the music being played.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In general, in one aspect, the invention features a method, apparatus, and computer program for an alarm system. It comprises a master unit; and an alarm monitor comprising an alarm sensor to provide a sensor signal representing alarm conditions; a processor to produce digital data based on the alarm signal; and a media access controller to generate a report signal comprising the digital data; and a transmitter to transmit the report signal to the master unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Particular implementations can include one or more of the following features. The processor is further to cause the transmitter to transmit the report signal when the sensor signal meets a predetermined condition. The alarm sensor comprises a camera; and the sensor signal comprises an image captured by the camera. The media access controller is further to generate a packet comprising the digital data; and the transmitter is further to transmit the packet. The media access controller is further to generate an electronic mail message comprising the digital data; and the transmitter is further to transmit the electronic mail message. The alarm monitor further comprises a receiver to receive a further signal comprising a destination address; wherein the media access controller directs the electronic mail message to the destination address. The processor is further to enter a sleep mode when the sensor signal meets a predetermined condition for a predetermined interval; and, when the sensor signal no longer meets the predetermined condition, the processor is further to leave the sleep mode and to cause the transmitter to transmit the report signal.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to an alarm system that transmits digital data representing alarm conditions such as weather conditions, motion, gas content, sounds, and so on. The digital data can be encoded, compressed or both, and can be transmitted wirelessly or by wire, cable, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> there is shown the first embodiment of media player/recorder of the present invention. The media player/recorder includes a wired interface <b>206</b>, a wireless interface <b>210</b>, memory <b>202</b>, a processor <b>300</b>, an output <b>216</b>, a keypad <b>208</b>, a display <b>212</b>, a storage device (the storage device may utilize, for example, a magnetic media (such as a hard disk drive), magneto-optical media, an optical media (such as a CD ROM, CDR, CDRW or the like), and the like) such as, a disk drive <b>230</b>, a preamp <b>232</b> and a voice coil motor (VCM) <b>234</b>. Wireless interface <b>210</b> includes a wireless transmitter <b>209</b> and a wireless receiver <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The operation of the media player/recorder is as follows. Operation of the media player/recorder is controlled by the user through keypad <b>208</b>. Status of the media player/recorder is provided to the user by display <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Media data, which was previously digitized, may be obtained (downloaded) from a personal computer, network appliance, local area network, Internet <b>50</b> and the like, including wireless networks with infrastructure, such as a designated access point, peer-to-peer wireless networks, and the like. Such external devices communicate with the media player/recorder via wired interface <b>206</b> and wireless interface <b>210</b>, which are controlled by processor <b>300</b>. Wired interface <b>206</b> may be implemented, for example, as a parallel interface, serial interface, USB, Ethernet connection, IEEE 1394 (a.k.a. Firewire), and the like. Wireless interface <b>210</b> may be implemented, for example, as an infrared interface, IEEE 802.15, IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth™ and the like. Again the present invention is independent of the interface selected. Media data is then stored on the storage device such as, disk drive <b>230</b> in accordance with processor <b>300</b>. Disk drive <b>230</b> is preferably a miniature drive with a capacity of 1 Gbyte of data storage, which is particularly suitable for a portable device. Of course, any other appropriate sized disk drive may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Alternatively, media data may be obtained directly from an external analog source, such as a microphone or video camera, connected to input <b>214</b>. Input <b>214</b> takes the input signal from external device and sets the analog signal to an appropriate level. The analog signal is then converted to a digital signal and compressed using a selected format by processor <b>300</b>, as will be described herein below. The compressed digital data is similarly stored on disk drive <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the user chooses a selection of media data to be played back with keypad <b>208</b>, processor <b>300</b> powers up disk drive <b>230</b> and retrieves the selected data which is then transferred to memory <b>202</b>. It is noted that the powering up of the device is done in a sequential manner so as to minimize energy consumption of the device. A more detailed description is provided below.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Memory <b>202</b> comprises a solid state memory, such as, for example dynamic random access memory (solid state memory), flash memory, EEPROM, or the like. It is not necessary for memory <b>202</b> to be nonvolatile since the media data is stored in a nonvolatile manner on storage device or disk drive <b>230</b>. The quantity of solid state memory required is less than is required in a conventional MP3 player. The quantity of solid state memory contemplate is about 2 Mbytes, which is sufficient to store about 2 minutes of MP3 data. Of course, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, when dealing with video data, more solid state memory may be required. The amount of solid state memory supplied is selected to minimize energy consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">After the selected data is stored in memory <b>202</b>, disk drive <b>230</b> is then powered down. In this manner, during playback disk drive <b>230</b> is powered up only during the transfer of the selected media data from disk drive <b>230</b> to memory <b>202</b>, which results in lower energy consumption. A more detailed description of the powering down of disk drive <b>230</b> is provided herein below. The media data is retrieved from memory <b>202</b>. Processor <b>300</b> determines the format of data compression from the retrieved data. Disk drive <b>230</b>, also stores the data compression/decompression algorithms. The data is decompressed in accordance with the determined format and converted to an analog signal by processor <b>300</b>. The analog signal is set to an appropriate level by output circuit <b>216</b>. If the analog signal contains audio data, output circuit <b>216</b> is connected to a speaker, headphone and the like for playback, and if the analog signal contains video data, output circuit <b>216</b> is connected to a display device for playback.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additionally, media data recorded on disk drive <b>230</b> or stored in memory <b>202</b> may be transferred (uploaded) to a personal computer, network appliance, local area network, internet <b>50</b> or another media player/recorder through interfaces <b>206</b> and <b>210</b> under the control of processor <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a detailed block diagram of processor <b>300</b>. Processor <b>300</b> is preferably implemented as a single integrated circuit. A media playback/recorder apparatus having a processor implemented as a single integrated circuit can be fabricated at lower cost and have lower energy consumption. Alternatively, processor <b>300</b> may be implemented by discrete components. Processor <b>300</b> comprises a read channel <b>341</b>, storage controller or hard disk controller <b>342</b>, digital signal processor/microprocessor unit (DSP/MPU) <b>343</b>, random access memory (RAM) <b>344</b>, a non volatile memory such as read only memory (ROM) <b>345</b>, digital to analog converter (DAC) <b>346</b> and analog to digital converter (ADC) <b>347</b>. DSP/MPU <b>343</b> comprises servo controller <b>349</b> and Codec <b>348</b>. In a preferred embodiment, DSP/MPU <b>343</b> is implemented as a single integrated circuit. In another embodiment, MPU may be implemented as one integrated circuit and the DSP may be implemented as another integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is noted that DSP/MPU <b>343</b> may comprise a microprocessor unit, a digital signal processor, or any combination thereof. ROM <b>345</b> stores programmed instructions for processor <b>300</b> and DSP/MPU <b>343</b> to control the operation of both the disk drive <b>230</b> (and associated circuitry) and the signal processing of the media data. RAM <b>345</b> is provided as a working memory for DSP/MPU <b>343</b>. For each of the various compression formats discussed above, the decompression and compression algorithms for Codec <b>348</b> are stored on disk drive <b>230</b>. Storing the decompression and compression algorithms on disk drive <b>230</b> minimizes the size of ROM <b>345</b> and its energy consumption. Additionally, this feature allows future compression and decompressions formats to be easily implemented for the media player/recorder.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, wireless interface <b>210</b> is implemented separately from processor <b>300</b>, and includes an antenna <b>356</b>, a wireless unit <b>354</b>, a baseband processor <b>352</b>, and a media access controller (MAC) <b>350</b>. Antenna <b>356</b> is a conventional antenna for receiving and transmitting wireless signals. Wireless unit <b>354</b> converts wireless signals received by antenna <b>356</b> to analog baseband signals, and converts analog baseband signals received from baseband processor <b>352</b> to wireless signals for transmission by antenna <b>356</b>. Baseband processor <b>352</b> converts analog baseband signals received from wireless unit <b>354</b> to a digital bitstream, and converts a digital bitstream received from MAC <b>350</b> to analog baseband signals, both according to well-known methods. MAC <b>350</b> frames the digital bitstream produced by baseband processor <b>352</b>, and filters the frames to select the frames addressed to processor <b>300</b>, both according to well-known methods. MAC <b>350</b> also converts frames received from processor <b>300</b> to a digital bitstream for baseband processor <b>352</b>, also according to well-known methods. In some implementations, MAC <b>350</b> includes an embedded microprocessor.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Prior to discussing the operation of processor <b>300</b>, reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an exemplary data format of a magnetic media used in disk drive <b>230</b>, comprising a series of concentric data tracks <b>13</b> wherein each data track <b>13</b> comprises a plurality of sectors <b>15</b> with embedded servo wedges <b>17</b>. Servo controller <b>349</b> processes the servo data in servo wedges <b>17</b> and, in response thereto, positions the read/write head over a desired track. Additionally, servo controller <b>349</b> processes servo bursts within servo wedges <b>17</b> to keep a disk head of disk drive <b>230</b> aligned over a centerline of the desired track while writing and reading data. Servo wedges <b>17</b> may be detected by the discrete time sequence detector implemented in DSP/MPU <b>343</b>. It is important to note that DSP/MPU <b>343</b> is utilized only during the time period for detecting servo wedges <b>17</b>; during other periods DSP/MPU <b>343</b> is available to perform other functions as described below, such as signal processing for media data playback and recording. By using only one DSP rather than two, the cost of fabrication and the amount of energy consumption can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As described above, the powering up of the device is done in a sequential manner so as to minimize energy consumption of the device. More specifically, the mechanical or motor portions of the storage device are energized first. After the motor reaches operating speed, VCM <b>234</b> is energized, followed by the energization of read channel <b>341</b> and HDC <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The operation of processor <b>300</b> is as follows. DSP/MPU <b>343</b> controls the entire operation of the media player/recorder. DSP/MPU <b>343</b> is coupled to hard disk controller <b>342</b>. When writing data to disk drive <b>230</b>, hard disk controller <b>342</b> receives a write instruction and write data from DSP/MPU <b>343</b>. The write data is temporarily stored in a cache memory (not shown) which is used as a buffer memory. Based on a clock from a clock generator (not shown), DSP/MPU <b>343</b> controls voice coil motor (VCM) and spindle motor <b>234</b> via servo unit <b>349</b>. As a result, the magnetic head is moved to a desired track position on the magnetic disk by the head arm, and the magnetic disk is rotated at a rated rotational speed by the spindle, which is driven by spindle motor <b>234</b>. The data is read from the cache memory and supplied to read channel <b>341</b> via hard disk controller <b>342</b>. Read channel <b>341</b> encodes the write data under the control of DSP/MPU <b>343</b>, and supplies the encoded write data to preamplifier <b>232</b>. The magnetic head writes the encoded write data on the magnetic disk in accordance with a signal from preamplifier <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When reading data from the magnetic disk, hard disk controller <b>342</b> receives a read instruction from DSP/MPU <b>343</b>. Based on a clock signal, DSP/MPU <b>343</b> controls voice coil motor and spindle motor <b>234</b> via servo unit <b>349</b>. Hence, the magnetic head is moved to a desired track position on the magnetic disk by the head arm, and the magnetic disk is rotated by spindle motor <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The data read from the magnetic disk by the magnetic head is supplied to read channel <b>341</b> via preamplifier <b>232</b>. Read channel <b>341</b> decodes the read data under the control of DSP/MPU <b>343</b>, and generates read data. The read data are supplied from read channel <b>341</b> to hard disk controller <b>342</b> under the control of DSP/MPU <b>343</b>, and are temporarily stored in the cache memory. The read data read from the cache memory are supplied to DSP/MPU <b>343</b> from hard disk controller <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As noted above, operation of the media player/recorder is controlled by the user through keypad <b>208</b>, which is in communication with DSP/MPU <b>343</b>. Status of the media player/recorder is provided to the user by display <b>212</b> in accordance with DSP/MPU <b>343</b>. When either uploading or downloading data, the media player/recorder is in communication with personal computer, network appliance, local area network, Internet <b>50</b>. Otherwise the media player/recorder can be operated independently. The user selects the file to be downloaded from personal computer, network appliance, local area network, Internet <b>50</b> by way of keypad <b>208</b>. Alternatively the user can select the file to be downloaded from the personal computer. DSP/MPU <b>343</b> controls the flow of data through interfaces <b>206</b> and/or <b>210</b> and stores the data onto hard disk <b>230</b> in accordance with the method described above. When uploading data to personal computer, network appliance, local area network, Internet <b>50</b> the process is reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">To record data directly input into media player/recorder from an external analog source, the external device is placed in communication with input <b>214</b>. Input <b>214</b> takes the input signal from the external device and sets the analog signal to an appropriate level. The analog signal is then converted to a digital signal by ADC <b>347</b> of processor <b>300</b>. Codec <b>348</b> of DSP/MPU <b>343</b> compresses the digitized data using a default compression format or one selected by the user by way of keypad <b>208</b>. The default or selected compression program is transferred from hard disk <b>230</b> to RAM <b>344</b> and provided to Codec <b>348</b> for encoding. The compressed digital data is similarly stored on disk drive <b>230</b> under the control of DSP/MPU <b>343</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the user chooses a selection of media data to be played back with keypad <b>208</b>, DSP/MPU <b>343</b> powers up disk drive <b>230</b> and retrieves the selected data as described above. The retrieved data is then written to memory <b>202</b>. After the selected data is stored in memory <b>202</b>, disk drive <b>230</b> is then powered down by DSP/MPU <b>343</b>. In this manner, during playback disk drive <b>230</b> is powered up only during the transfer of the selected media data from disk drive <b>230</b> to memory <b>202</b>, which results in lower energy consumption. A single song stored in MP3 format may take approximately one second to retrieve from disk drive <b>230</b>. The media data is retrieved from memory <b>202</b> by DSP/MPU <b>343</b> and the compression format is then determined.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">If the decompression program has already been transferred to RAM <b>344</b>, the program is provided to Codec <b>348</b>. Otherwise the decompression algorithm is retrieved from hard disk <b>230</b> and transferred to RAM <b>344</b>. The data is then decompressed by Codec <b>348</b> and converted to an analog signal by DAC <b>346</b>. The analog signal is set to an appropriate level by output circuit <b>216</b>. If the analog signal contains audio data, output circuit <b>216</b> is connected to a speaker, headphone and the like for playback, and if the analog signal contains video data, output circuit <b>216</b> is connected to a display device for playback.</p>

More specifically, the mechanical or motor portions of the storage device or disk drive <b>230</b> are energized first (step <b>914</b>). After the motor reaches its operating speed (step <b>916</b>), VCM <b>234</b>, preamp <b>232</b>, read channel <b>341</b> and HDC <b>342</b> are energized, since these components are only functional after disk drive <b>230</b> becomes operational. Energy would be unnecessarily expended if preamp <b>232</b>, read channel <b>341</b> and HDC <b>342</b> were energized before disk drive <b>230</b> becomes operational. Therefore, VCM <b>234</b>, preamp <b>232</b>, read channel <b>341</b> and HDC <b>342</b> are energized only after disk drive <b>230</b> becomes operational (step <b>918</b>). Preamp <b>232</b>, read channel <b>341</b> and HDC <b>342</b> can be referred to as a storage circuit and include circuits to transform data stored on a storage device to a digital signal.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic representation of memory <b>202</b>.

In one embodiment, DSP/MPU <b>343</b> uses a pointer system in connection with memory <b>202</b> to determine when the amount of data stored the amount data stored reaches an upper threshold value (step <b>922</b>). When the amount of data stored in memory <b>202</b> reaches the upper threshold value, HDC <b>342</b>, read channel <b>341</b>, preamp <b>232</b>, disk drive <b>230</b> and VCM <b>234</b> are powered down or deenergized (step <b>924</b>). Of course, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, while data is being to memory <b>202</b>, data may also be read contemporaneously therefrom by DSP/MPU <b>343</b> for decompression and playback. Data is then read out from memory <b>202</b> starting at location <b>702</b> towards location <b>724</b> by DSP/MPU <b>343</b> (step <b>926</b>). When the data file has been completely read from memory (step <b>928</b>), the user can select another file.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the simplest implementation, media data representing one selection (such as a single song) is transferred from disk drive <b>230</b> to memory <b>202</b> for playback. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic representation of memory <b>202</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flow chart illustrating an alternate implementation. As shown therein, instead of retrieving just one selection, first portions of multiple selections are transferred from disk drive <b>230</b> to memory <b>202</b>. These multiple selections may include the user's favorite selections, random selections from an external source, or the like (step <b>1204</b>). When the user starts playing back the selection, a timer is started (step <b>1208</b>) and the first selection is played back (step <b>1210</b>). If a user instruction is received (step <b>1212</b>) to continue playing that selection is received within a predetermined time (step <b>1214</b>), the remaining portion of the selection is transferred from disk drive <b>230</b> to memory <b>202</b> (step <b>1216</b>) for continued play back (step <b>1218</b>). If the timer times out (step <b>1214</b>), the first portion of the next selection (step <b>1206</b>) is played back and the process is repeated for each remaining first portion. Alternatively, instead of using a timer, a memory threshold, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, may be utilized permit playback of the entire current selection if the user instruction is received before the memory being read out goes below the current selection threshold. Otherwise the first portion of the next selection is played back. Of course, the play back of portions of selections <b>1</b> through N may be in any order, such as sequential, random and predetermined. If the play back is in sequential order new selections may be transferred from disk drive <b>230</b> to memory <b>202</b> to replace previously played back selections.</p>

This embodiment is similar to the above embodiments, but has no hard drive. Some implementations of this embodiment optionally include a non-volatile memory <b>1602</b> such as a flash memory instead of a hard drive. Consequently the circuits associated with the hard drive are also eliminated, resulting in a less-expensive media player/recorder. In the depicted implementation, baseband processor <b>352</b> and MAC <b>350</b> are implemented within processor <b>300</b>, which is preferably implemented as a single integrated circuit.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The implementations using non-volatile memory instead of a hard drive are especially useful for receiving streaming media from broadcasts such as internet radio stations and other media player recorders. Some implementations feature a “broadcast” mode where the media player/recorder plays a media selection and wirelessly transmits the media selection, either compressed or uncompressed, or in analog form, such that other media player/recorders can receive the broadcast media and play it at the same time as the broadcasting player/recorder.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The implementations with no hard drive or non-volatile memory are especially useful in a “local radio” mode where the media to be played is stored on a personal computer, server, or the like that is separate from the media player/recorder.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates the local radio mode. In this mode, the media is wirelessly streamed to the media player/recorder <b>1704</b>, which decompresses and plays the media without storing the media. Because the media player/recorder never stores a copy of the media, it is ideal for playing media for which only a single copy is licensed. The single copy is stored on a personal computer (PC) <b>1702</b>, and is streamed to media player/recorder <b>1704</b> for playback. Because only a single copy of the media is stored, the single-copy license is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows an implementation where a media player/recorder <b>1804</b> is implemented within a digital camera <b>1802</b>. In recording mode, an image sensor <b>1806</b> within camera <b>1802</b> captures one or more images, and passes a signal representing the image to media player/recorder <b>1804</b>. If the signal is analog, a analog-to-digital converter within media player/recorder <b>1804</b> converts the analog signal to a digital signal. A digital signal processor within media player/recorder <b>1804</b> then encodes the digital signal. The encoding can include image compression, image manipulation, and the like. A storage controller within media player/recorder <b>1804</b> stores the encoded image data on a storage device. In some implementations, digital camera <b>1802</b> is a digital motion picture camera and the encoded image data represents a motion picture.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In playback mode, the storage controller retrieves the encoded image data from the storage device. The digital signal processor decodes the retrieved encoded image data. Media player/recorder <b>1804</b> sends a signal representing the decoded image data to a display <b>1808</b>, which displays the image(s) captured by image sensor <b>1806</b>.A The media player/recorder described herein can be implemented as a portable unit, as a permanently mounted unit within a vehicle such as an automobile, and the like. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows automobiles <b>1902</b>A and <b>1902</b>B equipped with such a media player/recorder. In this implementation, the antenna of the automobile can serve as the antenna of the media player/recorder. The media player/recorders in the automobiles <b>1902</b> can communicate with each other, without user intervention, while traveling near each other, while stopped at intersections, and in other similar scenarios, to share media data, items of interest, and the like. The media player/recorders in the automobiles <b>1902</b> can also communicate with portable media player/recorders <b>1904</b> in a similar fashion. The vehicular and portable media player/recorders can communicate with a stationary base station <b>1906</b> to share media over a network such as the Internet. For example, a homeowner can equip his garage with such a base station <b>1906</b> so the media player/recorder in his automobile can share media and items of interest while parked in the garage during the night. Similarly, a user of a portable player/recorder <b>1904</b> can equip his home with a base station <b>1906</b> so the media player/recorder <b>1904</b> can share media and items of interest while not otherwise in use, for example while the user sleeps.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Some implementations receive and store data other than media data. In some implementations the media player/recorder records biometric data collected by a biometric sensor disposed near, upon, or within a human body or other organism. The biometric data can represent biological functions such as breathing, heart function, body temperature, blood pressure, and the like. Such devices and methods are well-know in the relevant arts, and are described in U.S. Pat.

Alternatively, the biometric data can be passed to media/player recorder <b>2002</b> wirelessly. The data can be passed in analog or digital form, and is received and stored by media/player recorder <b>2002</b> according to the methods described above.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Some implementations feature a “share” mode in which media stored on one media player/recorder can be shared with other media player recorders using wireless data transmissions over wireless interface <b>210</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref> show methods for such sharing. Of course, media can be shared over wired interface <b>206</b> as well using similar methods.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows a controller <b>2600</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention that can function as controller <b>2510</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Controller <b>2600</b> includes a processor <b>2618</b> that includes a microprocessor unit (MPU) <b>2640</b>, a volatile memory such as random access memory (RAM) <b>2624</b>, a non-volatile memory such as read only memory (ROM) <b>2626</b>, an optional digital to analog converter (DAC) <b>2628</b>, an optional analog to digital converter (ADC) <b>2630</b>, a media access controller (MAC) <b>2622</b>, and a baseband processor <b>2620</b>. Processor <b>2618</b> is preferably implemented as a single integrated circuit. A controller having a processor implemented as a single integrated circuit can be fabricated at lower cost and have lower energy consumption. Alternatively, processor <b>2618</b> can be implemented by discrete components. In some embodiments, processor <b>2618</b> is implemented together with one or more sensors <b>2502</b> as a single integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">MPU <b>2640</b> can comprise a microprocessor unit, a digital signal processor, or any combination thereof. ROM <b>2626</b> stores programmed instructions for processor <b>2618</b> and MPU <b>2640</b>. RAM <b>2626</b> is provided as a working memory for MPU <b>2640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Controller <b>2600</b> also includes an interface, which can be a wired interface <b>2606</b>, a wireless interface <b>2610</b>, or a combination of the two.

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Memory <b>2602</b> comprises a solid state memory, such as, for example dynamic random access memory (solid state memory), flash memory, EEPROM, or the like. The amount of solid state memory supplied is selected to minimize energy consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Antenna <b>2632</b> is a conventional antenna for receiving and transmitting wireless signals. Wireless unit <b>2610</b> converts wireless signals received by antenna <b>2632</b> to analog baseband signals, and converts analog baseband signals received from baseband processor <b>2620</b> to wireless signals for transmission by antenna <b>2632</b>. Baseband processor <b>2620</b> converts analog baseband signals received from wireless unit <b>2610</b> to a digital bitstream, and converts a digital bitstream received from MAC <b>2622</b> to analog baseband signals, both according to well-known methods.

MAC <b>2622</b> also converts frames received from processor <b>2618</b> to a digital bitstream for baseband processor <b>2620</b>, also according to well-known methods. In some implementations, MAC <b>2622</b> includes an embedded microprocessor.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Digital data may be transferred between controller <b>2600</b> and a master unit such as network appliance <b>2512</b>, a local area network, the Internet and the like, including wireless networks with infrastructure, such as a designated access point, peer-to-peer wireless networks, and the like. Such external devices communicate with the controller via wired interface <b>2606</b> and/or wireless interface <b>2610</b>, which are controlled by processor <b>2618</b>. Wired interface <b>2606</b> may be implemented, for example, as a parallel interface, serial interface, USB, Ethernet connection, IEEE 1394 (a.k.a. Firewire), and the like. Wireless interface <b>2610</b> may be implemented, for example, as an infrared interface, IEEE 802.15, IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth™ and the like. Some embodiments of the present invention comply with one or more of the following standards: IEEE 802.11; IEEE 802.11a; IEEE 802.11b; IEEE 802.11g; IEEE 802.11h; and IEEE 802.11i. Again, the present invention is independent of the interface selected. The digital data is then optionally stored in memory <b>2602</b>. Processor <b>2618</b> can obtain digital data directly from a digital sensor <b>2502</b>, or indirectly over wired interface <b>2606</b> or wireless interface <b>2610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Alternatively, digital data may be obtained from an external analog source such as an analog sensor <b>2502</b> connected to input circuit <b>2614</b>. Input circuit <b>2614</b> takes the input signal from the external device and sets the analog signal to an appropriate level. The analog signal is then converted to a digital signal by ADC <b>2630</b>. The digital data can be stored in memory <b>2602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> shows a process <b>2700</b> that can be performed by controller <b>2600</b> according to a preferred embodiment. Operation of controller <b>2600</b> can be automatic, controlled by the user through optional keypad <b>2608</b>, which is in communication with MPU <b>2640</b>, or both. Status of the controller can be provided to the user by optional display <b>2612</b> in accordance with MPU <b>2640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">One or more sensors <b>2502</b> generate a sensor signal representing alarm conditions (step <b>2702</b>). In embodiments where the sensor signal is digital, it can be received by interfaces <b>2606</b> and/or <b>2610</b>. In embodiments where the sensor signal is analog, it can be received by input circuit <b>2614</b>, which sets the signal to an appropriate level, and converted to a digital signal by ADC <b>2630</b>. In either case, the sensor signal is passed to processor <b>2618</b> and optionally stored in memory <b>2602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Processor <b>2618</b> produces digital data based on the sensor signal (step <b>2704</b>). For example, the digital data can represent the sensor signal, or can simply represent an alert triggered by the sensor signal. Media access controller <b>2622</b> generates a report signal comprising the digital data according to well-known methods (step <b>2706</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">When controller <b>2600</b> is in communication with a personal computer, network appliance, local area network, Internet, or the like, controller <b>2600</b> transmits a report signal comprising the digital data (step <b>2708</b>). MPU <b>2640</b> controls the flow of the digital data through interfaces <b>2606</b> and/or <b>2610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In some embodiments, media access controller <b>2622</b> generates a packet comprising the digital data, which is then transmitted. In some embodiments, media access controller <b>2622</b> generates an electronic mail message comprising the digital data which is then transmitted to a destination address that can be provided by network appliance <b>2512</b> or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some embodiments, controller <b>2510</b> and one or more actuators <b>2508</b> are implemented together for controlling a physical portal such as a window or door. In some embodiments, controller <b>2510</b> and actuators <b>2508</b> are implemented within the physical portal. In other embodiments, controller <b>2510</b> and actuators <b>2508</b> are implemented within a portal component, such as a lock, that can be installed in a portal.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows a window <b>2800</b> according to one embodiment. While features of the invention are described with respect to window <b>2800</b> and an actuator for opening and closing window <b>2800</b>, other sorts of physical portals and actuators are contemplated. In addition, features of the invention can be located in different parts of the window, door, or the like, such as in the sash, windowpane, door panel, frame, and so on. Window <b>2800</b> comprises a frame <b>2802</b> and a sash <b>2804</b> that can be moved in a vertical plane to open and close window <b>2800</b>. Window <b>2800</b> also comprises a controller <b>2510</b> and an actuator <b>2508</b>, installed inside window frame <b>2802</b> and shown in a cutaway view of window frame <b>2802</b>, that is to raise and lower sash <b>2804</b> according to a control signal provided by controller <b>2510</b>. In this example, actuator <b>2508</b> comprises a motor <b>2806</b> and a sash cable <b>2808</b> connected between motor <b>2806</b> and sash <b>2804</b>. Of course window <b>2800</b> can include other actuators for other purposes, for example to lock window <b>2800</b>, or to obscure window <b>2800</b> by operating blinds, liquid-crystal display windowpanes, and the like, that are within or external to window <b>2800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Window <b>2800</b> optionally comprises one or more sensors <b>2502</b> that provide a sensor signal. Sensors <b>2502</b> can comprise a thermometer, a light detector, a moisture detector, a wind detector, a barometer, a motion detector, a smoke detector, a gas detector, a glass breakage detector, or other sorts of sensors. As described above, controller <b>2510</b> optionally comprises a keypad <b>2608</b> and display <b>2612</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> shows a process <b>2900</b> that can be performed by window <b>2800</b> according to one embodiment. Controller <b>2510</b> receives a signal representing digital data (<b>2902</b>), and obtains the digital data from the signal (step <b>2904</b>). The digital data can represent an instruction to manipulate window <b>2800</b>, or information that can be used by controller <b>2510</b> to determine when and how to manipulate window <b>2800</b>. For example, the digital data can represent a schedule for the operation of window <b>2800</b>. As another example, the digital data can represent current or predicted weather conditions that controller <b>2510</b> can use to determine when and how to operate window <b>2800</b>. For this example, assume the digital data represents a forecast of inclement weather, and therefore controller <b>2510</b> has determined to close window <b>2800</b> immediately.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Controller <b>2510</b> produces a “close window” control signal, and provides the control signal to actuator <b>2508</b> (step <b>2906</b>), causing actuator <b>2508</b> to close window <b>2800</b>. Subsequently, controller <b>2510</b> receives sensor signals from sensors <b>2502</b> (step <b>2908</b>) within and/or external to window <b>2800</b> that indicate rising temperature, increasing sunlight, falling relative humidity, and rising barometric pressure. Accordingly, controller determines window <b>2800</b> should be opened, and provides an “open window” control signal to actuator <b>2508</b> (step <b>2910</b>), causing actuator <b>2508</b> to open window <b>2800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Subsequently a user observes the status of window <b>2800</b> on display <b>2612</b> (step <b>2912</b>), and enters a “close window” command using keypad <b>2608</b>. In response, controller <b>2510</b> produces a “close window” control signal, and provides the control signal to actuator <b>2508</b> (step <b>2914</b>), causing actuator <b>2508</b> to close window <b>2800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In other embodiments, the user can control window <b>2800</b> remotely. Controller <b>2510</b> can transmit a report signal representing the status of window <b>2800</b>. The user receives the report signal, for example as an email message or HTML document on a personal computer. The user enters a window command that is received as a signal by controller <b>2510</b>, which provides a corresponding control signal to actuator <b>2508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">If the signal representing the digital data is unavailable, controller <b>2510</b> can operate window <b>2800</b> according to information provided by sensor <b>2502</b> and/or a stored actuator schedule of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The invention can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them. Apparatus of the invention can be implemented in a computer program product tangibly embodied in a machine-readable storage device for execution by a programmable processor; and method steps of the invention can be performed by a programmable processor executing a program of instructions to perform functions of the invention by operating on input data and generating output.
