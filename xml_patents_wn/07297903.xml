<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to devices for toasting food items such as sandwich buns, hamburger buns, bagels, muffins and the like and, more particularly, to an improved contact toaster that efficiently and completely toasts the food items quickly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Toasted hamburger buns, bagels and muffins are highly valued by consumers for many reasons. For example, toasting a bun results in a caramelizing effect on its interior surface that provides a pleasing appearance and taste. This caramelizing effect also effectively seals the interior surfaces thereby preventing the absorption of juices from the meat and other ingredients, such as ketchup and mustard, into the bun. Accordingly, with the advent of fast-food restaurants that serve sandwiches, devices that efficiently toast a large number of buns in a very short period of time have become desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In response to this demand, devices such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,261,257 to Henderson et al. and 4,530,276 to Miller have been developed. These toasting devices both feature a housing containing a platen having two opposed heating surfaces. Conveyor belts are positioned on opposite sides of the platen and are spaced therefrom. The two halves of a bun are inserted into inlets at the top of the housing so that they are received into the spaces between the platen and the conveyor belts. The conveyor belts in turn slide the internal surfaces of the bun halves across the platen so that they are toasted. When the bun halves reach the bottom of the conveyor belts, they are disposed upon a tray at the outlet of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While devices such as those disclosed in Henderson et al. and Miller have proven to be effective in the restaurant industry, they primarily provide only toasting of the interior surfaces of the bun halves. This is a disadvantage in that, for many reasons, it is desirable to toast the exterior surfaces (i.e. the top and bottom) of a bun as well as heat the bun body internally. Heating the bun exterior surfaces and body provides a softer and warmer overall quality to buns that consumers find pleasing. Heating the entire bun, as opposed to just the interior surfaces, also keeps the sandwich contents warmer longer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, if the food item toasted is something other than typical bun halves, toasting only one side may not be sufficient. For example, many restaurants serve double or triple-decker sandwiches that feature a bun middle section with two interior surfaces or faces. It would be clearly preferable to toast both of these faces. The same can be said for situations where, instead of typical bun halves, the food items being toasted are bread slices. Accordingly, a device that heats both sides and the body of food items would have greater effectiveness and versatility.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As a result, devices such as the one disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,673,610 to Stuck have been developed. The device of Stuck includes the same features as the two patents discussed above but adds a pair of resistance-type auxiliary heaters that are positioned in proximity to the conveyor belts. While this addition allows both sides of a bun half or similar food item to be heated, the device still suffers from a number of limitations.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The auxiliary heaters of Stuck toast the exterior surfaces of a pair of bun halves by radiating heat through the wire conveyor belts. This occurs as the bun halves are slid along the centrally positioned platen. Accordingly, the interior surface of each bun half is heated by contact with the platen while the exterior surface of each bun half is heated by radiated heat from the auxiliary heaters. Any heating of the bodies of the bun halves, however, occurs only by conduction of the heat from the surfaces. As a result, the heating of the bodies of the bun halves is much less than optimal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the arrangement of Stuck limits the temperature level of the auxiliary heaters. More specifically, if the temperature of the auxiliary heaters is set too high, the wire conveyor belts will heat up and burn the exterior surfaces of the bun halves. This results in burnt belt marks on the exterior surfaces of the buns which consumers find undesirable. Furthermore, in extreme cases, the wire conveyor belts could burn down deep so that the bun halves are unusable.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Limiting the temperature of the auxiliary heaters limits the speed at which the device may be operated. This is a very critical consideration in the fast-food industry—that industry depends on providing high quality products at extremely fast speeds. If the temperature of the auxiliary heaters could be increased without burning belt marks into the buns, the device could toast many more buns in a shorter period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As many restaurants, including fast-food chains, have expanded their melt selections, a need has arisen for toasting devices that offer increased flexibility. More specifically, it is desirable that toasting devices accommodate thicker food items, such as muffins and bagels, in addition to the halves of sandwich buns.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The toasting devices of Henderson et al., Miller and Stuck suffer from limited flexibility in that they are able to accommodate only a narrow range of food item sizes. In each device, the spacing between the conveyor belts and the centrally positioned platen may be increased only slightly due to the size of the toasting device housing.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In response to the prior art difficulties, the present invention as well as the toasting devices of U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,192,782 and 5,960,704, both to Agcaoili and March, the contents of which are both herein incorporated by reference, were developed. Moreover, the present invention represents an improvement from other prior art because of the speed in which the present invention toasts the food items. As noted above, in the fast food industry, toasting speed is a critical element to the business of food production. The faster the toasting process, the more quickly customers are served. However, it is equally as important to maintain the high quality toasting standards.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The prior art devices, generally, sacrifice toasting speed for quality—once the devices try to attain a certain toasting speed, the quality declines. For example, in the prior art devices, to maintain the toast quality for hamburger or sandwich buns, the toasting process requires approximately 35 seconds (for bagels and muffins, the toasting process requires even more time). Where the speed was reduced to below 35 seconds, the buns do not demonstrate a “completely toasted quality,” but rather the buns merely show a “browed” color. Such food items are not toasted thoroughly and never attain the caramelization necessary to seal the food item as described above. As such, prior art has not been able to develop a toaster device that can maintain the high quality of the slower processes at a high toasting speed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved contact toaster that expediently toasts the interior and exterior surfaces of a food item.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved contact toaster that expediently and effectively heats a food item internally.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is still another object of the present invention to provide an improved contact toaster that may expediently, efficiently and completely toast a large number of food items in a short amount of time.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is still another object of the present invention to provide an improved contact toaster that may accommodate a wide variety of food item sizes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention is directed to an improved contact toaster for conveyorized toasting of bagels, sandwich buns, hamburger buns, muffins and similar food items that provides high quality, desirable toasted products at improved speeds. In particular, the present device provides for the toasting of food items of varying sizes and shapes at a much reduced speed over the prior art, but also maintains the high quality of the slower toasting devices. For instance, in one embodiment of the present invention, the toasting device can produce fully toasted hamburger/sandwich buns in under 17 seconds, fully toasted bagels in under 30 seconds and fully toasted muffins in under 50 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this example embodiment of the present invention, the toasting device features a preferably steel or metal housing of varying dimensions having multiple inlets of varying size, for receiving the food items of various sizes and a preferably heated outlet or receiving area for discharging the foot items after they are toasted. This embodiment includes a toasting chamber that is located between the inlet and the outlet and may contain at least one, but preferably three conveyor belts. This embodiment also incorporates various electronic and mechanical controls, switches and other components including a drive system with an electric motor that activates the conveyor belts so that they may transport hamburger bun halves, bagels, muffins or other similar food items through the pathway.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows clearly the preferred embodiment of the improved universal contact toaster <b>1</b>. The preferred embodiment of the toaster <b>1</b> is made of steel or some type of heat resistant metal. The toaster <b>1</b> has a back side <b>2</b> and, as seen clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a front side <b>3</b>, a left side <b>6</b> and a right side <b>12</b>, a top <b>8</b> and a bottom <b>14</b>. The toaster <b>1</b> is energized by a power source (not shown) connected, preferably, by a cord <b>44</b> and an on/off switch <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Also in the preferred embodiment, the toaster <b>1</b> has both a lower panel <b>4</b> and an upper panel <b>5</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, as shown, the upper panel <b>5</b> is in the closed position and the lower panel <b>4</b> is secured closed by fasteners <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b. </i>However, the upper panel <b>5</b> can be manipulated open by gripping the upper panel <b>5</b> at the top <b>8</b> of the toaster <b>1</b> along the interior edge (not shown) of the upper panel <b>5</b> and moving the upper panel <b>5</b> in a downward direction at a hinge (not shown) to open the upper panel <b>5</b>. In this manner, the user can manipulate, clean or fix the inner workings of the toaster <b>1</b>. Also, both the lower panel <b>4</b> and the upper panel <b>5</b> include a series of vents <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>to prevent the toaster <b>1</b> from overheating.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As can be seen generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the upper panel <b>5</b> in the preferred embodiment of the toaster <b>1</b> includes caution signs <b>16</b> (for user protection) and labels <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b, </i><b>11</b><i>c </i>and <b>11</b><i>d </i>to distinguish each inlet <b>13</b> so that a user does not attempt to put a food item <b>15</b> into the wrong inlet <b>13</b>. As seen more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, the applicable markings <b>11</b><i>a, </i><b>11</b><i>b, </i><b>11</b><i>c </i>and <b>11</b><i>d, </i>identify the heel inlet <b>17</b> for insertion of the heel <b>19</b>, the crown inlet <b>21</b> for insertion of the crown <b>23</b>, the muffin inlet <b>25</b> for insertion of the muffin <b>27</b> and the bagel inlet <b>29</b> for insertion of the bagel <b>31</b>. In addition, the labels reflect the correct orientation of the food item <b>15</b>, where applicable, for insertion into the toaster <b>1</b>. At the front of the inlets <b>25</b>, <b>29</b> for the muffin <b>27</b> and bagel <b>31</b> is a flange <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>to support and guide the foot item <b>15</b> at the applicable inlet <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Again, as can be seen generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, and more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, in the preferred embodiment of the toaster <b>1</b>, the muffin <b>27</b> and the bagel <b>31</b> enter their respective inlets <b>25</b> and <b>29</b> and move through the toaster <b>1</b>. As is discussed in greater detail below, the food items <b>15</b> move through the toaster <b>1</b> by way of a left side horizontal conveyor <b>33</b>, which, in the preferred embodiment, carries the heel <b>19</b> and the muffin <b>27</b>, and a right side horizontal conveyor <b>35</b>, which, in the preferred embodiment, carries the crown <b>23</b> and the bagel <b>29</b>. In addition, with respect to only the heel <b>19</b> and crown <b>23</b>, prior to moving onto the horizontal conveyors <b>33</b> and <b>35</b>, these food items <b>15</b> enter their respective inlets <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> and move through the toaster <b>1</b> to the horizontal conveyors <b>33</b> and <b>35</b> by moving down the vertical conveyor <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As these food items <b>15</b> move through the toaster <b>1</b>, particles may fall from a particular food item <b>15</b>. The horizontal conveyors <b>33</b> and <b>35</b> and the vertical conveyor <b>37</b> are preferably made of interlocking material so as to allow the food particles to fall through rather than be stuck on the particular conveyor. In this manner, as can be seen clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the particles fall onto a removable left side and right side tray <b>41</b> and <b>43</b>. This provides a user easy and quick access to clean the toaster <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref> shows clearly the control knob <b>45</b> that adjusts the compression tension between the vertical conveyors <b>37</b> and the right and left grill platens <b>47</b> and <b>49</b>. As will be discussed in greater detail below, heel inlet <b>17</b> and the crown inlet <b>21</b> are of different sizes since the food items <b>15</b> are of different widths; however, within each food item category, the widths may differ as well. For example, for one size hamburger a crown may be of a different size than the crown for a different hamburger. As such, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the control knob <b>45</b> can modulate the gap <b>51</b> and <b>53</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>) between each platen <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> and the vertical conveyor <b>37</b> and, therefore, apply more or less heat and pressure to the toasting food item <b>15</b>. The control knob <b>45</b> controls a mechanism (not shown) which adjusts the location of the platens <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> with respect to the vertical conveyor <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref> illustrate the outer facing portion of the air blower <b>55</b> which can be seen through the blower vent <b>56</b>. As can be seen more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, and discussed in additional detail below, the blower <b>55</b> will help apply impingement heat <b>105</b> to the food item <b>15</b> moving across the applicable horizontal conveyors <b>33</b> and <b>35</b>. The blower <b>55</b> also keeps hot air <b>107</b> away from the electronics housing <b>57</b> so as to prevent the electrical controls (not shown) from overheating.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-8</figref> demonstrate the receiving tray <b>59</b> of the preferred embodiment of the toaster <b>1</b>. As the food item <b>15</b> exists the toaster <b>1</b> through the outlets <b>61</b><i>a </i>and <b>61</b><i>b, </i>the food item <b>15</b> falls into the receiving tray <b>59</b>. The receiving tray <b>59</b> is attached to the toaster <b>1</b> preferably by fasteners <b>63</b> (a seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>). The receiving tray <b>59</b> also is heated. The heating source can be any one of a variety of means including, preferably, a foil heater (not shown) located within the receiving tray <b>59</b>. In this manner, the food item <b>15</b> retains the heat and crunchiness provided to it during the toasting process even if the user does not quickly remove the food item <b>15</b> from the receiving tray <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> provide a clear illustration of the front side <b>3</b> of the toaster <b>1</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the front side <b>3</b> includes a bifurcated from door <b>65</b>, which a user may open to clean or fix the internal workings of the toaster <b>1</b>. Similarly to the upper panel <b>5</b> on the back side <b>2</b>, the front door <b>65</b>, which has upper half <b>66</b> and lower half <b>68</b>, can be opened by the user manipulating knob <b>67</b> of the front door <b>65</b> and manipulating the front door <b>65</b>. The front door <b>65</b> preferably includes a series of vents <b>69</b><i>a </i>and <b>69</b><i>b </i>similar to the vents <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>to allow for air circulation within the toaster from overheating. The front side <b>3</b> also preferably includes a touch panel and a display <b>71</b> (however, other displays or monitors can be used), which can be used to control the change in the toaster <b>1</b> from breakfast mode to lunch mode (although other means to accomplish this change can be done including the manual operation of the toaster <b>1</b> by means of turning off the platens <b>47</b> and <b>49</b>) and, in addition, provides information regarding the toaster <b>1</b> temperature, speed and general condition.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> more clearly illustrate and distinguish the exterior <b>73</b> from the interior <b>75</b> of the toaster <b>1</b>. For example, as mentioned, the toaster <b>1</b> has two specific modes, the lunch mode and the breakfast mode. During both the lunch mode and breakfast mode, all the heating elements of the invention are on; however, in other embodiments, to save energy, a user, for example, may turn off the platens <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> during the breakfast mode since they are not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In general, during the lunch mode, the user will insert the heel <b>19</b> and the crown <b>23</b> into their respective inlets <b>13</b> at the top <b>8</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, during the lunch mode, the food items <b>15</b> are inserted into the inlets <b>13</b> and travel through the gap <b>51</b> and <b>53</b>. The food items <b>15</b> moves through the gap <b>51</b> and <b>53</b> by way of the vertical conveyor <b>37</b>. In the preferred embodiment, as seen clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, the vertical conveyor <b>37</b> has one large gear <b>81</b> that drives the conveyor <b>37</b>. The gear <b>81</b> is connected to drive motor on the right side <b>85</b>, but is not connected to the drive motor on the left side <b>83</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the gear <b>81</b> is connected to the motor <b>83</b> by a chain <b>87</b>. As seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the gear <b>81</b> turns the conveyor <b>37</b> through means of the axle <b>97</b>, which spans the width of the interior <b>75</b> of the toaster <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The gear <b>81</b> drives four smaller gears <b>93</b><i>a, </i><b>93</b><i>b, </i><b>93</b><i>c, </i><b>93</b><i>d, </i>via shafts <b>97</b>, <b>99</b> and vertical conveyor chain <b>91</b>. The vertical conveyor <b>37</b> is carried upon vertical conveyor chain <b>91</b>. In this manner, as the food item <b>15</b> enters the inlets <b>13</b>, it will be immediately conveyed down the vertical conveyor <b>37</b>, across the applicable platen <b>47</b> and <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With respect to the platens <b>47</b> and <b>49</b>, as can be seen clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, the platen for the heel <b>47</b> is of a greater width or gap than that for the crown <b>49</b>. As noted above, the basis for this differential is to allow the gaps <b>51</b> and <b>53</b> to vary based on the width of the narrow heel <b>19</b> versus that of the wider crown <b>23</b>. However, in both instances, in the preferred embodiment, the heel <b>19</b> and the crown <b>23</b> fit snuggly against the respective platens <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> as the food items <b>15</b> travel down the vertical conveyor <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the preferred embodiment, the platens <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> are heated by an embedded heating element (including, for example, calrods or other types of similar heating elements) cast into aluminum, bronze or other similar metals (not shown), but other methods may be used as well. The platens <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> essentially provide the first level of toasting for the heel <b>19</b> and the crown <b>23</b>. However, the muffin <b>27</b> and the bagel <b>31</b> do not get toasted by the platens <b>47</b> and <b>49</b>. Instead, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, as the muffin <b>27</b> and bagel <b>31</b> enter into the inlets <b>25</b> and <b>29</b>, respectively, the foot items <b>15</b> immediately drop down a slide <b>101</b> and directly onto the applicable horizontal conveyors <b>33</b> and <b>35</b>. Similarly, the heel <b>19</b> and crown <b>23</b> fall from the vertical conveyor <b>37</b> onto the slide <b>101</b> and then to the applicable horizontal conveyor <b>33</b> and <b>35</b>. Moreover, in the preferred embodiment, the food item <b>15</b> is oriented so that each food item <b>15</b> lands with the face <b>103</b> facing the top <b>8</b> on the applicable horizontal conveyor <b>33</b> and <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As seen clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, in the preferred embodiment, just as the food item <b>15</b> is transitioning from the slide <b>101</b> onto the applicable conveyor, its gets toasted by hot air impingement <b>105</b>. The impingement heat <b>105</b> starts or, in the case of the heel <b>19</b> and crown <b>23</b>, continues the toasting process of the foot item <b>15</b>. The impingement heat dries and further heats the food items <b>15</b> to enhance the toasting characteristics. The impingement heat <b>105</b> is created by the blower <b>55</b> blowing air <b>107</b> away from the electronics <b>57</b> and towards the foot item <b>15</b> coming down the slide <b>101</b>. The impingement air <b>105</b> hits the food item at both the beginning of the horizontal conveyor <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> and the end of the conveyor <b>115</b> and <b>117</b>. In the preferred embodiment, baffles <b>109</b><i>a, </i><b>109</b><i>b, </i><b>109</b><i>c </i>and <b>109</b><i>d </i>keep the impingement air <b>105</b> from escaping and, instead, directs the impingement heat <b>105</b> toward the foot item <b>15</b> at the beginning <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> and end <b>115</b> and <b>117</b> of the horizontal conveyors. Moreover, the impingement air <b>105</b> is warm as it comes from the blower <b>55</b>, but is further heated by the reflects <b>119</b><i>a </i>and <b>119</b><i>b, </i>which are preferably made from heat conducting metals or alloys, and reflect the heat given by the infrared heaters <b>121</b>, which are discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In general, in the preferred embodiment of the invention, there are two horizontal conveyors <b>33</b> and <b>35</b> because the breakfast food items move at different speeds from the lunch food items and, in this manner, as necessary or useful, the user can regulate the speed of the horizontal conveyors <b>33</b> and <b>35</b> through the display <b>71</b>, as discussed above. Moreover, the horizontal conveyors <b>33</b> and <b>35</b> are energized similarly to the vertical conveyor <b>37</b> as described above. In particular, in the preferred embodiment, as can be seen clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-9</figref>, the toaster <b>1</b> has the two drive motors <b>83</b> and <b>85</b> connected to the horizontal conveyors <b>33</b> and <b>35</b>. In both the breakfast <b>79</b> and lunch <b>77</b> modes, the horizontal conveyors <b>33</b> and <b>35</b> are activated so the motors <b>83</b> and <b>85</b> rotate the horizontal conveyors <b>33</b> and <b>35</b> by a connection to a gear <b>123</b><i>a </i>and <b>123</b><i>b </i>in the back end portion <b>113</b> and <b>115</b> of the applicable horizontal conveyor <b>33</b> and <b>35</b>. Again, the gears <b>123</b><i>a </i>and <b>123</b><i>b </i>are connected to the motor <b>83</b> and <b>85</b> by the chain <b>87</b> identified above or, as applicable depending on the conveyor, the second chain <b>125</b>. As seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the horizontal conveyors <b>33</b> and <b>35</b> have a series of standard gears and axles (seen generally at) <b>140</b> the move the conveyor belt itself.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The food item <b>15</b> will move across the applicable horizontal conveyor <b>33</b> and <b>35</b> in a direction <b>142</b> toward the receiving tray <b>59</b>. As the food item <b>15</b> moves across the applicable horizontal conveyor <b>33</b> and <b>35</b>, it is blasted with heat from the infrared heaters <b>121</b> (which can produce heat from a variety of means including, open wire, calrod, quartz or similar materials) that will further toast the food items <b>15</b> to imbue them with the thickness, crunchiness and coloring associated with high quality toasted products. This infra-red heaters <b>121</b> preferably will be controlled with watt regulation without temperature compensation; however, in other embodiments, temperature compensation may be used to control chamber temperature. In addition, underneath the horizontal conveyor belts <b>33</b> and <b>35</b>, are metal plates <b>144</b><i>a </i>and <b>144</b><i>b </i>which reflect heat from the infrared heaters <b>121</b> onto the food items <b>15</b> for further toasting. In the preferred embodiment, there are 8 infrared heaters; however, more or less may be used. The infrared heaters <b>121</b>, and the metal plates <b>144</b><i>a </i>and <b>144</b><i>b </i>cook the food items <b>15</b> to get that additional crispness, caramelization and/or browning just before the food items <b>15</b> exit the toaster <b>1</b> through the outlets <b>61</b><i>a </i>and <b>61</b><i>b </i>into the receiving tray <b>59</b>. As noted above, as the food items <b>15</b> exit the toaster <b>1</b>, the food items <b>15</b> also receive another blast of the impingement heat <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will also be appreciated that the speed of the various conveyors is controlled by the electronic controller <b>150</b> which regulates the speed of the motors <b>83</b>, <b>85</b>.</p>
