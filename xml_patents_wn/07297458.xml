<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0028">Illustrated herein are imaging members, and more specifically, positively and negatively charged electrophotographic imaging members and processes for forming images on the member. More specifically, disclosed herein are layered photoconductive imaging members useful in electrostatic digital, including color, process, and which members contain an optional supporting substrate, a photogenerating layer, a charge transport layer, and an optional protective overcoating layer and wherein the photogenerating layer contains a mixture of a photogenerating pigment, or pigments, an optional polymeric binder, and an electron transport component. In embodiments, the amount of photogenerating pigment and the amount of electron transport selected can each be adjusted to, for example, permit the photosensitivity tuneability of the photogenerating layer. More specifically, in embodiments the amount or concentration of the higher sensitivity photogenerating pigment present in the photogenerating layer can be preselected and varied to, for example, permit a number of different photosensitivities for the imaging members thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0029">Advantages of the imaging members illustrated herein in embodiments include the avoidance of extended milling times of a second photogenerating pigment in the photogenerating layer to thereby avoid/minimize an increase in the dark decay characteristics and maintaining the capacitive charging characteristics at low fields, and wherein the electrical properties of the members are excellent and in some instances improved as compared to similar members without an electron transport in the photogenerating and without adjusting the amount of a photogenerating pigment as illustrated herein. Also, when a blocking layer is present, especially a thick layer of, for example, from about 1 to about 20 microns, there can be achieved a reduction in the residual voltage caused primarily by the diffusion/penetration of the electron transport component from the photogenerating layer into the blocking layer thereby improving the electron mobility of the blocking layer. Moreover, in embodiments when the photogenerating layer contains the electron transport component there is permitted, for example, thicker photogenerating layers while maintaining relatively high pigment concentrations such that much of the light absorption is accomplished at the top, from about 2 to about 5 microns, and which layer may also minimize charge deficient spots and may allow improvements in the preparation of the members and the coating robustness thereof. Also, the presence of an electron transport component in the photogenerating layer can enhance electron mobility and thus enable a thicker photogenerating layer, and which thick layers can be more easily coated than a thin layer, such as about 0.1 to about 2 microns thick.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0030">The imaging members of the present invention in embodiments exhibit excellent cyclic/environmental stability; excellent wear characteristics; extended lifetimes of, for example, up to 1,000,000 imaging cycles; minimum microcracking; elimination/minimization of adverse affects when contacted with a number of solvents such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran and toluene; acceptable and in some instances improved electrical characteristics; excellent imaging member surface properties; and which members can be selected for both drum and belt photoreceptors.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0031">Processes of imaging, especially xerographic imaging, and printing, including digital, are also encompassed by the present invention. More specifically, the photoconductive imaging members of the present invention can be selected for a number of different known imaging and printing processes including, for example, electrophotographic imaging processes, especially xerographic imaging and printing processes wherein charged latent images are rendered visible with toner compositions of an appropriate charge polarity. The imaging members are in embodiments sensitive in the wavelength region of, for example, from about 475 to about 950 nanometers, and in particular from about 650 to about 850 nanometers, thus diode lasers can be selected as the light source. Moreover, the imaging members of this invention are useful in color xerographic applications, particularly high-speed color copying and printing processes.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0087">Device 1: Separately, a charge generator coating solution was prepared where 0.10 gram of 4-n-butoxycarbonyl-9-fluorenylidenemalononitrile and 0.53 gram of PCZ500 were weighed along with 16.34 grams of THF solvent in a glass bottle and rolled until the solids were dissolved.

<p id="p-0080" num="0088">Device 2: Separately, a charge generator coating solution was prepared where 0.20 gram of 4-n-butoxycarbonyl-9-fluorenylidenemalononitrile and 0.55 gram of PCZ500 were weighed along with 17.23 grams of THF solvent in a glass bottle and rolled until the solids were dissolved.

A pull rate of 180 millimeters/minute yields a charge transport layer thickness of 27 micrometers.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE II</heading>
<p id="p-0082" num="0090">The devices of Example I were electrically tested with a cyclic scanner set to obtain 100 charge-erase cycles immediately followed by an additional 100 cycles, sequences at 2 charge-erase cycles and 1 charge-expose-erase cycle, wherein the light intensity was incrementally increased with cycling to produce a photoinduced discharge curve from which the photosensitivity was measured. The scanner was equipped with a single wire corotron (5 centimeters wide) set to deposit 100 nanocoulombs/cm<sup>2 </sup>of charge on the surface of the drum devices. The devices of Example I were tested in the negative charging mode. The exposure light intensity was incrementally increased by means of regulating a series of neutral density filters, and the exposure wavelength was controlled by a band filter at 780±5 nanometers. The exposure light source was 1,000 watt Xenon arc lamp white light source. The dark discharge of the photoreceptor was measured by monitoring the surface potential for 7 seconds after a single charge cycle of 100 nanocoulombs/cm<sup>2 </sup>(without erase). Photosensitivity (dV/dx) was calculated from the initial discharge rate at low exposure intensity, determined at about 70 percent of the initial voltage (about 0 to about 0.7 erg/cm<sup>2 </sup>exposure).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0091">The drum was rotated at a speed of 40 rpm to produce a surface speed of 62.8 millimeters/second or a cycle time of 1.5 seconds. The xerographic simulation was carried out in an environmentally controlled light tight chamber at ambient conditions (30 percent RH and 22° C.).</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0093">Devices 1 and 2 of Example I demonstrate the selective tuning of photosensitivity where, for example, as the loading of pigment decreases the sensitivity of the photoreceptor decreases, but the residual voltage does not concomitantly increase since the necessary mobility was maintained by the introduction of the electron transport (ETM). As the concentration of pigment was decreased from 40 percent to 20 percent, it was replaced by ETM to facilitate the transport of electrons in the charge generating layer (CGL). The diffusion of the charge transporting small molecules from the CTL into the CGL as a result of the coating process enabled efficient charge injection into the charge, especially hole, transport layer (CTL). The concomitant decrease in the dark discharge voltage was commensurate with the decreased pigment loading. A comparison of Device 1 with Comparative Device 2 (prepared with a slightly higher pigment loading in the same binder system) demonstrated the transport advantage obtained from the addition of the electron transporting material, which resulted in lowering the residual voltage while the photosensitivity remained constant.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLE III</heading>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">WEB Example:</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0094">An imaging member was prepared by providing a 0.02 micrometer thick titanium layer coated on a biaxially oriented polyethylene naphthalate substrate (KALEDEX™ 2000) having a thickness of 3.5 mils, and applying thereon with a gravure applicator, a hole blocking layer solution containing 50 grams of 3-amino-propyltriethoxysilane, 41.2 grams of water, 15 grams of acetic acid, 684.8 grams of 200 proof denatured alcohol and 200 grams of heptane. This layer was then dried for about 5 minutes at 135° C. in the forced air dryer of the coater. The resulting blocking layer had a dry thickness of 500 Angstroms.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0095">An adhesive layer was applied over the blocking layer, using a gravure applicator, containing 0.2 percent by weight based on the total weight of the solution of a copolyester adhesive (ARDEL D100 available from Toyota Hsutsu Inc.) in a 60:30:10 volume ratio mixture of tetrahydrofuran/monochlorobenzene/methylene chloride. The adhesive layer was then dried for about 5 minutes at 135° C. in the forced air dryer of the coater. The resulting adhesive layer had a dry thickness of 200 Angstroms.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0096">A photogenerating layer dispersion was then coated on the above adhesive layer by introducing 0.45 gram of LUPILON 200 (PC-Z 200) available from Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Corporation, and 50 milliliters of tetrahydrofuran into a 4 ounce glass bottle. To this solution were added 2.4 grams of hydroxygallium phthalocyanine Type V and 300 grams of ⅛ inch (3.2 millimeter) diameter stainless steel shot. This mixture was then placed on a ball mill for about 20 to about 24 hours. Subsequently, 1.71 grams of PC-Z 500, 0.672 gram of N,N′-bis-(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-4,4′-biphenyl amine charge transport molecules (HTM) and 0.168 gram of 4-n-butoxycarbonyl-9-fluorenylidene malononitrile electron transporting material (ETM) were dissolved in 22 grams of tetrahydrofuran, and then added to 19.26 grams of the Type V OHGaPc slurry. This slurry was then rolled to mix without milling media overnight, about 18 to 20 hours. The resulting slurry was, thereafter, applied to the adhesive interface with a Bird applicator to form a charge generation layer. The charge generation layer was dried at 120° C. for 20 minutes in a forced air oven to form a dry charge generation layer with a final dry thickness of about 3 microns. This imaging member web was overcoated with a charge transport layer in contact with the charge generation layer. The charge transport layer was prepared by introducing into an amber glass bottle in a weight ratio of 40:10:50 N,N′-bis-(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-4,4′-biphenyl amine charge transport molecules (HTM) and the binder PCZ-500. The resulting mixture was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran to form a solution containing 15 percent by weight solids. This solution was applied on the charge generation layer to form a charge transport layer coating with a final dry thickness of about 17 μm. The imaging member resulting from the application of all the above layers was annealed at 120° C. in a forced air oven for 40 minutes and thereafter cooled to ambient room temperature, about 25° C.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0097">Similar web based photoreceptors were prepared with various weight ratios of pigment:binder:ctm (CTM in following Table) ratios where the pigment is Type V hydroxygallium phthalocyanine, the binder is PCZ500 and the charge transport matrix (CTM) is composed of a 4:1 weight ratio of N,N′-bis-(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-4,4′-biphenyl amine charge transport molecules (HTM) and 4-n-butoxycarbonyl-9-fluorenylidene malononitrile electron transporting material (ETM). The resulting layer thickness, reference the Table that follows, was determined by capacitive measurements and transmission electron spectroscopy.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0099">The electrical testing processes of Example II were in the photoreceptor devices of Example III, which devices were mounted and grounded to an aluminum drum with silver conductive paste. Note that devices F to J have similar characteristics to the Comparative Device 3 which has a higher pigment:binder ratio. The dark decay and residual voltage were slightly higher for device E indicating that the ratio of the active transport materials (HTM, ETM) and pigment to the binder was of value to, for example, maintain acceptable discharge characteristics including a low residual voltage and low dark decay while maintaining excellent photosensitivity as indicated. The photoinduced discharge characteristics indicate that as the binder ratio was increased (pigment loading remaining constant), sufficient transport occurred within the charge generation layers, while the devices also exhibited excellent charge injection at both the undercoat and transport layer interfaces.</p>
