<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A mechanism is disclosed for managing a distributed computing system in which a plurality of services are provided by a plurality of members. Initially, one of the members of the system is elected as the global master for the system. Thereafter, the global master selects a service master (where a service master comprises a member of the system) for each of the services provided by the system, such that each service has an associated service master. Each service master may be selected based upon an associated set of service master selection criteria. Once selected, each service master manages requests for the service with which the service master is associated. In this manner, services and the requests for the services are effectively managed.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to computers, and more particularly to a mechanism for managing a distributed computing system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Distributed computing systems are used in a wide variety of implementations to provide computing services on a large scale. Distributed systems offer a number of advantages, including scalability (additional members may be added to the system to provide additional capability), high availability (if one member breaks down, another member can be called upon to provide the services of the broken member), and flexibility (a number of different members may be called upon to provide a service). One drawback of distributed systems, however, is that they are complex and can be difficult to manage. This is especially true if the distributed system has a large number of members, and each member can provide multiple services, such that there is service overlap among the members.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To facilitate system management, a master election mechanism has been developed, whereby one of the members is elected as the “master” of the distributed system. Once elected, the master is given certain management responsibilities and privileges. Thereafter, the master is charged with the task of managing the processing of service requests in the entire system. While this arrangement does allow the system to be managed, it imposes a heavy burden on the master. If the system becomes large enough or complex enough, the master can become a significant bottleneck. As a result, this arrangement does not scale well. Since scalability is one of the advantages of having a distributed system, this approach undermines some of the benefits of having a distributed system in the first place. Given the shortcomings of the current approach, an improved mechanism is needed to manage a distributed system more effectively and efficiently.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">System Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a block diagram of a sample distributed computing system <b>100</b> in which one embodiment of the present invention may be implemented. For the sake of illustration, the invention will be described in the context of system <b>100</b>. However, it should be noted that the invention is not so limited. Rather, the concepts taught herein may be applied to any distributed computing system comprising any number of members and providing any number of services.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Members</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As shown, system <b>100</b> comprises sixteen members M<b>1</b>-M<b>16</b>. As used herein, the term member refers broadly to any component or entity that can participate in a distributed computing system. A member may be a physical entity, such as a node on a network, a computer, a portion of a computer, a peripheral, etc. A member may also be a logical or functional entity, such as a computing process, a thread within a process, etc. A member may even be a group of entities. Basically, any component or entity that can participate in a distributed computing system can be a member. System <b>100</b> may comprise a mixture of physical and logical entities such that some of the members are physical entities while other members are logical entities.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the various members M<b>1</b>-M<b>16</b> are interconnected via a network (for the sake of simplicity, this network is not shown). The network may be a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), an intranet, the Internet, the World Wide Web, or any other network. The network enables any member to communicate with any other member. This does not require, however, that each member have a direct link to every other member. A member may communicate with another member through one or more intervening members. For example, member M<b>1</b> may not have a direct link to member M<b>15</b>, but it may be able to communicate with M<b>15</b> via intervening member M<b>8</b>. In one embodiment, in addition to being able to communicate with other members, each member is also aware of the existence and the “liveliness” of all of the other members in the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Services</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each member may provide zero or more services. As used herein, the term service refers broadly to any functionality or facility that can be invoked. Examples of services include, but are not limited to, functions or methods, database instances, special capabilities (e.g. the ability to serve images rather than just plain text), etc. In system <b>100</b>, four services S<b>1</b>-S<b>4</b> are provided. Which service is provided by which members is shown by the boundary lines. For example, service S<b>1</b> is provided by members M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>6</b>, and M<b>7</b>, service S<b>4</b> is provided by members M<b>5</b>, M<b>9</b>, M<b>10</b>, M<b>14</b>, and M<b>15</b>, and so on. Some members, for example M<b>16</b>, can provide no services, while other members, for example M<b>1</b>, provide just one service S<b>1</b>, while other members, for example M<b>7</b>, provide multiple services S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>. Because some members can provide multiple services, and because different members can provide the same service, there can be service overlap between the various members, as shown by the overlapping boundary lines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">This complex arrangement of members and services can be quite difficult to manage. For example, if there is a request for service S<b>3</b>, which member should initially field this request? Further, which member should perform the actual processing to satisfy the request? These and many other management questions can arise. To address these issues, a management scheme is needed.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">SYSTEM MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW</heading>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Global Master Election</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, management of system <b>100</b> is implemented as follows. Initially, one (or more than one if so desired) of the members is elected to be the global master for the entire system <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, any of the members may be elected the global master. Alternatively, if so desired, the members eligible to be global master may be limited to only a subset of the members. In one embodiment, election of the global master is carried out by way of an arbitration scheme in which all of the members participate. Such master election schemes are well known, and any known scheme may be used.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Service Master Selection</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Once elected, it is up to the global master to select one (or more than one if so desired) service master for each of the services provided by the system <b>100</b>, such that each service has an associated service master. In system <b>100</b>, there are four services S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, S<b>4</b>; thus, four service masters are selected. In one embodiment, the members that are eligible to be service master for a service are the members that provide that service (note: this is not required; for purposes of the present invention, any member can be service master for any service). For such an embodiment, members M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>6</b> and M<b>7</b> are eligible to be service master for service S<b>1</b>, members M<b>6</b>, M<b>7</b>, M<b>8</b>, M<b>11</b>, M<b>12</b>, M<b>13</b> are eligible to be service master for service S<b>2</b>, and so on. It is up to the global master to select, for each service, one of the eligible members to be service master for that service. Because a member may be eligible to be service master for multiple services, the global master may select the same member to be service master for multiple services (e.g. the global master may select member M<b>7</b> to be service master for services S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Service Master Selection Criteria</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In selecting a service master, the global master may apply certain service master selection criteria. For each service, a different set of service master selection criteria may be applied. For example, for service S<b>1</b>, service master selection criteria C<b>1</b> may be applied, whereas for service S<b>2</b>, service master selection criteria C<b>2</b>, which is different from C<b>1</b>, may be applied. It should be noted, though, that each service need not have a different set of service master selection criteria. If so desired, the same set of service master selection criteria may be applied for multiple services.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The global master applies a set of service master selection criteria to an eligible member to determine whether that member qualifies to be the service master for a particular service. Only if the member satisfies the criteria in a set of service master selection criteria will it even be given service master consideration. In some instances, more than one eligible member may qualify to be service master for a service. In such cases, the global master may apply one or more tie breaking conditions to select one of the qualified members as service master. For purposes of the present invention, any tie breaking condition may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A set of service master selection criteria may comprise one or more criteria of any type. For example, one criterion may be that the eligible member must be currently “alive”. Another criterion may be a resource availability condition (e.g. CPU usage of the eligible member must be less than 50%, the eligible member must have at least 3 MB of available memory, the eligible member must have at least 1 GB of available hard disk storage, the eligible member must not be servicing more than five requests at this time, etc.). Another criterion may be that the eligible member must be running a certain version or higher of a certain set of software. These are just examples of some possible criteria. For purposes of the present invention, any type of criteria may be included in a set of service master selection criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As noted previously, a set of service master selection criteria may comprise multiple criteria. In such a case, the multiple criteria may be strung together to form a logical expression (e.g. criteria one AND criteria two AND NOT criteria three). This logical expression is evaluated by the global master at the time of selecting a service master to determine whether an eligible member qualifies to be a service master.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Service Master Functionality</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Once a member is selected to be the service master for a service, it can perform any type of desired management function for that service. For example, the service master can act as a gateway to receive all requests for that service. It can process all of the requests itself, or delegate the requests to other members that provide that service for processing, or process some of the requests itself and delegate the other requests. If it does delegate the requests to other members, the service master can do so in such a way that it balances the workload across those other members. In addition, the service master may monitor the service on the other members, report any irregularities or error conditions, and make adjustments to the service on those other members as needed. These and many other management functions may be performed by the service master.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A service master for a service may exercise some management control over other members that provide that particular service. Note though that, in one embodiment, the service master is master over the other members only with respect to that service, and not necessarily for other aspects. To illustrate, suppose that M<b>1</b> is selected to be service master for service S<b>1</b>. Thus, M<b>1</b> can exercise management control over member M<b>6</b> with regard to service S<b>1</b>. M<b>6</b> also provides service S<b>2</b>. M<b>1</b> has no management control over M<b>6</b> for purposes of S<b>2</b>. Instead, the service master for service S<b>2</b> will exercise control over M<b>6</b> for purposes of S<b>2</b>. Thus, the management control exercised by a service master is service-based.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">By having a service master for each service provided by system <b>100</b>, management of the services is not concentrated in one global master, but rather is distributed among a plurality of service masters. Among other benefits, this enables the system <b>100</b> to scale better. As a result, service-based masters enable system <b>100</b> to be managed more effectively and efficiently.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">REPOSITORY</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">To facilitate management of system <b>100</b>, there is maintained a repository of information. In one embodiment, this repository is global and persistent. The repository is global in the sense that it can be accessed by any of the members in system <b>100</b>, and in one embodiment, can be updated by any of the members in the system <b>100</b>. The repository is persistent in that the information stored therein survives system startups, shutdowns, and reboots.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Members, Services, and Status Blocks</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a diagrammatic representation of a sample repository for system <b>100</b>, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the repository is represented as a matrix, with the list of services S<b>1</b>-S<b>4</b> provided by system <b>100</b> shown across the top, and the list of members M<b>1</b>-M<b>16</b> in the system <b>100</b> shown down the left side. The repository contains a complete listing of all of the members and all of the services in the distributed computing system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">At the intersection of certain members and services, there is a status block <b>202</b>. The presence or absence of a status block <b>202</b> indicates whether a particular service is provided by a particular member. For example, member M<b>1</b> has a status block <b>202</b>(<i>a</i>) at its intersection with service S<b>1</b> and no status block at the intersection of any of the other services S<b>2</b>-S<b>4</b>. This means that member M<b>1</b> provides only service S<b>1</b>. Similarly, member M<b>7</b> has three status blocks <b>202</b>(<i>b</i>), <b>202</b>(<i>c</i>), <b>202</b>(<i>d</i>), one each at the intersections of services S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>3</b>. This means that member M<b>7</b> provides services S<b>1</b>-S<b>3</b> but not S<b>4</b>. Represented in this manner, it is easy to determine from the repository which services are provided by which members.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A status block <b>202</b> may contain any type of information. For example, a status block <b>202</b> may comprise information on whether a particular service on a particular member is currently “alive” or not. A status block <b>202</b> may also comprise information indicating which member is a service master. For example, if M<b>7</b> is service master for service S<b>1</b>, then the status block <b>202</b>(<i>b</i>) at the intersection M<b>7</b> and S<b>1</b> may contain some information indicating that M<b>7</b> is a service master for that service S<b>1</b>. With this information in the repository, it is possible for any member to easily determine which member is the service master for each service. This and any other type of information may be included in a status block <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the repository may be updated by various members for various purposes. For example, a member may update information pertaining to itself. As an example, when a new member (e.g. Mn) is added to the system <b>100</b>, it registers itself with the repository to indicate the services that it provides. Thus, if Mn provides services S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>, then it creates a new entry Mn for itself on the left side of the matrix, and stores two status blocks <b>202</b>(<i>y</i>), <b>202</b>(<i>z</i>), one each at the intersections of S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. The information in these status blocks <b>202</b>(<i>y</i>), <b>202</b>(<i>z</i>) would indicate that services S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are currently “alive” on member Mn.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The repository may also be updated by the global master. For example, when the global master selects a particular member to be a service master for a particular service, it may update the appropriate status block to indicate service master status. As an example, if the global master selects M<b>7</b> as the service master for service S<b>1</b>, then it may update status block <b>202</b>(<i>b</i>) to indicate service master status.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The repository may also be updated by various members to change the “alive” status of other members. As noted previously, in one embodiment, each member is aware of the liveliness of the other members. If a member (whether it be the global master, a service master, or some other member) detects that another member is no longer “alive”, or that a service on another member is no longer “alive”, it can update the repository to reflect this change in status. Thus, in one embodiment, the repository is maintained not by a single member but by the collection of members.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Service Master Selection Criteria</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition to member, service, and status information, the repository, in one embodiment, further comprises one or more sets of service master selection criteria C<b>1</b>-C<b>4</b>. Each set of criteria C<b>1</b>-C<b>4</b> is associated with one or more of the services S<b>1</b>-S<b>4</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, C<b>1</b> is associated with S<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> with S<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b> with S<b>3</b>, and C<b>4</b> with S<b>4</b>. Each set of criteria may be different from the other sets, some sets of criteria may be the same, or all sets of criteria may be the same. In one embodiment, the sets of service master selection criteria are specified by a system administrator. As will be described in greater detail in a later section, these sets of criteria are applied by the global master in selecting the service masters.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">MEMBER OVERVIEW</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown a functional block diagram of a member in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Member <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a representative member of the members of system <b>100</b>, showing some of the basic member components. Since member <b>300</b> is just a representative member, each member of system <b>100</b> may have more or fewer components than member <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, member <b>300</b> comprises a global master election mechanism <b>310</b>. In one embodiment, every member in system <b>100</b> comprises this mechanism <b>310</b>. Mechanism <b>310</b> enables each member <b>300</b> to perform some basic functions. One basic function is to self-register the member <b>300</b> with the repository to specify which services are provided by the member <b>300</b>. Mechanism <b>310</b> also enables the member <b>300</b> to ascertain the existence and the “liveliness” of all of the other members in the system <b>100</b>. In addition, mechanism <b>310</b> enables member <b>300</b> to participate in the election of a global master for the system <b>100</b>. Basically, mechanism <b>310</b> enables each member <b>300</b> to participate and to act as a member in system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Member <b>300</b> may further optionally comprise service master selection mechanism <b>320</b>. In one embodiment, this mechanism <b>320</b> is invoked only if the member <b>300</b> is selected to be the global master. If a member <b>300</b> is ineligible and hence can never be global master, then the member <b>300</b> need not include mechanism <b>320</b>. Basically, mechanism <b>320</b> enables a member <b>300</b>, if elected to be global master, to select a service master for each service provided by the distributed computing system <b>100</b>. The operation of mechanism <b>320</b> will be described in detail in a later section.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Member <b>300</b> may further optionally comprise one or more service management mechanisms <b>330</b> (for the sake of simplicity, only one mechanism <b>330</b> is shown). In one embodiment, this mechanism <b>330</b> is invoked only if the member <b>300</b> is selected to be a service master for a particular service. If a member is ineligible and hence can never be service master for any service, then member <b>300</b> need not include mechanism <b>330</b>. If a member <b>300</b> is eligible to be service master for a plurality of different services, then it may comprise a plurality of different service management mechanisms <b>330</b>, with each mechanism <b>330</b> corresponding to a different service. Basically, mechanism <b>330</b> enables a member <b>300</b> to manage requests for a particular service within system <b>100</b>. In managing the requests, the mechanism <b>330</b> may perform any desired management functions, e.g. process requests, delegate requests to other members, load balance, monitor services, etc. The functionality of each mechanism <b>330</b> may be customized for each service.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Member <b>300</b> may further optionally comprise one or more services <b>340</b>. These services are invoked when a member <b>300</b> is called upon to process a service request. If a member (e.g. M<b>16</b>) provides no services, then it need not incorporate any services <b>340</b>. On the other hand, if a member (e.g. M<b>7</b>) provides multiple services, then that member may comprise multiple services <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For purposes of the present invention, components/mechanisms <b>310</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>340</b> may be implemented using any desired technology. For example, components/mechanisms <b>310</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>340</b> may be implemented using hardware logic components (e.g. ASIC's). Alternatively, the functionality of components/mechanisms <b>310</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>340</b> may be derived via software (i.e. by having one or more processors execute one or more sets of computer instructions). In addition, a combination of hardware and software may be used (e.g. some components may be implemented in hardware while other components are implemented in software). This and all other implementations are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">OPERATION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, and the flow diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>, the operation of the distributed computing system <b>100</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention will now be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, operation begins with system startup (block <b>404</b>). During startup, each member <b>300</b> invokes its global master election mechanism <b>310</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). With this mechanism <b>310</b>, each member <b>300</b> performs some basic initialization functions, including registering the member with the repository. This entails adding the member ID and address to the repository, specifying which services are provided by the member, and specifying the current statuses of these services. Since each member <b>300</b> registers itself with the repository, by the end of the startup process, the repository will be fully populated with a complete list of the members and services in the distributed computing system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Thereafter, while still invoking the global master election mechanism <b>310</b>, each member participates in a global election/arbitration scheme to elect (block <b>408</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) a global master for the system <b>100</b>. As noted previously, such election schemes are well-known, and any known scheme may be used. In one embodiment, the scheme implemented in Oracle Cluster Synchronization Services is used. According to this scheme, whenever a member registers itself with the distributed system <b>100</b>, that member is assigned a number. This number is incremented with each additional member. When it comes time to elect a global master, the currently “alive” member with the lowest number is elected as the global master. If that global master dies, crashes, etc., the currently “alive” member with the next lowest number is elected as the new global master. That way, the global master is the member that has been “alive” for the longest period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Once a global master is elected, the global master updates the repository to indicate that it is now global master. That way, any member can consult the repository at any time to ascertain which member is the global master.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">After a member is elected global master, that member invokes its service master selection mechanism <b>320</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to select (block <b>412</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) a service master for each service provided by the distributed computing system <b>100</b>. The process of selecting the service masters is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The global master begins the service master selection process by consulting the repository, and selecting (block <b>504</b>) one of the services (e.g. S<b>1</b>) in the repository. In addition, the global master retrieves from the repository the set of service master selection criteria (e.g. C<b>1</b>) associated with the selected service. Thereafter, the global master proceeds to determine (block <b>508</b>) which members are eligible to be service master for the selected service. In one embodiment, the eligible members are those members that provide the selected service. Thus, to determine the eligible members, the global master consults the repository and retrieves therefrom the list of members that provide the selected service.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The global master then applies (block <b>512</b>) the set of service master selection criteria to each of the eligible members to determine (block <b>516</b>) whether any of the eligible members are qualified to be service master for the selected service. If no qualified members are found, the global master generates (block <b>520</b>) an error message to indicate that it is unable to establish a service master for the selected service. The global master then proceeds to block <b>536</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">On the other hand, if one or more qualified members are found, then the global master proceeds to determine (block <b>524</b>) whether there are multiple qualified members. If so, the global master applies (block <b>528</b>) one or more tie breaking conditions to choose one of the qualified members as the service master. Once a member is selected (either by way of tie breaker or by virtue of having only one qualified member), the global master establishes (block <b>532</b>) that member as the service master for the selected service. To do so, the global master updates the repository to indicate that the selected member is now the service master for the selected service. In addition, the global master sends a message to the other members that provide the selected service to inform those members that the selected member is now service master for the selected service. The service master is thus established.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thereafter, the global master determines (block <b>536</b>) whether there are other services for which service masters need to be established. If so, the global master loops back to block <b>504</b> to select another service, and to establish a service master for that service. This process continues until all of the services in the repository have been selected and processed. After the service masters are established, the distributed computing system <b>100</b> is ready for regular operation.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, during regular operation, the global master and the service masters work together to manage (block <b>416</b>) requests for services. In one embodiment, the global master acts as a directory service to direct requests to the proper service masters. Specifically, when the global master receives a service request from a requester, the global master determines which service is being requested by the request. The global master then determines (by consulting the repository) which member has been selected as the service master for that service, determines the address for that member, and then sends that address to the requester. The requestor thereafter uses that address to request the service from the service master directly. Thus, the global master does not process the service request, but rather tells the requestor which service master to send the request to to obtain processing and management. By leaving the processing and management of requests to the service masters, the global master prevents itself from being overloaded, and hence, becoming a bottleneck in the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When a service master receives a service request from a requestor, it determines which service is being requested by the request (a member could be service master for multiple services), and invokes the service management mechanism <b>330</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) corresponding to that service. In managing the request, the service master may choose to do the processing itself to satisfy the request. In that case, the service master invokes the appropriate service <b>340</b> to process the request. On the other hand, the service master may choose to delegate the request to another member that provides the service. If that is the case, the service master forwards the request to another member. When delegating requests, the service master may perform some load balancing functions. In addition, the service master may perform some other management functions such as service monitoring, error reporting, etc. Overall, the service master may perform any desired function for properly managing requests for a particular service.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">During the course of regular operation, the status and condition of the various members can and probably will change. As a result of these changes, some of the selected service masters may no longer satisfy their associated service master selection criteria (for example, the CPU usage or the memory available on the service master may no longer be at the required levels). To ensure that the service masters continue to satisfy their associated service master selection criteria, the global master re-evaluates (block <b>420</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) each service master on a frequent basis. This re-evaluation may be done on an event-driven basis (e.g. each time the global master directs a request to a particular service master), or it may be done on a regular basis (e.g. every few seconds).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">During re-evaluation, the global master chooses a member that is the service master for a particular service. The global master then retrieves from the repository the set of service master selection criteria associated with that particular service, and applies those criteria to the member to see if the criteria are still satisfied. If so, the member remains as the service master. If not, the global master selects another member to be service master for that particular service. This selection may be carried out in the same manner as that described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Namely, the global master: determines which members are eligible to be service master for the particular service; applies the set of service master selection criteria to each of the eligible members to determine which ones are qualified; applies a set of tie breaking condition(s), if necessary; and establishes one of the qualified members as the new service master for the particular service. In this manner, the global master ensures that the service master selections are kept current. By having current service masters, and by having the global master work with the service masters in the manner described above, the distributed computing system <b>100</b> can be managed effectively and efficiently.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">HARDWARE OVERVIEW</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As noted previously, the functionality of each member <b>300</b> may be implemented in software as one or more sets of instructions executable by one or more processors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a hardware block diagram of a computer system <b>600</b> in which this software embodiment may be implemented. Computer system <b>600</b> includes a bus <b>602</b> or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a processor <b>604</b> coupled with bus <b>602</b> for processing information. Computer system <b>600</b> also includes a main memory <b>606</b>, such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to bus <b>602</b> for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor <b>604</b>. Main memory <b>606</b> may also be further used to store temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor <b>604</b>. Computer system <b>600</b> further includes a read only memory (ROM) <b>608</b> or other static storage device coupled to bus <b>602</b> for storing static information and instructions for processor <b>604</b>. A storage device <b>610</b>, such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, is provided and coupled to bus <b>602</b> for storing information and instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Computer system <b>600</b> may be coupled via bus <b>602</b> to a display <b>612</b>, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a computer user. An input device <b>614</b>, including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus <b>602</b> for communicating information and command selections to processor <b>604</b>. Another type of user input device is cursor control <b>616</b>, such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor <b>604</b> and for controlling cursor movement on display <b>612</b>. This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to one embodiment, the functionality of the present invention is provided by computer system <b>600</b> in response to processor <b>604</b> executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory <b>606</b>. Such instructions may be read into main memory <b>606</b> from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device <b>610</b>. Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory <b>606</b> causes processor <b>604</b> to perform the process steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The term “computer-readable medium” as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor <b>604</b> for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device <b>610</b>. Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory <b>606</b>. Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise bus <b>602</b>. Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio-wave, infra-red, and optical data communications.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punchcards, papertape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave as described hereinafter, or any other medium from which a computer can read.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor <b>604</b> for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system <b>600</b> can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus <b>602</b>. Bus <b>602</b> carries the data to main memory <b>606</b>, from which processor <b>604</b> retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory <b>606</b> may optionally be stored on storage device <b>610</b> either before or after execution by processor <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Computer system <b>600</b> also includes a communication interface <b>618</b> coupled to bus <b>602</b>. Communication interface <b>618</b> provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link <b>620</b> that is connected to a local network <b>622</b>. For example, communication interface <b>618</b> may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, communication interface <b>618</b> may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface <b>618</b> sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Network link <b>620</b> typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link <b>620</b> may provide a connection through local network <b>622</b> to a host computer <b>624</b> or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) <b>626</b>. ISP <b>626</b> in turn provides data communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the “Internet” <b>628</b>. Local network <b>622</b> and Internet <b>628</b> both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link <b>620</b> and through communication interface <b>618</b>, which carry the digital data to and from computer system <b>600</b>, are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Computer system <b>600</b> can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link <b>620</b> and communication interface <b>618</b>. In the Internet example, a server <b>630</b> might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet <b>628</b>, ISP <b>626</b>, local network <b>622</b> and communication interface <b>618</b>. The received code may be executed by processor <b>604</b> as it is received, and/or stored in storage device <b>610</b>, or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, computer system <b>600</b> may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At this point, it should be noted that although the invention has been described with reference to a specific embodiment, it should not be construed to be so limited.
