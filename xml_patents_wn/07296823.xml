<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART STATEMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an igniter assembly used in an inflator of an airbag device or a seat belt device, an inflator including the igniter assembly, and an airbag device and a seat belt device including the inflator.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In an igniter assembly assembled in an inflator of an airbag device, if an igniter is energized, high-temperature reaction gas is rapidly generated and a gas generating agent of the inflator starts to react with this reaction gas. Thus, the inflator generates a large amount of gas, and an airbag rapidly expands by this gas.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional igniter assembly of an inflator will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>10</b>(<i>c</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>a</i>) is a cross-sectional view taken along the axial direction of the igniter assembly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>b</i>) is a cross-sectional view taken along the axial direction of a collar, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>c</i>) is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the interface between the collar and a resin.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The igniter assembly <b>10</b>A includes an igniter <b>20</b>, a substantially cylindrical collar <b>30</b>A for holding the igniter <b>20</b>, and the resin <b>40</b> for joining the igniter <b>20</b> to the collar <b>30</b>A. The igniter <b>20</b> has a head portion <b>21</b> containing a reaction agent and pins <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> protruded and extended from the head portion <b>21</b> as conducting terminals. The collar <b>30</b>A has a cylindrical main body <b>31</b>, a collar portion <b>32</b> provided inward at the inner circumferential surface of the main body <b>31</b>, and a cylindrical surrounding wall portion <b>33</b> extended from one end of the shaft of the main body <b>31</b>. A surface <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the collar portion <b>32</b> at the side of the surrounding wall portion <b>33</b> is a radial surface extended in a radiant direction perpendicular to the shaft of the main body <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The head portion <b>21</b> of the igniter <b>20</b> is disposed in the surrounding wall portion <b>33</b> and the pins <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> are inserted into the main body <b>31</b> through an internal hole of the collar portion <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The resin <b>40</b> is filled between the igniter <b>20</b> and the inside of the surrounding wall portion <b>33</b> and the inner circumferential surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the internal hole of the collar portion <b>32</b> by injection molding or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The resin <b>40</b> is filled between the igniter <b>20</b> and the collar <b>30</b>A, but then shrinks in the arrow direction A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>c</i>) during cooling. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>c</i>), a gap C may be generated between the resin <b>40</b> and the inner circumferential surface of the surrounding wall portion <b>33</b> and the inner circumferential surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the collar portion <b>32</b>. This gap C may function as a passage for leaking gas at the time of operation of the inflator.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-293835 discloses a construction in which a cylindrical protrusion is provided on a collar such that a gap extended from the inner circumferential surface of the collar to the outer surface of an igniter is not generated although resin is shrunk. However, in this case, the cost of producing the collar increases by forming the protrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present invention therefore is to provide an igniter assembly which can prevent a gap from being generated due to shrinkage of resin, and which has an easily manufactured collar. Another object of the invention is to provide an inflator using the igniter assembly, and an airbag device and a seat belt device including the inflator.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description of the invention and the associated drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an embodiment of the invention, an igniter assembly includes an igniter and a substantially cylindrical collar for holding the igniter, in which the igniter and the collar are integrally joined to each other with resin interposed therebetween. A radial surface which substantially extends in a radial direction is provided in the collar, the resin is attached to the radial surface, and a concave portion is formed in the radial surface.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect of the invention, a groove which extends in a non-radial direction is formed as the concave portion.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another aspect of the invention, the bottom of the groove is rounded.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another embodiment of the invention, an inflator includes the above-described igniter assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to still another embodiment of the invention, an airbag device includes the above-described inflator.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment of the invention, a seat belt device includes a seat belt and a pretensioner which applies pretension to the seat belt by gas pressure from the above-described inflator during an emergency.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the igniter assembly according to the present invention, the concave portion is provided in the radial surface, shrinkage of the resin is restricted, and a gap is prevented from being generated between the collar and the resin. Furthermore, the concave portion can be more easily formed compared with a protrusion, and the cost of producing the igniter assembly is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">If the groove which extends in a non-radial direction is provided as the concave portion, shrinkage of the resin can be restricted. In addition, the groove can be easily formed in the collar.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">If the bottom of the groove is rounded, the resin is easily attached to the bottom of the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The inflator, the airbag device, and the seat belt device including the igniter assembly can prevent gas from leaking through the gap of the igniter assembly upon operation.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Hereinafter, embodiments will be described with reference to the attached drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) is a cross-sectional view taken along the axial direction of an igniter assembly according to an embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>) is a cross-sectional view taken along the axial direction of a collar, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>c</i>) is a partial enlarged cross-sectional view of the collar. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>) are plan views of a collar portion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a partial enlarged cross-sectional view of the collar portion illustrating the cross-sectional shape of a groove.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the igniter assembly <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment, grooves <b>50</b> are formed in the upper surface <b>32</b><i>b </i>of a collar portion <b>32</b> of a collar <b>30</b> (radial surface at the side of a surrounding wall portion <b>33</b>). These grooves <b>50</b> do not extend in a radial direction and are concentrically formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) in the present embodiment. However, in another possible embodiment, grooves <b>51</b> may be formed in a knurling shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>). The depth of the grooves <b>50</b> or <b>51</b> is preferably 0.2 to 1.0 mm, and particularly, 0.3 to 0.6 mm. The width of the grooves <b>50</b> and <b>51</b> along the radial surface <b>32</b><i>b </i>is preferably 0.3 to 0.8 mm, and particularly, 0.4 to 0.6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The bottom of the groove <b>50</b> is preferably rounded as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The radius of curvature of the rounding is preferably in the order of 0.02 to 0.06 mm. By rounding the bottom of the groove <b>50</b>, it is possible to prevent with certainty air from remaining in the bottom of the groove when resin is filled in the groove <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">However, the shape of the groove <b>50</b> is not necessarily limited to this. For example, the bottom of the groove <b>50</b> may be flat as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The other constructions of the igniter assembly <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment are the same as the igniter assembly <b>10</b>A, and like reference numbers denote the like portions.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the igniter assembly <b>10</b>, in a case where resin <b>40</b> is filled between an igniter <b>20</b> and the collar <b>30</b>, shrinkage of the resin <b>40</b> along the radial surface <b>32</b><i>b </i>is restricted by the grooves <b>50</b> formed in the radial surface <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the collar portion <b>32</b>, and a gap C is prevented from being generated between the resin <b>40</b> and the collar <b>30</b>. Thus, when an inflator including the igniter assembly <b>10</b> generates gas, it is possible to prevent the gas from leaking through the gap C.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, since the gap C does not exist, it is possible to prevent moisture from permeating into the inflator.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The collar may be made of metal such as aluminum, iron, stainless, or zinc or resin such as nylon or polybutyleneterephthalate (PBT). The groove may be formed by cutting the radial surface <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the collar portion <b>32</b>. Alternatively, the groove may be formed by forming a convex protrusion in a mold when manufacturing the collar by casting or injection molding or the like. If the metal collar is forged, the groove may be formed upon forging.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, an inflator including the igniter assembly <b>10</b> and an airbag device and a seat belt device including the inflator will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of an inflator for an airbag device according to the embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of an airbag device including the inflator.</p>

The inside and the outside of the partition member <b>63</b> are communicated with each other through an opening <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The igniter assembly <b>10</b> is mounted at one end of the partition member <b>63</b>. In more detail, the igniter assembly <b>10</b> is inserted into the partition member <b>63</b> while keeping the igniter <b>20</b> in the forefront and a head portion <b>21</b> of the igniter <b>20</b> contacts or faces the ignition propellant <b>65</b> in the partition member <b>63</b>. The periphery of one end side of the partition member <b>63</b> is caulked to the inside of the partition member <b>63</b> to overlap with the rear periphery of the igniter assembly <b>10</b> (collar <b>30</b>) such that the igniter assembly <b>10</b> is held therein and one end of the partition member <b>63</b> is sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">However, the construction for holding the igniter assembly <b>10</b> and sealing the partition member <b>63</b> is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the present embodiment, a flange <b>69</b> for mounting the inflator <b>60</b> to a retainer <b>82</b> is mounted at the side surface of the outer covering body of the inflator <b>60</b>. The gas nozzle <b>64</b> is disposed in the front of the flange <b>69</b>. Furthermore, in the present embodiment, the flange <b>69</b> is integrally formed with the lower housing <b>62</b> to be laterally protruded from the upper periphery of the lower housing <b>62</b>, and the gas nozzle <b>64</b> is formed by perforating the side surface of the upper housing <b>61</b>. However, the present embodiment is not limited to this. A hole <b>70</b> into which a bolt <b>84</b><i>a </i>is inserted is formed in the flange <b>69</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The airbag device <b>80</b> includes the inflator <b>60</b>, an airbag <b>81</b> which expands by gas emitted from the inflator <b>60</b>, and the retainer <b>82</b> for holding the inflator <b>60</b> and the airbag <b>81</b>, and a module cover <b>83</b> mounted on the retainer <b>82</b> to cover the folded airbag <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The airbag <b>81</b> has a front surface facing a vehicle occupant or the like when the airbag <b>81</b> expands and a rear surface opposite to the front surface. An opening (mouth) <b>81</b><i>a </i>into which the inflator <b>60</b> is inserted is provided in the rear surface.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The retainer <b>82</b> includes a main plate portion <b>82</b><i>a </i>and a leg portion <b>82</b><i>b </i>bent downward from the periphery of the main plate portion <b>82</b><i>a</i>. An inflator inserting hole <b>82</b><i>c </i>is formed in the center of the main plate portion <b>82</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the front side of the inflator <b>60</b> is inserted from the rear surface of the main plate portion <b>82</b><i>a </i>into the inflator inserting hole <b>82</b><i>c</i>. The mouth <b>81</b><i>a </i>of the airbag <b>81</b> and the periphery of the inflator inserting hole <b>82</b><i>c </i>overlap with and are fixed to each other by a mounting ring <b>84</b>. The front side of the inflator <b>60</b> is disposed in the airbag <b>81</b> through the mouth <b>81</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The bolt (stud bolt) <b>84</b><i>a </i>is protruded from the mounting ring <b>84</b> and is inserted into insertion holes (of which the reference numbers are omitted) of the periphery of the mouth <b>81</b><i>a </i>and the periphery of the inflator inserting hole <b>82</b><i>c </i>and an insertion hole <b>70</b> of the flange <b>69</b> to be protruded from the rear surface of the flange <b>69</b>. By tightening a nut <b>84</b><i>b </i>to the, bolt <b>84</b><i>a</i>, the airbag <b>81</b> and the inflator <b>60</b> are fixed to the retainer <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The airbag device <b>80</b> is constructed by folding the airbag <b>81</b> and mounting the module cover <b>83</b> to cover the folded airbag <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Moreover, in the present embodiment, a leg member <b>83</b><i>a </i>is standing downward from the rear surface of the module cover <b>83</b> and fixed to the leg portion <b>82</b><i>b </i>of the retainer <b>82</b> by a fixing tool <b>83</b><i>b </i>such as a rivet. The module cover <b>83</b> is pushed and cleaved by the airbag <b>81</b> when the airbag expands. Reference number <b>83</b><i>c </i>denotes a tear line for cleavage.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the inflator <b>60</b> and the airbag device <b>80</b> having the aforementioned constructions, when pins <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> of the igniter assembly <b>10</b> are energized, a reaction agent in the igniter <b>20</b> reacts and thus the ignition propellant <b>65</b> is ignited. Next, the gas generating propellant <b>66</b> is ignited by high-temperature gas emitted from the ignition propellant <b>65</b> through the opening <b>68</b>, thereby generating gas. This gas is emitted from the gas nozzle <b>64</b> to the outside of the inflator <b>60</b>, that is, the inside of the airbag <b>81</b> through the filter <b>67</b>. As a result, the airbag <b>81</b> expands. The airbag <b>81</b> pushes and opens the module cover <b>83</b> and expands toward the vehicle occupant or the like, thereby protecting the vehicle occupant or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the inflator <b>60</b> and the airbag device <b>80</b>, the gas is prevented from leaking between the resin <b>40</b> and the collar <b>30</b> of the igniter assembly <b>10</b> upon operation.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of an inflator for a seat belt device including the igniter assembly <b>10</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the entire construction of a seat belt device that includes the inflator, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an exploded perspective view of a retractor (pretensioner) of the seat belt device.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">One end of a seat belt <b>91</b> of the seat belt device <b>90</b> is retractably connected to the retractor <b>92</b> and the other end thereof is fixed to a vehicle body by an anchor <b>93</b>. The seat belt <b>91</b> penetrates through a shoulder anchor <b>94</b> and a tongue <b>95</b>. The anchor <b>93</b> is disposed at the side surface of the vehicle interior. A buckle device <b>96</b> for latching the tongue <b>95</b> is provided at the opposite side of the anchor <b>93</b> of the seat. The shoulder anchor <b>94</b> is disposed on the upper side of the side surface of the vehicle interior.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the present embodiment, the retractor <b>92</b> includes a pretensioner which applies pretension to the seat belt <b>91</b> during an emergency of the vehicle and an impact energy absorbing mechanism (EA mechanism) for absorbing impact energy applied from the seat belt <b>91</b> to the vehicle occupant. Hereinafter, the construction of the retractor <b>92</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A spool <b>98</b> is received in a base frame <b>97</b> of the retractor <b>92</b> and one end of the seat belt <b>91</b> is wound on the spool <b>98</b>. The seat belt <b>91</b> is wound on/off by rotating the spool <b>98</b>. A torsion bar <b>99</b> is mounted at the center of axis of the spool <b>98</b> and one end of the torsion bar <b>99</b> is supported by a support member <b>102</b> through locking components <b>100</b> and <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The torsion bar <b>99</b> is a main component of the EA mechanism. If the tension of the seat belt <b>91</b> exceeds a predetermined value, the torsion bar <b>99</b> is plastic-deformed and thus rotates in an unwinding direction of the seat belt <b>91</b> while drag is applied to the spool <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A gear <b>103</b> is mounted at one end (left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) of the spool <b>98</b>. The gear <b>103</b> is engaged with a gear (not shown) of a return spring cover <b>104</b> shown in lower left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The spool <b>98</b> is biased in a direction of retracting the seat belt <b>91</b> by a return spring (not shown) in the return spring cover <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a pipe <b>107</b> is mounted between a pretensioner cover <b>105</b> shown at the right side of the return spring cover <b>104</b> and a pretensioner plate <b>106</b> shown at the lower right side. An inflator <b>108</b> is mounted at one end of the pipe <b>107</b>. In the pipe <b>107</b>, a spring <b>109</b>, a piston <b>110</b>, and a plurality of balls <b>111</b> are arranged. A notched opening (of which the reference number is omitted) is formed in the vicinity of the other end of the pipe <b>107</b>. A guide block <b>112</b> is fitted into the other end of the pipe <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A pin <b>113</b> is mounted in the pretensioner cover <b>105</b> and holds a ring gear <b>114</b> having external teeth and internal teeth. The pipe <b>107</b> surrounds the outer circumference of the ring gear <b>114</b>. Furthermore, the pipe <b>107</b> is arranged such that a direction from one end to the other end thereof becomes a direction of retracting the seat belt of the spool <b>98</b>. The opening faces the outer circumferential surface of the ring gear <b>114</b> and the front ball <b>111</b> exposed through the opening is engaged with the external teeth of the ring gear <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A pinion <b>116</b> engaged with the internal teeth of the ring gear <b>114</b> is mounted on a root portion <b>115</b> of the gear <b>103</b>. When the ring gear <b>114</b> is held by the pin <b>113</b>, the ring gear <b>114</b> is not engaged with the pinion <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">When the inflator <b>108</b> emits the gas, the gas is injected into the pipe <b>107</b> and the balls <b>111</b> moves to the other end of the pipe <b>107</b>, that is, in the seat belt retracting direction of the spool <b>98</b> by gas pressure. At this time, the front ball <b>111</b> presses the ring gear <b>114</b> to bend the pin <b>113</b>. Thus, a state that the pin <b>113</b> holds the ring gear <b>114</b> is released and the ring gear <b>114</b> is engaged with the pinion <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As a result, the spool <b>98</b> is biased in the seat belt retracting direction by the gas pressure from the inflator <b>108</b> through the pinion <b>116</b>, the ring gear <b>114</b>, and the ball <b>111</b>, and the seat belt <b>91</b> is wound on the spool <b>98</b>. Thus, the pretension is applied to the seat belt <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the present embodiment, an inflator <b>108</b> includes a substantially cylindrical housing <b>117</b> and gas generating propellant <b>118</b> is contained in the housing <b>117</b>. A gas nozzle <b>119</b> is formed in one end of the housing <b>117</b>. The gas nozzle <b>119</b> is closed by a burst seam <b>120</b> upon non-operation of the inflator. When the gas pressure having a predetermined value or more is applied from the inside of the housing <b>117</b>, the burst seam <b>120</b> bursts and the gas nozzle <b>119</b> is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The igniter assembly <b>10</b> is mounted in the other end of the housing <b>117</b>. In more detail, the surrounding wall portion <b>33</b> of the collar <b>30</b> of the igniter assembly <b>10</b> is inserted into the housing <b>117</b> while keeping the igniter <b>20</b> in the forefront and the head portion <b>21</b> of the igniter <b>20</b> contacts or faces the gas generating propellant <b>118</b> in the housing <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the present embodiment, a concave portion (of which the reference number is omitted) is formed in a step portion between the surrounding wall portion <b>33</b> and the main body <b>31</b>, and the other end of the housing <b>117</b> is fitted into the concave portion. By caulking the outer periphery of the concave portion in the axial direction of the inflator, the housing <b>117</b> and the collar <b>30</b> are integrally coupled. In addition, a sealing material (O-shaped ring) <b>121</b> for sealing the coupling portion is provided in the concave portion.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The inflator <b>108</b> is inserted into one end of the pipe <b>107</b> while keeping the gas nozzle <b>119</b> in the forefront and connected with the pipe <b>107</b> by a connecting mechanism (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the inflator <b>108</b> and the seat belt device <b>90</b> having the aforementioned construction, when the pins <b>22</b> and <b>23</b> of the igniter assembly <b>10</b> are energized, the reaction agent in the igniter <b>20</b> reacts and the gas generating propellant <b>118</b> is ignited, thereby generating gas. Furthermore, the burst seam <b>120</b> bursts by the gas pressure, the gas nozzle <b>119</b> is opened, and the gas is emitted from the gas nozzle <b>119</b> into the pipe <b>107</b>. As a result, the pretensioner mechanism of the retractor <b>92</b> operates as described above and thus the pretension is applied to the seat belt <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the inflator <b>108</b> and the seat belt device <b>90</b>, it is possible to prevent the gas from leaking between the resin <b>40</b> and the collar <b>30</b> of the igniter assembly <b>10</b> upon operation.</p>
