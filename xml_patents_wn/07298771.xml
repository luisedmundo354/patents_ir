<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention is related generally to light emitting devices, such as lasers, laser diodes, light-emitting diodes, super-luminescent laser diodes, etc. More specifically, the invention provides for using one or more volume Bragg grating (VBG) elements for modifying (or conditioning) one or more output characteristics of such devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Laser cavities or resonators, however complex, typically include two or more mirrors or other reflecting devices that form a closed optical path for rays traveling in a certain direction. An optical element positioned in that closed optical path, which includes mirrors and/or other reflecting devices that form the path, may be referred to as “intra-cavity.” An optical element positioned in the path of light that has departed from the resonator may be referred to as an “extra-cavity” element.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Using extra-cavity partial reflectors as feedback elements with a solitary laser cavity has been attempted in the past with a purpose of achieving single longitudinal mode operation of the otherwise multi-mode laser. Such reflectors, however, were not wavelength-selective devices. Such designs may be referred to as the “coupled-cavity” approach. This approach suffered from instabilities stemming from the non-selective nature of the feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another approach used was to employ a dispersive element, such as surface diffraction grating, as an extra- or intra-cavity wavelength-selective device in order to induce narrow-band or single longitudinal mode operation of a semiconductor laser. Although successful in a laboratory, this approach results in rather bulky devices, which are difficult to align and to maintain in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A somewhat more practical approach for inducing narrowband operation of a single-transverse mode semiconductor laser proved to be a fiber Bragg grating functioning typically as an extra-cavity element. This device is a narrow-band reflector that functions only in an optical fiber waveguide. It is, therefore, inapplicable to solid-state lasers, laser diode arrays, and, most likely, even to multi-mode (transverse) broad-area high-power single-emitter laser diodes, whether fiber-coupled or not.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The use of a volume Bragg grating element has been suggested as an intra-cavity element to induce single-longitudinal mode (also called single-frequency) operation of a single-transverse mode laser diode. In this approach, the volume Bragg grating element forms the external Bragg mirror of an external-cavity single-spatial mode semiconductor laser diode. However, to the inventors' knowledge, neither the possibility of using a VBG element for extra-cavity narrow-band feedback nor a practical device for achieving narrow-band operation of a single-transverse mode semiconductor laser diodes have been disclosed previously. Furthermore, to the inventors' knowledge, not even the possibility of applying VBG elements to multiple-transverse mode, broad-area laser diodes, laser diode arrays or the possibility of conditioning other attributes of laser emission (such as its spatial mode and temporal profile) have been disclosed previously.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To the inventors' knowledge, there are currently no devices in the market that employ volume Bragg grating elements for conditioning of laser characteristics, nor are there any successful practical devices in the market that use any of the above-mentioned approaches to improve the output characteristics of arrays of lasers.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention provides methods and apparatuses that can overcome the problems known in the prior art. The invention provides several practical embodiments of using VBG elements for conditioning any or all of the output characteristics of lasers and other light-emitting devices.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The inventors have found that volume Bragg grating (VBG) elements recorded in photorefractive materials, particularly those recorded in inorganic photorefractive glasses (PRGs), have many properties that can improve one or more characteristics of light-emitting devices such as solid-state lasers, semiconductor laser diodes, gas and ion lasers, and the like. A volume Bragg grating (“VBG”) element may be any structure that: a) has a periodically varying index of refraction in its bulk (the shape of the surface of the constant index of refraction can be any smooth figure, flat or curved); b) is generally transparent in the spectral region of its operation; and c) has a thickness in the direction of propagation of light of 0.05 mm or more.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A photorefractive material may include any material that has the ability to change its index of refraction subsequent to illumination by light of certain wavelength region or regions. Such a change in refractive index may occur in the material either immediately upon illumination by light or as a result of secondary processing step or steps, whether chemical, thermal, etc. Such a material may also be generally transparent in the spectral region of its photosensitivity, i.e. the light at the recording wavelength may have the ability to penetrate sufficiently deep into the material (&gt;0.1 mm) without suffering excessive absorption (&gt;90%). Further, the material may be amorphous and generally isotropic.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Though the embodiments described herein are directed to certain examples of laser devices, it should be understood that the principles of the invention apply to other light-emitting devices as well. For example, applications of this invention include but are not limited to: high-power, semiconductor, solid state, ion, and gas lasers; light-emitting diodes and super-luminescent laser diodes; medical diagnostics, treatment, and surgical instruments; environmental sensors; metrology instruments; industrial applications; and defense applications.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Properties of VBG elements, and methods for manufacturing VBG elements, have been described previously (see, for example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/390,521, filed Mar. 17, 2003).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Generally, there are at least three distinct characteristics of the output of a laser device that may be improved using the techniques of the invention: 1) emission spectrum (e.g., peak wavelength of the laser emission and its spectral width); 2) spatial/angular beam characteristics (e.g., the angular divergence of the output laser beam and its spatial mode structure); and 3) temporal profile of the laser pulses (e.g., the duration of the laser pulse, its temporal phase variation or chirp etc.). As used herein, spectral, spatial, or temporal conditioning, refer to affecting any of the above characteristics, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The inventors have found that VBG elements permanently recorded in a suitable material, particularly a PRG, have a number of properties that can be utilized for improving one or more of the above characteristics. These properties include, but are not limited to: 1) single spectral pass band without any extraneous pass bands; 2) ability to control the spectral width of the VBG filter pass band; 3) ability to control the amplitude and phase envelope of a VBG filter; 4) narrow acceptance angle range otherwise called field of view; 5) ability to control the acceptance angle and the field of view; 6) ability to multiplex more than one filter in the same volume of the material; 7) high damage threshold of the VBG elements manufactured in a suitable material, particularly PRG; 8) ability to be shaped into bulk optical elements with sufficiently large clear aperture; and 9) reflectivity distributed over the volume of the material.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">There are at least two general approaches to using VBG elements for conditioning a characteristic of a light emitting device: a) using a VBG that is outside of the laser cavity (extra-cavity); and b) using a VBG that is inside laser cavity (intra-cavity).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As discussed above, a laser resonator may be viewed as a closed optical path formed between mirrors and/or other light-reflecting elements. Such a closed optical path is typically a condition that is necessary for lasing to occur. For this reason, it is desirable that any intra-cavity element added to the resonator does not alter this condition, lest it impede light generation via stimulated emission. By contrast to intra-cavity elements, extra-cavity elements may be free from such a constraint. Furthermore, the efficiency of light generation typically depends nonlinearly on single-pass cavity loss. Thus, it is also desirable that any intra-cavity element used for laser output conditioning have as little loss as possible. This includes the losses in the element itself, as well as the losses in the optical delivery system used to project light onto the element and back. In contrast, extra-cavity elements used for laser output conditioning may be much more tolerant to the loss factor.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When used for narrowing the spectral output of a laser, intra-cavity elements provide wavelength-selective loss that raises the lasing threshold for all but a few cavity modes. In contrast, the feedback from an extra-cavity wavelength-selective element reduces lasing threshold for just a few cavity modes, which creates preferred lasing conditions for those modes. These modes, then, consume most or all of the available laser gain and prevent other modes from lasing. Similar processes affect the formation of the spatial mode of the laser when intra- and extra-cavity elements are used for spatial mode conditioning.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An optical delivery system may be viewed as a collection of optical elements, e.g. lenses, mirrors, prisms etc., that collects some or all of the light emanating from a particular aperture of the laser cavity, projects some or all of this light onto a VBG element or a system thereof, and then collects some or all of the light returned from said VBG element and projects it back onto the aperture of laser cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When considering the intra-cavity use of VBG elements, a design factor that may be considered is the reduction of the total loss of the VBG element plus the optical delivery system for the preferred longitudinal and transverse modes of the laser. In comparison, the design of an extra-cavity system for laser output conditioning may be more complex. In order to achieve stable output with desired characteristics, it may be desirable to optimize any or all of the following factors: 1) The solitary cavity design, including, but not limited to, cavity length, reflectivity of the cavity mirrors, threshold, differential efficiency, etc., all of which may be dependent on the properties of the gain medium; 2) The intrinsic reflectivity and loss of the VBG element; 3) The spectral bandwidth of the VBG element; 4) The reflectivity of the VBG element facets; 5) The relative angle between the volume Bragg grating planes and the external facets of the element; 6) The design of the external optical delivery system projecting light onto and back from the VBG element, including, but not limited to, its total coupling efficiency into the solitary laser cavity, the length of the external cavity, the divergence of the light (in both directions) incident upon the VBG and the output coupler of the solitary cavity, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, single-transverse mode laser diodes that are stabilized by a fiber Bragg grating may have such a fiber Bragg grating positioned rather far from the laser diode chip (typically about 1 meter) in order to induce the so-called coherence collapse regime of operation. Such a condition may be necessary to achieve stable laser output. However, if a VBG element was used as a mere free-space replacement of the fiber Bragg grating, it may result in a device 1.5 m long without an advantage of easy coiling or folding that the optical fiber affords naturally. Such a device might not be practical, however, and, therefore, different stable operating conditions might be desirable for devices using VBG elements for laser output conditioning, which are the result of the optimization of the above-described parameters.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Extra-cavity Use of VBG Elements</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A VBG element may be used extra-cavity to condition, spectrally, spatially, and/or temporally, light received from a light-emitting device. At least a portion of the conditioned light may then be fed back into the laser cavity. In the process of doing so, the light emitted from the laser will assume the characteristics of the light conditioned by the VBG. Example embodiments of such extra-cavity use of VBG elements are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>. Note that, when the VBG is used in extra-cavity configuration, the laser device is operating above threshold in the absence of optical feedback from the VBG element.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an example embodiment, a VBG element and a laser output coupler may be positioned in conjugate planes. An optical system including one or more lenses may be positioned in the light path after the light exits the laser cavity through the output coupler. Such an optical system may form an image of the output coupler in a particular location in space outside the laser cavity. A VBG element may be positioned in that plane so that the VBG element reflects the light rays incident upon it in such fashion that the reflected rays go back through the imaging optical system and form an image in the plane of the output coupler. In this case, it may be said that the output coupler and the VBG are positioned in the conjugate planes of the imaging optical system. A feature of this configuration is that it maximizes the coupling efficiency from the external element (the VBG element in this case) back into the laser cavity, essentially matching the resonator mode pattern in both transverse directions. Such an embodiment may be desirable where the laser cavity is a waveguide, such as in the case of semiconductor laser diodes, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In another example embodiment, the output of a waveguide laser cavity (e.g., a semiconductor laser diode) may be approximately collimated in one axis (e.g., the fast axis) by a cylindrical lens. The other axis (e.g., the slow axis) of the laser output may be allowed to diverge freely. The VBG element may be positioned in the optical path of the laser output behind the cylindrical lens and aligned in such a way that it reflects portion of the laser light back into the laser cavity. In this embodiment the coupling efficiency of the optical delivery system (e.g., the cylindrical lens) from the VBG back into the laser cavity is very low, making it undesirable for use as an intra-cavity element. However, such a system may be designed to operate stably in an extra-cavity configuration. It will induce wavelength-stable, spectrally narrowed operation of the laser diode. In this configuration the divergence of the non-collimated laser axis (the slow axis) can also be reduced without the use of additional optics, when such a laser is a broad-area multiple transverse mode semiconductor laser diode. In this configuration an entire linear array of semiconductor lasers can be conditioned with a single cylindrical lens and a single VBG element.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An example embodiment of a broad-area high-power semiconductor laser, having an emitting aperture of greater than about 50 μm, with output conditioned by an extra-cavity VBG with a cylindrical fast-axis lens, is also disclosed. The output power of the laser changes rather insignificantly despite the fact that the VBG reflectivity is relatively high (30%). Small reduction in the output power is a factor in the design of practical systems using high-power laser diodes and may be provided by the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Example design parameters for stable operation of broad-area semiconductor laser diodes may include: laser cavity, 1-3 mm long; emitting aperture, 100-500 μm; back facet reflectivity, 0.9 or greater; front facet reflectivity, 0.5-20%; FAC lens EFL, 50-2000 μm; FAC lens type, graded-index cylindrical or plano-convex aspheric cylindrical; FAC AR coating, all facets&lt;2%; VBG reflectivity, 5-60%; VBG thickness, 0.2-3 mm; VBG position behind FAC lens, 0-10 mm; and angle of the VBG planes with respect to its facet, 0-5 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">An example embodiment of an extra-cavity VBG without any optical delivery system (e.g., without any lenses) is also disclosed. In this embodiment a VBG element may be positioned in the optical path of the light behind the output coupler (e.g., the laser diode front facet) without any extra optical elements (e.g., lenses) in between. In the case of a waveguide cavity, such as the case for semiconductor laser diodes, only a very small portion of the total laser output power may be returned by the VBG into the laser cavity. However, with proper laser cavity and VBG design, it is possible to achieve spectral narrowing and stabilization of the output wavelength across a range of operating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Example design parameters for such an embodiment may include: laser cavity, 1-3 mm long; emitting aperture, 100-500 μm; back facet reflectivity, 0.9 or greater; front facet reflectivity, 0.2-5%; VBG reflectivity, 30-99%; VBG thickness, 0.05-3 mm; VBG position in front of the laser, 0-5 mm; and angle of the VBG planes with respect to its facet, 0-5 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Some of the embodiments described herein demonstrate how the output of a laser diode, laser diode bar, or stack may be modified spectrally and/or spatially. Effects of the VBG element in these cases include spectral narrowing of the emission line of a laser or laser array, stabilization of the peak emission wavelength of a laser or a laser array, and the reduction of the divergence of the slow axis of a laser or a laser array.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Note that the high total output power of the laser transmitting through the clear aperture of the VBG (&gt;20 W for laser diode arrays), the high power density on the VBG element (&gt;40 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) as well as high temperature excursions suffered by such an element (T&gt;100 C) may limit the choice of suitable materials for VBG implementation. Nevertheless, the inventors have successfully demonstrated VBG elements operation in all of the above conditions when implemented in PRG materials.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for example, demonstrates how both of these properties may be utilized in order to combine the output of an entire array of lasers onto a single target using a single VBG. In that embodiment, the VBG element contains a grating having a period that varies depending on location. When positioned properly in front of an array of emitters, such a grating will force different emitters to operate at a different peak wavelength depending on their location, creating a wavelength-shifted laser array. The output of such an array may be subsequently combined by use of one of a number of well-known wavelength multiplexing techniques into a much brighter spot with intensity essentially equivalent to that of the entire array and spatial dimensions essentially equivalent to that of an individual emitter.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">An embodiment for spectral power combining of a laser diode array via external feedback through a wavelength multiplexer is also disclosed. In this embodiment, a wavelength multiplexer may be positioned in the path of output light of an array of emitters and behind an optical delivery system. Such a multiplexer may be designed to combine the output of all the emitters into one beam, provided they operate at the wavelengths matching the appropriate input channels of the multiplexer. Such a condition may be achieved automatically when an external feedback is provided into the emitters from a partial reflector positioned in the light path behind the wavelength multiplexer. In this configuration, the reflected light will travel back through the multiplexer and separate into multiple channels different in wavelength. As a result, each of the emitters in the array will receive feedback at a wavelength matching that of the corresponding channel of the multiplexer. Such feedback will force each emitter to operate at appropriate wavelength, so that their output power is efficiently combined.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Other applications include, but are not limited to, stabilization of super-luminescent laser diodes, light-emitting diodes, solid-state lasers, gas and ion lasers; wavelength stabilization of sources used in telecommunications, sensing, metrology, material processing, other industrial applications and defense electronics; multi-wavelength emitters and emitter arrays for use in any of the application areas mentioned above; and tunable-wavelength emitters.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Intra-cavity Use of VBG Elements</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">VBG elements may be used inside a laser cavity, rather than through an external feedback, to affect laser output directly. Examples of embodiments of intra-cavity use of VBG elements are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A VBG may be used to force a laser to operate on a single longitudinal mode. Due to the highly selective reflectivity of a VBG reflector, only one longitudinal mode of the laser cavity has gain exceeding the lasing threshold. Conventionally, monolithic or air-spaced etalons are used to select a single longitudinal mode of a solid-state laser (e.g., Nd:YAG). Very often, additional elements (e.g., thin etalon or a birefringent filter or both) are employed in order to achieve single-frequency operation, even for a narrow gain-bandwidth medium. It may be desirable that these elements, which provide wavelength-selective loss inside the cavity, are tuned in synch with each other and with the length of the main cavity in order to provide continuous, hop-free tuning.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">There are numerous ways to achieve single longitudinal mode (or single frequency) operation, with some of the embodiments described below. In one embodiment, a reflective VBG element may be used as the output coupler or the high reflector of a laser resonator. The length of the VBG element may be selected in such a way that its reflectivity drops rapidly when the wavelength is detuned from the Bragg condition. Consequently, only one resonator mode reaches lasing threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In another embodiment, two VBG elements may be employed—one as the high reflector and one as an output coupler of the laser resonator. The VBG elements may have slightly shifted peak reflectivity wavelengths, which creates more rapid change in cavity loss with wavelength. This would allow the use of shorter, less selective VBG elements and/or longer laser resonators.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In yet another embodiment, the VBG may act as a distributed feedback (DFB) element, taking place of both resonator mirrors. Such an element may be monolithic, with proper phase shift between the two halves of the Bragg grating. In this embodiment, the active medium may be the VBG itself, which can be achieved with proper doping with active ions, or the active medium can be attached to the VBG element along the length of the Bragg grating, partially or entirely.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It may be desirable that a laser output include only one (e.g., the lowest) spatial mode, which in free-space resonators has the designation TEM<sub>00</sub>. This mode has a smooth intensity profile and the lowest possible angular divergence. However, such TEM<sub>00 </sub>operation is often rather difficult to achieve in high-power lasers with high single-pass gain. The techniques for achieving TEM<sub>00 </sub>operation usually rely on the differences in the spatial and angular profile of the TEM<sub>00 </sub>and the higher modes by introducing an element or elements with position-dependent loss (apertures) or angle-dependent loss. VBGs are well suited to serve in either capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Glebov, et al., have disclosed an approach for using a transmission-type VBG element inside a solid-state laser cavity to provide an angle-dependent cavity loss. However, that approach uses a VBG as an intra-cavity folding element that has very high angular sensitivity and requires very delicate and extremely accurate alignment. If the alignment of such a folding element is disturbed, the laser generation will seize, which makes this approach undesirable. A preferred approach would be to use a mode-forming element that by itself does not require critical alignment and, when perturbed, would not stop laser operation, but rather allow higher spatial modes to achieve lasing threshold, at most. This requires an element or elements that have low loss for TEM<sub>00 </sub>mode, have high loss for all higher modes, and do not alter the optical path of the TEM<sub>00 </sub>mode. This class of intra-cavity mode-forming elements may be referred to as “non-folding” mode-forming or mode-stripping elements.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">It should be understood that the diffraction efficiency of a VBG element depends on the angle of incidence for a given wavelength of light. For this reason, it will produce an angle-dependent gain/loss profile in the laser cavity. Such a gain profile will create higher losses for spatial modes higher than TEM<sub>00 </sub>and, therefore, can be used for suppressing higher spatial mode in the laser resonator (“mode-stripping”), resulting in a clean TEM<sub>00 </sub>output of the laser.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">To function as a spatial mode-stripping device, a VBG element may have a variety of angular diffraction efficiency profiles, such as those provided and described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. It should be understood that other possible types of angular profiles of diffraction efficiency of a VBG element may lead to the desired effects on the output of a laser. It should also be understood that reflection and transmission type VBG elements, as well as hybrid elements, may be utilized to achieve the desired effect. The principles of the invention may be applied to any or all of these cases without limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">An example embodiment of a non-folding mode-forming element is a VBG mirror with a Gaussian or super-Gaussian reflectivity profile. In this embodiment, a reflective VBG element may have an axially-symmetric reflectivity profile with smooth radial variation of the reflectivity following, preferably, a super-Gaussian shape. Such an element, when used either as an output coupler or the high reflector of the laser cavity, may be designed to overlap spatially with the TEM<sub>00 </sub>mode at that particular location within the resonator, but it would have high losses for all the higher resonator modes. Such a VBG element with a soft aperture may have either plane parallel Bragg planes (e.g., a zero optical power VBG element) or have Bragg planes designed to have a particular curvature (e.g., a VBG element with finite optical power).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Another embodiment includes the use of a transmissive, non-folding VBG element to diffract higher resonator modes away from the resonator optical axis. This approach relies on the high angular selectivity of the transmissive VBGs and may be made with such angular reflectivity profile that the TEM<sub>00 </sub>mode is transmitted through such an element without being diffracted, that is, with little or no loss. Several or all of the higher modes, starting with TEM<sub>01</sub>/TEM<sub>10</sub>, may experience sufficient diffraction, and, therefore, loss, such that they do not reach the threshold for lasing. Such a VBG element may or may not have axial symmetry in its angular profile of the diffraction efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Yet another example embodiment is based on the natural angular selectivity of a reflective VBG. Such a VBG element, serving as the output coupler or the high reflector of the laser cavity, would have high reflectivity for the incident waves of a particular wavelength near the normal to the grating planes, but the reflectivity would drop rapidly for the waves incident upon such VBG element at an angle outside its angular acceptance. Therefore, the VBG element would satisfy the three criteria for non-folding mode-forming elements outlined above.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The amplitude and phase envelope of the VBG may be adjusted in order to produce a desired effect on the temporal profile of ultra-short laser pulses. One particular example is the compensation of pulse chirping produced inside the laser cavity by other elements, such as the laser gain medium.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> provides plots showing how a VBG element can force a laser to operate on a single longitudinal mode. As an example, a VBG element may be used as a partially reflective output coupler. The VBG element has a narrow wavelength reflectivity, considerably narrower than the width of the gain curve of the active medium of the laser. In order to lase, the individual longitudinal modes of the laser resonator have to exceed the lasing threshold. Due to the highly selective reflectivity of a VBG output coupler, however, only one longitudinal mode of the laser cavity has a gain exceeding the lasing threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> depict a VBG element used as a distributed feedback element of a solid-state laser.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Similar to narrow wavelength pass-band, a VBG element may have a narrow angle pass-band, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Preferably, the angular passband of the VBG element should be wider than the angular width of the TEM<sub>00 </sub>mode of the laser cavity. Due to the relatively sharp roll-off of the diffraction efficiency of a VBG element with angle of incidence (the laser wavelength is fixed), a higher mode of the laser cavity will experience higher losses and, therefore, will be essentially suppressed by the VBG element. The VBG element thus functions to strip the laser from its higher spatial modes and force it to operate on the TEM<sub>00 </sub>mode only.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, the VBG element has a high diffraction efficiency for the TEM<sub>00 </sub>mode only and produces higher loss for the higher spatial modes.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">By contrast, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14C and 14D</figref>, the VBG element <b>230</b> may have a diffraction efficiency profile with a dip at nearly normal incidence, both in azimuth and elevation angle profile. Therefore, it will have low loss for the TEM<sub>00 </sub>mode in transmission. Such a VBG element <b>230</b> may be used as an essentially transparent (i.e., lossless) element inside the laser cavity, which may include at least one mirror <b>234</b> and a gain medium <b>232</b>.

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>, the higher spatial modes will experience diffraction on the VBG element <b>230</b> and, therefore, will be directed out of the cavity, producing higher losses for those modes and, therefore, eliminating them. In either case the result is TEM<sub>00 </sub>output of the laser. VBG elements of both transmission and reflection type can be used to achieve TEM<sub>00 </sub>operation.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> depicts an embodiment suitable for shaping the temporal profile of ultra-short laser pulses.

It is known that ultra-short laser pulses (e.g., &lt;10 ps duration) have wide spectral range and will, therefore, likely experience dispersion inside the gain medium. The gain medium may be bulk solid-state, fiber, planar waveguide or any other. Such dispersion is generally undesirable because it leads to broadening of the ultra-short laser pulse. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, the VBG element <b>240</b> may be manufactured with a grating period that varies slightly along the axis, z, of the laser. Such a grating may produce slightly different delays for different wavelengths and, therefore, will compensate for the dispersion of the gain medium <b>244</b> of the laser. This improves the temporal characteristics of the laser pulse. Alternatively, the same technique may be used for compression of the chirped and stretched high peak power ultra-short pulses subsequent to their amplification in an optical amplifier. The pulses must be stretched prior to the amplification to avoid damage to the amplifier as well as nonlinear effects.</p>
