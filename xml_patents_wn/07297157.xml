<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to medical devices, such as, for example, stents and stent-grafts, and methods of making the devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The body includes various passageways such as arteries, other blood vessels, and other body lumens. These passageways sometimes become occluded or weakened. For example, the passageways can be occluded by a tumor, restricted by plaque, or weakened by an aneurysm. When this occurs, the passageway can be reopened or reinforced, or even replaced, with a medical endoprosthesis. An endoprosthesis is typically a tubular member that is placed in a lumen in the body. Examples of endoprosthesis include stents and covered stents, sometimes called “stent-grafts”.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Endoprostheses can be delivered inside the body by a catheter that supports the endoprosthesis in a compacted or reduced-size form as the endoprosthesis is transported to a desired site. Upon reaching the site, the endoprosthesis is expanded, for example, so that it can contact the walls of the lumen.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The expansion mechanism may include forcing the endoprosthesis to expand radially. For example, the expansion mechanism can include the catheter carrying a balloon, which carries a balloon-expandable endoprosthesis. The balloon can be inflated to deform and to fix the expanded endoprosthesis at a predetermined position in contact with the lumen wall. The balloon can then be deflated, and the catheter withdrawn.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another delivery technique, the endoprosthesis is formed of an elastic material that can be reversibly compacted and expanded, e.g., elastically or through a material phase transition. During introduction into the body, the endoprosthesis is restrained in a compacted condition. Upon reaching the desired implantation site, the restraint is removed, for example, by retracting a restraining device such as an outer sheath, enabling the endoprosthesis to self-expand by its own internal elastic restoring force.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To support a passageway open, endoprostheses are sometimes made of relatively strong materials, such as stainless steel or Nitinol (a nickel-titanium alloy), formed into struts or wires. These materials, however, can be relatively radiolucent. That is, the materials may not be easily visible under X-ray fluoroscopy, which is a technique used to locate and to monitor the endoprostheses during and after delivery. To enhance their visibility (e.g., by increasing their radiopacity), the endoprostheses can be coated with a relatively radiopaque material, such as gold. Because the endoprostheses are typically kept in the body for a relatively long time, it is desirable that they have good biocompatibility.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention relates to methods of making medical devices, such as, for example, stents and stent-grafts, and methods of making the devices. More particularly, the invention features an endoprosthesis, such as a stent, having a layer that can enhance the biocompatibility of the endoprosthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect, the invention features a stent including a member having a first portion, and a second portion disposed outwardly of the first portion. The second portion is more radiopaque than the first portion and has a first layer including a radiopaque material, and a second layer defining an outer surface of the member and including the radiopaque material and a second material.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments may include one or more of the following features. The second layer includes an alloy of the radiopaque material and the second material. The radiopaque material is selected from the group consisting of gold, platinum, palladium, and tantalum.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a support <b>12</b> carrying a stent <b>10</b>, which is in the form of a tubular member defined by struts <b>11</b> and openings <b>13</b>. Depending on the type of stent <b>12</b> (e.g., balloon-expandable or self-expandable), support <b>12</b> can be a balloon catheter or a catheter shaft. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, stent <b>10</b> includes multiple cross-sectional portions. In particular, struts <b>11</b> of stent <b>10</b> are formed of a relatively radiolucent core <b>14</b> surrounded by a relatively radiopaque portion <b>16</b>. Radiopaque portion <b>16</b> includes a radiopaque layer <b>18</b>, e.g., made of gold, and a layer <b>20</b>, e.g., made of a gold-titanium alloy, that can enhance the biocompatibility of stent <b>10</b>. For example, layer <b>20</b> can be passivated to provide stent <b>10</b> with a relatively inert outer surface.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In general, stent <b>10</b> can be formed by coating a relatively radiolucent stent with a radiopaque material, such as gold or platinum, to form layer <b>18</b>. Layer <b>20</b> is then formed on the radiopaque material. Layer <b>20</b> can be formed on the pre-formed radiopaque layer <b>18</b> and/or formed from a portion of the radiopaque layer. Layer <b>20</b> is then passivated, e.g., by forming a layer of an oxide or nitride on layer <b>20</b> or by converting layer <b>20</b> to an oxide or a nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Core <b>14</b> is generally formed of one or more core material selected to provide stent <b>10</b> with certain physical and mechanical properties. For example, the core material is selected to provide stent <b>10</b> with sufficient hoop strength and radial strength so the stent can maintain a body vessel open. Suitable core materials include stainless steel (e.g., 316L stainless steel), Nitinol (e.g., for self-expandable stents), other titanium alloys, tantalum alloys, zirconium alloys, and/or niobium alloys. At the same time, it is also desirable to reduce (e.g., minimize) differences or mismatch in mechanical properties (e.g., stiffness) between the stent and the body vessel. The mechanical mismatch can cause, for example, inflammation and/or reocclusion of the vessel. One method of reducing mechanical mismatch is to form the stent with less material (e.g., by forming smaller struts <b>11</b>), thereby approximating the compliancy or resiliency of the vessel. However, reducing the amount of core material in stent <b>10</b> can also reduce the radiopacity of the stent.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To increase the radiopacity of stent <b>10</b>, the stent includes radiopaque portion <b>16</b> disposed over core portion <b>14</b>. Portion <b>16</b> includes radiopaque layer <b>18</b>, which is formed with a radiopaque material. The radiopaque material can be any material with a density and/or linear absorption coefficient sufficient to enhance the radiopacity of stent <b>10</b>. In embodiments, the radiopaque material has a density and/or linear absorption coefficient to attenuate an incident X-ray beam. In some cases, the radiopaque material has a density of equal to or greater than about 10 g/cc. Examples of radiopaque materials include gold, platinum, palladium, tantalum, iridium, cobalt, titanium, tungsten, stainless steel, Nitinol, and metal alloys containing a sufficient percentage of heavy elements. Radiopaque layer <b>18</b> can be, for example, up to about 8 microns thick, e.g., about 6–8 microns, thick. Methods of forming radiopaque layer <b>18</b> include, for example, electrodeposition, physical vapor deposition (e.g., sputtering), chemical vapor deposition, galvanizing, and/or dipping (e.g., in molten material).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some cases, however, the radiopaque materials do not have a desired level of biocompatibility and/or the biocompatibility of the material is unknown (e.g., in the long term). It is believed, for example, that gold may affect (e.g., catalyze) electron transfer in certain undesirable reactions in the body. Accordingly, radiopaque portion <b>16</b> includes a relatively inert layer <b>20</b> disposed over radiopaque layer <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Layer <b>20</b> enhances the biocompatibility of stent <b>10</b> by providing the stent with a layer (as shown, an outer layer) that can be passivated, e.g., more easily than radiopaque layer <b>18</b>. For example, layer <b>20</b> is capable of reacting (e.g., oxidizing) and forming products, such as oxides, nitrides, and/or carbides, that are more inert, and therefore, more biocompatible, than the material(s) in radiopaque layer <b>18</b>. Relative to radiopaque layer <b>18</b>, layer <b>20</b> has a lower oxidation potential, i.e., can be more easily oxidized to form a biocompatible product.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, layer <b>20</b> includes a mixture (here, an alloy) of the radiopaque material(s) in radiopaque layer <b>18</b> and one or more alloying material. The alloying material can be any material capable of forming a mixture with the radiopaque material(s), and forming a product that is more easily passivated than the radiopaque material(s). The alloying material can be, for example, tantalum, titanium, niobium, zirconium, chromium, silicon, rhodium, iridium, platinum, and/or palladium. Any of the alloying materials can be used with any of the radiopaque materials described above.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As an example, for a gold radiopaque layer <b>18</b>, the alloying material can be titanium. In this example, layer <b>20</b> includes an alloy of gold-titanium, such as Au<sub>0.30</sub>Ti<sub>0.70</sub>, which can be more easily passivated than gold. That is, relative to gold, the gold-titanium alloy can more easily form or be converted to a product, e.g., an oxide, that is relatively inert and biocompatible. In embodiments, for the alloy of gold-titanium (Au<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>y</sub>) x can range from about 0–30%, and y can range from about 70–100%. For example, x can be equal to or greater than about 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, or 25%, and/or equal to or less than about 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, or 5%. In embodiments, the concentration of titanium, y, can be equal to or greater than about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95%, and/or less than or equal to 100%, 95%, 90%, 85%, 80%, or 75%. Layer <b>20</b> can be up to about 10 microns thick, e.g., about 0.1–10 microns thick. Ternary (e.g., Au—Ti—Cr) or higher mixtures or alloy systems can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, layer <b>20</b> can be formed on a pre-formed radiopaque layer <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, after radiopaque layer <b>18</b> is formed, modified layer <b>20</b> can be applied on the radiopaque layer by physical vapor deposition, including sputtering and ion beam assisted deposition, chemical vapor deposition, or electrodeposition. Layer <b>20</b> can also be formed by forming layers, e.g., alternating layers, of the radiopaque material and the alloying material on layer <b>18</b> in a predetermined ratio, and heating the layers (e.g., at elevated, annealing temperatures) to form the alloy by diffuision.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Alternatively or in addition, layer <b>20</b> can be formed from a portion of a formed radiopaque layer <b>18</b>. That is, a portion of the radiopaque layer <b>18</b> can be converted to layer <b>20</b>. For example, a gold-titanium layer <b>20</b> can be formed by implanting titanium ions into a formed gold radiopaque layer <b>18</b>, and annealing the radiopaque layer. As a result, a certain thickness of the radiopaque layer (e.g., in the sub-micron range) is converted to an alloyed modified layer that can be passivated. In another example, a layer of alloy material, e.g., Ti, can be deposited on radiopaque layer <b>18</b>, e.g., Au, and the layers can be heated, e.g., annealed, to form an alloy, e.g., Au—Ti.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It should be noted that while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows radiopaque layer <b>18</b> and layer <b>20</b> as two discrete, well-defined layers, in some embodiments, the interface between the layers is not well defined. As a result, the endoprosthesis can be formed with good adhesion and high durability (e.g., reduced risk of flaking). Corrosion from contact of dissimilar material can also be reduced. The interface may not be well defined, for example, when modified layer <b>20</b> is formed from a formed radiopaque layer <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, radiopaque portion <b>16</b> does not include an interface between two layers. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a strut <b>22</b> of a stent is formed of a relatively radiolucent core <b>24</b> surrounded by a relatively radiopaque layer <b>26</b>. Core <b>24</b> is generally the same as core <b>14</b> described above. Radiopaque layer <b>26</b> includes one or more radiopaque material and one or more alloying material, as described above. In addition, radiopaque layer <b>26</b> is formed having a compositional gradient in which the concentration(s) of the alloying material(s) and/or the radiopaque material(s) varies along the thickness of layer <b>26</b> (arrows A and B). As an example, for a radiopaque layer <b>26</b> formed of a gold-titanium alloy, layer <b>26</b> can be relatively gold-rich (or titanium-poor) at surface <b>28</b> adjacent to core <b>24</b>, and relatively gold-poor (or titanium-rich) at outer surface <b>30</b>. At surface <b>28</b>, the concentration of the radiopaque material can be about 100%; and at outer surface <b>30</b>, the concentration of the alloying material can be about 100%. The concentration(s) of the radiopaque material(s)l and/or the alloying material(s) can vary linearly or non-linearly (e.g., exponentially) between surfaces <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>. The concentration(s), e.g., of the alloying material, can increase or decrease from surface <b>28</b> to surface <b>30</b>. In certain embodiments, layer <b>26</b> having the compositional gradient can be formed on a radiopaque layer, such as radiopaque layer <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Methods of forming compositionally-graded layer <b>26</b> include using physical vapor deposition while controlling the source of materials used for deposition. In another method, layer <b>26</b> can be formed by forming alternating layers of a radiopaque material and an alloying material in a predetermined ratio, and annealing the layers. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to form a concentration gradient of titanium along layer <b>26</b>, layers of titanium <b>27</b><i>a</i>, <b>27</b><i>b</i>, and <b>27</b><i>c </i>can be formed alternating with layers of gold <b>29</b><i>a</i>, <b>29</b><i>b</i>, and <b>29</b><i>c</i>. Titanium layer <b>27</b><i>a </i>is thicker than layer <b>27</b><i>b</i>, which is thicker than layer <b>27</b><i>c</i>. Gold layers <b>29</b><i>a</i>–<b>29</b><i>c </i>are of equal thickness. When the layers are subsequently annealed, they can diffuse together and form a gold-titanium alloy in which the concentration of titanium varies along the thickness of layer <b>26</b> (here, increasing with increasing distance from core <b>24</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">After layer <b>20</b> or <b>26</b> is formed, stent <b>10</b> can be passivated by exposing the stent to an appropriate environment. For example, stent <b>10</b> can be oxidized by heating the stent in an oxidizing atmosphere, such as one containing oxygen and/or water, to form an oxide layer on layer <b>20</b> or <b>26</b>. Nitrides can be formed by heating stent <b>10</b> in an atmosphere containing nitrogen, nitrogen-hydrogen, and/or ammonia. Carburizing, e.g., increasing the surface concentration of carbon, can be performed by exposing stent <b>10</b>, at an elevated temperature, to an atmosphere rich in a hydrocarbon gas, such as methane. Alternatively or in addition, passivation can be performed by electropolishing to produce an oxide-rich surface layer. In some cases, passivation can occur relatively spontaneously, e.g., upon exposure to air, when the oxidation potential is relatively low.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Stent <b>10</b> can then be finished, e.g., electropolished to a smooth finish, according to conventional methods. Stent <b>10</b> can be finished before passivation. Alternatively, stent <b>10</b> can be formed textured.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Stent <b>10</b> can then be used, e.g., delivered and expanded, according to conventional methods.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Generally, stent <b>10</b> can be self-expandable, balloon-expandable, or a combination of both. Examples of stent <b>10</b> and support <b>12</b> are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,725,570 (Heath) and 5,234,457 (Andersen), all hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In other embodiments, stent <b>10</b> is a part of a stent-graft. The stent-graft can be a stent attached to a biocompatible, non-porous or semi-porous polymer matrix made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), expanded PTFE, polyethylene, urethane, or polypropylene. Stent <b>10</b> can include a releasable therapeutic agent or a pharmaceutically active compound, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,674,242, and commonly-assigned U.S. Ser. No. 09/895,415, filed Jul. 2, 2001, all hereby incorporated by reference. The therapeutic agents or pharmaceutically active compounds can include, for example, anti-thrombogenic agents, antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, anesthetic agents, anti-coagulants, and antibiotics.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The following examples are illustrative and not intended to be limiting.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The following example describes ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD) as a method for depositing thin films on a substrate, e.g., a stent.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an IBAD system <b>50</b> generally includes a fixture assembly <b>52</b> configured to support a stent <b>54</b>, and a deposition assembly <b>56</b>. System <b>50</b> is used in a vacuum chamber <b>51</b> at pressures of about 1×10<sup>−4</sup>−3×10<sup>−4 </sup>Torr, provided in part by a diffusion pump <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Deposition assembly <b>56</b> includes two crucibles <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, their respective shutters <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>, two electron beam evaporators <b>68</b> and <b>70</b>, and an ion beam gun <b>72</b>. Crucibles <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, e.g., made of graphite, contain materials to be deposited, such as gold and titanium. Electron beam evaporators <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> are configured to generate a flow of electrons that can be focused (e.g., using magnetic fields) on the materials in crucibles <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, respectively, to melt and to evaporate the materials to form thermally evaporated materials <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Evaporators <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> can have water-cooled jackets that cool crucibles <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, respectively. Ion beam gun <b>72</b> is configured to receive a flow of argon (e.g., 2–4 sccm) and to ionize the argon to form a plasma <b>74</b>. Plasma <b>74</b> is accelerated out of ion beam gun <b>72</b> to stent <b>54</b> using magnets (not shown). Shutters <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> can be moved, e.g., swiveled, to allow or to block the flow of evaporated material <b>76</b> from crucibles <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Fixture assembly <b>52</b> is generally configured to allow stent <b>54</b> to be uniformly coated with evaporated material <b>76</b>. Typically, the thermal evaporation process can deposit a film of material <b>76</b> on a substrate that is in a line of sight of crucible <b>60</b> or <b>62</b>. To provide uniform coverage on stent <b>54</b>, the stent is rotated during deposition. In embodiments, stent <b>54</b> is placed on a rotatable spindle. The friction between the stent and the spindle can hold the stent in place during rotation to provide a coated stent without contact points. Alternatively, stent <b>54</b> can be clipped to a rotatable shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A quartz crystal <b>78</b> is used to determine the thickness of the deposited material. Crystal <b>78</b> is interfaced to a controller (not shown) and oscillated. The controller is calibrated such that the thickness of material deposited on crystal <b>78</b> (and thus also stent <b>54</b>) can be calculated by measuring the change in the oscillation frequency of the crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A method of coating using IBAD will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Stent <b>54</b>, e.g., a Nitinol or stainless steel stent, is thoroughly chemically cleaned. For example, stent <b>54</b> can be cleaned in a solvent (such as isopropyl alcohol or acetone) and a degreaser, and rinsed with deionized water. Heat and/or agitation, e.g., using ultrasonic energy, can be used to clean stent <b>54</b>. Stent <b>54</b> is then placed on fixture assembly <b>52</b>, which is then placed in vacuum chamber <b>51</b>, with the stent about two feet from crucibles <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Stent <b>54</b> is then subjected to a sputter cleaning. Chamber <b>51</b> is evacuated to a pressure of about 1×10<sup>−5 </sup>Torr, and ion beam gun <b>72</b> is activated. Ion beam gun <b>72</b> ionizes argon gas to form plasma <b>74</b>, and the plasma is accelerated to stent <b>54</b> to sputter clean/etch the surface of the stent. The angle of incidence for plasma <b>74</b> can be about 45–90°, e.g., about 70°. In embodiments, stent <b>54</b> is sputter cleaned for about 20–30 minutes. An estimated 100–300 angstroms of material can be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A first material, e.g., gold in crucible <b>60</b>, is then deposited. During the final ten minutes of sputter cleaning, electron beam evaporators <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> are slowly ramped up.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Shutters <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> are over their respective crucibles <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>, so no material can deposit on stent <b>54</b>. After sputter cleaning is complete and the material to be deposited is molten, shutter <b>64</b> moves, e.g., swivels, to allow evaporated material to coat stent <b>54</b>. The surface of stent <b>54</b> is simultaneously bombarded with plasma <b>74</b>. It is believed that as ions of the first material deposit on stent <b>54</b>, plasma <b>74</b> transfers energy to the ions, freeing some ions from the surface of the stent and allowing some ions to migrate on the stent surface. As a result, it is believed that a composite including the first material is formed with enhanced density.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A second material, e.g., titanium, tantalum, or platinum, is then deposited. After the thickness of the first material coated on stent <b>54</b> reaches, e.g., about 200–500 angstroms, shutter <b>66</b> is moved to allow the second material (in crucible <b>62</b>) to co-deposit with the first material. The concentrations of each material can be controlled by adjusting the power to evaporators <b>68</b> and <b>70</b>. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, initially the concentration of the first material is relatively high, and the second material is then slowly introduced. In embodiments, at time t, shutter <b>64</b> is moved to prevent the first material from depositing on stent <b>54</b>, and a pure layer of the second material is deposited over the alloy layer (i.e., the layer having the first and second materials). Then, stent <b>54</b> is allowed to cool, chamber <b>51</b> is returned to atmospheric pressure, and the stent is removed from the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In embodiments, stent <b>54</b> is then annealed. Annealing can promote diffusion between the layers of materials and/or the layers and the stent substrate, and can strengthen bonding or adhesion between the layers. In some cases, a Nitinol stent can be annealed at about 300–400° C., and a stainless steel stent can be annealed at about 500–1000° C. Annealing times can vary, e.g., from a few minutes to days, depending, for example, on the diffusion of the materials in stent <b>54</b>, which can be temperature-dependent.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">OTHER EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In other embodiments, one or more intermediate layers can be formed between core <b>14</b> or <b>24</b> and radiopaque layer <b>18</b> or <b>26</b>, i.e., at least a portion of the core and the radiopaque layer do not contact. For example, in embodiments in which there is lattice mismatch between the core and the radiopaque layer, intermediate layer(s) can be selected to have intermediate lattice parameters to serve as buffer layer(s), thereby reducing (e.g., minimizing) stress between the core and the radiopaque layer. The intermediate layer(s) can be, for example, a mixture of the core material and the radiopaque material.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Layer <b>20</b> may not include the radiopaque material(s) in radiopaque layer <b>18</b>. For example, a radiopaque layer may include gold, while layer <b>20</b> includes a material that can be passivated, such as a platinum-titanium alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Radiopaque layer <b>18</b>, layer <b>20</b>, and/or layer <b>26</b> can cover all or only one or more selected portions of a stent. For example, radiopaque layer <b>18</b>, layer <b>20</b>, and/or layer <b>26</b> may be formed only on one or more end portions of the stent.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, other types of layers can be formed on layer <b>20</b> or <b>26</b>. For example, one or more selected portions of a stent may include a magnetopaque (i.e., visible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) material on layer <b>20</b> or <b>26</b>. Suitable magnetopaque materials include, for example, non-ferrous metal-alloys containing paramagnetic elements (e.g., dysprosium or gadolinium) such as terbium-dysprosium, dysprosium, and gadolinium; non-ferrous metallic bands coated with an oxide or a carbide layer of dysprosium or gadolinium (e.g., Dy<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>); non-ferrous metals (e.g., copper, silver, platinum, or gold) coated with a layer of superparamagnetic material, such as nanocrystalline Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, or MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>; and nanocrystalline particles of the transition metal oxides (e.g., oxides of Fe, Co, Ni).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In other embodiments, radiopaque layer <b>18</b>, layer <b>20</b>, and/or layer <b>26</b> may be formed on medical devices other than stents and stent-grafts, for example, those where radiopacity is desired such as orthopedic implants.</p>
