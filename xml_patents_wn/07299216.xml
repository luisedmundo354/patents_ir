<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and apparatus that catalogs the characteristics and scheduling of multiple ETL procedures or processes as the multiple ETL procedures extract, transform data from a first database to load the data to a second database. The method and apparatus catalogs the progress and success of execution of multiple ETL procedures. The method and apparatus determines the necessary scheduling for cleansing operations of the first database, then initiates the cleansing operation of the first database, and then catalogs the progress of a cleansing process performed on a database to eliminate inconsistencies, redundancies, and corruptions of the database. The method and apparatus determines any errors in the execution of the ETL procedures and transmits an error message describing the errors to a person.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to database systems. More particularly, the present invention pertains to apparatus and methods for supervision of data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) procedures in data warehousing and data mart applications.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A data warehouse, as is known in the art, is a central repository for all or significant parts of the data that an enterprise's various business systems collect. Typically, a data warehouse is housed on an enterprise server computing system. Data from various processing applications and other sources is selectively extracted and organized on the data warehouse database for use by analytical applications and user queries. Data extracted and organized from a data warehouse is often placed in a data mart. A data mart is a repository of data gathered from operational data and other sources such a data warehouse that is designed to serve a particular group of people requiring the information.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is known in the art that in managing databases, extract, transform, and load (ETL) refers to three separate functions combined into a single program procedure. First, the extract function reads data from a specified source database and extracts a desired subset of data. Next, the transform function works with the acquired data—using rules or lookup tables, or creating combinations with other data—to convert it to the desired state. Finally, the load function is used to write the resulting data (either all of the subset or just the changes) to a target database, which may or may not previously exist.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">ETL procedures can be used to acquire a temporary subset of data for reports or other purposes, or a more permanent data set may be acquired for other purposes such as: the population of a data mart or data warehouse; conversion from one database type to another, and the migration of data from one database or platform to another.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The definitions of the data warehouse, data mart and ETL procedures were found 7/3/2002, at www.searchDatabase.com.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Refer now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for a description of a database processing system of the prior art. Programming applications <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, . . . <b>10</b><i>n </i>are executed by computer processors to create data that is stored in specific databases in database storage units <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>15</b><i>n</i>. The programming applications <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, . . . <b>10</b><i>n </i>are applications such as On-Line Transaction Programs (OLTP), where customers are able to create data such as purchases or sale order entry. The ETL procedures <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>, <b>25</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>25</b><i>n </i>are executed by the computer processors to remove data from the databases in the database storage units <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>15</b><i>n</i>, transform the data to the desired state and format, and loading of the transformed data to the data warehouse <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Historical data generated by older computer systems is maintained on a “legacy database” in a separate database storage unit <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to prevent the database information within the database storage units from being modified and potentially corrupted, an operational data storage (ODS) staging unit <b>35</b> is employed by the ETL procedures <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>, <b>25</b><i>c</i>, . . . , <b>25</b><i>n</i>, and <b>30</b> as a staging database retention device.

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The ETL procedures <b>25</b><i>a </i>and <b>25</b><i>b </i>illustrate that multiple ETL procedures may be performed on a database from a single database storage unit <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>15</b><i>n</i>,. The transformation portion of the ETL procedure performs different conversions to the database for placement in the data warehouse <b>40</b>. To improve the quality of the database or segment of the database being extracted from each of the database storage units <b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>15</b><i>n</i>, a cleansing process is executed to eliminate any inconsistencies, redundancies, and corruptions from the data being extracted. The cleansing process may be a separate program executed by the computer processor or a sub-procedure of the ETL procedure <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>, . . . , <b>25</b><i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The data marts <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b</i>, . . . <b>50</b><i>n </i>are databases within database storage units that are created to serve a particular group requiring an individualized database.

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">U.S. Pat. No. 6,208,990 (Suresh, et al.) teaches a computer software architecture to automatically optimize the throughput of data extraction/transformation/loading (ETL) process in data warehousing applications. This architecture has a component aspect and a pipeline-based aspect. The component aspect refers to the fact that every transformation used in this architecture is built up with transformation components selected from an extensible set of transformation components. Besides simplifying source code maintenance and adjustment for the data warehouse users, these transformation components also provide these users the building blocks to effectively construct pertinent and functionally sophisticated transformations in a pipelined manner. Within a pipeline, each transformation component automatically stages or streams its data to optimize ETL throughput. Furthermore, each transformation either pushes data to another transformation component, pulls data from another transformation component, or performs a push/pull operation on the data. Thereby, the pipelining; staging/streaming; and pushing/pulling features of the transformation components effectively optimizes the throughput of the ETL procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">U.S. Pat. No 6,189,004 (Rassen, et al.) demonstrates a method and apparatus for creating a data mart and for creating a query structure for the data mart. The method automatically defines a query interface for a data mart. The data mart includes fact and dimension tables. The method comprises accessing a schema description and a query interface description for the data mart. The schema description specifies a schema, which in turn, defines the relationships between the fact tables and dimension tables of the data mart. The query interface description specifies the fields, related to the schema description, which can be used in a query and the way in which results are to be presented to the user. The fields correspond to columns and rows in the fact tables. The schema description is used to create a first set of commands to create and populate the fact and dimension tables. Additionally, a second set of commands to create the query interface is created. Some commands of the first set of commands are executed causing the creation and population of the tables. Some commands of the second set of commands are executed causing the creation of a user interface. A query is generated using the user interface. The query is sent to the system for processing. The results of the query are presented to the user according the second set of commands.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">U.S. Pat. No. 6,151,608 (Abrams) describes a method and system for migrating data from one or more ASCII files and/or from one or more relational databases to one or more relational database tables without the need to write code. Abrams allows the user to define mapping templates and conditionals to assist in translating and transforming data values. Referential integrity, data dependencies, order of operations, and uniqueness constraints are enforced using a predefined set of migration rules templates that are based on the principles of relational design. The mapping and migration rules templates are used to intelligently generate instructions for updating or populating relational database destination tables. The instructions control the data transfer, data translation, data transformation, data validation, foreign key insertion, and the addition of required codes and flags in the destination tables. A migration engine of the system includes a data map architect and an update processor, which spawns the templates and migrates the data dynamically, utilizing the data definitions for the destination tables. In addition to supporting conversion efforts, Support for performing consolidation, restoration from an archive, migration to new instances, upgrading to a new release, adding additional features and enhancements, and changing business requirements is provided. The audit trail is complete enough that the entire migration process can be reversed without compromising the integrity of either the source or the destination application.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">“How to Select an Extraction/Transformation/Loading (ETL) Tool”, Mimno, 101communications LLC, Chatsworth, Calif. 91311, found 6/27/2002 www.101dataintelligencesolutions.com, provides techniques for selecting an appropriate ETL tool. The ETL tool operates at the heart of the data warehouse, extracting data from multiple data sources, transforming the data to make it accessible to business analysis, and loading multiple target databases. Unlike other components of a data warehousing architecture, it's extremely difficult to switch from one ETL tool to another. Because of a lack of standards, data definitions and transformation rules cannot be moved from one tool to another. If the selected ETL tool fails in production, it is the one component of the architecture that isn't easily replaceable.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In large enterprises that may have many databases stored on database storage units, multiple ETL procedures are executed periodically to extract, transform, and load the data from the data storage units to the data warehouse to create and maintain one or more databases and from the data warehouse to create and maintain the data marts. An ETL supervisor provides the control, monitoring, and cleaning necessary for coordinating and administering the databases and data marts of the enterprise.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The ETL supervisor determines the scheduling of the ETL procedures and initiates the execution of the ETL procedures at the appropriate schedule to extract, transform data from a first database to a second database. During the execution of the ETL procedures, the ETL supervisor determines the progress of the ETL procedure and catalogs the progress and success of execution of the multiple ETL procedures. As the ETL supervisor controls the ETL procedures, the ETL supervisor catalogs the characteristics and scheduling of the multiple ETL procedures. A sub-process of the ETL procedures, generally, indicates a scheduling for the cleansing of the first database to eliminate inconsistencies, redundancies, and corruptions. The ETL supervisor extracts the scheduling of the cleansing process and at the appropriate time executes the cleansing process. The key information of the cleansing process is logged for future reference.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The ETL supervisor logs any failures in the execution of the ETL procedures. The ETL supervisor reviews the logged failures and, if the failures are sufficiently severe, The ETL supervisor transmits a message to a responsible person detailing the failure.</p>
