<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to the use of belted roll magnetic material separation and particularly to an improved method of feeding materials onto such separator.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Relevant Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Magnetic separation technology exploits the difference in magnetic properties between magnetic feed material and non-magnetic material mixed therewith. Magnetic particles are pulled toward a drum shell or belt surface by magnetic force from within the drum or roll. In dry separation processes non-magnetic material is thrown off the apparatus by centrifugal force. The process works reasonably well for relatively coarse particles (for example, &gt;0.55 mm) because the centrifugal force is large enough to provide for adequate separation and when particles are not charged electrostatically to an extent or degree that would interfere with the separation process. What is needed is an improved method for introducing the feed material onto the separation apparatus to enhance separation of the material into magnetic and non-magnetic components, especially for small size or fine particles (for example, &lt;0.55 mm) and for materials that tend to be electrostatically charged.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of separating feed material including magnetic particles and non-magnetic particles using a magnetic roll separator having an idler roll and a driven magnetic roll carrying magnets about its circumference and a belt in contact with the rolls, comprising the steps of: moving the belt over the rolls; and directing the feed stream onto the belt after contact of the belt with the magnetic roll. Additional steps include: directing the feed stream at an angle perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the surface of the belt and magnetic roll; directing the feed stream at an acute angle with respect to the surface of the belt and the magnetic roll; selectively directing the feed towards an outer surface of the belt at a plurality of spaced positions; directing the feed with respect to the surface of such belt at a selectable angle; and providing the feed materials with predetermined kinetic energy to cause the non-magnetic particles to bounce away from the belt.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other aspects of the present invention include kinetically dispensing the magnetic particles to allow the magnetic particles to be attracted and adhere to magnetic poles provided by the magnetic roll; providing the feed materials with predetermined kinetic energy to cause the non-magnetic particles to bounce away from the belt; kinetically dispersing the magnetic particles to allow the magnetic particles to be attracted and to adhere to magnetic poles provided by the magnetic roll; selecting the angle of direction of feed onto the belt to be between an angle perpendicular to the surface of the belt and an acute angle with respect to the surface of the belt.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an additional aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of separating feed material including magnetic particles and non-magnetic particles using a magnetic roll separator having an idler roll spaced from a magnetic roll carrying magnets about its circumference and a continuous belt in contact with the rolls comprising the steps of: moving the belt over the magnetic roll; directing the feed onto the belt after contact with the magnetic roll at an angle of attack with respect to an outer surface of such belt; and directing the feed stream onto the belt to provide the feed material with sufficient kinetic energy to cause the non-magnetic particles to bounce on impact away form the belt and to disperse the magnetic particles to allow the magnetic particles to be attracted to and adhere to magnetic poles provided by the magnetic roll for enhancing the separation between the magnetic and non-magnetic particles. Other steps include directing the feed stream onto the magnetic roll whereby the angle of the feed stream is substantially perpendicular to the surface of the belt and magnetic roll; directing the feed stream onto the magnetic roll at an acute angle with respect to the surface of the belt and the magnetic roll; or selectively directing the feed stream towards the magnetic roll onto an outer surface of the belt at a plurality of spaced positions; or selectively directing the feed onto the magnetic roll at a plurality of positions where an inner surface of the belt is closely adjacent the magnetic roll; or selecting the angle of feed onto the belt to be between an angle perpendicular to such belt surface and an acute angle with respect to the surface of the belt.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for separating feed material including magnetic particles and non-magnetic particles using a belt and magnetic roll separator including a magnetic roll and an idler roll comprising the steps of: moving the belt over the magnetic roll and directing the feed onto the belt closely adjacent and firmly supported by the magnetic roll at a selectable position on the belt and at a selectable angle onto the belt. An additional step includes providing the feed material with sufficient kinetic energy to disperse the magnetic particles to adhere to magnetic poles for enhancing the separation of particles making up the feed material.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Background</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A magnetic separator is a device used to separate a mixture of fine, dry materials based upon their magnetic properties. The principles governing this process are magnetism and the interaction between magnetic, gravitational, and centripetal forces. The magnetic characteristics of a material are based upon atomic structure and magnetic field intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The principles involved in the separation apparatus include feed rate, particle velocity and magnetic field strength. Magnetic separation has two general applications:</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">1. Purification of feeds via the magnetic removal of impurities and (2) the concentration of magnetic materials from a mixture of materials.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Magnetic separation is a process in which two or more materials are separated from each other. The primary force employed is magnetization, however, there are other forces that act upon the particles as well.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a separator system <b>10</b> employs a magnetic separator roll <b>11</b>, driven by a mechanism <b>21</b> as well known in the art. Belt <b>12</b> is also a conventional belt as understood in the art. Feed <b>13</b> is directed from feed pan <b>16</b> via vibratory feeder <b>15</b> onto belt adjacent the idler roll <b>14</b>. Ionizer <b>17</b>, when used, provides an ion cloud <b>18</b> to neutralize electric charge on belt <b>12</b> and assists in removal of particles on the belt. Separated portions <b>19</b> are divided by splitters <b>20</b> also as understood in the art.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">THE PRESENT EMBODIMENT OF AN IMPACTING FEED METHOD</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As discussed hereinabove, normally the feed stream is fed onto the belt surface near the idler or non-magnetic roll <b>14</b> of the belt separator via feed pan <b>16</b>. This location is chosen so that the particles have time to “settle down” before they approach the magnetic roll <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the present invention, the feed stream is directed onto the belt at the location where the belt is in contact with the magnetic roll. There are two distinct advantages that derive from this approach. First, the time interval during which particles “settle down” in the prior art can result in the attraction to the belt due to static charges, which causes some of the fine particles to stick to the belt even though they should have been thrown out as non-magnetic product by the centripetal force. Ionizers as discussed hereinabove may assist in the separation, but some interference may still result during the “settling down” time period</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Second, the use of direct-to-magnetic roll feed allows for directing a given feed at the angle appropriate for optimization of separation for the specific feed properties at hand. In addition, the exact radial location of the feed input to the magnetic roll may be changed to further enhance separation as desired. In the prior art systems, the only input point that is suggested is tangentially onto the belt prior to the belt contacting the magnetic roll <b>31</b> prior to the 12 o'clock position. The variability of the “angle of attack” allows for the positioning of the magnetic particles so as to allow them to approach the magnetic surface with some kinetic energy of a predetermined quantity allowing the particles to disperse and to “find” a magnetic pole to adhere to. Finally, the non-magnetic particles will bounce on impact and therefore be thrown out from the roll/belt surface with greater energy thereby enhancing the separation and providing a significant improvement over existing technology.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With respect now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a pictorial illustration of the improved separation method is illustrated. The idler <b>30</b>, magnetic roll <b>31</b> and belt <b>32</b> moving in the direction as shown by arrow <b>33</b> are substantially as discussed for similar parts in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> hereinabove. Magnetic particles <b>34</b> are separated from non-magnetic particles <b>35</b> and deposited on collection surface <b>41</b> employing conventional splitter(s) <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each angle of direction or attack <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> and <b>40</b> is chosen based upon the content and type of feed <b>13</b> that is to be processed based upon the position of feed pan <b>13</b>′. Angle of attack <b>39</b> is perpendicular to the surface of belt <b>32</b> over magnetic roll <b>31</b>. The other angles <b>37</b>, <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> form acute angles with respect to belt <b>32</b> surface. The angles of attack <b>37</b>-<b>40</b> may be at any position on the outer surface of belt <b>32</b> from the vertical axis <b>43</b> that extends from an upper 12 o'clock position to the horizontal axis <b>44</b> at the 9 o'clock position.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-21</figref> a substantial improvement in a separation is obtained for the rare earth magnetic roll separator (RER) system with the impacting feed methods vs. the standard feed methods of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The results obtained when the angle of attack is substantially vertically is generally shown as angles <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. These results are set forth in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the significant improvements that result at four different feed rates in a roll feed method in accord with the present invention vs. a belt feed method of the prior art. The ionizer <b>17</b> was off during the test runs. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a substantial improvement obtains and does not vary in any significant manner as feed rates increase.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> illustrate results with other samples also with four feed rates. Again, the differences between roll feed and belt feed methods of separation are substantial.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref> illustrate six different samples each for belt operation vs. roll operation. A substantial reduction in Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>level is obtained from the use of the new impact feed methodology.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> illustrate test runs where ionizer <b>17</b> was on and different roll speeds were employed. Here again, the recovery rates of the impact feed methodology were substantially enhanced over the belt approach. In addition, as shown clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> the recovery percentage is significantly better employing the methodology of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-18</figref> illustrate results for angles substantially similar to angles <b>39</b>, <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> illustrate test results at constant roll speed with ionizer <b>17</b> turned on. Recovery is substantially higher with the impact feed methodology and results are more constant in the non-magnetic fraction even with varying feed rates.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-16</figref> illustrate results with ionizer <b>17</b> on and constant roll speed and show substantially the same improvements as seen hereinabove with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-18</figref> illustrate other test samples and show similar improvements as seen hereinabove with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref> illustrate five test runs employing constant roll speed and feed rates with ionizer <b>17</b> on (Nos. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) and off (No. <b>5</b>) illustrating that the 10 o'clock position of angle of attack offers a substantial improvement, with ionizer on or off, for the particular feed material over the prior art or standard feed position on the belt spacedly removed from the magnetic roll.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates another set of test runs showing the improved recovery and consistency employing the impact feed methodology according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">While the invention has been described with respect to certain specific embodiments, it will be appreciated that many modifications and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is intended therefore, by the appended claims to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
