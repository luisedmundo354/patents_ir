<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to optical films, sheets, or layers that create unique optical effects, and more specifically to optical films, sheets, or layers comprising a plurality of optical elements that form images at different distances from a surface of the film, sheet, or layer, thereby creating unique optical effects.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Decorative films and coatings are used for a variety of purposes such as to provide a desired aesthetic appearance, to attract a consumer's attention, or to create a particular visual effect such as a rainbow of colors. A variety of such decorative films are reflective. Examples of such decorative films include diffraction gratings on children's athletic shoes and hair accessories as well as on packages of toothpaste and cereal to name a few. Another common example includes holograms placed on credit cards for security purposes. More generally, such optical films and coatings may be used on decorative signs, packaging, consumer goods, and for other applications as well. Manufacturing processes for incorporating such simple optical elements into films are well-established, economical, and straightforward. Accordingly, striking decorative optical effects that can be practically implemented are thus both useful and desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A unique film comprising a sheet having optical elements capable of forming a plurality of images at different distances from a surface of the film or sheet has been developed and corresponds to a preferred embodiment of the invention. This film can be used in a wide variety of applications, including but not limited to uses related to packaging, signage, and decoration.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another embodiment of the present invention, an optical structure comprises a sheet of material having a surface. The surface comprises a plurality of optical elements. The optical elements are comprised of microscopic patterns in the surface that cooperate to produce an image. Each of the elements has a focal length. At least some of the focal lengths are significantly different from other focal lengths, such that some portions of the surface appear to be closer to a viewer than other portions of the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment of the present invention, a method of creating an optical effect from an image comprises producing ten or more copies of the image arranged in side-by-side relationship. Producing the copies of the images comprises using microscopic patterns in a surface to form some of the copies at different distances from a viewer than other of the copies. Examples of such microscopic patterns include Fresnel lenses and diffractive optical elements like diffraction gratings and holograms.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment of the present invention, a method of creating an optical effect from an image comprises producing at least first and second copies of the image at least partially superimposed over each other. Producing the first and second copies comprises using microscopic patterns in a surface to form the first of the copies at different distances from the viewer than the second of the copies. These first and second copies may be formed by microscopic patterns comprising first and second Fresnel lenses or diffractive optical elements having different focal lengths that have been superimposed.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The embodiments described herein relate to structures such as optical films, sheets, and layers comprising multiple optical elements. As described above, the terms film, sheet, and layers are used interchangeably as the meaning of these terms are generally the same.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As expounded above, these optical films may be useful for a variety of purposes, for instance, to capture a person's attention or to create a striking visual or aesthetic effect. Furthermore, these particular optical sheets, films, and layers produce unique three-dimensional appearances and motion effects when objects are moved relative to the optical layer.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An exemplary embodiment of a optical sheet <b>100</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The optical sheet <b>100</b> comprises a surface having a plurality of first regions <b>110</b> and a plurality of second regions <b>120</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first and second regions <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> are adjacent to each other. Although the first and second regions <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> of the optical sheet <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprise a series of columns having substantially constant width, in other embodiments the regions can be columns of variable width. The sizes of the regions <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may vary. The regions <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> can also have different shapes and should not be restricted to any particular shape such as columns or rows. The size and shape of the regions <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> can also differ across the optical sheet. The size and shape may be comprise a pattern, image or picture, design, and may be a letter, numeral, character, symbol, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An example of an alternative configuration is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which shows an optical sheet <b>200</b> having a first region <b>210</b> defining a shape within a second region <b>220</b>. The first region <b>210</b> is configured to be in the shape of a letter “Y”. This first region <b>210</b> is surrounded by the second region <b>220</b>, which serves as a background for the first region. In this example, the first region <b>210</b> is separated from the second region <b>220</b> by a small distance, although such separation is not required. In other embodiments, other configurations for the first and second regions <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> can be used to create other graphical effects. The first and second regions <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> may, for example, be configured and arranged in the shape of other images or pictures such as stars, flowers, or more abstract designs. The first and second region <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> may have a shapes that form letters, numbers, characters, symbols, text, or other graphics and should not be limited only to those examples described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Likewise, although the optical sheet <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are rectangular, in other embodiments the optical sheet may have other shapes including, non-polygonal shape such as a circle, and may have arbitrary or irregular shapes. The shape of the layer <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> may be selected to conform to an area on an object on which the layer is disposed. The optical <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> sheet may, for example, be affixed to an item such as a consumer good, package, sign, etc. using, e.g., adhesive or other technique for securing the optical sheet in place.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Again with reference to the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first regions <b>110</b> comprise a plurality of first optical elements <b>112</b>. The first optical elements <b>112</b> comprise optical elements capable of being formed in or on a film, sheet or layer, such as a Fresnel lenses, holographic optical elements, or other diffractive optical elements. Other types of optical elements capable of being formed in or on a sheet are also possible. Similarly, the second regions <b>120</b> comprise a plurality of second optical elements <b>122</b>. These second optical elements <b>122</b> may also comprise Fresnel lenses, diffractive optical elements, or other types of optical elements capable of being formed in or on a sheet. Therefore, there exist first optical elements <b>112</b> in the first regions <b>110</b> in this embodiment that are directly adjacent to second optical elements <b>122</b> in the second regions <b>120</b>. These optical elements <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> may be reflective or transmissive. The sheets <b>100</b> may be colored. For example, a reflective layer may have a colored tint. Similarly, a transmissive film included in the sheet may also possess color independent of dispersion effects.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, the first and second regions <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> comprise a large number of optical elements to create an optical effect. In one embodiment, a region comprises ten or more optical elements. In another embodiment, a region comprises 25 or more optical elements. In other embodiments, a region comprises 100 or more optical elements. A region may also comprise 1000 or more optical elements as well, although the possible ranges should not be limited to these. The plurality of first regions <b>110</b> may comprise different numbers or equal numbers of optical elements. The plurality of second regions <b>120</b> can also comprise different numbers or equal numbers of optical elements. The number of optical elements in the first region or regions <b>110</b> may or may not be the same as the number of optical elements in the second region or regions <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The size of the optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> may range between about 1 to 100 mm<sup>2</sup>. These optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> may be circular, elliptical, square, rectilinear, or have other regular or irregular shapes as well. In the case where the lenses have irregular shape, the average width of the optical elements may be between about 1 and 100 mm for certain embodiments. Dimensions (e.g., area, width, etc.) outside these ranges, however, are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, the plurality of first optical elements <b>112</b> are adjacent to each other in the first region <b>110</b>, and the plurality of second optical elements <b>122</b> are adjacent to each other in the second region <b>120</b>, although the embodiments should not be so limited. Also, the diffractive optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b>, are depicted as circular or portions of circles having substantially the same radius of curvature. In other embodiments, the optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> may have shapes other than circles or portions of circles or may be circles or portions of circles having different radii. Examples of other shapes include rectangles, squares, etc., as well as curved and irregular shapes. The shapes of the optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> may be the same or may be portions of the same geometric object or shape. Alternatively, the shapes of the optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> may be different or be portions of different shapes. Similarly, although the plurality of optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> are shown as comprising an irregular pattern in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 and 2</figref>, partially regular and ordered patterns may also be employed in other embodiments. The shapes and arrangement of the plurality of first optical elements <b>112</b> may be the same or different from the shapes and arrangement of the plurality of second optical elements <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an exemplary embodiment, the first and second optical elements <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> have optical power. This optical power may correspond to focal lengths in the range between about ±1 and ±100 millimeter in certain embodiments although focal lengths outside these ranges are possible. Accordingly, the first and second optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> are capable of producing an image from a light beam impinging on the surface of the optical sheet <b>100</b>. These first and second optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> preferably focus respective images on respective image planes for each of the optical elements. Preferably, the first optical elements <b>112</b> have a different focal length and corresponding optical power than the second optical elements <b>122</b>. In such embodiments, each of the plurality of first optical elements <b>112</b> focuses an image at a first distance d<sub>1 </sub>from the surface of the optical sheet <b>100</b>, and each of the plurality of second optical elements <b>122</b> focuses an image at a second distance d<sub>2 </sub>from the surface of the optical sheet <b>100</b>, wherein d<sub>1</sub>≠d<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In various embodiments, the distances d<sub>1 </sub>and d<sub>2 </sub>are non-zero distances that can be positive or negative (although the distance could be zero in the case where the optical element does not have optical power). As used herein, a positive distance indicates that an image is formed in front of the surface of the optical sheet <b>100</b>, and a negative distance indicates that an image is formed behind the surface of the optical sheet <b>100</b>. Optical elements having positive and negative focal lengths or optical power would produce images in front of and behind the optical sheet <b>100</b> (depending on whether the elements are reflective or transmissive). In addition, the image created by optical elements having one focal length may be inverted while images created by optical elements having another different focal length may be upright. In some embodiments, the focal lengths and corresponding distances d<sub>1 </sub>and d<sub>2 </sub>have a different sign, whereas in other embodiments, the focal lengths and distances d<sub>1 </sub>and d<sub>2 </sub>have the same sign.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described above, the optical elements may be transmissive or reflective. In the case where the optical elements are reflective, a real image may be formed in front of the optical sheet and a virtual image may be formed behind of the optical sheet. Alternatively, in the case where the optical elements are transmissive, a real image may be formed behind the optical sheet and a virtual image may be formed in front of the optical sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">These effects are illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an optical sheet 100 including a first optical element <b>112</b> in a first region <b>110</b> and a second optical element <b>122</b> in a second region <b>120</b>. Despite being in different regions, the first and second optical elements <b>112</b>,<b>122</b> are adjacent to each other. Therefore, the first and second optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are like many of the optical elements illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first optical element <b>112</b> forms a first image <b>114</b> at a distance d<sub>1 </sub>from the optical sheet <b>100</b>, and the second optical element <b>122</b> forms a second image <b>124</b> at a distance d<sub>2 </sub>from the optical sheet <b>100</b>. Therefore, the first and second images are longitudinally separated from each other by a distance |d<sub>2</sub>−d<sub>1</sub>|. As used herein, “longitudinally separated” refers to the distance along a perpendicular to the surface of the optical sheet <b>100</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The longitudinal offset adjacent image sets disclosed herein produce a visually striking and appealing appearance that captures a viewer's attention and thus may be useful in marketing to consumers, and especially in consumer packaging and point-of-purchase displays or other marketing displays. The optical sheets, films, and layers can also be used in other applications, such as in architectural applications, which include uses as privacy screens, cubical dividers, wall tiles, and floor tiles. The decorative uses, however, should not be limited to these. Other non-decorative uses, such as to demarcate an area or convey information in, for example, signage, as well as for other potential applications in medicine, science, industry, military or other environments. As indicated above, the optical sheets, films, and layers may be colored. For example, bright yellow, red, or orange films may be used to alert pedestrians to be cautious around potentially hazardous features such as steps, curbs, low hanging pipes, ceilings, doorways, glass windows, etc. Other uses including those not yet realized are envisioned as being possible as well.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition to creating unique and eye-catching three-dimensional appearances, the longitudinally offset image also exhibit unique motion effects. Exemplary three-dimensional motional effects resulting from optical elements having different, e.g., positive and negative, focal lengths are illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates that when an object moves in a particular direction relative to the optical film <b>100</b>, a first image <b>114</b> formed below the surface of the optical film <b>100</b> (that is, d<sub>1</sub>&lt;0) will move in the same direction as the object, whereas a second image <b>124</b> formed above the surface of the decorative film <b>100</b> (that is, d<sub>2</sub>&gt;0) will move in the opposite direction as the object. Where optical elements that create images on opposite sides of the optical film <b>100</b> are arranged in adjacent regions, such as in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, this configuration produces a visually striking motion effect when objects are moved relative to the optical film <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Although the exemplary optical sheets described herein contain first and second regions of optical elements, in other embodiments, more than two regions of optical elements can be used to form an optical layer. In such embodiments, each of the plurality of regions contains optical elements capable of forming an image at a unique distance or range of distances from the optical film surface. As explained above, this configuration can be used to produce unique three-dimensional appearances and motion effects. Also, the first and second regions can optionally comprise a plurality of sub-regions that may or may not be contiguous with each other. For example, the first region may comprise two or more sub-regions with different positive focal lengths and the second region may comprise two or more sub-regions with different negative focal lengths. Alternatively, the sub-regions in the first region may have different focal lengths but these different focal lengths may be close in length to each other in contrast to the focal length(s) for the second region. Other configurations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an exemplary embodiment, the first and second optical elements are of the same type (for example, both are Fresnel lenses). In other embodiments, the first and second optical elements are of different types (for example, the first optical elements are holographic optical elements, and the second optical elements are Fresnel lenses). Different types of optical elements can be mixed in other ways in a region or plurality of regions.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The optical elements preferably comprise microscopic patterns such as miniature curved or inclined or declined refractive (or reflective) surfaces as in the case of Fresnel lenses. The optical elements may also comprise surface relief features such as grooves or rulings or other phase change features such as index of refraction variations in the case of diffractive optical elements. These features may be circular, elliptical, cylindrical, linear, or have other regular or irregular shape and configurations. These features, whether grooves, miniature refractive features in a Fresnel lens, or diffractive features in a diffractive optical element such as a hologram, are preferably small having an average spacing that may range from between about 0.5 micrometers (μm) to about 2 millimeters (mm). These features also preferably have an average height or depth ranging from between about 0.2 micrometers to about 200 microns. Dimensions (spacing and size) outside these ranges are also possible. In the case where surface relief variations are employed, preferably, the microscopic features comprise features having sufficiently small physical dimension such that the optical elements are substantially smooth on a macroscopic scale across a plurality of optical elements, for example, across a region of 1 centimeter or larger. Accordingly, the optical elements and microscopic patterns are preferably smooth to the touch. Preferably these microscopic patterns are shaped and arranged to provide the desired focal length and optical power.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The microscopic patterns are preferably formed in or on a sheet. This sheet may be substantially transmissive or comprise a reflective surface. For example, a layer of metallization or a thin film dielectric stacked structure may be provided. As described above, the sheet may be colored. Accordingly, a material having color or a film such as a dielectric film that imparts color may be used. The sheet may comprise a flexible or rigid substrate such as for example paper, polyester (PET), polycarbonate (PC), polypropylene (PPOP), acrylic, and glass. Other materials may be used as well. In certain embodiments, a layer such as a polymer layer may be formed on the substrate and the microscopic patterns may be imprinted on this polymer layer. This polymer layer may be cured, for example, by UV curing, heating, exposure to e-beam or using other techniques. Other layers of material may be used to form the microscopic pattern. Alternatively, the microscopic pattern can be formed in the substrate in other embodiments as well. Still other configurations are possible and should not be limited to those described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the sheet or decorative film may be provided with an adhesive to affix the structure to a surface such as a package, consumer goods, etc. A laminate may also be disposed over the microscopic pattern. As indicated above, other configurations and designs are possible. The sheet, film, or layer produced may be referred herein as product.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A cross-section of an exemplary optical layer or film <b>100</b>, in an embodiment wherein the optical elements are Fresnel lenses, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As is well known, Fresnel lenses are refractive lenses having a substantially flattened spatial extent. Fresnel lens generally comprise a plurality of concentric or cylindrical rings. These rings comprise refractive surfaces having local curvature and/or inclination/declination similar to that of a conventional piano-convex or plano-concave refractive lens so as to refract light in a manner similar to a conventional non-Fresnel. In one embodiment, the Fresnel lenses formed on the optical film or layer have a diameter of approximately 0.25 inches and have a focal length of approximately 0.50 inches. In certain embodiments, the Fresnel lenses formed on the optical film or layer have a diameter between approximately 0.10 inches and approximately 0.50 inches. In still other embodiments, the Fresnel lenses formed on the optical film or layer have a diameter between approximately 0.01 inches and approximately 1.00 inches. In other embodiments, the Fresnel lenses formed on the optical film or layer have a focal length between approximately 0.25 inches and 0.75 inches. In still other embodiments, the Fresnel lenses formed on the optical film or layer have a focal length between approximately 0.10 inches and approximately 1.00 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As indicated herein, the optical elements can be larger or smaller. For example, optical elements such as Fresnel lenses may be about 2 to 6 inches or larger. One embodiment may comprise an ordered array of square optical elements about 2.4 inch on a side. These optical element may be stepped out into a plurality of rows and columns. The focal length may alternate, positive and negative across a given row and along a given column. For example, the first row may be positive, negative, positive, negative . . . , the second row may be negative, positive, negative, positive, the third row may be positive, negative, positive, negative, . . . , etc., to produce a striking visual effect. The size of the optical element may be larger, e.g. 4 or 6 inches or more across or may be smaller. Other configurations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a first Fresnel lens optical element <b>112</b> formed in a first region <b>110</b> of the optical film or layer <b>100</b>, and an adjacent second Fresnel lens optical element <b>122</b> formed in a second region <b>120</b> of the optical film or layer <b>100</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the first and second optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> are formed over a substrate <b>102</b>. The first Fresnel lens optical elements <b>112</b> comprises a plurality of rings <b>116</b> having curved or inclined/declined refractive surfaces <b>118</b> that refract light so as to form images. The second Fresnel lens optical elements <b>122</b> also comprises a plurality of rings <b>126</b> having curved or inclined/declined refractive surfaces <b>128</b> that refract light so as to form images. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows first and second Fresnel lens refractive optical elements <b>112</b>, <b>122</b> having approximately equal power of opposite sign. In such cases, the cross-sectional profiles may be the complement or the inverse of each other, the convex shapes curvatures of the rings in the first lens element <b>112</b> being opposite to or the negative of the concave shaped curvatures of the rings in the second lens element <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As described above, in some embodiments, the substrate <b>102</b> is reflective, and in other embodiments the substrate <b>102</b> is substantially transparent. In an exemplary embodiment, the substrate comprises a flexible material, such as a polymeric sheet or paper board, although in other embodiments the substrate comprises a rigid material, such as glass or rigid plastic. In a modified embodiment, additional optical elements (not shown) are formed on the backside <b>104</b> of the substrate <b>102</b>, effectively allowing a two-sided sheet or film <b>100</b> to be created. In another modified embodiment, the optical elements are coated with a laminate, such that the finished optical sheet or film has a smooth surface.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In various embodiments such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, two or more optical elements having different optical power and focal lengths may be superimposed over each other. These two or more lens elements may comprise Fresnel lenses or diffractive optical elements for example. Other types of optical elements capable of being formed in or on a sheet may also be employed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a first lens element <b>250</b> comprises a first plurality of rings <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B, <b>250</b>C, <b>250</b>D which may correspond, for example, to rings of a Fresnel lens. These rings <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B, <b>250</b>C, <b>250</b>D are concentric about a center <b>270</b>. These rings <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B, <b>250</b>C, <b>250</b>D may comprise refractive (or reflective) features similar to those depicted in the Fresnel lens <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Preferably, these rings <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B, <b>250</b>C, <b>250</b>D have refractive surfaces that are selected to provide the Fresnel optical element <b>250</b> with a first focal length.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also depicts a second optical element <b>260</b> comprising a second plurality of rings <b>260</b>A, <b>260</b>B, <b>260</b>C, <b>260</b>D that may also correspond to rings of a Fresnel lens. These rings <b>260</b>A, <b>260</b>B, <b>260</b>C, <b>260</b>D are also concentric about the center <b>270</b>. These rings <b>260</b>A, <b>260</b>B, <b>260</b>C, <b>260</b>D may comprise refractive (or reflective) features similar to those depicted in the Fresnel lens <b>122</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Accordingly, the first set of rings <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B, <b>250</b>C, <b>250</b>D corresponding to the first optical element <b>250</b> may be the inverse, complement, or negative, of the second set of rings <b>260</b>A, <b>260</b>B, <b>260</b>C, <b>260</b>D corresponding to the second optical element <b>260</b>. Nevertheless, the rings <b>260</b>A, <b>260</b>B, <b>260</b>C, <b>260</b>D of the second optical element <b>260</b> preferably have refractive surfaces that are selected to provide the second Fresnel optical element <b>260</b> with a second focal length.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically shows four rings <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B, <b>250</b>C, <b>250</b>D in the first optical element <b>250</b> and four rings <b>260</b>A, <b>260</b>B, <b>260</b>C, <b>260</b>D in the second optical element <b>260</b>, more or less rings may be included in either of the optical elements.

Other configurations are possible. For example, more than two lenses may be superimposed in other embodiments. The ordering can also be different. Additionally, the order may vary from the outermost ring to the center and the same pattern need not be repeated. Other variations are possible.

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0051">As described above, the focal length of the first Fresnel optical element <b>250</b> and the focal length of the second optical element <b>260</b> are preferably different. Accordingly, images of an object are formed at different distances (d<sub>1 </sub>and d<sub>2</sub>) from the optical film or sheet. In various preferred embodiments, the focal length of the first Fresnel optical element <b>250</b> may be positive and the focal length of the second optical element <b>260</b> may be negative. For example, the rings <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B, <b>250</b>C, <b>250</b>D in the first optical element <b>250</b> may comprise positive features yielding a positive focal length while the rings <b>260</b>A, <b>260</b>B, <b>260</b>C, <b>260</b>D in the second optical element <b>260</b> may comprise negative features yielding a negative focal length. As described above, one image may be formed in front of the optical sheet and the other image is formed behind the optical sheet. Also, one of the images may be virtual and the other image may be real.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0052">Since the two lenses <b>250</b>, <b>260</b> are superimposed, the images formed by each of these lenses are preferably superimposed or overlap as well. One of these images, however, may be closer to the viewer and one of these images may appear farther from the viewer. Additionally, one of these images may be inverted and one of these images may be upright. The images may have the same size or may have different sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0053">In various embodiments the optical elements <b>250</b>, <b>260</b> may be partially overlapped and need not be completely overlapped. Similarly, the images may be partially overlapped and not completely overlapped.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0054">The pair of overlapped optical elements <b>250</b>, <b>260</b> may range in size from about 1 to 100 millimeters. The resultant focal lengths may range between about 1 to 100 millimeters. Dimensions outside these ranges, however, are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0055">In an embodiment similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the optical elements <b>250</b>, <b>260</b> may comprise diffractive optical element such as holograms. The rings may, for example, comprise phase features such as refractive index modulations or surface relief features (e.g. thickness variations) that alter the optical path length and phase of the light. As discussed above, preferably the diffractive optical elements <b>250</b>, <b>260</b> have different focal lengths. One may be positive and the other may be negative. Accordingly, the phase features in the first optical element <b>250</b> may be the reciprocal of the phase features of the second optical element <b>260</b>. The phases may, for example, differ by π. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, preferably the pair of optical elements <b>250</b>, <b>260</b> are superimposed or at least partially overlapped and produce images that are partially or substantially overlapped. The rings <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B, <b>250</b>C, <b>250</b>D and <b>260</b>A, <b>260</b>B, <b>260</b>C, <b>260</b>D are concentric about a common center point <b>270</b>. Preferably, however, the focal lengths of the two optical elements <b>250</b>, <b>260</b> are different and the respective images formed by these optical elements are formed at different distances from the viewer.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0056">Although a plurality of circular rings are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the optical features may be non-circular. These optical features may, for example, be elliptical or linear or curved or have other regular or irregular shapes and configurations. The patterns need not be symmetric or continuous. Such non-circular diffractive, refractive, or reflective features, may be used for example in holograms or other diffractive optical elements as well as Fresnel lenses. As described above, other optical elements that may be formed in or on the sheet may be employed as well.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0057">Also, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a pair of optical elements <b>250</b>, <b>260</b> overlapped, additional optical elements can be partially or substantially completely overlapped in other embodiments. Also, although a single pair of optical elements <b>250</b>, <b>260</b> is shown, more than one pair can be included in side-by-side arrangement or otherwise laterally displaced across an optical sheet, film, or layer. For example, the optical sheet may include a plurality of pairs stepped and repeated across the sheet or a portion thereof. The plurality of pairs of superimposed optical elements may comprise an ordered array of pairs or a disordered or irregular arrangement, or a pattern that is partially irregular but that exhibits some regularity may be employed. Other variations in the configuration and arrangement are possible as well.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0058">The optical elements formed on the optical films and sheets described herein can be manufactured according to a wide variety of techniques. For example, individual dies for Fresnel lenses or diffractive or holographic optical elements can be formed by diamond turning or photomask techniques. Larger patterns may be formed by step and repeat processes. As discussed above, the arrangement of lenses may be disordered or ordered, e.g., periodic. Larger lens patterns may be embossed onto rolls of film to create the optical sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0059">An exemplary system <b>350</b> that can be used to form product as described herein is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this system, a sheet <b>352</b> comprising a substrate layer coated with a curable material is fed by a film supply <b>354</b>, and is ran past a master drum <b>356</b> having an outer surface <b>358</b> on which a surface relief pattern <b>304</b> is formed. The surface relief pattern <b>304</b> may correspond to a negative or inverse copy of the features comprising the optical elements to be formed on the finished product. Rollers <b>360</b> are positioned adjacent the drum <b>356</b> to force the coated sheet <b>352</b> against the surface relief pattern <b>304</b>. The portion of the drum <b>356</b> where the curable material makes contact with the drum <b>356</b>, and is cured, is referred to as the contact area <b>362</b>. The drum <b>356</b> optionally contains a source of ultraviolet light <b>364</b> that irradiates the contact area <b>362</b> to from optical elements, such as diffractive elements, Fresnel lenses, or holographic elements, in the curable material. The resultant product is taken up by a rotating spool <b>366</b>. Large sheets can be formed in this manner. Individual sections of product can be die cut from the large sheets. To form the drum, diamond turning, photomasking techniques in combination with step and repeat processes such as described above can be employed. Other approaches are possible as well.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0060">The methods of fabricating the sheets of optical elements should not be limited to those described above or elsewhere herein. Other different approaches in processing and manufacture are possible. For example, surface relieve or volume holographic or other diffractive optical elements may be formed using well-known processes such as contact copying, embossing, casting, and extruding. Multiple replication steps may be employed. One exemplary method of creating a volume diffractive optical elements by embossing a surface relief pattern onto a layer of curable material, is described in greater detail in U.S. patent application Publication U.S. 2003/0124435 A1, entitled “Diffractive Optical Element and Method of Manufacture”, and published on 3 Jul. 2003.
