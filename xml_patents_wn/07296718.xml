<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method of production and arrangement for feeding and guiding web materials in laterally separate paths to a machine for producing packing blanks.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As used herein, ‚Äúweb material‚Äù refers to a material that is thin in relation to its width and having a continuous length. In this connection, the web material is advanced to a machine for producing packing blanks. ‚ÄúPacking blanks‚Äù refers to a semi-finished container or similar packing product, that is afterwards modified to cover an item for transport or storage. Typical web materials for producing packing blanks include, e.g., corrugated cardboard of different grades and widths provided on reels, or folded to form an orthogonal package known as fan fold.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Machines for producing packing blanks are known in different configurations. The specific machines referred to herein are typically equipped with multiple cutting and creasing tools that are individually controllable within an operative width of the machine. I.e., the tools are individually positioned within the operative width, and individually operated to engage the web material for cutting and creasing operations. Such operations are notoriously performed in a feed direction through the machine and, if appropriate, also in a transverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The web materials are advanced through feeder means that are operated and controlled in synchronization with the operation and control of the machine and its processing tools. The feeder means may be operatively connected to the machine, typically though the feeding is an integrated function of the machine. An example of the machine type referred to is found in WO 00/21713.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The producers of packing blanks typically desire a machine having an operative width that is wider than the largest dimension presently processed, thereby ensuring a capacity to meet future needs. Another relevant factor in this context is the versatility of the machine to shift the production of different products, requiring webs of different widths and/or grades. Accordingly, the full width and capacity of the machine is rarely exploited in the production of packing blanks. Typically, a supply of webs having different widths or grades are lined up in the feed direction, requiring significant storage space and feeding distance upstream of the machine. This disadvantage is another problem in connection with prior methods and equipment.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a method of production that allows a higher exploitation of a machine for producing packing blanks.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This object is met, according to the invention, through feeding web materials individually in parallel feed paths through the machine, comprising the step of guiding the web materials in laterally separate paths from a side by side storage to the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The method not only permits a faster shifting between web materials, but provides also for multiple processing or simultaneous production of packing blanks from multiple webs.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method and a web guide ensuring that the webs are laterally separated as they are introduced in a machine for producing packing blanks.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Still another object is to increase the personal security at a production site.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">These objects are met through the step and arrangements for controlling the longitudinal margins of each web in a guided passage that is laterally adjustable to accommodate the width of the web and to locate the position of each web relative to the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Still another object is to provide a web guide adapted for guiding a fan fold web material from a web supply to a machine for producing packing blanks, while preserving the integrity of the web portion between the crease lines/fold lines, of the fan fold web.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">This object is met by equipping the web guide with a line up means comprising a capstan, wherein a circumference of the capstan is defined through horizontal bars parallel with a rotation axis of the capstan, and the cord length between adjacent bars of the capstan corresponding to the distance between the fold lines of the fan fold web material.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Other objects met through the method and arrangements presented are, e.g., low cost and energy consumption, avoidance of complicated web shifter structures and a low consumption of construction materials. The capstan and web guide allows a transport that preserves the web material, reducing the feed resistance by applying a rotary feed, thereby reducing the pulling power and wear on the web material.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the following disclosure, reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a machine for producing packing blanks is generally identified through reference number <b>10</b>, a web guide is generally numbered <b>20</b>, and a web supply in the form of a package of fan fold web material is generally numbered <b>40</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the web guide <b>20</b> is shown separated from the machine <b>10</b> and web supply <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The machine <b>10</b> is typically equipped with multiple cutting and creasing tools that are individually controllable within the operative width of the machine. The tools are supported on guides and controlled by a programmable control unit for individual, lateral positioning on the guides. Tool displacement may be realized through an endless, rotating belt to which the tools are individually connected and disconnected. The tools are also individually controlled to engage the web material for cutting and creasing operations. Such operations are notoriously performed in a feed direction through the machine. In drawing <b>1</b>, the feed direction goes from right to left. Typically, the machine <b>10</b> also comprises tools operative in a second direction transversely to the feed direction. A feed function is integrated in the machine <b>10</b>, comprising feed rollers engaging the web and operative to advance the web through the machine to be processed into packing blanks by the cutting and creasing tools.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The detailed structure and operation of the machine <b>10</b> is not critical in order to profit from the invention. However, a significant feature of the machine <b>10</b> employed in this invention is that the feed function is divided into individually operating sections over the operative width of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A sectioned feed function may be realized in many ways, such as through separate feed rollers, each feed roller driven separately from the others. One solution foresees an integral, driven feed roller cooperating with multiple rolls or wheels, the rolls or wheels controlled individually or in sets to engage the web and to provide a counter pressure from an opposite side of the web. Another alternative or complementary realization of a sectioned feed function comprises the step of frictionally arresting a web while the feed rollers are running. To this end, a clamping force may be applied regionally through a number of brake means distributed over the operative width of the machine. Such brake means may be hydraulically, pneumatically or electrically driven and controlled individually or in sets to press a web against structural elements of the machine frame, e.g.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The web guide <b>20</b> is effective for controlling the web materials to be advanced in laterally separate paths to the machine <b>10</b> for producing packing blanks. The web guide <b>20</b> comprises a frame having a horizontal member <b>21</b> extending transversely to the feed direction of the webs. Each web is controlled by a pair of guide rails <b>22</b>, the guide rails running in parallel in the feed direction and being laterally displaceable on the horizontal member <b>21</b> to accommodate the width and longitudinal margins of a web material. Each guide rail <b>22</b> comprises an upper flexible strip <b>23</b> spaced from a lower flexible strip <b>24</b>, defining there between a guided passage for the longitudinal margin of the web. The guided passage runs continuously from an entrance end <b>25</b> to an exit end <b>26</b> of the guide rail <b>22</b>. The upper and lower flexible strips are made of any suitable material such as thin metal or synthetic materials, e.g. The spacing that provides the guided passage is ensured through a U-shaped clamp <b>27</b> separating the strips at the entrance end <b>25</b>, and through a vertical shield <b>28</b> that holds the upper and lower strips in a spaced relation at the exit end <b>26</b>. Within each pair of guide rails <b>22</b> the vertical shields <b>28</b> are facing each other from the opposite longitudinal margins of the two guide rails, preventing the web from leaving the guided passages when the pair of guide rails <b>22</b> is laterally adjusted to accommodate the width of the web material.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">From the above it will be appreciated that the guide rails <b>22</b>, covering opposite sides of the longitudinal margins of the webs in motion, provides increased personal security at the production site.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The exit end <b>26</b> of guide rail <b>22</b> is connectable to the machine <b>10</b>. Advantageously the exit end <b>26</b> is laterally displaceable on guide means, carried on the machine <b>10</b> as conventional. For example, the exit end <b>26</b> may be formed to slide on a horizontal rail arranged on the machine. A locking device <b>29</b> secures the exit end <b>26</b> to the machine in a lateral position. The locking ensures that the web maintains a correct location relative to the machine <b>10</b> in the transverse or lateral direction.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The guide rail <b>22</b> is laterally displaceable on the frame of web guide <b>20</b>. To this end, the guide rail <b>22</b> may be formed to slide on a horizontal rail arranged on the horizontal member <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The guide rails <b>22</b> may be sliding freely on the frame of web guide <b>20</b> and on the machine <b>10</b>, to be manually positioned in order to accommodate the width of a web material and to locate the web relative to the machine. Spacer flanges <b>34</b> at entrance ends and on shields <b>28</b> define a minimum lateral gap between adjacent webs.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Alternatively, the lateral adjustment of guide rails <b>22</b> may be achieved through a mechanical drive such as a geared or helical rack, rotatable on the machine or on the horizontal member of the frame, and engaging a geared seat on the guide rail <b>22</b>. Alternative mechanical structures may be contemplated in a driven lateral displacement of the guide rails <b>22</b>, such as chains or belts, e.g. A driven lateral displacement of the guide rails <b>22</b> may also rely on an endless member carried on the machine <b>10</b> and driven to rotate for displacement in alternate directions by employment of an upper and lower part of the endless member.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An advantageous embodiment foresees that the guide rails of at least one pair of guide rails are controlled in parallel for lateral displacement in mutually opposite directions relative to a center. This may be achieved in a driven displacement using the endless member, a chain, a belt, or by employment of a helical rack that is geared in opposite directions, e.g. Preferably, the center of parallel displacement is adjustable in lateral direction and applied at least to a central web path through the web guide <b>20</b> and through the machine <b>10</b> for producing packing blanks.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further details apparent from the drawings, such as the vertical posts <b>30</b> and horizontal rack <b>31</b> of frame <b>20</b>, front rail <b>32</b> of horizontal member <b>21</b>, the flaring plates <b>33</b> at the entrance ends <b>25</b>, and other details not mentioned, are less critical features of the illustrated embodiment and not further discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Reference number <b>40</b> refers to a package in a supply of fan fold web material. Packages <b>40</b> are stored side by side transversely to the feed direction, substantially in parallel with the machine <b>10</b> and web guide <b>20</b>. The number and total width of the packages <b>40</b> relates to the operational width of the machine <b>10</b>. The packages <b>40</b> may comprise fan fold webs of different sizes and/or different grades. In exchange for packages <b>40</b> of fan fold web material, the machine <b>10</b> may also be supplied web materials stored on reels and controlled by the web guide of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In order to preserve the integrity of the web portion between the crease or fold lines of the fan fold web material, a line up means <b>200</b> is associated with the web guide <b>20</b>. The line up means <b>200</b> is effective for aligning the fan fold web, in a vertical plane, with the main direction of guide rails <b>22</b> for a problem-free passage at the entrance ends <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Line up means <b>200</b> comprises a capstan <b>201</b>, freely rotating about an axis <b>202</b> transversely to the feed direction. The axis <b>202</b> is supported on arms <b>203</b> extending from the frame <b>20</b>. Advantageously, the arms <b>203</b> may be laterally displaceable on the horizontal member <b>21</b> of the frame to be positioned at a center of each web path, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The capstan <b>201</b> has a circumference, illustrated through a dash-dot circle line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, that is defined through horizontal bars <b>204</b> carried in the ends of radial members <b>205</b> extending from a central hub <b>206</b> of the capstan. A cord length c between successive bars <b>204</b> of the capstan <b>201</b> corresponds to a length l between fold lines of the fan fold material. When loading the fan fold web into the web guide <b>20</b>, capstan <b>201</b> is synchronized to support the web through the bars <b>204</b> successively engaging the fold lines as the capstan rotates, thereby directing the web into the guide rails without causing additional folding of the straight web portion between the fold lines of the fan fold material. The capstan <b>201</b> is likewise effective for aligning a reeled web material with the guide rails <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably, the angle between radial members <b>205</b>, or angular distance between adjacent bars <b>204</b>, is 120¬∞ as seen from the centre of capstan <b>201</b>. Naturally, other angular distances may be chosen as long as the relation between cord length c and fold line distance l is met. However, three bars <b>204</b> forming an isosceles triangle reduces the risk of bad synchronization and provides the most compact structure for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, the capstan <b>201</b> may be assisted by an arm <b>207</b> that is effective for holding-down the web towards the capstan. The arm <b>207</b> preferably is flexible, made of thin metal or synthetic material, e.g., and attached to the frame <b>20</b> so as to reach upstream from the location of the entrance ends of guide rails <b>22</b>. The arm <b>207</b> may be biased, through a spring element or through an inherent bias, to press the web for contact with the bars <b>204</b> of the capstan as the capstan rotates, anti-clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The web guide <b>20</b> disclosed above makes possible a method of production that allows a higher exploitation of a machine for producing packing blanks. By guiding the web materials in laterally separate paths from a side by side storage to the machine, not only a faster shifting between web materials will be achieved. Combined with a sectioned feed function, capable of feeding individual webs in parallel paths through the machine for processing into packing blanks, the web guide also makes possible a multiple processing, i.e. a production of packing blanks from two or more webs at the same time. As a whole, the invention leads to shorter standstills at shifting operations, better exploitation of operative machine width, and higher flexibility in the production of different sized or configured packing blanks. Another important aspect of the invention is that the guide rails <b>22</b>, denying access to the longitudinal margins of the webs in motion, provides increased personal security at the production site.</p>
