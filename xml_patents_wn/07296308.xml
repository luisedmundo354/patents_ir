<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention comprises, in one form thereof, a water circulator that connects to the pressurized water inlet in a swimming pool. Water from the pool is pumped through the pool's filter system and into the water circulator through the pool inlet. The water circulator includes a jet tube that is vertically oriented and proximate to the pool's side wall. The pressurized water exits the jet tube through several nozzles in the jet tube. The nozzles direct the pressurized water along the side wall to thereby direct debris toward the pool outlet. The pool outlet carries the debris and water to the pool's filter system. The nozzles direct the water away from the pool outlet so that the water current travels along the majority of the side wall before reaching the pool outlet. Thus, more debris may be picked up in the current and slower moving water passes the pool outlet. The jet tube further includes one or more outlets proximate to the pool floor. These outlets are directed towards the center of the pool so that the pressurized water stirs up debris and sediment on the floor.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to swimming pool water circulation as a means for cleaning the pool water.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One typical prior art swimming pool water circulation system is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The prior art system includes an assembly <b>14</b> comprised of a strainer, a pump, and a filter.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the prior art filtering system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the water in the swimming pool <b>12</b> first travels into an outlet port <b>26</b> of the swimming pool <b>12</b>. The water withdrawn from pool <b>12</b> is fed into intake port <b>30</b> of assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a substantially circular swimming pool <b>12</b> is depicted, however other shapes and sizes may be used for swimming pool <b>12</b>. Thus, swimming pool <b>12</b> may be oval shaped, rectangular, square shaped, irregularly shaped, etc. Furthermore, the outlet port <b>26</b> may be disposed at a different location, and there may be a multiplicity of such outlet ports <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, water entering intake port <b>30</b> of assembly <b>14</b> is circulated through the filter in assembly <b>14</b>. Typically disposed within filter in assembly <b>14</b> is a filtering media <b>32</b>. The precise location of the filter media and of the strainer, filter tank, pump, and other accessories typically used with these filtering systems will vary from one filter system to another. The filter in assembly <b>14</b> may include a sand filter, a diatomaceous earth filter, a cartridge filter, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The water enters the intake port <b>30</b>, passes through a strainer, a pump, and then the filter media <b>32</b> and exits via output port <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The cleaned water is then fed to a return water port <b>28</b>. Such a return water port <b>28</b> is typically built into a sidewall <b>20</b> of pool <b>12</b>. The water fed through return water port <b>28</b> then flows directly across the surface of the pool, typically in a pattern shown by the arrows.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Such a water circulation pattern does little if anything to agitate and gather up the sediment and debris <b>24</b> that typically rests on the floor <b>21</b> or that is suspended below the surface of the water.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, a swimming pool circulation system that effectively agitates the pool water is desired in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention comprises, in one form thereof, a swimming pool water circulating system including a pool with an amount of water and a pressurized water inlet, a jet tube that is submerged in the water and in fluid communication with the water inlet, and a plurality of nozzles that penetrate the jet tube.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The jet tube is oriented in a substantially vertical direction and substantially parallel to the side wall of the pool. The nozzles direct the pressurized water in a direction that is parallel to the side wall and away from a pool skimmer/outlet. The jet tube also includes at least one outlet in the end of said tube proximate to the floor. These outlets are directed in a direction substantially perpendicular to the direction of the nozzles. A pump drives water from the pool skimmer/outlet through a strainer and filter media to the pressurized water inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An advantage of the present invention is that a water current is developed along the sides of the pool and across the pool floor to thereby stir up debris and direct it toward the pool skimmer/outlet. The water current also circulates more of the pool water past the pool skimmer/outlet such that an increased amount of sediment and debris enters the pool's filter system and is removed.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown the swimming pool water circulation system of the present invention. The circulation system <b>10</b> includes a pool <b>12</b>, a filter and pump assembly <b>14</b>, and a water circulator <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The swimming pool <b>12</b> includes a side wall <b>20</b> and floor <b>21</b>, water <b>22</b>, debris <b>24</b>, skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b>, and pool inlet <b>28</b>. The swimming pool <b>12</b> may be circular, elliptical, rectangular, irregularly shaped, etc. Further, the pool <b>12</b> may be an above-ground or in-ground pool. The debris <b>24</b> may be suspended in the water <b>22</b>, as well as floating on top of the water and resting on the pool floor <b>21</b>. In most pools, the skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b> is located on the side wall <b>20</b>, approximately centered at the surface of the water <b>22</b>. The pool inlet <b>28</b> is conventionally located on the side wall <b>20</b> near the surface of the water <b>22</b> and offset in a counter-clockwise direction from the skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b>. In some cases, however, the pool inlet <b>28</b> is offset in a clockwise direction from the skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b>. The pool inlet <b>28</b> includes a through-the-wall assembly <b>29</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The through-the-wall assembly <b>29</b> is internally threaded and is connected to a fluid passageway that is connected to the filter and pump assembly <b>14</b>.</p>

The filter output <b>34</b> is in fluid communication with the pool inlet <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The water circulator <b>16</b> is affixed to the pool inlet <b>28</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> displays the water circulator <b>16</b> in greater detail. The water circulator <b>16</b> includes an adaptor <b>36</b>, an elbow <b>38</b>, a coupler <b>40</b>, a jet tube <b>42</b>, and an end cap <b>44</b>. The adaptor <b>36</b> is threaded into the through-the-wall assembly <b>29</b> of the pool inlet <b>28</b> or otherwise removably affixed to the pool inlet <b>28</b> in a substantially water-tight manner. The elbow <b>38</b> fits tightly within the adaptor <b>36</b> and is affixed to adaptor <b>36</b> with a set screw, an adhesive, or other suitable means. The elbow is oriented such that one end is directed towards the pool floor <b>21</b>. The coupler <b>40</b> is removably affixed to the elbow <b>38</b> such as by threading the coupler <b>40</b> onto the elbow <b>38</b>. Alternatively, a short tube <b>46</b> is affixed to the elbow <b>38</b> with a set screw, an epoxy, or other suitable means and the coupler <b>40</b> is removably affixed to the short tube <b>46</b>. The jet tube <b>42</b> fits snugly into the coupler <b>40</b> and is removably affixed to the coupler <b>40</b> such as with a set screw or by threading the jet tube <b>42</b> into the coupler <b>40</b>. The end cap <b>44</b> slides snugly onto the jet tube <b>42</b> and is affixed to the jet tube <b>42</b> with a set screw, an adhesive, by threading the end cap <b>44</b> onto the jet tube <b>42</b>, or other suitable means.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The jet tube <b>42</b> is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>. The jet tube <b>42</b> includes a plurality of nozzles <b>48</b> having a centerline A, a first set of slots <b>50</b>, and a second set of slots <b>52</b>. By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>show a jet tube <b>42</b> having five nozzles <b>48</b> and two slots in each set of slots <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>, however, the jet tube <b>42</b> may include any number of nozzles <b>48</b> and slots <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>. For example, shallow pools may require a shorter jet tube <b>42</b> and fewer nozzles <b>48</b> than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>. The first set of slots <b>50</b> and the second set of slots <b>52</b> are centered on centerline B. Centerline B is located approximately 90 degrees along the circumference of the cross-section of the jet tube <b>42</b> from centerline A. Thus, when the nozzles <b>48</b> are positioned parallel to the side wall <b>20</b>, the slots <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> may face the center of the pool <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The jet tube <b>42</b> is preferably positioned such that the nozzles <b>48</b> are aimed parallel to the side wall <b>20</b> and face away from the skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b>. In most pools, such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pool inlet <b>28</b> is offset in the counter-clockwise direction from the skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b>. In this configuration, the end of the jet tube <b>42</b> associated with the second set of slots <b>52</b> is inserted into the coupler <b>40</b> such that the slots <b>52</b> are completely covered by coupler <b>40</b>. The end cap <b>44</b> is affixed to the end of the jet tube <b>42</b> associated with the first set of slots <b>50</b> without covering the first set of slots <b>50</b>. The nozzles <b>48</b> are oriented to be parallel to the side wall <b>20</b> and to direct the water flow in the counter-clockwise direction. Thus, in the present example, the nozzles <b>48</b> are directed away from the skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b> and the first set of slots <b>50</b> are directed toward the center of the pool <b>12</b>. In the case that the pool inlet <b>28</b> is offset in the clockwise direction from the skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b>, the end of the jet tube <b>42</b> associated with the first set of slots <b>50</b> is inserted into the coupler <b>40</b> such that the slots <b>50</b> are completely covered by coupler <b>40</b> and the nozzles <b>48</b> are directed in the clockwise direction, parallel to the sidewall <b>20</b>. The end cap <b>44</b> is affixed to the end of the jet tube <b>42</b> that is associated with the second set of slots <b>52</b> without covering the second set of slots <b>52</b>. Thus, in this configuration, the nozzles <b>48</b> are directed away from the skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b> and the second set of slots <b>52</b> are directed toward the center of the pool <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a detailed view of a nozzle opening in the jet tube <b>42</b> and a nozzle <b>48</b>. The nozzle <b>48</b> includes a circular barb <b>54</b> such that nozzle <b>48</b> is snapped into the nozzle opening. The nozzle <b>48</b> may alternatively be affixed to the nozzle opening by an adhesive or another suitable method. In the present embodiment, the nozzle <b>48</b> is substantially cylindrical, however, the nozzle <b>48</b> may be configured in any shape. The cross-section of the jet tube <b>42</b> may be configured into alternate shapes as well.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In use, the pump in the filter assembly <b>14</b> drives filtered water through the filter output <b>34</b> to the pool inlet <b>28</b>. This pressurized water flows through the water circulator <b>16</b> through the adapter <b>36</b>, the elbow <b>38</b>, the coupler <b>40</b>, and into the jet tube <b>42</b>. The pressurized water escapes the jet tube <b>42</b> through the nozzles <b>48</b> and the first set of slots <b>50</b> in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The jets of pressurized water create a current in the pool water <b>22</b>. The current travels along the side wall <b>20</b> toward the skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b>, as shown by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and thus the current carries debris <b>24</b> to the skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b>. The pressurized water escaping the jet tube <b>42</b> though the first set of slots <b>50</b> travels along the pool floor <b>21</b> toward the center of the pool <b>12</b>. This stirs up debris and sediment <b>24</b> resting on the floor <b>21</b> so that the debris and sediment <b>24</b> may be picked up by the current and carried in suspension toward the skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b>. The water <b>22</b> and debris <b>24</b> that travel through the skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b> enter the filter assembly <b>14</b> through the filter intake <b>30</b>. The debris <b>24</b> and other sediment are filtered out of the water <b>22</b> by the strainer and the filter media <b>32</b> and the cleaned water is then pumped through the filter output <b>34</b> to the pool inlet <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It should be particularly noted the water circulator <b>16</b> is preferably made of a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) such as schedule <b>40</b> PVC. Alternatively, the water circulator <b>16</b> may be made of stainless steel or any other material approved for use in swimming pools by NSF International.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be further particularly noted that the coupler <b>40</b> may be a compression coupler. The compression coupler includes a gasket affixed to the outer surface of the short tube <b>46</b> and a gasket affixed to the outer surface of the jet tube <b>42</b>. A ring is threaded onto each end of the coupler, squeezing the gaskets against an inner wall of the compression coupler. Thus coupler <b>40</b> connects the short tube <b>46</b> to the jet tube <b>42</b>. Alternatively, coupler <b>40</b> is a pipe union such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In a further alternative, the coupler <b>40</b> and the short tube <b>46</b> are not used and the jet tube <b>42</b> is affixed directly to the elbow <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a further embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the pool <b>12</b> may have an inlet <b>128</b> on the pool floor <b>21</b>. In this particular embodiment, the elbow <b>38</b> is removed and the short tube <b>46</b> is connected directly to the adaptor <b>36</b>. Further, the slots <b>50</b> or <b>52</b> on the end of the jet tube <b>42</b> that is affixed to the coupler <b>40</b> are exposed to thereby allow the pressurized water to escape through those slots. The end cap <b>44</b> covers the slots <b>50</b> or <b>52</b> that are associated with the end of the jet tub <b>42</b> that is proximate to the surface of the water <b>22</b> such that pressurized water that is directed to the center of the pool <b>12</b> is directed along the floor <b>21</b>, not the surface of the water <b>22</b>. Alternatively, a set of slots are located in the adaptor <b>36</b> or the short tube <b>46</b> to be closer to the floor <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a further embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b</i>, the jet tube <b>242</b> is configured with rotating fixtures <b>256</b> between each of the nozzles <b>48</b>. The fixtures <b>256</b> allow one to set the direction of each of the nozzles independently. Further, in this particular embodiment, separate nozzle segments may be added or removed to adjust the length of the jet tube <b>242</b> according to the depth of the pool <b>12</b>. Each segment may include one or more nozzles <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a further embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b</i>, the jet tube <b>342</b> has no slots <b>50</b> or <b>52</b>. One end of the jet tube <b>342</b> is affixed to the coupler <b>40</b> and the opposite end is affixed to a collar <b>358</b>. A jet tube extension <b>360</b> is affixed to the collar <b>358</b> and the end cap <b>44</b> is affixed to the jet tube extension <b>360</b>. A set of slots <b>350</b> are located in the jet tube extension <b>360</b>. Thus, the jet tube <b>342</b> of the present embodiment includes only one set of slots. The jet tube <b>342</b> is oriented with the nozzles <b>48</b> directed away from the skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b> and then the jet tube extension <b>360</b> is affixed to the collar <b>358</b> with the slots <b>350</b> oriented to direct the pressurized water toward the center of the pool <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a further embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>, jet tube <b>442</b> does not include slots <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, and end cap <b>44</b> is left off. Similarly to previously described embodiments, the jet tube <b>442</b> is affixed to the coupler <b>40</b> and includes nozzles <b>48</b>. The jet tube <b>442</b> is positioned such that the nozzles <b>48</b> are aimed parallel to the side wall <b>20</b> and face away from the skimmer/pool outlet <b>26</b>. A redirecting elbow <b>462</b> is affixed to the open end of the jet tube <b>442</b> such that the open end of the redirecting elbow <b>462</b> is directed towards the center of the pool <b>12</b>. An end cap <b>444</b> having slots <b>450</b> is affixed to the open end of the redirecting elbow <b>462</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should be particularly noted that several components of the water circulator in the examples provided may be combined into a single component. For example, the adaptor <b>36</b>, elbow <b>38</b>, short tube <b>46</b>, and coupler <b>40</b> of the first embodiment may be a single molded piece rather than the multiple components described.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">While the invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiments disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope and spirit of the appended claims.</p>
