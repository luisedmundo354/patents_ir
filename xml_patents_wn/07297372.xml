<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a composition useful for forming a protective coating on a substrate and to a process for using the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Historically, coatings have been applied to substrates, both to protect the substrates and to improve the properties of the substrates. For example, and without limitation, coatings have been developed to protect substrates from various environmental conditions and to protect substrates during contact of the substrates with other objects. Moreover, coatings have been developed to improve properties of substrates such as durability, strength, environmental resistance and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the automotive industry, coatings are used for protecting various components of an automotive vehicle. As an example, coatings are used for protecting vehicle components against cosmetic damage (e.g., degradation, marring, denting) due to corrosion, abrasions, impacts, chemicals, ultraviolet light, thermal cycling or the like. While, it is desirable for such coatings to protect against cosmetic damage, it is also desirable to provide a composition that is relatively easy to handle, and particularly exhibits relatively low volatile emissions. Thus, the present invention provides a composition for forming a coating with improved protection capabilities, ease of handling and relatively low volatile emissions.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention meets the above needs and others by providing a composition and process for coating a substrate. The process includes contacting the substrate with a composition including an isocyanate in an amount up to about 75% by volume of the composition, the isocyanate being at least 75% aliphatic by weight; and an amine in an amount up to about 75% by volume of the composition.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a process and composition for forming a protective coating upon a substrate. In a preferred embodiment, the composition forms a protective coating on a substrate provided by one or more components of an automotive vehicle. In a highly preferred embodiment, the composition forms a protective coating on a surface of a pick-up truck bed, and thus forms a bed-liner for such pick-up truck.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The composition preferably includes at least two components:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">1) an isocyanate component; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">2) an amine component.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">The isocyanate component in the composition may include a single isocyanate or a mixture of two or more different isocyanates. Amounts of isocyanate present in the composition may range up to about 75% by volume, and more preferably range from about 30% to about 70% by volume. Even more preferably, the isocyanate is present in the composition from about 40% to about 60% by volume and most preferably from about 45% to about 55% by volume.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">Preferred isocyanates of the present composition may be monoisocyanates, diisocyanates, polyisocyanates or a combination thereof. Included in the definition of isocyanates are the isocyanates themselves, or optionally dimers, trimers, prepolymers or quasi-prepolymers thereof with active-hydrogen components (e.g., obtainable from use of a polyol, amine-terminated polyether, or otherwise).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">Exemplary monoisocyanates include, without limitation, isophorone monoisocyanate, 3,5-dimethylphenyl isocyanate, paratoluenesulfonyl monoisocyanate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">Representative examples of diisocyanates include, without limitation, 4,4′-diisocyanatodiphenylmethane, p-phenylene diisocyanate, 1,3-bis(isocyanatomethyl)-cyclohexane, 1,4-diisocyanatocyclohexane, 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate, 3,3′-dimethyl-4,4′-biphenyl diisocyanate, 4,4′-diisocyanatodicyclohexylmethane, and 2,4-toluene diisocyanate, or mixtures thereof.

<p id="p-0014" num="0015">Isocyanates of the present invention may be aromatic or aliphatic (e.g., cycloaliphatic). It is preferred, however, that the major portion of the isocyanate composition is aliphatic. In one preferred embodiment, at least 75% of the isocyanate is aliphatic by weight, more preferably at least 90% of the isocyanate is aliphatic by weight and even more preferably at least 99% of the isocyanate is aliphatic by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">In one embodiment, preferably, the isocyanate has an NCO equivalent weight of at least about 130, more preferably at least about 160, and most preferably at least about 200; and is preferably no greater than about 500, more preferably no greater than about 400, and most preferably no greater than about 300. Moreover, it is desirable for the isocyanate to have a relatively low residual monomer level that is preferably less than about 1% by weight, more preferably less than about 0.2% by weight and most preferably less than about 0.05% by weight. Such low residual monomer level can assist in lowering volatile emission levels while handling the unreacted component or during application of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">In a highly preferred embodiment, the isocyanate includes a liquid aliphatic isocyanate oligomer or prepolymer based upon dicyclohexylmethane 4,4′-diisocyanate (H<sub>12</sub>MDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), tetramethyl-1,3-xylylene diisocyanate (TMXDI), hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) or a mixture thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">One highly preferred isocyanate is a dimerized, trimerized or the biureted form of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) or its quasi-prepolymer. An example of such a composition is DESMODUR XP-7100, which is commercially available from Bayer Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pa.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">The amine is present in the composition for reacting with the isocyanate component of the composition, and preferably forming a urea linkage. By “amine component” herein, it is meant a component having an amine functional group, such as molecules, compounds, oligomers, polymers, or the like having an amine termination or active hydrogens that are amine hydrogens. The amount of amine may be any suitable amount for achieving the desired amount of urea. For instance, the amine may be present in the composition in an amount up to about 75% by volume and more preferably from about 30% to about 70% by volume. Even more preferably, the amine is present in the composition from about 40% to about 60% by volume and even more preferably from about 45% to about 55% by volume.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">Amines suitable for the composition of the present invention may be primary, secondary, tertiary amines or mixtures thereof. The amines may by monoamines, diamines, triamines or mixtures thereof. The amines may be aromatic or aliphatic (e.g., cycloaliphatic), but are preferably aliphatic. The amine preferably is provided as a liquid having a relatively low viscosity (e.g., less than about 100 mPa·s at 25° C.). Particularly preferred resins of the composition are primarily based upon secondary amines or mixtures of primary and secondary amines. For example, if a mixture of primary and secondary amines is employed, preferably the primary amine is present in an amount up to about 50 parts by volume, with the secondary amine present in an amount up to about 100 parts by volume. Though others can be used, primary amines present is the resin preferably have a molecular weight greater than about 200 (e.g., for reduced volatility), and secondary amines present in the resin are preferably diamines with molecular weights of at least about 190 (e.g., about 210-230).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">In one preferred embodiment, the amine is a resin that includes at least one secondary amine at the amount of 20% to 100%, preferably 40% to 80%, and more preferably about 50% to 70% by volume. Suitable secondary amines include mono-functional acrylate or methacrylate modified aliphatic polyamines. Examples of the aliphatic polyamines includes, without limitation, ethylamine, the isomeric propylamines, butylamines, pentylamines, hexylamines, cyclohexylamine, ethylene diamine, 1,2-diaminopropane, 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,3-diaminopentane, 1,6-diaminohexane, 2-methyl-1,5-pentane diamine, 2,5-diamino-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,2,4- and/or 2,4,4-trimethyl-1,6-diamino-hexane, 1,11-diaminoundecane, 1,12-diaminododecane, 1,3- and/or 1,4-cyclohexane diamine, 1-amino-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-aminomethyl-cyclohexane, 2,4- and/or 2,6-hexahydrotoluylene diamine, 2,4′- and/or 4,4′-diamino-dicyclohexyl methane and 3,3′-dialkyl-4,4′-diamino-dicyclohexyl methanes (such as 3,3′-dimethyl-4,4′-diamino-dicyclohexyl methane and 3,3′-diethyl-4,4′-diamino-dicyclohexyl methane), 2,4- and/or 2,6-diaminotoluene and 2,4′- and/or 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl methane, or mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">An example of a particularly preferred amine includes an aliphatic amine, such as a cycloaliphatic polyamine with high steric hindrance that is optionally modified with an n-butyl group. One such amine is available commercially from UOP under the designation of CLEARLINK™. Another example of a particularly preferred amine is an acrylic modified primary amine.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">In another highly preferred embodiment, the amine is provided as an amine-functional resin. More preferably, such amine-functional resin is a relatively low viscosity, amine-functional resin suitable for use in the formulation of high solids polyurethane/polyurea coatings. One highly preferred amine-functional resin is substantially free of solvent. Though any of a number of different resins may be suitable, a preferred resin is an ester of an organic acid. For example, one highly preferred amine is an aspartic ester-based amine-functional reactive resin that is compatible with isocyanates (e.g., one that is solvent free, and/or has a mole ratio of amine functionality to the ester of no more than 1:1 so there remains no excess primary amine upon reaction), such as DESMOPHEN NH 1220 commercially available from Bayer Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pa. Of course, other suitable compounds containing aspartate groups may be employed as well. Other examples of particularly preferred secondary polyamines are polyaspartic esters, which are derivatives of compounds such as maleic acid, fumaric acid esters, aliphatic polyamines and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">Such compounds may be prepared in any suitable art-disclosed manner. By way of example, without limitation, the subject matter described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,126,170, 5,236,741 or both, hereby incorporated by reference, may be employed as guidance. For instance primary monoamines or polyamines may be reacted with substituted or unsubstituted maleic or fumaric acid esters.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0026">Examples of suitable amines for preparing the aspartic esters include without limitation ethylamine, the isomeric propylamines, butylamines, pentylamines, hexylamines, cyclohexylamine, ethylene diamine, 1,2-diaminopropane, 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,3-diaminopentane, 1,6-diaminohexane, 2-methyl-1,5-pentane diamine, 2,5-diamino-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,2,4- and/or 2,4,4-trimethyl-1,6-diamino-hexane, 1,11-diaminoundecane, 1,12-diaminododecane, 1,3- and/or 1,4-cyclohexane diamine, 1-amino-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-aminomethyl-cyclohexane, 2,4- and/or 2,6-hexahydrotoluylene diamine, 2,4′- and/or 4,4′-diamino-dicyclohexyl methane and 3,3′-dialkyl-4,4′-diamino-dicyclohexyl methanes (such as 3,3′-dimethyl-4,4′-diamino-dicyclohexyl methane and 3,3′-diethyl-4,4′-diamino-dicyclohexyl methane), 2,4- and/or 2,6-diaminotoluene and 2,4′- and/or 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl methane, or mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">One example of the polyaspartic esters is the derivative of diethyl maleate and 1,5-diamino-2-methylpentane, available commercially from Bayer Coporation, Pittsburgh, Pa. under the trade name Desmophen NH1220.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">Another group of preferred polyaspartic esters are derivatives of dialkyl maleate or furmarate and cycloaliphatic polyamines with the chemical structure of R—(CH<sub>2</sub>—NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>, where, n&gt;2, and R represents an organic group which is inert towards isocyanate groups at a temperature of 100° C. or less, and contains at least one cycloaliphatic ring. An example, without limitation, is 1,3- or 1,4-bis-aminomethyl cyclohexane, or the mixture thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">The amine resin component may also include high molecular weight primary amines, such as polyoxyalkyleneamines at the amount of 0 to 50%, preferably 10% to 40%, and more preferably 20% to 30%. The polyoxyalkyleneamines contain two or more primary amino groups attached to a backbone, such as propylene oxide, ethylene oxide, or a mixture thereof. Examples of such amines include those offered under the designation JEFFAMINE™ from Huntsman Corporation, preferably with a molecular weight ranging from about 200 to about 7500, such as, without limitation, JEFFAMINES D-230, D-400, D-2000, T-403 and T-5000.</p>

Nos. 5,236,741; 5,243,012; 6,013,755; and 6,180,745, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">It should be recognized that concentrates or diluted forms of the present composition may be employed, pursuant to which the proportion of the amine to isocyanate assumes a proportion corresponding with the above volume percentages. Thus, for example, in one embodiment, the amine and the isocyanate are present in an amount of about 1:10 to about 10:1 parts by volume, and more preferably about 1:3 to about 3:1 parts by volume, and still more preferably about 1:1 parts by volume.

<p id="p-0042" num="0043">The composition may also include other additives such as fillers or even fibrous reinforcement (e.g., for forming a composite).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">The various ingredients of composition may be combined and applied to a substrate according to a variety of combination and application protocols to form protective coatings. Preferably, the isocyanate is separated from the amine until a short period of time (e.g., preferably less than about 5 minutes, more preferably less than about 60 seconds and most preferably less than about 10 seconds) prior to application of the composition to a substrate. The composition may be applied to a surface of a substrate using suitable art-disclosed techniques, including but not limited to brushing, rolling, dipping, dripping, extruding, curtain coating, swabbing, spraying or the like. Moreover, the composition may be applied continuously or intermittently upon a surface of a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">Nearly any substrate may receive the composition to form a coating thereon. The composition may be applied to metal, plastic, or composite substrates, wood substrates or the like. In preferred embodiments, the composition is applied to coated or uncoated surfaces of metal components. In highly preferred embodiments, the composition is applied to painted or e-coated surfaces of automotive components (e.g., to form a truck bedliner, by coating one or more of the floor, side walls, head board, tail gate or other component of a pick-up truck cargo box) and may be applied in addition to or as a replacement for a clear coat. Depending on the desired texture of the coating, the composition may be applied to achieve a smooth surface (e.g., a class A finish) or a roughened or even coarse surface over part or all of the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">In certain embodiments, the coated or uncoated surface of a substrate may be treated prior to application of the composition. The surface of a substrate, may be sanded, scuffed, primed or otherwise treated prior to application of the composition to the substrate. For example, it may be desirable to apply a suitable adhesion promoter or primer to the surface to be coated. An example of one such primer is available commercially from The Dow Chemical Company under the name BETAGUARD™ 67725. Advantageously, such pre-treatment techniques can assist the coating formed on the substrate to tenaciously adhere to the surface of the substrate. In a highly preferred embodiment, the substrate is pre-treated with a plasma, for example, for ionizing oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) molecules that are then directed toward the surface of the substrate. In this manner, the plasma treatment forms suitable groups (e.g., ketone or hydroxyl groups) that bond with the composition such that the composition forms a coating that is even more tenaciously adhered to the surface of the substrate. Of course, other suitable surface treatments may be employed as desired. Examples of various potential surface treatments are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,298,587; U.S. Pat. No. 5,320,875; U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,786; U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,712 U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,958 incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">Thus, it will be appreciated that the application of the coating composition of the present invention will result, in certain preferred embodiments, in forming a laminate of a substrate (e.g., metal (such as steel, magnesium, titanium or aluminum), plastic (such as including a polyurethane, a polystyrene, a polyester, polyolefin, a nylon, an epoxy, an acrylic, or the like), a ceramic, a composite, or otherwise), optionally having a layer from a primer or plasma treatment, optionally having one or more coats (e.g., base coat, top coat, clear coat, such as an art-disclosed 2-component urethane or acrylic coating) thereon, and having the coating composition of the present invention thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">According to one preferred protocol, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is illustrated a system <b>10</b> for combining isocyanate and amine components to form the composition and for applying the composition to a substrate. As shown, the system <b>10</b> includes a supply <b>12</b> of isocyanate and a supply <b>14</b> of amine-based resin. The system <b>10</b> also includes a metering system <b>20</b> having a first metering container <b>22</b> for receiving a predetermined amount of isocyanate and a second metering container <b>24</b> for receiving a predetermined amount of resin. Each of the metering containers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are in fluid communication with a nozzle <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">In a preferred approach to applying the composition to a surface, the surface is prepared as desired and provided at a suitable application point. The isocyanate and amine-functional components are delivered to a suitable dispenser. Preferably, the components are independently metered to a mixing chamber, where they are mixed by direct impingement at a controlled ratio, and thereafter released from the dispenser as a mist or fine spray. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, isocyanate and amine components are pumped from their respective supplies <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> to their respective metering containers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. Thereafter, the isocyanate and amine components in the containers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are expelled under pressure from the containers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> to the nozzle <b>30</b> (e.g., which may be part of a gun block) and are expelled from the nozzle <b>30</b> as a spray <b>34</b>. Preferably, the nozzle <b>30</b> includes an internal space or cavity (not shown) wherein the isocyanate component and amine component can intermix, atomize or both such that the resulting spray <b>34</b> is a substantially homogeneous composition. The pressure used to expel the spray <b>34</b> is preferably greater than about 1000 psi and more preferably between about 1500 psi and 2000 psi.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">To apply the composition to a substrate, the substrate may be moved relative to the nozzle <b>30</b>, the nozzle <b>30</b> may be moved relative to the substrate or a combination thereof such that the spray <b>34</b> is directed at the substrate for layering the composition on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">It is contemplated that the application system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be designed as a robotic system. For example, the nozzle <b>30</b>, the metering containers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> or both may be mounted on a robot arm (not show), which may be programmed to move the nozzle <b>30</b> as it sprays the composition such that a substrate may be coated as desired. Moreover, such a robotic system could apply coatings upon truck bedliners in an automotive assembly plant or at another location during assembly or formation of a truck. In alternative embodiments, however, the composition may be applied after full assembly of a truck. Advantageously, the composition emits minimal airborne chemicals during application such that spraying systems for applying the composition may be used in a variety of locations.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">Although, the composition may be applied at room temperature (e.g., around 20° C.), it may be desirable to heat the isocyanate, the amine or both to no greater than about 90° C. prior to application to improve the mixing efficiency, flow and wetting properties of the composition during application. Once applied, the composition may be allowed to cure upon the substrate to form a protective coating. Curing may occur at a wide variety of temperatures. Generally, curing desirably occurs at room temperature in the absence of applied heat. However, cooling or heating measures may also be taken to lower or raise the temperature of curing.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">In preferred embodiments, the rate of curing of the composition may be at least partially chemically controlled. For example, curing of the composition may be controlled by the rate of reaction of the amine component with the isocyanate component. Typically, primary amines react comparatively quickly with the isocyanate while secondary amines react comparatively slowly. Thus, the amine component may be provided as a mixture of primary and secondary amines that are combined according to weight ratios that are chosen as desired to control the rates of curing of the composition to form the coating. Weight ratios of primary amine to secondary amine appropriate for process of application similar to the one described and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are approximately range from about 0:1 to about 0.8:1 and is preferably about 0.5:1.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">Preferably, the composition is well mixed into a substantially homogeneous liquid mixture prior to application to a substrate. Thus, upon curing (which may be accomplished substantially without the need to apply heat to the coating), the composition will form a substantially homogeneous coating. The coating may be applied in one or more layers of one or more continuous or variable thickness. Preferred thickness for coatings on automotive components (e.g., for forming a truck bedliner) range from about 0.5 millimeter to about 20 millimeters, more preferably from about 1 millimeter to about 10 millimeters and most preferably from about 3 millimeters to about 5 millimeters. The thickness may vary across a substrate, randomly or according to a predetermined pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">In certain embodiments, the protective coatings formed according to the present invention exhibit various advantageous properties. For example, and without limitation, coatings according to the present invention can exhibit strength both adhesive and cohesive up to and greater than 300 psi when applied to painted and e-coated surfaces. Additionally, preferred embodiments of the coating exhibit superior resistance to degradation caused by UV radiation, moisture, thermal cycles, chemical (e.g., alkali) exposure, salt and the like. For example, the coating exhibits substantially no blistering, cracking or charring when sag panel aged for two weeks at about 70° C. Likewise, upon two weeks of water immersion at 32° C., the coating exhibits substantially no blistering, dulling, or softening or loss of adhesion. Like results are also realizable upon exposure to 100% relative humidity at 38° C. for two weeks.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">Also advantageously, the coating resists fluid spotting such as from liquid soap, windshield solvent, coolant, motor oil, bug and tar remover or the like. It resists color change, dulling, softening or surface distortion from contact with fuel, as well as from contact with acid or alkali substances.</p>
