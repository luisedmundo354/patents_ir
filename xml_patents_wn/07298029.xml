<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/868,231, filed Jun. 15, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,061,083, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the technology for implementing a battery-less non-contact identification method intended mainly to protect token-device media, valuable securities (marketable securities), money paper (negotiable commercial coupons or tickets), important documents, IC cards, prepaid cards, and other paper or film-form media against forgery, by using semiconductor chips.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">First, the prior art disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. Hei8-50672 (1996) is described as an example of art related to the present invention. The corresponding prior art relates to security thread identification equipment intended for various types of token-device media, wherein the equipment is designed so that metallic patterns consisting of character data and other data and embedded in token-device media can be electrically identified by detecting the metal(s). The equipment mentioned above is basically designed so that the forgery only of ordinary paper provided with advanced copying art is made difficult by inserting a metallic pattern into the information contained in the paper.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Next, the prior art disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. Hei8-202844 (1996) is described. The corresponding prior art is for connecting semiconductor chips to a base substrate made of paper or synthetic paper, by using anisotropic electroconductive paste.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An embodiment of prior art is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This embodiment indicates that there is crack <b>42</b> originating from chipping <b>41</b>. Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> implies that since pad <b>43</b> is located at the top of semiconductor chip <b>44</b>, short-circuiting could result if electroconductive particles <b>46</b> inside adhesive resin <b>45</b> come into contact with the edge of the chip <b>44</b>, and that since antenna <b>47</b> is located at the top of substrate <b>49</b>, electroconductive particles <b>48</b> contribute to connection to the electrodes of the antenna <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another embodiment of prior art is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which indicates that since there exists a semiconductor chip equipped with both aluminum pad <b>73</b> and surface oxide film <b>74</b> on the surface of its device silicon layer <b>72</b>, electroconductive particles <b>75</b> are distributed from adhesive resin <b>71</b>, and that electroconductive particles <b>77</b> captured on the surface of gold pad <b>76</b> contribute to electrical continuity with antenna <b>78</b>. Insulating material <b>79</b> is a passivation film. This figure shows the cross-sectional structure of a semiconductor chip connected using a conventional anisotropic electroconductive adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present inventors consider that the prior art disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. Hei8-50672 (1996) poses the following problem. That is to say, when preventive measures are to be taken against the forgery of various token-device media, the present inventors consider that in terms of technology, an added value exists in judging whether the forgery method is easy. In the above-mentioned embodiment of the prior art, therefore, although the sealing of metallic patterns in token-device media is described, this method not only facilitates pattern creation, but also has a risk close to recommending a method of forgery. Although forgery protection technology is for improving safety as its intended purpose, this technology enhances the reliability of forgery at the same time, and for this reason, forgery protection technology has the danger of no safeguards being provided against a high degree of forgery. It is to be deeply considered, therefore, that undeliberate forgery protection technology turns out to act as a forgery augmenter. In this case, referring to the technical level of metallic pattern creation, the present inventors consider it obvious that since the technology relates to the detection of metals, it is possible to analyze patternized information, even without using advanced technology, just by unsealing the medium and closely examining its contents. In other words, since the detection of metallic patterns is the requirement, its implementing method can be easily selected at a normal technical level.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring now to problems associated with Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. Hei8-202844 (1996), the present inventors consider that the corresponding art assumes paper and other thin media, not mere changes in materials, and that the mechanical strength of paper and the strength of semiconductor chips require even deeper studies. In this embodiment of the prior art, when a configuration with a thickness up to 100 microns is considered, whether problems arise depends greatly on whether no mechanical stresses are applied. That is to say, different restrictions must be defined to mount semiconductor chips on thin paper-form media. More specifically, the thickness and size of the semiconductor chips must be studied. For example, when examining whether a semiconductor chip 1 mm in size can withstand use at a normal operating level with paper 100 microns thick, one needs to study about whether the semiconductor chip can withstand use, not whether it can be structurally formed. The present inventors have considered that this conventional embodiment alone does not suffice to establish the realization style of practically usable thin media up to 100 microns thick.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Next, problems relating to the embodiment of prior art that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are described. During the processing of semiconductor chip periphery, since semiconductor chips that have been diced using a diamond blade are used, if external stresses are applied to the semiconductor chips and concentrated on the periphery thereof, the periphery will break or crack and some or all of the semiconductor chip functions will be lost. If these semiconductor chips are sealed in thin media such as paper, since bending or concentrated load stresses are prone to be applied, even a slight chipping (namely, a nick) around the semiconductor chips will result in their damage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Next, problems relating to the embodiment of prior art that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are described. In this structural view, despite gold bumps existing, no consideration is given to the fact that side effects may be caused by the presence of the anisotropic electroconductive adhesive or electroconductive adhesive around the semiconductor chips. More specifically, no consideration is given to possible increases in the vertical dimensions of the structure due to the presence of the gold bumps, or to the likely occurrence of short circuits around the semiconductors. As a result, there exists the problem that the configuration of the semiconductor chips that includes the gold bumps makes the total structure of the equipment exceptionally thick and prevents bending-resistant structure from being achieved.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an embodiment of the present invention. Semiconductor chip side wall oxide film <b>11</b> is located on the side of device layer silicon <b>12</b>, and pad <b>13</b> is located on the surface of a semiconductor chip equipped with back oxide film <b>14</b> and semiconductor chip side wall oxide film <b>15</b>, and is connected to antenna <b>17</b>, which is formed on the surface of a substrate <b>18</b> by use of an electroconductive material such as silver paste. Although electroconductive particles <b>19</b> are located directly between the pad and the antenna and thus contribute to vertical electrical continuity, electroconductive particles <b>19</b><i>a </i>are located near the side of the semiconductor chip and do not make a direct contribution to electrical continuity between the pad and the antenna. However, for a semiconductor device characterized in that the periphery of a semiconductor chip is formed using an insulating material and in that the terminals on the semiconductor chip are connected to the terminals of its mounting substrate by use of an electroconductive adhesive, short circuits between the antenna and the semiconductor chip will not occur, even if the above-mentioned electroconductive particles come into contact with the edge of the semiconductor chip. Also, the use of a normal electroconductive adhesive, not an anisotropic one, gives particularly significant favorable effects. That is to say, electrical short-circuiting will not result, even if the electroconductive adhesive comes into contact with the edge of the semiconductor chip.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Views (a) to (f) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> show another embodiment of the present invention. View (a) shows the cross section of the semiconductor chips existing immediately after they have been finished into wafer form. The side wall oxide films shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are oxidized beforehand at where the semiconductor chips are to be separated in wafer form, and these oxide films are connected to the principal plane of each semiconductor chip and to the oxide films of oxide film layer <b>23</b>. Pad <b>21</b> is formed on device layer silicon <b>22</b>, and the oxide film layer <b>23</b> is inserted in sandwiched form between silicon substrate <b>24</b> and the device layer silicon. This structure is called “silicon-on-insulator wafer structure.” View (b) shows the cross section of the wafer existing immediately after a support tape has been continuously attached thereto. Numeral <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>) denotes an adhesive material layer. In the remainder hereof, numeral <b>30</b> denotes a similar adhesive material layer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>) is a cross-sectional view of the silicon substrate <b>24</b> existing immediately after it has been removed by etching with chemicals such as potassium hydroxide, hydrazine, and/or ammonia. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>d</i>) is a cross-sectional view of the wafer existing immediately after its back face has been coated with photoresist <b>26</b>, then exposed to light, and has undergone photographic processing. The sections where the semiconductor chips are to be separated are already pattern-printed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>e</i>) is a cross-sectional view of the wafer existing immediately after etching grooves <b>27</b> have been formed. Etching uses either hydrofluoric acid, which is usually used for etching oxide films, or a chemical mixed with it, or a dry etchant. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>f</i>) is a cross-sectional view of the semiconductor chip that has been expanded using expanded support tape <b>28</b>. In this way, semiconductor chips that are thin, compact, and free of chipping, can be formed easily and economically. The semiconductor chips thus formed are characterized in that each of them has a plane dimension up to 0.5 mm on the long side, in that the semiconductor chips are separated by etching as shown in this embodiment, and in that they are inserted in antenna-equipped form into a paper or film-form medium so as to send information of multiple bits.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows yet another embodiment of the present invention. Pad <b>31</b> is formed on active devices such as memory mat <b>32</b>, reading circuit <b>33</b>, selector circuit <b>34</b>, sending/receiving circuit <b>36</b>, and power circuit <b>38</b>. This arrangement enables pads of a large area to be formed for reliable and stable connection to an antenna. The semiconductor chip is surrounded by a semiconductor chip side wall oxide film <b>35</b> to prevent short-circuiting due to contact with an electroconductive adhesive. The pad <b>31</b> is connected to each circuit via through-hole <b>37</b>. The semiconductor chip has small pads <b>39</b> for generating random numbers, and since, at these pads, the semiconductor chip and the antenna can obtain analog data which varies with their lateral contact resistance against electroconductive particles and with the particular fluctuations in capacity against ferroelectrics, random number-generating circuit <b>39</b><i>a </i>performs analog-to-digital conversions into information. The information that has thus been obtained can be used as non-iterative unique information, just like a person's fingerprints, and can therefore contribute to forgery protection of the medium for which the semiconductor chip is to be used. Since the above-mentioned unique information will be lost if the semiconductor chip and the antenna are separated, the information features high tampering resistance, namely, resistance to forgery. To protect media from forgery, therefore, it is valid to use a semiconductor device characterized in that as described above, the device on the principal plane of each semiconductor chip has one or more pads and these semiconductor chips are inserted in antenna-equipped form into a paper or film-form medium so as to send information of multiple bits, and in that each semiconductor chip has a plane dimension up to 0.5 mm on its long side and a plurality of pads smaller than a pad formed for connection to an antenna are present on the semiconductor chip in order to generate random numbers. At memory mat <b>32</b>, each semiconductor chip on the wafer is arbitrarily pattern-printed with random numbers by electron-beam direct plotting in a very small area size.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Views (a) to (c) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> show still another embodiment of the present invention. View (a) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional view of semiconductor chip <b>51</b> connected to antenna <b>52</b> and existing in a film-form medium. View (b) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of the semiconductor chip in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) and shows two electrodes taken from the surface and back of the semiconductor chip, and these electrodes (electrodes <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>) serve as antenna electrodes <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> to form capacities. It has thus become possible to form a small semiconductor chip not having a capacity in itself and hence advantageous in terms of economy and yield. View (c) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows multiple electrodes taken from the surface of the semiconductor chip, and these electrodes (electrodes <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>) serve as antenna electrodes <b>57</b> and <b>58</b> to form capacities. Such device set forth above can be made into a more economical and more effective forgery protection and identification device by forming a semiconductor device characterized in that semiconductor chips with a plane dimension up to 0.5 mm on the long side are inserted in capacitor-containing-antenna-equipped form into a paper or film-form medium so as to send information of multiple bits.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows still another embodiment of the present invention. With a semiconductor chip that has adhesive resin <b>61</b> at back oxide film <b>62</b> and side wall oxide film <b>66</b> on one side of device silicon layer <b>63</b>, tungsten pad <b>68</b> on surface oxide film <b>66</b> can be electrically connected to antenna <b>69</b> via electroconductive particles <b>67</b> by using an anisotropic electroconductive adhesive over which electroconductive particles <b>65</b> have been distributed. A thin semiconductor chip-antenna combination free from short-circuiting can be formed because pads are formed using tungsten or a non-oxidizing metal and because side wall oxide films are adopted. Thus, token-device media for forgery protection can be formed by forming a semiconductor device characterized in that semiconductor chips each having a long side up to 0.5 mm in plane dimension and each having pads made of tungsten are inserted in antenna-equipped form into a paper or film-form medium so as to send information of multiple bits.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows still another embodiment of the present invention. Medium surface printed pattern <b>81</b> is located on the surface of film-form medium <b>83</b>, in which is present a semiconductor chip <b>82</b> including an antenna. Since direct emulation of the information contained in the read-only memory of the semiconductor chip results in the forgery protection capability of the memory being lost, whether the medium is a forgery can be confirmed more strictly by cryptographing the information and printing it in numeric data or pattern form. Also, since the semiconductor chip itself can contain only a read-only memory, semiconductor chips can be formed in a small size. In other words, various token-device media highly resistant to forgery can be created by forming a semiconductor device characterized in that semiconductor chips having a long side up to 0.5 mm in plane dimension are inserted in antenna-equipped form into a paper or film-form medium so as to send information of multiple bits, and in that the information is cryptographed and printed on the medium. Information combined with special ink, a magnetic material, and the like, is further used as cryptographed and printed information.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> show still another embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is a plan view of semiconductor chip <b>91</b>. Electroconductive particles <b>92</b> exist in distributed form on small pads <b>93</b>. Also, writable memory area <b>97</b> exists in the semiconductor chip <b>91</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the semiconductor chip <b>91</b> connected to antenna <b>95</b> on substrate <b>96</b> by use of adhesive resin <b>94</b>. Since analog data varying with the particular contact resistance against the electroconductive particles between the semiconductor chip and the antenna and with the particular fluctuations in capacity against ferroelectrics can be obtained at the small pads of the semiconductor chip, the analog data is converted into digital data by a random number-generating circuit. The digital data can be used as non-iterative unique information, just like a person's fingerprints, and can therefore contribute to forgery protection of the medium for which the semiconductor chip is to be used. Since the above-mentioned unique information will be lost if the semiconductor chip and the antenna are separated, the information features high tampering resistance, namely, resistance to forgery.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows still another embodiment of the present invention. This figure shows examples of realizing the forgery protection protocols using the semiconductor chips of the present invention and random number-generating circuits contained in these semiconductor chips. Such forgery protection protocols can be broadly divided into an open type and a closed type. First, an example of open-type protocol realization is set forth below. For the open type, during initialization, the code number N to be generated by the semiconductor chip within a film medium (such as a card) is inquired about from an inquirer such as a reader/writer. The card, after responding with N, makes N unreadable by closing the N reading circuit autonomously or in accordance with the appropriate command from the inquirer. After receiving N, the inquirer registers it in a database. During the operation phase, the inquirer first interrogates for the ID of the card. The inquirer, after returning the card ID, places the random number on the card. The card cryptographs the random number with N as the key, and returns the random number to the inquirer. After restoring N from the database and decryptographing N into original form, the inquirer compares restored N and its original value and if both match, the inquirer regards the card as correct. In this embodiment, as far as its application to the forming media in the invention, such as token-device media or marketable securities, is concerned, the card can be changed for any other such type of medium without limitations. Next for the closed type, a writable memory area exists in the semiconductor chip, and during initialization, cryptographed N is written from the inquirer into the memory area of the card. After this, the N reading circuit within the card is closed. Next, a second random number different from the above random number N within the semiconductor chip is given thereto, then the random number N is cryptographed and read out, and the content in the memory area is also read out and returned to the inquirer, where the corresponding memory content is reverted to the second random number. Thus, it is verified that the corresponding semiconductor chip is not a forgery. The use of the cards and system having these features ensures that authenticating the validity of the card is accomplished by checking N.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> show yet another embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> is a waveform diagram of the electromagnetic wave that the inquirer in the invention sends to the paper or film-form medium including the semiconductor chip. Although the frequency of carrier waves is arbitrary, the carrier waves themselves are amplitude-modulated and when the nth clock <b>111</b> is given, the data of the nth address in the read-only memory will be sent from the semiconductor chip. The second half of the clock cycle is therefore a period during which the nth data <b>112</b> is sent. Similarly, periods during which (1+n)th clock <b>113</b> or (1+n)th clock <b>114</b> follows. This sequence is repeated to read the contents of the read-only memory within the semiconductor chip into the inquirer. That is to say, it is possible to form a semiconductor device characterized in that carrier waves are periodically amplitude-modulated in multi-frequency units and given to each antenna-equipped semiconductor chip, in that the leading edge of each periodic signal is used as a clock, and in that the load of the antenna within the semiconductor chip is varied during the corresponding period and one bit of information is sent from the semiconductor chip. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> is a circuit block diagram of semiconductor chip <b>118</b>. Antenna <b>115</b> is connected to rectifier <b>116</b> and a voltage is supplied to the semiconductor chip. At the same time, data enters counter <b>119</b>, from which the data is then sent in units of one bit together with a <b>119</b><i>a </i>selector signal, the output of ROM <b>177</b>. These elements constitute a compact semiconductor chip. That is to say, it is possible to form a semiconductor device characterized in that carrier waves are periodically amplitude-modulated in multi-frequency units and given to each antenna-equipped semiconductor chip, in that the semiconductor chip contains a counter, in that the leading edge of each periodic signal is used as a clock and the signal is sent to the counter, in that the output signal from the counter selects a memory output signal, and in that the load of the antenna within the semiconductor chip is varied during the corresponding period and one bit of information is sent from the semiconductor chip.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows further another embodiment of the present invention. Film-form medium <b>124</b> contains a first semiconductor chip <b>121</b> and a second semiconductor chip <b>123</b>, both of which are connected across antenna <b>122</b>. In general, a semiconductor device is formed that is characterized in that a plurality of semiconductor chips share one antenna and in that each semiconductor chip operates according to the particular operational status of the antenna. Thus, it is possible to mount multiple semiconductor chips easily without forming a complex congestion circuit in a semiconductor chip, to make a semiconductor chip assist a damaged one, and hereby to improve the reliability of the medium. Furthermore, a system even higher in security can be constructed by assigning unique information to multiple semiconductor chips and creating a program so that the semiconductor chips report the respective relationships to each other and so that when more than one predetermined requirement is satisfied, data will be transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows further another embodiment of the present invention. Semiconductor chip <b>131</b> is sealed in film-form medium <b>133</b> which has cryptographed physical information notation column <b>132</b> on the surface. To ensure forgery protection, it is absolutely necessary that physically identical media be difficult to form with accuracy and that advanced identification technology be used. Even if the semiconductor chip itself is to be formed using advanced process technology, it is difficult without the proper manufacturing technology to make a counterfeit semiconductor chip called “clone.” Semiconductor process technology is represented by the accuracy level of the micropattern. Even if an identical function is realized, therefore, a higher degree of process technology will reduce semiconductor chips in size. Also, technical levels will improve with time and if the semiconductor chips are the same in function, their physical shapes will decrease, and if the semiconductor chips are the same in physical shape, their functions will improve. Whether the particular semiconductor chip and mounting method are forgeries can be identified more easily by forming a semiconductor device characterized in that all or part of physical information on the size, thickness, position, angle-of-inclination, and other factors of the semiconductor chip to be inserted in antenna-equipped form into a paper or film-form medium so as to send information of multiple bits is cryptographed and printed on the medium.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a further another embodiment of the present invention. A first cover film roll <b>141</b> and a second cover film roll <b>144</b> are present, semiconductor chip <b>142</b> is inserted between a first cover film <b>145</b> and a second cover film <b>143</b>, and a medium including a finished semiconductor chip is taken up onto take-up roll <b>146</b>. The materials to be used for the cover films are not limited to any specific materials such as paper, synthetic paper, plastics, cloth, or fiber cloth. The semiconductor chip is automatically picked up and positioned. This semiconductor chip may have a mounted antenna beforehand or may be printed on the first or second film or may be bonded thereto using an electroconductive adhesive when the chip is inserted into the film via a wire. The surface of the intermediate bonding film into which the semiconductor chip has been inserted is coated with another adhesive, namely, an urethane-based, cyano-based, or UV-setting adhesive, with the result that the film is formed so as to ensure low temperature and the flatness and rigidity of the finished medium.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref> show a further another embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> shows one of the states where a plurality of semiconductor chips <b>151</b> are arranged in distributed form inside film-form medium <b>152</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> shows an example in which small antenna <b>154</b> is mounted on each of the semiconductor chips <b>151</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>. The shape and characteristics of the antenna differ according to the radio frequency to be used or the particular amount of energy. One possible method of forming the antenna is by shaping micro-wiring into coil form by use of semiconductor wiring process technology. The use of multilayer wiring or copper wiring technology enables a compact and low-resistance coil long in wiring run. On-semiconductor formation of the antenna increases the reliability of its connection while at the same time reducing manufacturing processes and enabling economical formation of the semiconductor chip. Distributed arrangement of multiple semiconductor chips in a medium enables non-repeatability to be achieved, and this arrangement can be a compensation means for semiconductor failures and ensures forgery protection and higher reliability. Various token-device media for forgery protection can be realized more easily by forming a semiconductor device characterized in that an antenna smaller than a semiconductor chip is mounted thereon and in that multiple such semiconductor chips are inserted into a paper or film-form medium so as to send information of multiple bits without radio interference.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a further another embodiment of the present invention. A first antenna pad <b>161</b> and a second antenna pad <b>162</b> exist on the active device of a semiconductor chip and are connected across antenna coil <b>163</b>. Although this figure assumes a coil-form antenna, the pads can be connected to the antenna terminals of a dipole antenna, instead. The first antenna pad and the second antenna pad are connected to the sending/receiving circuit of the semiconductor chip through a first through-hole <b>164</b> and a second through-hole <b>165</b>, respectively. In this way, multiple pads are provided on an active device and connected to an antenna or an external capacity-provided circuit element, depending on the particular requirements. The pads and the antenna are connected by press-fitting or using an adhesive. The use of an anisotropic electroconductive adhesive enables efficient connection of multiple pads and a substrate wiring pattern just by performing one bonding/heating/pressurizing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a further another embodiment of the present invention. This figure is a plan view of an embodiment, showing that tapered corner members <b>171</b> are provided at the corners of a semiconductor chip. In order to use the area of the semiconductor chip more effectively by increasing mechanical strength against concentrated loads and bending loads and by removing the cutting width of a dicing blade, the separation of the semiconductor chip is conducted using etching technology. At this time, the pattern of the separation groove is designed so that the corner shape of the as-finished semiconductor chip is optimized for reduced mechanical stress concentration by shaping the corners of the semiconductor chip into tapered or round form. Thus, high reliability can be conferred on forgery protection token-device media that uses a semiconductor device characterized in that a semiconductor chip with a plane dimension up to 0.5 mm on its long side is inserted in antenna-equipped form into a paper or film-form medium so as to send information of multiple bits, and in that the corners of the semiconductor chip are taper-cut to 1/100 of the length of the long side.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows a further another embodiment of the present invention. Stress concentration tool <b>181</b> is pressed against film-form medium <b>182</b>, and semiconductor chip <b>183</b> is located under the stress concentration tool, on or near the neutral plane of the medium. At the bottom of the film-form medium is present a silicon rubber <b>184</b>, which exists on steel plate <b>185</b>. The silicon rubber indicates an environment in an actual living space where it is located in the vicinity of the film-form medium. The stress concentration tool is at least 1 mm in diameter, and it indicates an environment in an actual living space where a concentrated load is applied. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the film-form medium deforms according to the particular magnitude of the concentrated load, resulting in such cross-sectional status as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The empirically obtained relationship between the concentrated load resistance of the film-form medium under this state and the size of the semiconductor chip is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. Supposing that the pressures applied to the film-form medium by persons in an actual living space are about 700 g and that whether the medium can withstand a concentrated load of 1 kg is one criterion, the inventors have found from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> that the medium can be separated into an area resistant to the concentrated load in the case of a semiconductor chip size up to 0.5 mm, and an area not resistant to the concentrated load in the case of a semiconductor chip size exceeding 0.5 mm. With this fact in mind, the inventors consider it to be a technical minimum requirement to create various forgery protection token-device media forming part of a semiconductor device characterized in that semiconductor chips are formed with a plane dimension up to 0.5 mm on the long side, in that each of these semiconductor chips is inserted in antenna-equipped form into a paper or film-form medium so as to send information of multiple bits, and in that each semiconductor chip is up to 50 microns thick. The inventors also consider that the technology for forming these media forms part of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref> show a further another embodiment of the present invention. Braille-use bump <b>201</b> on film-form medium <b>204</b> contains semiconductor chip <b>202</b> equipped with antenna <b>203</b>. Token-device media and the like come with braille-use bumps, and semiconductor chips up to 0.5 mm in size can be embedded in these bumps. This arrangement can contribute to the improvement of the structural strength of semiconductor chip mounting portions. More specifically, reliability can be improved by forming various forgery protection token-device media that contain a semiconductor device characterized in that semiconductor chips are formed with a plane dimension up to 0.5 mm on the long side, in that each of these semiconductor chips is inserted in antenna-equipped form into a paper or film-form medium so as to send information of multiple bits, and in that each semiconductor chip is present in a braille-use bump.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows a further another embodiment of the present invention. A first semiconductor chip <b>211</b> connected to a first antenna <b>212</b>, and a second semiconductor chip <b>213</b> connected to a second antenna <b>214</b> are present in film-form medium <b>217</b>. At this time, a first cryptographed physical information notation column <b>215</b> and a second cryptographed physical information notation column <b>216</b> exist on the surface of the film-form medium. Output information from the first semiconductor chip is printed in numeric data or special pattern form on the first cryptographed physical information notation column, and output information from the second semiconductor chip is printed in numeric data or special pattern form on the second cryptographed physical information notation column. Thus, forgery identification is possible, even if either semiconductor chip is damaged. In general, a highly reliable method can be supplied by forming various forgery protection token-device media that uses a semiconductor device characterized in that a plurality of semiconductor chips have a plane dimension up to 0.5 mm on the long side, in that each of these semiconductor chips is inserted in antenna-equipped form into a paper or film-form medium so as to send information of multiple bits, and in that the information contained in each semiconductor chip is printed in cryptographed pattern form on the medium.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows a further another embodiment of the present invention. Semiconductor chip <b>223</b> of the structure where antenna <b>226</b> is connected to antenna pad <b>225</b> is present between a first cover film <b>221</b> and a second cover film <b>224</b>, and the semiconductor chip is reinforced by reinforcement metal <b>222</b>. The reinforcement metal can provide improvements against a concentrated load by being made of a material large in elastic modulus. Although it is desirable that the reinforcement metal be thicker, it has its own limits since the thickness of the film-form medium which can be used is limited. A thickness greater than that of the semiconductor chip, therefore, is the appropriate thickness of the reinforcement metal, and hereby, improvement effects can be obtained. It is desirable that the reinforcement metal and the semiconductor chip be bonded as strongly as possible, and this is required for the purpose of reducing the tensile stresses on the thin semiconductor chip. According to the present invention, a method excellent in reliability can be supplied by forming various forgery protection token-device media that uses a semiconductor device characterized in that a semiconductor chip with a plane dimension up to 0.5 mm on its long side is inserted in antenna-equipped form into a paper or film-form medium so as to send information of multiple bits, and in that a metal thicker than the semiconductor chip is bonded thereto.</p>

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Still another embodiment of the present invention is described using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</figref>. In this embodiment, the invention is applied to a proximity-type non-contact IC card complying with ISO/IEC 14443. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref> is a view showing the status that one IC semiconductor chip <b>9001</b> containing a memory and a communications control function is mounted on card-form wiring substrate <b>9003</b> having an formed antenna coil <b>9002</b> is seen from the side at which the device of the IC semiconductor chip is not formed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the semiconductor chip portion of a finished card, shown as an A-B line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In this embodiment, the wiring substrate <b>9003</b> on which the antenna coil <b>9002</b> is formed has the IC semiconductor chip <b>9001</b> mounted so that electrode bump <b>9004</b> faces downward against the coil. The wiring substrate <b>9003</b> is made of polyethylene phthalate (PET) and has the coil <b>9002</b> formed by screen printing with electroconductive paste. The electrode bump <b>9004</b> and the coil <b>9002</b> are connected using anisotropic electroconductive adhesive <b>9005</b>. This anisotropic electroconductive adhesive has electroconductive particles distributed inside the adhesive layer, and although the mating portion between the electrode bump <b>9004</b> and the coil <b>9002</b> is electrically connected via the electroconductive particles located between both, since these electroconductive particles are distributed, other electrode bump—coil sections not facing each other suffer no electrical short-circuiting. In this embodiment, the size and thickness of the IC semiconductor chip <b>9001</b> are 0.3 mm and about 30 microns, respectively, and the back face of the silicon wafer with a formed device has been ground to a smaller thickness by combined use of mechanical grinding and chemical grinding and then diced to obtain the thin IC semiconductor chip.

In this embodiment, one gold bump <b>9013</b> that has been formed by vapor deposition is provided on both the surface and back of the device of IC semiconductor chip <b>9011</b>, and bump <b>9013</b> is connected to zinc-plated copper rectangular antenna <b>9012</b>. The IC semiconductor chip <b>9011</b> is connected so as to ensure that its principal plane is inclined with respect to that of the antenna <b>9012</b> and that the end of the IC semiconductor chip does not protrude from either side of the antenna.

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">During the manufacture of the semiconductor device pertaining to this embodiment, the antenna members have been processed into the lead frame structure having a multitude of antenna <b>9022</b> connected in arranged form to antenna frame <b>9025</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28C</figref>. The pitch between the adjacent antennas in the lead frame structure mentioned above is equal to the pitch of the IC semiconductor chip <b>9021</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref>, and the interval between the antennas facing each other is equal to that of the antenna pair existing when it is to be connected to the IC semiconductor chip. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28D</figref> shows a status under which the antenna members of the lead frame structure mentioned above and LSI wafer <b>9026</b> are overlapped for connecting the antennas <b>9022</b> and the IC semiconductor chip <b>9021</b>. The LSI wafer <b>9026</b>, after being bonded onto a support sheet attached to the required sheet frame <b>9028</b>, are diced into separate IC semiconductor chips. Under this state, the antenna members are positioned on the required array of sheet-supported IC semiconductor chips so that the ends of the antennas are arranged on the bumps of the IC semiconductor chips. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28E</figref> shows the cross-sectional structure of the semiconductor wafer at the A-B line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28D</figref> which shows the connection of the antennas <b>9022</b> and the IC semiconductor chips <b>9021</b>. The ends of the antennas <b>9022</b> supported by antenna frame <b>9025</b> are fit to only the IC semiconductor chip at the left end of the figure among all IC semiconductor chips <b>9021</b> bonded onto the support sheet <b>9027</b>, and the antennas <b>9022</b> and the bumps <b>9023</b> on the IC semiconductor chips are connected via anisotropic electroconductive adhesive <b>9024</b> by use of heating/pressurizing apparatus <b>9029</b>. After the required time of heating/pressurization, the IC semiconductor chips <b>9021</b> and the support sheet <b>9027</b> are detached by heat, then the IC semiconductor chips are separated from the support sheet, and each chip is connected to the antenna. The heating/pressurizing apparatus <b>9029</b> mentioned above has the structure where it is long in a vertical direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28E</figref>. In the connection processes set forth above, all valid semiconductor chips arranged in line on the support sheet are connected to the antennas <b>9022</b> at the same time, after which the antennas are separated from the antenna frame <b>9025</b> by being cut at the C-D and C′-D′ sections in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28E</figref>, with the result that IC semiconductor chips with a connected dipole antenna are finished.

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As set forth above, in this embodiment, since the width of the antenna <b>9022</b> is smaller than that of the IC semiconductor chip <b>9021</b>, the multiple IC semiconductor chips in line on the silicon wafer can be connected to the respective antennas at the same time, which provides the advantages that significant throughput in the manufacturing processes can be obtained and that costs can be reduced. The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref> can also be embedded in resin and other substrate materials and used.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A to 29D</figref> show yet another embodiment of a semiconductor device based on the present invention, and a method of manufacturing this semiconductor device. In this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref>, bumps <b>9033</b> are formed on both the side at which the device of IC semiconductor chip <b>9031</b> is formed, and the side where the device of the IC semiconductor chip <b>9031</b> is not formed, and each bump is connected to antenna <b>9032</b> via solder <b>9034</b>. Although the thin line-form antenna <b>9032</b> made of copper-sheathed iron is thick at the connection with the IC semiconductor chip <b>9031</b>, the cross-sectional area of the thick portion is smaller than the area of the IC semiconductor chip <b>9031</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">During the manufacture of the semiconductor device pertaining to this embodiment, antenna members are inserted into the hole of antenna support <b>9038</b> with a multitude of antennas <b>9032</b> arranged in two-dimensional form. The arrangement of these antennas is equal to the array of the IC semiconductor chips <b>9031</b> formed on the silicon wafer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref> shows the LSI wafer <b>9035</b> on which the IC semiconductor chips <b>9031</b> are formed, and the LSI wafer <b>9035</b>, after being bonded onto support sheet <b>9036</b> attached to the required sheet frame <b>9037</b>, are diced into separate IC semiconductor chips. A cross-sectional view of the opposed arrangement of the LSI wafer in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref> and the antenna unit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29C</figref> is shown as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29D</figref>. The antenna <b>9032</b>, although embedded through the hole in the antenna support <b>9038</b>, does not fall from the support since the thick portion of the antenna that is connected to the IC semiconductor chip is greater than the hole in diameter. Under this state, the antenna members are positioned so that the IC semiconductor chips <b>9031</b> bonded onto the support sheet <b>9036</b> and the antenna members face each other. Next, the bump <b>9033</b> on each IC semiconductor chip and each antenna <b>9032</b> are connected via the solder <b>9034</b> by heating/pressuring apparatus not shown in the figure. After the required time of heating/pressurization, the IC semiconductor chips <b>9031</b> and the support sheet <b>9036</b> are detached by heat, then the IC semiconductor chips are separated from the support sheet, and each chip is connected to the antennas. In the connection processes set forth above, one side of each valid semiconductor chip on the support sheet is connected to the antennas at the same time. After this, the two-dimensionally arranged antennas are likewise connected to the other side of each IC semiconductor chip. In this process, since the positions of the antennas need to be matched facing in the opposite direction to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29D</figref>, a magnet parallel to the support is used for preventing the antennas from falling.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As set forth above, in this embodiment, since the cross-sectional area of each antenna <b>9032</b> is smaller than the area of each IC semiconductor chip <b>9031</b>, the multiple IC semiconductor chips formed in plane form on the silicon wafer can be connected to the respective antennas at the same time, which provides the advantages that significant throughput in the manufacturing processes can be obtained and that costs can be reduced. The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref> can also be embedded in resin and other substrate materials and used.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">When preventive measures are to be taken against forgery of various token-device media, the inventors consider that in terms of technology, an added value exists in whether the forgery method is easy. Although the sealing of metallic patterns in token-device media is described in embodiments of prior art, this method not only facilitates the pattern creation itself, but also has a risk close to recommending a method of forgery. Although forgery protection technology is for improving safety as its intended purpose, this technology enhances the reliability of forgery at the same time, and for this reason, forgery protection technology has the danger of no safeguards being provided against a high degree of forgery. It is to be deeply considered, therefore, that undeliberate forgery protection technology turns out to act as a forgery augmenter. In this case, referring to the technical level of metallic pattern creation, the present inventors consider it obvious that since the technology relates to the detection of metals, it is possible to analyze patternized information, even without using advanced technology, just by unsealing the medium and closely examining its contents. In other words, since the detection of metallic patterns is the requirement, its implementing method can be easily selected at a normal technical level. According to the present invention, the practical structure that uses semiconductor chips alone and in conjunction with cryptography and has a random number-generating technique can be economically implemented to protect various token-device media from forgery.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The effectiveness of the above-described solutions to conventional problems can be discovered by presenting means.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The present inventors consider that the mechanical strength of paper and the strength of semiconductor chips require even deeper studies. In one of the conventional embodiments described earlier in this SPECIFICATION, when a configuration with a thickness up to 100 microns is considered, whether problems arise depends greatly on whether no mechanical stresses are applied. That is to say, different restrictions must be defined to mount semiconductor chips on thin paper-form media, and although this deserves to be actively and clearly stated after being considered more deeply, the conventional embodiment mentioned above lacks such active understanding of the importance of defining different restrictions. More specifically, the thickness and size of the semiconductor chips must be studied. For example, when examining whether a semiconductor chip 1 mm in size can withstand use at a normal operating level with paper 100 microns thick, one needs to study about whether the semiconductor chip can withstand use, not whether it can be structurally formed. According to the present invention, it is possible to obtain the effects that solve the problems described above.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">During the processing of semiconductor chip periphery, since semiconductor chips that have been diced using a diamond blade are used, if external stresses are applied to the semiconductor chips and concentrated on the periphery thereof, the periphery will break or crack and some or all of the semiconductor chip functions will be lost. If these semiconductor chips are sealed in thin media such as paper, since bending or concentrated load stresses are prone to be applied, even a slight chipping (namely, a nick) around the semiconductor chips will result in their damage. Deep considerations from this viewpoint are not incorporated into the conventional structure. According to the present invention, it is possible to obtain the effects that solve these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">No consideration is given to the fact that despite gold bumps being present, side effects may be caused by the presence of the anisotropic electroconductive adhesive or electroconductive adhesive around the semiconductor chips. More specifically, no consideration is given to possible increases in the vertical dimensions of the structure due to the presence of the gold bumps, or to the likely occurrence of short circuits around the semiconductors. As a result, there exists the problem that the configuration of the semiconductor chips that includes the gold bumps makes the total structure of the equipment exceptionally thick and prevents bending-resistant structure from being achieved. According to the present invention, it is possible to obtain the effects that solve these problems.</p>
