<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image reading device, such as an image sensor, that converts optical information to an electric signal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows, an image reading device is composed of IC chips K<sub>1</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>, . . . , K<sub>m</sub>, for reading an image, arranged in a row and mounted on a printed circuit board (not shown). The IC chips K<sub>1</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>, . . . , K<sub>m </sub>sequentially output photoelectric conversion signals, which are then converted by an A/D converter <b>100</b> into a digital signal, which is then fed out via an output terminal <b>200</b>. The IC chips K<sub>1</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>, . . . , K<sub>m </sub>all have the same circuit configuration, of which a conventional example will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Photodiodes PD<sub>1</sub>, PD<sub>2</sub>, . . . , PD<sub>n</sub>, serving as photoelectric conversion elements, have their anodes connected to ground, and have their cathodes connected respectively to the gates of p-channel MOSFETs (metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors) A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, . . . , A<sub>n </sub>for amplification. The transistors A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, . . . , A<sub>n </sub>receive, at their sources, constant currents respectively from constant-current sources I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, . . . , I<sub>n</sub>, and have their drains connected to ground.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A bias voltage supply circuit <b>2</b> outputs a positive direct-current voltage stably. The voltage (hereinafter referred to as the “bias voltage”) output from the bias voltage supply circuit <b>2</b> is applied, through the drain-source channels of p-channel MOSFETs B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, . . . B<sub>n </sub>for switching, to the cathodes of the photodiodes PD<sub>1</sub>, PD<sub>2</sub>, . . . , PD<sub>n </sub>respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this circuit configuration, when the transistor B<sub>x</sub>(x=1, 2, . . . , n) remains on for a predetermined time or longer, a reverse bias is applied to the photodiode PD<sub>x</sub>, and thus a predetermined amount of electric charge is accumulated therein. In the following descriptions, this will be depicted as “the photodiode PD<sub>x </sub>being initialized.”</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the transistor B<sub>x </sub>turns from on to off, the initialization of the photodiode PD<sub>x </sub>is broken off, and the accumulated electric charge is discharged in proportion to the amount of incident light, causing a current to flow. Thus, the photodiode PD<sub>x </sub>gives a voltage proportional to the amount of incident light.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, a transistor C<sub>x </sub>turns on, with the result that the voltage signal (hereinafter referred to simply as “the signal of the photodiode PD<sub>x</sub>”) at the cathode of the photodiode PD<sub>x </sub>is amplified by a source-follower circuit formed by the transistor A<sub>x</sub>, is then subjected to further amplification, waveform shaping, and other processing by an output circuit <b>51</b>, and is then fed out via a terminal T<sub>OUT </sub>(hereinafter, this will be depicted as “the signal of the photodiode PD<sub>x </sub>being read out”).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A control circuit <b>52</b> controls the transistors C<sub>x </sub>in such a way that the signals of the photodiodes PD<sub>1</sub>, PD<sub>2</sub>, . . . , PD<sub>n </sub>are output sequentially, and also controls the transistors Bx in such a way that the photodiode PD<sub>x </sub>is initialized every time the signal of this photodiode PD<sub>1 </sub>is read out.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, in this conventional circuit configuration, the signals of all the photodiodes PD<sub>1</sub>, PD<sub>2</sub>, . . . , PD<sub>n </sub>are transmitted to the output circuit <b>51</b> by way of a single output line L, which is thus provided so as to be common to as many as several tens to several hundred photodiodes. This makes the output line L considerably long, and thus imposes a limit on the operating frequency of the image reading device, because, the longer the conductor laid as the output line L, the higher its resistance and capacitance, and thus the greater the resulting time constant.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Moreover, in the conventional circuit configuration, there are variations in the characteristics of the individual photodiodes PD<sub>1</sub>, PD<sub>2</sub>, . . . , PD<sub>n</sub>, but nevertheless the signals read out from them are fed out intact. As a result, according to the position of the photodiodes within the IC chip, for example, the characteristics of the semiconductors, such as their degree of impurity and thickness, and the light shield conditions for the individual photodiodes vary, and thus the signals that these photodiodes output vary.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An object of the present invention is to provide an image reading device that is ready to operate at a higher operating frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">To achieve the above object, according to the present invention, an image reading device is built as an IC chip having a plurality of processing sections, of which each has a plurality of image reading photoelectric conversion elements, a plurality of transistors for reading a photoelectric conversion signal from the image reading photoelectric conversion elements, a signal selection circuit for sequentially selecting the plurality of transistors, and a signal output line by way of which the photoelectric conversion signal is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">This arrangement helps shorten the signal output line within each processing section. As a result, it is possible to reduce the resistance and capacitance of the conductor laid as the signal output line. Moreover, it is possible to reduce the number of transistors that are connected to a single signal output line and thereby reduce the parasitic capacitance connected to a single signal output line. This makes it possible to increase the operation speed.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As a result, the transistors B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, . . . , B<sub>n </sub>are sequentially kept on for one period of the clock signal CLK one after another, specifically in such a way that the transistor B<sub>1 </sub>remains on between time points t<sub>4 </sub>and t<sub>6</sub>, the transistor B<sub>2 </sub>remains on between time points t<sub>6 </sub>and t<sub>8</sub>, and so forth. Thus, the image reading photodiodes PD<sub>1</sub>, PD<sub>2</sub>, . . . , PD<sub>n </sub>are initialized sequentially.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this way, if one pays attention to the first image reading photodiode PD<sub>1</sub>, whereas the transistor C<sub>1 </sub>is kept on between time points t<sub>3 </sub>and t<sub>5 </sub>so that the signal of the photodiode PD<sub>1 </sub>is read out, the transistor B<sub>1 </sub>is also kept on between time points t<sub>4 </sub>and t<sub>5 </sub>(i.e. during the last half of the read period) so that the photodiode PD<sub>1 </sub>is initialized. Thus, only the signal read out between time points t<sub>3 </sub>and t<sub>4 </sub>(i.e. during the first half of the read period) is actually used. Likewise, also with the other image reading photodiodes PD<sub>2</sub>, PD<sub>3</sub>, . . . , PD<sub>n</sub>, only the signals read out during the first half of their respective read period are actually used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Moreover, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows, the shift register <b>3</b> also sequentially outputs, in synchronism with the trailing edges of the clock signal CLK after the rising edge of the start trigger signal ST, negative pulses, each having a pulse width equal to one period of the clock signal CLK, via its terminals M<sub>1</sub>′, M<sub>2</sub>′, . . . , M<sub>n</sub>′.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As a result, the transistors B<sub>1</sub>′, B<sub>2</sub>′, . . . , B<sub>n</sub>′ are sequentially kept on for one period of the clock signal CLK one after another, specifically in such a way that the transistor B<sub>1</sub>′ remains on between time points t<sub>1 </sub>and t<sub>3</sub>, the transistor B<sub>2</sub>′ remains on between time points t<sub>3 </sub>and t<sub>5</sub>, and so forth. Thus, the dummy photodiodes PD<sub>1</sub>′, PD<sub>2</sub>′, . . . , PD<sub>n</sub>′ are initialized sequentially.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Moreover, the shift register <b>3</b> outputs, at its terminal E, a signal, which is fed out of the IC chip via its terminal T<sub>SO </sub>so as to be fed to the terminal T<sub>SI </sub>of the next IC chip. That is, this signal is used as the start trigger signal ST in the next IC chip. Here, the shift register <b>3</b> outputs one positive pulse via its terminal E with such appropriate timing as to prevent interference between the reading of the signal of the last image reading photodiode PD<sub>n </sub>of the IC chip under discussion and the reading of the signal of the first image reading photodiode PD<sub>1 </sub>of the next IC chip.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this circuit configuration, the differences between the signals of the image reading photodiodes PD<sub>x </sub>and the signals of the corresponding dummy photodiodes PD<sub>x</sub>′ are output. Thus, even if there are variations among the output signals from the individual photodiodes within an IC chip according to their position, for example, due to variations in the characteristics of the semiconductors, such as their degree of impurity and thickness, and variations in the light shield conditions of the individual photodiodes, such variations are cancelled. This helps enhance the uniformity of the signal levels obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Moreover, instead of transmitting all the signals from the individual image reading photodiodes PD<sub>1</sub>, . . . , PD<sub>n </sub>to the output circuit H by way of a single output line, the signals from the group of the image reading photodiode PD<sub>1</sub>, . . . , PD<sub>k </sub>are transmitted by way of the first output line L<b>1</b>, and the signals from the group of the image reading photodiode PD<sub>k+1</sub>, . . . , PD<sub>n </sub>are transmitted by way of the first output line L<b>2</b>. Likewise, instead of transmitting all the signals from the dummy photodiodes PD<sub>1</sub>′, . . . , PD<sub>n</sub>′ to the output circuit H by way of a single output line, the signals from the group of the dummy photodiode PD<sub>1</sub>′, . . . , PD<sub>k</sub>′ are transmitted by way of the third output line L<b>3</b>, and the signals from the group of the dummy photodiode PD<sub>k+1</sub>′, . . . , PD<sub>n</sub>′ are transmitted by way of the fourth output line L<b>4</b>. This makes it possible to shorten the output line substantially in half. Shortening the conductor laid as the output line results in reducing its resistance and capacitance, and also in reducing the parasitic capacitance due to the transistors connected thereto in half. This reduces the resulting time constant, and thus makes it possible to increase the operating frequency of the image reading device. Specifically, whereas the operating frequency conventionally achieved is limited to 1.5 to 2.0 MHz, that achieved in this embodiment is as high as 3.0 to 4.0 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Where, as in the embodiment described above, the image reading photodiodes are divided into two groups, they are classified, for example, according to whether the signals from them are read out in the first half or latter half of the period for reading one complete image. The image reading photodiodes may be divided into a plurality of groups, i.e. not only two but also three or more; in any case, output lines are provided one for each group.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is possible to omit the dummy photodiodes completely, or provide only one dummy photodiode common to all the image reading photodiodes and output the differences between the signals of the individual image reading photodiodes and the signal of the dummy photodiode. This helps simplify the circuit configuration, and thus contributes to miniaturization and cost reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Providing as many dummy photodiodes as image reading photodiodes, however, makes it possible to arrange the dummy photodiodes close to the corresponding image reading photodiodes. Thus, in this arrangement, outputting the differences between the signals of the image reading photodiodes and the signals of the dummy photodiodes arranged close thereto makes it possible to reduce variations among the output signals from the individual photodiodes within an IC chip according to their position, for example, due to variations in the characteristics of the semiconductors, such as their degree of impurity and thickness, and variations in the light shield conditions of the individual photodiodes.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As described above, according to the present invention, in an image reading device, it is possible to shorten the output line by way of which signals obtained from photoelectric conversion elements are transmitted to an output circuit, and also reduce the number of transistors connected to one output line. That is, it is possible to reduce the resistance and capacitance of the conductor laid as the output line. This reduces the parasitic capacitance due to the transistors connected to the output line, and thereby reduces the resulting time constant. In this way, it is possible to increase the operating frequency of the image reading device and obtain outputs corrected for variations in the characteristics of photodiodes.</p>
