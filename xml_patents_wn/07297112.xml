<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not Applicable</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to sensor devices and, more particularly, to an bio-sensor system configured for wirelessly transmitting data to a remote transponder from an on-chip transponder having a sensor and which is implantable in a patient. The bio-sensor system is specifically adapted to apply a stable and precise voltage to an electrode system of the sensor such that glucose concentration levels of the patient may be accurately measured.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The blood glucose concentration level of a patient is normally controlled by the pancreas. However, for patients suffering from diabetes, the pancreas does not properly regulate the production of insulin needed to metabolize food into energy for the individual. For diabetic patients, glucose levels must be checked or monitored several times throughout the day so that insulin may be periodically administered in order to maintain the glucose concentration at a normal level. In one popular method, the glucose level is monitored by first obtaining a sample of blood from finger-pricking. The glucose level of the blood sample is then placed on a glucose measurement strip and a subsequent chemical reaction produces a color change that may be compared to a reference chart. In this manner, the reaction of the blood sample with the glucose measurement strip provides an indication as to whether the glucose level is abnormally low or high such that the diabetic patient may administer the proper amount of insulin in order to maintain the glucose concentration within a predetermined range. Such administration of insulin is typically performed by way of self-injection with a syringe.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Unfortunately, the finger-pricking method of glucose testing is uncomfortable as both the blood-pricking and the insulin injections are painful and time-consuming such that many diabetic patients are reluctant to check their glucose levels at regular intervals throughout the day. Unfortunately, glucose levels often fluctuate throughout the day. Therefore, even diabetic patients who are otherwise consistent in checking their glucose levels at regular intervals throughout the day may be unaware of periods wherein their glucose levels are dangerously low or high. Furthermore, the finger-pricking method is dependent on patient skill for accurate testing such that the patient may rely on erroneous data in determining the dosage level of insulin. Finally, self-monitoring of glucose levels imposes a significant burden on less capable individuals such as the young, the elderly and the mentally-challenged.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At the time of this writing, it is estimated that 17 million people in the United States, or about six percent of the population, have diabetes. Due in part to dietary habits and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, particularly among children, diabetes is expected to increase at the rate of about 7 percent every year such that the disease is predicted to eventually reach epidemic proportions. In addition, the current cost of diabetes in the United States alone is estimated at over $120 billion with the total U.S. sales of the glucose measuring strips alone estimated at about $2 billion. Thus, there is a demand for continuous, reliable and low-cost monitoring of glucose levels of diabetic patients due to the increasing number of people diagnosed with diabetes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Included in the prior art are several implantable devices have been developed in an effort to provide a system for continuous and reliable glucose monitoring. In such implantable devices, an electrochemical sensor is embedded beneath the skin of the patient. The electrochemical sensor detects the glucose concentration level and transmits signals representative of the glucose concentration level to a receiving device. Unfortunately, such implantable devices suffer from several deficiencies. One such deficiency is that implantable devices may expend a substantial amount of power in sensing and processing bio-signals. The power requirement for such devices necessitates the use of large batteries in order to prolong the useful life. Unfortunately, implantable devices having batteries as the power source may require periodic surgeries for replacement of the batteries when the capacity drops below a minimum level.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, some batteries contain materials that may present a risk of harm to the patient due to toxic substances or chemical within the battery that may leak into the patient after implantation. Also, due to the relatively limited power capacity of batteries, the range of functions that may be performed by the implantable device may be somewhat limited. Finally, it may be desirable to monitor multiple physiological parameters in addition to glucose concentration levels. In such cases, the implantable device may require multiple sensors wherein each sensor simultaneously monitors a different physiological parameter of the patient. For example, in addition to monitoring glucose concentration levels, the temperature and heart rate of the patient may also be monitored. Such an implantable device having multiple sensors may consume more power than can be supplied by a battery that is miniaturized for use in an implantable device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One implantable device in the prior art overcomes the above noted deficiency associated with large power requirements by providing a bio-sensor system that is passively powered such that the operating life of the bio-sensor is theoretically unlimited. As understood, the passively powered bio-sensor system includes at least one sensor that is implanted in a patient. The implanted sensor monitors physiological conditions of the patient. An implanted passive transponder receives the sensor signals from the sensor, digitizes the sensor signals and transmits the digitized sensor signal out of the patient's body when subjected to an interrogation signal from a remote interrogator. The interrogator also energizes the implanted transponder such that the bio-sensor system may be passively powered. In this manner, the passively powered bio-sensor system requires no batteries such that it essentially has an unlimited operating life.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another deficiency of implantable devices pertains to electrochemical sensors that are utilized therein to measure glucose concentration levels in the patient's blood. Such sensors typically use an amperometric detection method wherein oxidation or reduction of a compound is measured at a working electrode in order to determine substance concentration levels. A potentiostat is used to apply a constant potential or excitation voltage to the working electrode with respect to a reference electrode. In measuring glucose concentration levels in the blood, glucose oxidase (GOX) is typically used as a catalyst to oxidize glucose and form gluconic acid, leaving behind two electrons and two protons and reducing the GOX. Oxygen that is dissolved in the patient's blood then reacts with GOX by accepting the two electrons and two protons to form hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and regenerating oxidized GOX.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The cycle repeats as the regenerated GOX reacts once again with glucose. The consumption of O<sub>2 </sub>or the formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is subsequently measured at the working electrode which is typically a platinum electrode. As oxidation occurs at the working electrode, reduction also occurs at the reference electrode which is typically a silver/silver chloride electrode. The more oxygen that is consumed, the greater the amount of glucose in the patient's blood. In the same reaction, the rate at which H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is produced is also indicative of the glucose concentration level in the patient's blood. Because the potentiostat controls the voltage difference between the working electrode and the reference electrode, the accuracy with which the sensor measures glucose concentration levels is dependent on the accuracy with which the voltage is applied. If the voltage that is applied to the sensor is excessive, the silver or silver chloride reference electrode may be excessively consumed such that the reference electrode may become damaged. Furthermore, erroneous measurements of glucose concentration levels may result such that the ability of the patient to administer insulin in order to correct for abnormalities in glucose concentration levels may be compromised</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an attempt to overcome the above-described deficiency associated with two-electrode electrochemical sensors, three-electrode electrochemical sensors have been developed wherein an auxiliary electrode is included with the working electrode and the reference electrode. The inclusion of the auxiliary electrode is understood to reduce the consumption of silver and silver chloride by reducing the magnitude of current flowing through the reference electrode, thereby stabilizing the electrode potential. Unfortunately, such three-electrode electrochemical sensors of the type describe above add complexity and cost to the bio-sensor system due to the increased difficulty in manufacturing and operating such electrochemical sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As can be seen, there is a need for an implantable bio-sensor system that overcomes the above-described deficiencies associated with the stability of the reference electrode potential with respect to the working electrode. More specifically, there exists a need in the art for an implantable bio-sensor system that provides a stable and accurate voltage to the electrochemical sensor in order to improve the accuracy with which glucose concentration levels may be measured. In combination with the power requirements, there is also a need in the art for an implantable bio-sensor system that enables the simultaneous and selective monitoring of multiple physiological parameters of the patient through the use of multiple bio-sensors included with the implantable device. Furthermore, there exists a need in the art for an implantable bio-sensor system which allows full-duplex operation such that requests for data (i.e., physiological parameters of the patient) and transmission of such data can be simultaneously performed. Finally, there is a need in the art for an implantable bio-sensor system that enables continuous readout of the data at a remote device.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Provided is a telemetric bio-sensor system which utilizes radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and which includes a remote transponder that is in wireless communication with a passively powered on-chip transponder. The bio-sensor system is specifically adapted to provide a substantially stable and precise voltage to a sensor assembly that is included with an implantable on-chip transponder. The remote transponder is placed within a predetermined distance of the on-chip transponder in order to supply power to and request telemetry data from the on-chip transponder. The remote transponder is also configured to remotely receive data representative of a physiological parameter of the patient as well as identification data and may enable readout of one or more of the physiological parameters that are measured, processed and transmitted by the on-chip transponder upon request by the remote transponder.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Importantly, the power receiver supplies a substantially non-deviating sensor reference voltage to the sensor in order to enhance the accuracy with which the physiological parameter is measured. The precision and stability of the sensor reference voltage (i.e., the sensor power) is enhanced by the specific circuit architecture of the glucose sensor. The application of the substantially stable voltage to the sensor assembly allows for relatively accurate measurement of the physiological parameter of the patient such as measurement of a glucose concentration level by a glucose sensor. The technique of generating the stable and precise voltage may be applied to a 2-pin glucose sensor as well as to a 3-pin glucose sensor without the use of a microprocessor such that cost and power consumption of the on-chip transponder may be reduced. Advantageously, the stability and accuracy of the sensor reference voltage is achieved without the use of a microprocessor to reduce power consumption of the on-chip transponder as well as reduce overall costs of the bio-sensor system.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The on-chip transponder includes the sensor assembly having the sensor which may be the 2-pin or 3-pin glucose sensor. However, any other sensor may be used with the on-chip transponder. Components of the on-chip transponder may include: the sensor, a power receiver, an analog-to-digital (A/D) assembly, a data processor and an RF transmitter which may preferably be interconnected using conventional integrated circuit technology such that the on-chip transponder may be packaged into a sufficiently small size for implantation into a patient. An RF receiver may also be included with the on-chip transponder to allow for selection among a plurality of sensors and to allow for full-duplexing, which enables continuous and/or simultaneous two-way wireless communication between the remote transponder and the on-chip transponder.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The remote transponder emits a scanner signal that is received by a power receiver of the on-chip transponder. The power receiver converts the scanner signal to a power signal to power the A/D assembly, a data processor and an RF transmitter. The A/D assembly converts the physiological parameter contained in an analog electrical signal coming from the sensor into digital format in a digital signal. The A/D assembly may also add a unique identification code to the digital signal to identify the particular sensor from which the sensor signal originated.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The data processor receives the digital signal from the A/D assembly and filters, amplifies and/or encodes the digital signal to generate a processed data signal. The data processor may also gate the data signal to determine when to transmit the data signal and may also sum the data signal with other data (i.e., from other sensors). The RF transmitter impresses (i.e., modulates) the data signal onto a radio carrier of a desired frequency, amplifies the modulated carrier and sends it to an antenna for radiation to the remote transponder.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating various aspects of the invention and not for purposes of limiting the same, provided is a uniquely configured telemetric bio-sensor system <b>10</b> which utilized radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and which includes a remote transponder <b>800</b> that is in wireless communication with a passively powered on-chip transponder <b>100</b>. The bio-sensor system <b>10</b> is specifically adapted to provide a substantially stable and precise voltage to a sensor assembly <b>200</b> that is included with the on-chip transponder <b>100</b>. The on-chip transponder <b>100</b> is implantable into a host such as a human patient.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The remote transponder <b>800</b>, which may be a compact handheld device, may be manually placed within a predetermined distance (e.g., within several feet) of the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> in order to supply power to and request telemetry data from the on-chip transponder <b>100</b>. The remote transponder <b>800</b> may alternatively be fixedly mounted and may be configured to automatically transmit power and telemetry request data to the patient and, hence, the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> when the patient moves within the predetermined distance to the remote transponder <b>800</b>. Regardless of whether it is handheld, fixedly mounted or otherwise supported, the remote transponder <b>800</b> is configured to remotely receive data representative of a physiological parameter of the patient as well as identification data such that the data may be stored or displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Importantly, the application of the substantially stable voltage to the sensor assembly <b>200</b> allows for relatively accurate measurement of the physiological parameter of the patient such as measurement of a glucose concentration level by a glucose sensor <b>210</b>. As will be demonstrated below, the technique of generating the stable and precise voltage may be applied to a 2-pin glucose sensor <b>210</b> as well as to a 3-pin glucose sensor <b>210</b>. Importantly, the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> provides the stable and precise voltage to the sensor assembly <b>200</b> without the use of a microprocessor such that cost and power consumption of the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In its broadest sense, the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> and operational method of use thereof comprises the implantable on-chip transponder <b>100</b> and the remote transponder <b>800</b> in wireless communication with one another. As mentioned above, the sensor assembly <b>200</b> is connected to or integral with the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> and may be implanted in the patient with the on-chip transponder <b>100</b>. The bio-sensor system <b>10</b> is configured such that the remote transponder <b>800</b> may enable readout of one or more of the physiological parameters that are measured, processed and transmitted by the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> upon request by the remote transponder <b>800</b>. The bio-sensor system <b>10</b> may be configured to operate in simplex mode as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Alternatively, the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> may be configured to operate in duplex mode as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>wherein the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> additionally includes an intelligent radio frequency (RF) receiver. When provided with the RF receiver <b>700</b>, the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> enables features such as selection between multiple sensors <b>210</b> and/or continuous readout of data (e.g., physiological parameters of the patient) in addition to readout of identification data which may be correlated to a patient database containing information regarding the patient's identity as well as information regarding the patient's age, weight, medical history, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring more particularly now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, shown are block diagrams of the sensor assembly <b>200</b> as connected to the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> of the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> for respective embodiments enabling simplex and duplex operation. The on-chip transponder <b>100</b> includes the sensor assembly <b>200</b> having the sensor <b>210</b>. The sensor <b>210</b> may be configured as the 2-pin glucose sensor <b>210</b> or as 3-pin glucose sensor <b>210</b> as was mentioned above. However, any other sensor may be used with the on-chip transponder <b>100</b>. For example, the sensor <b>210</b> may be configured as at least one of the following: a pressure transducer, a blood sugar sensor, a blood oxygen sensor, a heart rate monitor, a respiratory rate sensor, etc. In this regard, the sensor <b>210</b> may be configured as any type of sensor for measuring, monitoring or detecting any type of physiological parameter of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of the remote transponder <b>800</b>. The remote transponder <b>800</b> is configured to wirelessly request data regarding the physiological parameter by transmitting a scanner signal <b>882</b> to the on-chip transponder <b>100</b>. The remote transponder <b>800</b> is also configured to receive a data signal <b>462</b> representative of the physiological parameter from the on-chip transponder <b>100</b>. In the same manner, the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> is configured to communicate with the remote transponder <b>800</b> and receive the scanner signal <b>882</b> and transmit the data signal <b>462</b> therefrom once the remote transponder <b>800</b> and on-chip transponder <b>100</b> are within sufficiently close proximity to one another to enable wireless communication therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Components of the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> for the embodiment of the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> enabling simplex operation include: the sensor <b>210</b>, a power receiver <b>600</b>, an analog-to-digital (A/D) assembly <b>300</b>, a data processor <b>400</b> and an RF transmitter <b>500</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>. For embodiments of the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> enabling duplex operation, the RF receiver <b>700</b> is included with the on-chip transponder <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>. Each of the components of the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> may be electrically interconnected via conventional conductive wiring. However, electrical connections may preferably be provided using conventional integrated circuit technology such that the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> may be packaged into a sufficiently small size for implantation into the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The sensor <b>210</b> is configured to generate a sensor signal <b>234</b> representative of the physiological parameter of the patient and is made up of a positive signal and a negative signal transmitted in parallel and sent from the sensor <b>210</b> to the A/D assembly <b>300</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>. For embodiments of the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> enabling simplex operation, the power receiver <b>600</b> is configured to receive the scanner signal <b>882</b> at antenna <b>601</b> and to generate a power signal <b>602</b> for passively powering the on-chip transponder <b>100</b>. For embodiments of the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> enabling duplexing, the RF receiver <b>700</b> receives the scanner signal <b>882</b> at antenna <b>701</b> for delivery to the power receiver <b>600</b>. The A/D assembly <b>300</b> is connected to the power receiver <b>600</b> via power line <b>604</b> to receive the power signal <b>602</b>. The A/D assembly <b>300</b> is also connected to the sensor <b>210</b> to receive the analog sensor signal <b>234</b> therefrom. Once powered by the power signal <b>602</b>, the A/D assembly <b>300</b> is configured to generate a digital signal <b>372</b> in response to the analog sensor signal <b>234</b> coming from the sensor <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, the data processor <b>400</b> is connected to the A/D assembly <b>300</b> and the power receiver <b>600</b> and is configured to receive the power signal <b>602</b>, via power line <b>606</b>, as well as the digital signal <b>372</b> from the A/D assembly <b>300</b>. Upon powering by the power signal <b>602</b>, the data processor <b>400</b> is configured to generate a data signal <b>462</b> in response to the digital signal <b>372</b>. In general, the data processor <b>400</b> receives the digital signal <b>372</b> and filters, amplifies and/or encodes the digital signal <b>372</b> to generate the data signal <b>462</b>. The data processor <b>400</b> may be configured to gate the data signal <b>462</b> to determine when to transmit the data signal <b>462</b> to the remote transponder <b>800</b>. In addition, the data processor <b>400</b> may also be configured to sum the data signal <b>462</b> with other data (i.e., from other sensors <b>210</b>), as will be explained in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The RF transmitter <b>500</b> is connected to the power receiver <b>600</b> via power line <b>608</b> to receive the power signal <b>602</b>. The RF transmitter <b>500</b> is also connected to the data processor <b>400</b> and is configured to receive the data signal <b>462</b> therefrom. The RF transmitter <b>500</b> is also configured to modulate, amplify, filter and transmit the data signal <b>462</b> for receipt back to the remote transponder <b>800</b>. In general, the RF transmitter <b>500</b> impresses (i.e., modulates) the data signal <b>462</b> onto a radio carrier of a desired frequency, amplifies the modulated signal and sends the modulated signal to antenna for radiation to the remote transponder <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The power receiver <b>600</b> circuitry is configured similar to the circuitry of a voltage regulator, as is well known in the art, wherein reference diodes and resistors are arranged in such a manner as to generate an approximate supply voltage. However, the power receiver <b>600</b> is also specifically configured to supply a suitable voltage to the sensor <b>210</b> processing circuitry without delivering substantial current so as to reduce complexity. Thus, in addition to collecting, rectifying, filtering and regulating power for supply to the A/D assembly <b>300</b>, data processor <b>400</b> and RF transmitter <b>500</b>, the power receiver <b>600</b> also provides the substantially stable and precise voltage to the sensor assembly <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">More specifically, the power receiver <b>600</b> is configured to supply a substantially non-deviating sensor reference voltage signal <b>642</b> to the sensor <b>210</b> in order to enhance the accuracy with which the physiological parameter is measured. The precision and stability of the sensor reference voltage signal <b>642</b> (i.e., the sensor <b>210</b> power) is enhanced by the specific circuit architecture of the glucose sensor <b>210</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b </i>and as will be described in greater detail below. In this manner, the accuracy of glucose concentration levels, as represented by an output signal from the glucose sensor <b>210</b>, is improved. As was earlier mentioned, once the physiological parameter is measured by the sensor <b>210</b>, the remote transponder <b>800</b> is configured to receive the data signal <b>462</b> from the RF transmitter <b>500</b> and extract data representative of the physiological parameter for storage and/or display.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For embodiments of the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> enabling duplex operation, the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> additionally includes the RF receiver <b>700</b> which is configured to receive the scanner signal <b>882</b> from the remote transponder <b>800</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>. In a broadest sense, the scanner signal <b>882</b> is received at antenna <b>701</b> and is decoded by the RF receiver <b>700</b> to inform the on-chip transponder <b>100</b>, via a message signal <b>702</b>, that a request for data has been made. The power receiver <b>600</b> also converts the scanner signal <b>882</b> into the power signal <b>602</b> for relay to the A/D assembly <b>300</b>, the data processor <b>400</b> and the RF transmitter <b>500</b> via respective ones of the power lines <b>604</b>, <b>606</b>, <b>608</b>, as was described above. The RF receiver <b>700</b> is configured to filter, amplify and demodulate the scanner signal <b>882</b> and generate the message signal <b>702</b> for delivery to controlling components of the on-chip transponder <b>100</b>. More specifically, the message signal <b>702</b> is transmitted to the A/D assembly <b>300</b>, the data processor <b>400</b> and the RF transmitter <b>500</b> via respective ones of the message/control lines <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, <b>708</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For configurations of the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> having a plurality of sensors <b>210</b>, each one of the sensors <b>210</b> may be operative to sense a distinct physiological parameter of the patient and generate the sensor signal <b>234</b> representative thereof. For example, an additional one of the sensors <b>210</b> may be provided to measure an internal body temperature of the patient. Still further, an additional one of the sensors <b>210</b> may be provided to measure a blood pressure level of the patient. The plurality of sensors <b>210</b> may generate a plurality of sensor signals <b>234</b>. The RF receiver <b>700</b> may be configured to coordinate requests for data from one or more of the plurality of sensors <b>210</b> for subsequent transmission of the data back to the remote transponder <b>800</b>, as will be described in greater detail below. For embodiments of the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> having multiple sensors <b>210</b>, the data processor <b>400</b> may be configured to assign a preset identification code to the digital signal <b>372</b> for identifying the sensor <b>210</b> from which the sensor signal <b>234</b> originates. In such an embodiment, the A/D assembly <b>300</b> may include a switch <b>310</b> that is responsive to the message signal <b>702</b> and which is operative to select among the plurality of sensor signals <b>234</b> for subsequent transmission thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b</i>, for configurations of the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> wherein the sensor <b>210</b> is a glucose sensor <b>210</b> having an electrode assembly <b>201</b>, the specific circuit architecture of the glucose sensor <b>210</b> is preferably such that the sensor reference voltage signal <b>642</b> is supplied to the electrode assembly <b>201</b> at a substantially constant value of about positive 0.7 volts. Advantageously, the stability and accuracy of the sensor reference voltage signal <b>642</b> is achieved without the use of a microprocessor. The circuit architecture includes an electrode assembly <b>201</b> having a first terminal <b>202</b> (i.e., a working electrode) and a second terminal <b>204</b> (i.e., a reference electrode) that are both placed in fluid communication with the patient's blood.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The 2-pin glucose sensor <b>210</b> may be configured to measure the glucose level using glucose oxidase (GOX) as a catalyst to cause oxidation of glucose in the patient's blood which forms gluconic acid and which reduces the GOX. Oxygen (O2) in the patient's blood reacts with the GOX to form hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and regenerate the oxidized GOX. The consumption of O<sub>2 </sub>or the formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is measured at the first terminal <b>202</b>, which may be fabricated of platinum. While oxidation occurs at the first terminal <b>202</b>, reduction is measured at the second terminal <b>204</b>, which may be fabricated of silver/silver chloride. The rate at which O<sub>2 </sub>is consumed and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is formed is indicative of the glucose concentration level in the patient's blood. Advantageously, supplying the sensor reference voltage signal <b>642</b> to the first terminal <b>202</b> at a substantially constant value of about positive 0.7 increases the accuracy with which the glucose concentration level may be measured by the 2-pin glucose sensor <b>210</b> as well as the 3-pin glucose sensor <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>, measurement accuracy of glucose concentration level by the 2-pin glucose sensor <b>210</b> is enhanced by the circuit architecture thereof. As can be seen, the 2-pin glucose sensor <b>210</b> includes a first precision resistor <b>224</b>, a first operational amplifier <b>220</b>, a voltmeter <b>250</b>, a second operational amplifier <b>230</b> and a tunable second precision resistor <b>240</b>. The first precision resistor <b>224</b> is connected to the power receiver <b>600</b> and is configured to receive the sensor reference voltage signal <b>642</b> therefrom for excitation of the glucose sensor <b>210</b>. The first operational amplifier <b>220</b> is connected to the first precision resistor <b>224</b> through the first signal line <b>212</b> and is configured to receive the sensor reference voltage signal <b>642</b>. The first operational amplifier <b>220</b> discharges a precision sensor reference voltage signal <b>223</b> at a non-inverting input <b>232</b> thereof in response to the sensor reference voltage signal <b>642</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The voltmeter <b>250</b> is connected to a non-inverting input of first operational amplifier <b>220</b> and to the first precision resistor <b>224</b> and is configured to monitor the precision sensor reference voltage signal <b>223</b>. The voltmeter <b>250</b> is configured to establish a sensor <b>210</b> operating point and more accurately interpret responses of the sensor <b>210</b>. The voltmeter <b>250</b> also cooperates with non-inverting first operational amplifier <b>220</b> to buffer the precision sensor reference voltage signal <b>223</b> and apply a substantially accurate sensor reference voltage signal <b>226</b> to the first terminal <b>202</b>. The second operational amplifier <b>230</b> is connected to the second terminal <b>204</b> through the second signal line <b>214</b> and is configured to receive current discharging from the second terminal <b>204</b> in response to the accurate sensor reference voltage signal <b>226</b> applied to the first terminal <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The tunable second precision resistor <b>240</b> is connected between an output and an inverting input of the second operational amplifier <b>230</b> and cooperates therewith to generate the sensor signal <b>234</b> that is substantially proportional to the glucose level of the patient's blood. The current is delivered to an inverting terminal of the second operational amplifier <b>230</b> having a non-inverting input <b>232</b> which is grounded, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>. Accurate current measure (e.g., discharging from the second terminal <b>204</b>) at the second operational amplifier <b>230</b> is established by the tunable second precision resistor <b>240</b>. By configuring the glucose sensor <b>210</b> in this manner, the need for a microprocessor is eliminated and the associated calibration procedures and current drain. Output of the second operational amplifier <b>230</b> as determined by the precision sensor reference voltage <b>223</b> as well as by the sensor <b>210</b> operating point (i.e., glucose levels) and the second precision resistor <b>240</b>, is then processed and transmitted upon request by the remote transponder <b>800</b>.</p>

The third terminal <b>206</b> is co-located with the first and second terminals <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> and is also preferably in fluid communication with the patient's blood. The auxiliary control circuit <b>260</b> is connected between the third terminal <b>206</b> and the second operational amplifier <b>230</b> through the third signal line <b>216</b> and is configured to monitor and control an amount of current discharging from the third terminal <b>206</b>. The third terminal <b>206</b> is configured to divert current away from the second terminal <b>204</b> during application of the accurate sensor reference voltage signal <b>226</b> applied to the first terminal <b>202</b>. The addition of the third terminal <b>206</b> to the electrode assembly <b>201</b> of the 3-pin glucose sensor <b>210</b> may help to reduce the consumption of silver and/or silver chloride contained in the second terminal <b>204</b> by drawing a portion of current away from the second terminal <b>204</b>. In this manner, the third terminal <b>206</b> acts to stabilize the electrode potential and the operational life of the glucose sensor <b>210</b> may be increased.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the operation of the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> will now be generally described. More specifically, the method of remotely monitoring physiological parameters using the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> will be described wherein the bio-sensor system <b>10</b> broadly comprises the remote transponder <b>800</b> and the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> having the sensor <b>210</b> and which is implantable in the patient. The method comprises the steps of remotely generating and wirelessly transmitting the scanner signal <b>882</b> with the remote transponder <b>800</b> wherein the scanner signal <b>882</b> contains radio signal power and a telemetry data request. The scanner signal <b>882</b> is received at the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> whereupon the scanner signal <b>882</b> is filtered, amplified and demodulated to generate the message signal <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Radio signal power is then collected from the scanner signal <b>882</b> and the power signal <b>602</b> is generated in response thereto. Simultaneously, upon being powered by the sensor reference voltage signal <b>642</b>, the sensor <b>210</b> senses at least one physiological parameter of the patient in the manner as was described above and generates the analog sensor signal <b>234</b>. The power signal <b>602</b>, the analog sensor signal <b>234</b> and the message signal <b>702</b> are all received at the A/D assembly <b>300</b> which then generates the digital signal <b>372</b> which is representative of the analog sensor signal. The power signal <b>602</b>, the message signal <b>702</b> and the digital signal <b>372</b> are then received at the data processor <b>400</b> which prepares the digital signal <b>372</b> for modulation. The data processor <b>400</b> then generates the data signal <b>462</b> which is representative of the digital signal <b>372</b>. The power signal <b>602</b>, the message signal <b>702</b> and the data signal <b>462</b> are received at the RF transmitter <b>500</b> which then modulates, amplifies, filters and wirelessly transmits a transmitted signal <b>502</b> from the on-chip transponder <b>100</b>. The remote transponder <b>800</b> then received the transmitted signal <b>502</b> from the on-chip transponder <b>100</b> and extracts data that is representative of the physiological parameter of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>, wherein the sensor <b>210</b> is configured as the 2-pin glucose sensor <b>210</b>, the method may further comprise steps for enhancing the stability and precision of the power supplied to the electrode assembly <b>201</b> by first tuning the power signal <b>602</b> with the first precision resistor <b>224</b> to generate the sensor reference voltage signal <b>642</b> at the level of about positive 0.7 volts. The sensor reference voltage signal <b>642</b> is received at the first operational amplifier <b>220</b> which generates the precision sensor reference voltage signal <b>223</b>. The voltmeter <b>250</b> monitors the precision sensor reference voltage signal to establish a sensor <b>210</b> operating point. The first operational amplifier <b>220</b> cooperates with the voltmeter <b>250</b> to buffer the precision sensor reference voltage signal <b>223</b> in order to generate a substantially accurate sensor reference voltage signal <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The accurate sensor reference voltage signal <b>226</b> is applied to the first terminal <b>202</b> to cause the reaction with the patient's blood which causes current to discharge from the second terminal <b>204</b> in the manner earlier described. The current discharges at the second terminal <b>204</b> in proportion to the glucose level. By tuning the second precision resistor <b>240</b>, which is connected in series to the second operational amplifier <b>230</b>, a voltage divider is formed with the glucose sensor <b>210</b>. The second precision resistor <b>240</b>, in cooperation with the second operational amplifier <b>230</b>, measures the level of discharging current and generates the sensor signal <b>234</b> which is substantially proportional to the glucose level of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>, for the case where the sensor <b>210</b> is a 3-pin glucose sensor <b>210</b> including the third terminal <b>206</b> that is co-located with the first and second terminals <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, the method of sensing the glucose level further comprises the steps of diverting a portion of the current away from the second terminal <b>204</b>. This is performed by discharging current at the third terminal <b>206</b> during application of the accurate sensor reference voltage signal <b>226</b> to the first terminal <b>202</b>. The current from the third terminal <b>206</b> is passes through the auxiliary control circuit <b>260</b> which is connected between the third electrode and the second operational amplifier <b>230</b>. The auxiliary control circuit <b>260</b> monitors and controls the amount of current discharging from the third terminal <b>206</b> in order to stabilize the accurate sensor reference voltage signal <b>226</b> applied to the first terminal <b>202</b> which may increase the operational life of the glucose sensor <b>210</b>.</p>
