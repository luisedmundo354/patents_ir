<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates in general to the field of electronic packaging. More particularly, the present invention relates to electronic packaging that removes heat from an electronic component using thermal dissipation channels of an organic substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electronic components, such a microprocessors and integrated circuits, must operate within certain specified temperature ranges to perform efficiently. Excessive heat degrades electronic component performance, reliability, life expectancy, and can even cause failure. Heat sinks are widely used for controlling excessive heat. Typically, heat sinks are formed with fins, pins or other similar structures to increase the surface area of the heat sink and thereby enhance heat dissipation as air passes over the heat sink. In addition, it is not uncommon for heat sinks to contain high performance structures, such as vapor chambers and/or heat pipes, to further enhance heat transfer. Heat sinks are typically formed of metals, such as copper or aluminum. More recently, graphite-based materials have been used for heat sinks because such materials offer several advantages, such as improved thermal conductivity and reduced weight.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the heat dissipation performance of conventional heat sinks, even when augmented with high performance structures and the use of exotic materials, may not be enough to prevent excessive heat buildup in the electronic component and/or the underlying substrate in some applications, such as in a multi-chip module that requires high power density. For example, excessive heat buildup in the module substrate of a multi-chip module can be a problem when an organic substrate, such as polyimide or other polymer(s), FR-4 (i.e., glass-epoxy laminate), etc., is used in lieu of a ceramic carrier, glass-ceramic substrate, or other conductor-carrying substrate that can withstand higher temperatures. Moreover, excessive heat buildup exacerbates another problem associated with using organic substrates, which is discussed below, relating to the mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of organic substrates relative to that of silicon chips. Hence, organic substrates are typically not used as module substrates in multi-chip modules, even though organic substrates are typically much less costly than ceramic carriers, glass-ceramic substrates, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Electronic components are generally packaged using electronic packages (i.e., modules) that include a module substrate to which one or more electronic component(s) is/are electronically connected. A single-chip module (SCM) contains a single electronic component such as a central processor unit (CPU), memory, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or other integrated circuit. A multi-chip module (MCM), on the other hand, contains two or more such electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Generally, each of these electronic components takes the form of a flip-chip, which is a semiconductor chip or die having an array of spaced-apart terminals or pads on its base to provide base-down mounting of the flip-chip to the module substrate. The module substrate is typically a ceramic carrier, glass-ceramic substrate, or other conductor-carrying substrate. As mentioned above, organic substrates are generally not used as module substrates because of their inability to withstand higher temperatures and because of the typically large CTE mismatch between organic substrates and flip-chips. This is disadvantageous because, as mentioned above, organic substrates are typically much less costly than ceramic carriers, glass-ceramic substrates, and the like. Typically, ceramic carriers have a CTE (e.g., CTE=2-7 ppm/° C.) much closer to that of flip-chips (e.g., CTE=2-3 ppm/° C.) than do organic substrates (e.g., CTE=12-20 ppm/° C.). In general, the larger the base area of the flip-chip the more problematic the CTE mismatch becomes. Hence, organic substrates are typically not used as module substrates, especially for relatively large flip-chips, because of the substantial strain on the solder balls (which interconnect the flip-chip and the module substrate as discussed below) due to CTE mismatch.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, the problems associated with the use of organic substrates due to CTE mismatch are exacerbated by any excessive heat buildup in the organic substrate due to heat dissipation performance limitations of the heat sink as discussed above. Excessive heat buildup acts to magnify the strain on the solder balls due to CTE mismatch between the organic substrate and the flip-chip.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Controlled collapse chip connection (C4) solder joints (also referred to as “solder bumps”) are typically used to electrically connect the terminals or pads on the base of the flip-chip with corresponding terminals or pads on the module substrate. C4 solder joints are disposed on the base of the flip-chip in an array of minute solder balls (e.g., on the order of 100 μm diameter and 200 μm pitch). The solder balls, which are typically lead (Pb)-containing solder, are reflowed to join (i.e., electrically and mechanically) the terminals or pads on the base of the flip-chip with corresponding terminals or pads on the module substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Typically, a non-conductive polymer underfill is disposed in the space between the base of the flip-chip and the module substrate and encapsulates the C4 solder joints. The C4 solder joints are embedded in this polymeric underfill and are thus protected from corrosion caused by corrosion inducing components such as moisture and carbon dioxide in the air. In addition, the polymeric underfill provides mechanical rigidity and electrical isolation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of a conventional multi-chip module assembly <b>100</b> that utilizes C4 solder joints. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged view of the C4 solder joints of the conventional multi-chip module assembly <b>100</b>. In many computer and other electronic circuit structures, an electronic module is electrically connected to a printed circuit board (PCB). For example, the conventional multi-chip module assembly <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> includes capped module <b>105</b> electrically connected to a PCB <b>110</b>. Generally, in connecting an electronic module to a PCB, a plurality of individual electrical contacts on the base of the electronic module must be connected to a plurality of corresponding individual electrical contacts on the PCB. Various technologies well known in the art are used to electrically connect the set of contacts on the PCB and the electronic module contacts. These technologies include land grid array (LGA), ball grid array (BGA), column grid array (CGA), pin grid array (PGA), and the like. In the illustrative example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a LGA <b>115</b> electrically connects PCB <b>110</b> to a module substrate <b>120</b>. LGA <b>115</b> may comprise, for example, conductive elements <b>116</b>, such as fuzz buttons, retained in a non-conductive interposer <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some cases, the module includes a cap (i.e., a capped module) which seals the electronic component(s) within the module. The module <b>105</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a capped module. In other cases, the module does not include a cap (i.e., a bare die module). In the case of a capped module, a heat sink is typically attached with a thermal interface between a bottom surface of the heat sink and a top surface of the cap, and another thermal interface between a bottom surface of the cap and a top surface of the electronic component(s). For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a heat sink <b>150</b> is attached with a thermal interface <b>155</b> between a bottom surface of heat sink <b>150</b> and a top surface of a cap <b>160</b>, and another thermal interface <b>165</b> between a bottom surface of cap <b>160</b> and a top surface of each flip-chip <b>170</b>. In addition, a heat spreader (not shown) may be attached to the top surface of each flip-chip <b>170</b> to expand the surface area of thermal interface <b>165</b> relative to the surface area of the flip-chip <b>170</b>. The heat spreader, which is typically made of a highly thermally conductive material such as SiC, is typically adhered to the top surface of the flip-chip <b>170</b> with a thermally-conductive adhesive. Typically, a sealant <b>166</b> (e.g., a silicone adhesive such as Sylgard 577) is applied between cap <b>160</b> and module substrate <b>120</b> to seal the chip cavity <b>167</b>. In the case of a bare die module, a heat sink is typically attached with a thermal interface between a bottom surface of the heat sink and a top surface of the electronic component(s). Heat sinks are attached to modules using a variety of attachment mechanisms, such as adhesives, clips, clamps, screws, bolts, barbed push-pins, load posts, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Capped module <b>105</b> includes a module substrate <b>120</b>, a plurality of flip-chips <b>170</b>, LGA <b>115</b>, and cap <b>160</b>. In addition, capped module <b>105</b> includes C4 solder joints <b>175</b> electrically connecting each flip-chip <b>170</b> to module substrate <b>120</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, capped module <b>110</b> also includes a non-conductive polymer underfill <b>180</b> which is disposed in the space between the base of each flip-chip <b>170</b> and module substrate <b>120</b> and encapsulates the C4 solder joints <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Module substrate <b>120</b> is typically a ceramic carrier, glass-ceramic substrate, or other conductor-carrying substrate that can withstand higher temperatures. As discussed above, organic substrates are typically not used as module substrates because of the inability of organic substrates to withstand higher temperatures and because of the typically large CTE mismatch between organic substrates and flip-chips. Moreover, the problems associated with the use of organic substrates due to CTE mismatch are exacerbated by any excessive heat buildup. This is disadvantageous because organic substrates are typically much less costly than ceramic carriers, glass-ceramic substrates, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, a need exists for an enhanced method and apparatus for removing heat from an electronic component mounted on an organic substrate.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">1. Overview</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with the preferred embodiments of the present invention, a chip module heat transfer apparatus includes one or more chips electronically connected to a module substrate by controlled collapse chip connection (C4) solder joints. The module substrate, which is preferably an FR-4 laminate or other organic substrate, has cut-out channels formed thereon. A permanent solder mask is laminated over the cut-out channels to form thermal dissipation channels, which are in fluid communication with input and output ports. The C4 solder joints include solder balls that electronically connect terminals on the chips to corresponding attach pads on the module substrate that are exposed through the permanent solder mask. The thermal dissipation channels extend along rows of attach pads. A cooling fluid, such as an inert perfluorocarbon fluid, flows through the thermal dissipation channels to remove heat and to mitigate strain on the solder balls due to coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between the chips and the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">2. Detailed Description</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is depicted, in a sectional view, a multi-chip module assembly <b>300</b> that utilizes a module substrate having integral thermal dissipation channels according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention. The multi-chip module assembly <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is similar to the conventional multi-chip module assembly <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but the module substrate <b>120</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is replaced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> with a module substrate <b>320</b> having integral thermal dissipation channels according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, module substrate <b>320</b> includes a plurality of upper thermal dissipation channels <b>322</b> and a plurality of lower thermal dissipation channels <b>324</b>. Upper thermal dissipation channels <b>322</b> and lower thermal dissipation channels <b>324</b> are microfluidic channels etched into module substrate <b>320</b> and define a portion of one or more recirculation loops used to circulate coolant through the module substrate. This additional cooling in the module substrate reduces the limits placed on heat sink external resistance values during processing and hence increases the efficiency of the processors. In addition, this additional cooling in the module substrate mitigates strain on the solder balls due to coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between the processor chips and the module substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Upper thermal dissipation channels <b>322</b> remove heat from the upper side of module substrate <b>320</b> which, as discussed below, includes C4 attach pads for electrically connecting the module substrate to a plurality of chips via C4 solder joints. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, one upper thermal dissipation channel <b>322</b> extends along each row of C4 attach pads. This configuration of the upper thermal dissipation channels is exemplary. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the methods and apparatus of the present invention can also be applied to other configurations of the upper thermal dissipation channels. For example, the upper thermal dissipation channels may be configured to extend along selected rows of C4 attach pads, or may be configured to each extend along a plurality of rows of C4 attach pads, or may be configured to each extend between adjacent rows of C4 attach pads.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Lower thermal dissipation channels <b>324</b> remove heat from the lower side of module substrate <b>320</b> which, as discussed below, includes LGA attach pads for electrically connecting the module substrate to a PCB via an array of conductive elements such as fuzz buttons. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, one lower thermal dissipation channel <b>324</b> extends along each row of LGA attach pads. This configuration of the lower thermal dissipation channels is exemplary. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the methods and apparatus of the present invention can also be applied to other configurations of the lower thermal dissipation channels. For example, the lower thermal dissipation channels may be configured to extend along selected rows of LGA attach pads, or may be configured to each extend along a plurality of rows of LGA attach pads, or may be configured to each extend between adjacent rows of LGA attach pads. Likewise, the upper or lower thermal dissipation channels may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Moreover, the multi-chip module assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is exemplary. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the methods and apparatus of the present invention can also apply to configurations differing from the multi-chip module assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to other types of chip modules, and generally to other conductor-carrying substrates. For example, in lieu of being applied to a module substrate having C4 attach pads and LGA attach pads, such as module substrate <b>320</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the methods and apparatus of the present invention can also be applied to an organic substrate having pin thru hole (PTH) technology connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Some of the elements of multi-chip module assembly <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are identical to those discussed above with respect to the conventional multi-chip module assembly <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Those identical elements are discussed briefly again below, along with a detailed discussion of elements unique to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, module substrate <b>320</b> is an organic substrate, such as polyimide or other polymer(s), FR-4 (i.e., composite laminate of a resin epoxy reinforced with a woven fiberglass mat), and the like. As discussed above in the Background Art section, organic substrates are typically much less costly than ceramic carriers and glass-ceramic substrates but organic substrates are generally not used as module substrates because of the inability of organic substrates to withstand higher temperatures and because of the typically large coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between organic substrates and flip-chips. Typically, ceramic carriers have a CTE (e.g., CTE=2-7 ppm/° C.) much closer to the CTE of flip-chips (e.g., CTE=2-3 ppm/° C.) as compared to the CTE of organic substrates (CTE=12-20 ppm/° C.). In general, the larger the base area of the flip-chip the more problematic the CTE mismatch becomes. Hence, organic substrates are typically not used as module substrates, especially for relatively large flip-chips, because of the substantial strain on the C4 solder joints due to CTE mismatch. The present invention solves these problems by flowing a cooling fluid, such as an inert perfluorocarbon fluid, through thermal dissipation channels integrally formed in the organic substrate to remove heat and mitigate strain induced by the CTE mismatch.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Multi-chip module assembly <b>300</b> includes a capped module <b>305</b> electrically connected to a PCB <b>110</b>. Generally, as mentioned earlier, in connecting an electronic module to a PCB, a plurality of individual electrical contacts on the base of the electronic module must be connected to a plurality of corresponding individual electrical contacts on the PCB. Various technologies well known in the art are used to electrically connect the set of contacts on the PCB and the electronic module contacts. These technologies include land grid array (LGA), ball grid array (BGA), column grid array (CGA), pin grid array (PGA), and the like. In the illustrative example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a LGA <b>115</b> electrically connects PCB <b>110</b> to a module substrate <b>320</b>. LGA <b>115</b> may comprise, for example, conductive elements <b>116</b>, such as fuzz buttons, retained in a non-conductive interposer <b>117</b>. One skilled in the art will appreciate, however, that any of the various other technologies may be used in lieu of, or in addition to, such LGA technology.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, module <b>305</b> includes a cap <b>160</b> (i.e., module <b>305</b> is a “capped module”). In the case of a capped module, a heat sink is typically attached with a thermal interface between a bottom surface of the heat sink and a top surface of the cap, and another thermal interface between a bottom surface of the cap and a top surface of the electronic component(s). For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a heat sink <b>150</b> is attached with a thermal interface <b>155</b> between a bottom surface of heat sink <b>150</b> and a top surface of a cap <b>160</b>, and another thermal interface <b>165</b> between a bottom surface of cap <b>160</b> and a top surface of each flip-chip <b>170</b>. In addition, a heat spreader (not shown) may be attached to the top surface of each flip-chip <b>170</b> to expand the surface area of thermal interface <b>165</b> relative to the surface area of the flip-chip <b>170</b>. The heat spreader, which is typically made of a highly thermally conductive material such as SiC, is typically adhered to the top surface of the flip-chip <b>170</b> with a thermally-conductive adhesive. Typically, a sealant <b>166</b> (e.g., a silicone adhesive such as Sylgard 577) is applied between cap <b>160</b> and module substrate <b>320</b> to seal the chip cavity <b>167</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Heat sink <b>150</b> is attached to module <b>305</b> using a thermally-conductive adhesive to form thermal interface <b>155</b>. Although not shown for the sake of clarity, heat sink <b>150</b> is also attached to module <b>305</b> through a conventional LGA mounting mechanism. In this regard, heat sink <b>150</b> includes a plurality of bolts or load posts (not shown) that project from the bottom surface of heat sink <b>150</b>. Typically, one bolt or load post is positioned on each side of the generally square or rectangular footprint of module cavity <b>167</b>. The bolts or load posts pass through correspondingly positioned throughholes (not shown) in cap <b>160</b>, PCB <b>110</b>, and an insulated steel backup plate (not shown). As is well known in the art, the bolts or load posts cooperate with one or more compression springs (not shown) to urge assembly <b>300</b> together with force sufficient to make the electrical connections of LGA <b>115</b>. Alternatively, those skilled in the art will recognize that other attachment mechanisms may be used. Generally, heat sinks, PCBs and the like, are attached to modules using a variety of attachment mechanisms, such as adhesives, clips, clamps, screws, bolts, barbed push-pins, load posts, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As mentioned above, the module may alternatively be a “bare die module” that does not include a cap. In this “bare die module” alternative case, a heat sink is attached with a thermal interface between a bottom surface of the heat sink and a top surface of each flip-chip. In addition, a heat spreader may be attached to the top surface of each flip-chip to expand the surface area of the thermal interface relative to the surface area of the flip-chip. In the “bare die module” alternative case, a non-conductive spacer frame extends between a bottom surface of the heat sink and the top surface of the PCB. Rather than being defined by surfaces of the cap, the module cavity in this alternative case would be defined by surfaces of the non-conductive spacer frame and the heat sink. Also, in the “bare die module” alternative case a butyl rubber gasket would be seated along the periphery of the non-conductive spacer frame to seal the electronic component(s) within the module cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Capped module <b>305</b> includes module substrate <b>320</b>, a plurality of flip-chips <b>170</b>, LGA <b>115</b>, and cap <b>160</b>. In addition, capped module <b>305</b> includes C4 solder joints <b>175</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) electrically connecting each flip-chip <b>170</b> to module substrate <b>320</b>. Capped module <b>305</b> also includes a non-conductive polymer underfill <b>180</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) which is disposed in the space between the base of each flip-chip <b>170</b> and a cover layer <b>410</b>, discussed below, which is provided on an upper surface of substrate <b>320</b>. The non-conductive polymer <b>180</b> encapsulates the C4 solder joints <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged sectional view of module substrate <b>320</b> of the multi-chip module assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, along one of upper thermal dissipation channels <b>322</b> and one of lower thermal dissipation channels <b>324</b>. The upper thermal dissipation channel <b>322</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is integrally formed in the upper end of module substrate <b>320</b> and extends along a row of C4 attach pads <b>406</b>,<b>408</b>. A cover layer <b>410</b> is provided on the top surface of module substrate <b>320</b> and encloses cut out channels on the top surface of module substrate <b>320</b> to form upper thermal dissipation channels <b>322</b>. Preferably, cover layer <b>410</b> is a permanent solder mask (e.g., epoxy, acrylate, and the like) laminated to the top surface of module substrate <b>320</b>. The C4 attach pads <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> are exposed through cover layer <b>410</b>, but cover layer <b>410</b> is retained around the periphery of each C4 attach pad <b>406</b>,<b>408</b> so that a sealed relationship is maintained between C4 attach pads <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> and cover layer <b>410</b>. Hence, the upper surface of upper thermal dissipation channel <b>322</b> is defined by the sealed combination of C4 attach pads <b>406</b>,<b>408</b> and cover layer <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Similarly, the lower thermal dissipation channel <b>324</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is integrally formed in the lower end of module substrate <b>320</b> and extends along a row of LGA attach pads <b>412</b>. As is conventional, conductive vias <b>413</b> extend through module substrate <b>320</b> to electrically connect C4 attach pads <b>408</b> to LGA attach pads <b>412</b>. A cover layer <b>414</b> is provided on the bottom surface of module substrate <b>320</b> and encloses cut out channels on the bottom surface of module substrate <b>320</b> to form lower thermal dissipation channels <b>324</b>. Preferably, cover layer <b>414</b> is a permanent solder mask (e.g., epoxy, acrylate, and the like) laminated to the bottom surface of module substrate <b>320</b>. The LGA attach pads <b>412</b> are exposed through cover layer <b>414</b>, but cover layer <b>414</b> is retained around the periphery of each LGA attach pad <b>412</b> so that a sealed relationship is maintained between LGA attach pads <b>412</b> and cover layer <b>414</b>. Hence, the lower surface of lower thermal dissipation channel <b>324</b> is defined by the sealed combination of LGA attach pads <b>412</b> and cover layer <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the methods and apparatus of the present invention can also be applied to configurations of the upper and lower thermal dissipation channels other than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. For example, the upper and/or lower thermal dissipation channels may be routed differently than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (e.g., the upper thermal dissipation channels may be routed to extend perpendicular to the lower thermal dissipation channels). Also, additional thermal dissipation channels may be provided (e.g., one or more intermediate thermal dissipation channels may be provided between the upper and lower thermal dissipation channels), and/or either the upper or lower thermal dissipation channels may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a top view of a module substrate <b>502</b> having integral thermal dissipation channels <b>504</b> (shown in dotted lines) in fluid communication with a thermal reservoir <b>506</b> according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention. Module substrate <b>502</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> prior to electrically connecting a flip-chip thereto. The flip-chip is to be connected to an array of C4 solder joints <b>508</b> exposed though a cover layer <b>510</b> provided on the top surface of module substrate <b>502</b>. The thermal dissipation channels <b>504</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> correspond to upper thermal dissipation channels <b>322</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The thermal dissipation channels <b>504</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as dotted lines because they are hidden under cover layer <b>510</b>. Each thermal dissipation channel <b>504</b> extends along a row of C4 attach pads <b>508</b> and intersect peripheral channels <b>512</b>. Thermal dissipation channels <b>504</b> are in fluid communication with an input port <b>514</b> and an output port <b>516</b> via peripheral channels <b>512</b>. A sealant <b>518</b> is provided on the end faces of module substrate <b>502</b> to cap thermal dissipation channels <b>504</b> and peripheral channels <b>512</b>. The sealant may be, for example, epoxy, silicone, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A cooling fluid is preferably pumped from thermal reservoir <b>506</b> through a supply conduit <b>520</b> to input port <b>514</b> of module substrate <b>502</b>, where the cooling fluid picks up heat as it travels through thermal dissipation channels <b>504</b>. From the perspective shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the cooling fluid flows through thermal dissipation channels <b>504</b> right to left. Then, the cooling fluid is exhausted from outlet port <b>516</b> of module substrate <b>502</b> through an exhaust conduit <b>522</b> and returns to thermal reservoir <b>506</b>, where the cooling fluid is cooled for recirculation. To provide additional cooling, reservoir <b>506</b> may be thermally attached to a heat sink, e.g., attached to the underside of heat sink <b>150</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or an additional heat sink, or connected to a heat pipe, waterfall, or other conventional cooling mechanism. The cooling fluid may be any suitable coolant, for example, an inert perfluorocarbon fluid, such as 3M Fluorinert commercially available from 3M Company, St. Paul, Minn. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a pump is preferably provided to force the cooling fluid through the recirculation loop. Alternatively, the cooling fluid may move passively through the recirculation loop, e.g., by convection.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Supply conduit <b>520</b> and exhaust conduit <b>522</b> are respectively attached to input port <b>514</b> and outlet port <b>516</b> using any suitable conventional fastening technique, such as by inserting and sealing tubular fittings (not shown) into the ends of peripheral channels <b>512</b> at input port <b>514</b> and outlet port <b>516</b>, and then mating supply conduit <b>520</b> and exhaust conduit <b>522</b> over the tubular fittings to provide a tight seal. Supply conduit <b>520</b> and exhaust conduit <b>522</b> may be rubber, metal or some other suitable material that is compatible with the coolant.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In general, the rate of heat transfer can be controlled by using various thermal transport media in the internal structure of the module substrate. For example, the rate of heat transfer can be controlled by varying the composition and/or the flow rate of the cooling fluid. Also, the rate of heat transfer is a function of the configuration of the thermal dissipation channels within the module substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, module <b>502</b> may include intermediate and/or lower thermal dissipation channels. For example, module <b>502</b> may include lower thermal dissipation channels that correspond to lower thermal dissipation channels shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The direction of flow of the cooling fluid in these additional channels may be concurrent, opposite and/or perpendicular to the direction of flow of the cooling liquid in thermal dissipation channels <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a partial, sectional view of an organic substrate <b>600</b> having cut-out channels formed on the top and bottom surfaces thereof, prior to laminating a permanent solder mask over the top and bottom surfaces, according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a partial view in that it shows only a relatively small area of organic substrate <b>600</b> containing cut-out channels in the vicinity of a single pin-through-hole (PTH) technology connector. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that substrate <b>600</b> may contain many such connectors, and that the cut-out channels may extend from connector to connector. Likewise, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the methods and apparatus of the present invention can also be applied to substrates that contain other types of connectors, such as C4 attach pads, and as well to substrates that are not organic, such as ceramic carriers, glass-ceramic substrates, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Organic substrate <b>600</b> preferably includes an FR-4 laminate <b>602</b> sandwiched between a pair of Cu foil layers <b>604</b> and a pair of electrolytic Cu layers <b>606</b>. Upper cut-out channels <b>612</b> are formed on the top surface of substrate <b>600</b> by etching away selective portions of electrolytic Cu layer <b>606</b> and Cu foil layer <b>604</b>. Lower cut-out channels <b>614</b> are formed on the bottom surface of substrate <b>600</b> by etching away selective portions of electrolytic Cu layer <b>606</b> and Cu foil layer <b>604</b>. Upper cut-out channels <b>612</b> and lower cut-out channels <b>614</b> are formed using conventional photolithographic processes, such as photomask exposure and the like. Preferably, upper cut-out channels <b>612</b> and lower cut-out channels <b>614</b> are positioned to substantially surround a connector, such as the PTH technology connector <b>613</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. This arrangement of the cut-out channels efficiently removes heat from the connector when a coolant flows through the channels. Those skilled in the art will appreciate, however, that the methods and apparatus of the present invention can also be applied to other arrangements of the cut-out channels.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition to, or in lieu of, etching away selective portions of electrolytic Cu layer <b>606</b> and Cu foil layer <b>604</b>, selective portions of non-conductive layers (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of substrate <b>600</b> may be etched away to form the upper cut-out channels <b>612</b> and/or lower cut-out channels <b>614</b>. For example, the upper cut-out channels <b>612</b> and/or the lower cut-out channels <b>614</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may be extended from connector <b>613</b> to an adjacent connector (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) by etching away selective portions of non-conductive layers (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that lie between those two connectors. Likewise, the upper cut-out channel and/or the lower cut-out channel may be formed by etching away selective portions of non-conductive layers of the substrate, e.g., by etching away selective portions of non-conductive layers of the substrate between contacts or in moat-like fashion around the periphery of an array of connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a sectional view similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> but showing a permanent solder mask <b>702</b>,<b>704</b> laminated to the top and bottom surfaces of organic substrate <b>600</b> to enclose the cut-out channels <b>612</b>,<b>614</b> and thereby form thermal dissipation channels <b>712</b>, <b>714</b> according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention. Permanent solder masks <b>702</b>, <b>704</b> may be epoxy, acrylate, or other suitable material, that is laminated to electrolytic Cu layer <b>606</b> (and any other layers of substrate <b>600</b> that are co-planar with electrolytic Cu layer <b>606</b>) by, for example, hot roll lamination, vacuum lamination, dip coating, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> but showing selective portions of the permanent solder mask <b>702</b>,<b>704</b> removed to expose PTH technology connector <b>613</b> according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention. Preferably, these selective portions of permanent solder mask <b>702</b>,<b>704</b> are removed by conventional lithographic techniques, such as photomask exposure and the like. Connector <b>613</b> is exposed through permanent solder masks <b>702</b>,<b>704</b>, but permanent solder masks <b>702</b>,<b>704</b> are retained in contact with electrolytic Cu layers <b>606</b> so that a sealed relationship is maintained between electrolytic Cu layers <b>606</b> and permanent solder masks <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">One skilled in the art will appreciate that many variations are possible within the scope of the present invention. For example, the methods and apparatus of the present invention can also apply to configurations differing from the multi-chip module assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as well as to other types of chip modules and other conductor-carrying substrates. Thus, while the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that these and other changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
