<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Apparatus, systems, and methods to control the frequency of a plurality of gyroscopes are disclosed. The gyroscopes are configured such that each individual gyroscope operates independently of one another and at the same pre-determined frequency. To accomplish this, the natural frequency of each gyroscope is determined, and a reference signal is added to the output signal of its respective gyroscope such that the sum of the natural frequency and the reference signal frequency equals the pre-determined frequency. Thus, each individual gyroscope, though it may include its own individual natural frequency, operates autonomously at the pre-determined frequency.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to improvements in gyroscopes, and more particularly to, hemispherical resonator gyroscopes (HRGs).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A hemispherical resonator gyroscope (HRG) is a vibratory sensor that includes a hemispherical resonator. Examples of HRGs can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,625,067, 3,656,354, 3,678,762, 3,719,074, 4,157,041, 4,951,508, 5,763,780, 5,801,310, 5,892,152, 5,902,930, 5,983,719, 6,065,340, 6,079,270, 6,158,282, 6,565,395, 6,619,121, and 6,883,361, each of which is hereby incorporated, in its entirety, by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A main component of each HRG is a quartz high Q resonator. This resonator is driven into oscillation by application of electrostatic forcers that are synchronized to the individual natural frequency of the resonator. Since each individual resonator includes its own individual natural frequency, the frequency is often referred to as “4.xx kHz”, which is approximately 4.1 kHz for a 30 millimeter diameter resonator. For example, a first resonator may include a natural frequency of 4.07 kHz, while a second resonator includes a natural frequency of 4.13 kHz.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The electrostatic forcers cause the resonator to flex in an elliptical mode of oscillation. A set of readout electrodes arranged around the resonator are used to sense the amplitude, location, and motion of the elliptical mode standing wave pattern (the flex wave) resulting from such oscillation. If the HRG is rotated, the angle of rotation can be determined from processing a signal output by amplifiers attached to the readout electrodes (i.e., by observing changes in the position of the flex wave or actions necessary to prevent changes in the position of the flex wave).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an HRG <b>100</b> partitioned into four functional segments: a sensor segment <b>110</b>, a control drive segment <b>120</b>, a readout segment <b>130</b>, and a signal processing segment <b>140</b>. Sensor segment <b>110</b> includes a hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b>, a plurality of drive electrodes <b>1120</b>, and a plurality of readout electrodes <b>1130</b>. The plurality of drive electrodes <b>1120</b> includes a set of amplitude control drive electrodes <b>1122</b>, a set of quadrature control drive electrodes <b>1124</b>, and a set of rate control drive electrodes <b>1126</b>. The plurality of readout electrodes <b>1130</b> includes a set of X-axis readout electrodes <b>1132</b>, and a set of Y-axis readout electrodes <b>1134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Control drive segment <b>120</b> is in communication with sensor segment <b>110</b> to provide an amplitude control drive signal <b>1210</b> to the set of amplitude control drive electrodes <b>1122</b>, a quadrature control drive signal <b>1220</b> to the set of quadrature control drive electrodes <b>1124</b>, and a rate control drive signal <b>1230</b> to the set of rate control drive electrodes <b>1126</b>. Sensor segment <b>110</b> is also in communication readout segment <b>130</b> and provides an X readout signal <b>1310</b> from X readout electrodes <b>1132</b>, and a Y readout signal <b>1320</b> from Y readout electrodes <b>1134</b> to readout segment <b>130</b>. Readout segment <b>130</b> is in communication with signal processing segment <b>140</b> to provide signal processing segment <b>140</b> with X readout signal <b>1310</b> and Y readout signal <b>1320</b>. X readout signal <b>1310</b> is derived from signals provided by X readout electrodes <b>1132</b>, and Y readout signal <b>1320</b> is derived from signals provided by Y readout electrodes <b>1134</b>. X readout signal <b>1310</b> and Y readout signal <b>1320</b> are utilized by processing segment <b>140</b> to provide an inertial angle output signal <b>150</b>. X readout signal <b>1310</b> and Y readout signal <b>1320</b> are also used in processing segment <b>140</b> to provide amplitude drive signal <b>1210</b>, quadrature control drive signal <b>1220</b>, and rate control drive signal <b>1230</b> to control drive unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Control of HRG <b>100</b>, and detection of any rotation of HRG <b>100</b> are provided by X readout signal <b>1310</b> and Y readout signal <b>1320</b>. Each electrode of X readout electrodes <b>1132</b> and Y readout electrodes <b>1134</b> provides an electrode readout signal (S<sub>ER</sub>) to readout segment <b>130</b>. S<sub>ER </sub>is related to a bias voltage (V<sub>b</sub>) and to the amplitude (A) of the flex wave, where the relationship can be described using equation (E1) below. In equation (E1), V<sub>b </sub>is the bias voltage applied to hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b> (which in some instances is metal clad so that its surface is electrically conductive), ω<sub>R </sub>(≈4.1 kHz) is the natural frequency of hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b> of sensor segment <b>110</b>, A is the amplitude of the flex wave over X readout electrodes <b>1132</b> and Y readout electrodes <b>1134</b>, φ is a phase offset, and K<sub>r </sub>is a proportionality constant.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>S</i><sub>ER</sub><i>=K</i><sub>r</sub><i>*V</i><sub>b</sub>[1−<i>A</i>*Cos(ω<sub>R</sub><i>t+</i>φ)]  (E1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To operate HRG <b>100</b>, three types of control forces are applied to hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b>. These forces correspond to amplitude drive signal <b>1210</b>, quadrature control drive signal <b>1220</b>, and rate control drive signal <b>1230</b> provided by control drive segment <b>120</b>. Amplitude drive signal <b>1210</b> is used to provide amplitude control of the flex wave and to keep hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b> oscillating at or near its natural (resonant) frequency. Quadrature control drive signal <b>1220</b> is used to suppress mass and stiffness variations around hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b>, and rate control drive signal <b>1230</b> is used to position the flex wave.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The force applied to hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b> by each of the plurality of drive electrodes <b>1120</b> is proportional to a direct current (DC) bias voltage V<sub>b </sub>maintained on hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b>. In the case of rate control drive signal <b>1230</b> (represented in equation (E2) as K<sub>d</sub>), the maximum rate that can be applied to the position of the flex wave is a function of the amplitude of the flex wave as shown by equation (E2):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>S</i><sub>RCD</sub><i>=K</i><sub>d</sub><i>*V</i><sub>b</sub><i>*A*</i>Sin(ω<sub>R</sub><i>t+</i>φ)]  (E2).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
As such, increasing the bias voltage V<sub>b </sub>will increase the magnitude of the electrostatic force applied to hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b> by each of the plurality of drive electrodes <b>1120</b> (i.e., by amplitude drive signal <b>1210</b>, quadrature control drive signal <b>1220</b>, and/or rate control drive signal <b>1230</b>).
</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b> is a high Q oscillator, the Q being, in some instances, approximately 10*10<sup>6</sup>. To control the flex wave of the oscillating hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b>, all forces applied via the plurality drive electrodes <b>1120</b> must be precisely synchronized and phase locked to the natural frequency (ω<sub>R</sub>) of hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b>. In current HRG <b>100</b> devices, during normal operation the various signals all have a frequency at least approximately equal to the natural frequency ω<sub>R </sub>of hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b>. Phase locking is achieved through the use of a phase locked loop <b>1410</b> provided by signal processing segment <b>140</b>. Phase locked loop <b>1410</b> tracks the natural frequency ω<sub>R </sub>of hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b> via X readout signal <b>1310</b> and Y readout signal <b>1320</b> to provide a reference signal for amplitude control loop <b>1420</b>, quadrature control loop <b>1430</b>, and rate control loop <b>1440</b> to ensure amplitude drive signal <b>1210</b>, quadrature control drive signal <b>1220</b>, and rate control drive signal <b>1230</b>, respectively, have the same frequency as hemispherical resonator <b>1110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of a system <b>200</b> including two HRG devices (e.g., HRG <b>210</b> and HRG <b>260</b>). Here, HRG <b>210</b> includes it own natural frequency (ω<sub>R1</sub>) (e.g., 4.1 kHz). As such, any signal (e.g., readout signal <b>215</b>) output by HRG <b>210</b> would include frequency ω<sub>R1</sub>. Readout signal <b>215</b> is filtered by a bandpass filter <b>220</b> and transmitted to data processor <b>230</b>. Any signal representing an angle (Δθ<sub>1</sub>) output by HRG <b>210</b> would include frequency ω<sub>R1</sub>. Moreover, any signal (e.g., a local oscillator signal) received by HRG <b>210</b> would likewise include frequency ω<sub>R1 </sub>since the frequency of each signal in HRG <b>210</b> is controlled by phase locked loop <b>240</b>. In other words, the frequency (ω<sub>LO1</sub>) of the local oscillator signal is the same as the natural frequency (ω<sub>R1</sub>) of HRG <b>210</b> (i.e., ω<sub>LO1=ω</sub><sub>R1</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The operation of HRG <b>260</b> is similar to the operation of HRG <b>210</b>. However, due to the nature of HRGs, the natural frequency (ω<sub>R2</sub>) of HRG <b>260</b> is different from (ω<sub>R1</sub>). For example, ω<sub>R2 </sub>may be 4.03 kHz. In other words, ω<sub>LO1</sub>=ω<sub>R1 </sub>and ω<sub>LO2</sub>=ω<sub>R2</sub>, wherein ω<sub>LO1 </sub>and ω<sub>R1 </sub>include a different frequency from ω<sub>LO2 </sub>and ω<sub>R2 </sub>such that the signals representing angles Δθ<sub>1 </sub>and Δθ<sub>2 </sub>have different frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, previous systems are complex from a hardware, firmware, and software point of view since each HRG has its own individual natural frequency. Since each HRG has its own individual natural frequency, synchronizing the output signals (e.g., ω<sub>R1 </sub>=4.11 KHz and ω<sub>R2 =</sub>4.07 KHz) from a plurality of HRG devices requires electronics incorporating a set of complex algorithms and computations. Often, the complex algorithms and computations omit important components from one or more signals from the HRG devices since estimating and/or rounding occurs in the algorithms and computations. As such, the resulting signals are not as accurate as they otherwise could be. Notably, these systems become even more complex when each HRG also includes 4.07 KHz) from a plurality of HRG devices requires electronics incorporating a set of complex algorithms and computations. Often, the complex algorithms and computations omit important components from one or more signals from the HRG devices since estimating and/or rounding occurs in the algorithms and computations. As such, the resulting signals are not as accurate as they otherwise could be. Notably, these systems become even more complex when each HRG also includes its own accelerometer (not shown) to measure the speed of change in direction for its associated HRG. Thus, there is a need for systems and methods to synchronize output signals from a plurality of HRG devices in a less complex and more accurate manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention accomplishes the above goal for two or more gyroscopes in communication with one another. By its nature, each gyroscope outputs a signal at its own individual natural frequency (ω<sub>R</sub>). For a hemispherical resonator gyroscope (HRG), the natural frequency is about 4.1 kHz for a 30 millimeter resonator. However, the techniques of the present invention are equally applicable to resonate bodies having other natural frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each HRG also includes an associated phase locked loop in communication with the HRG. A reference signal including a reference frequency (ω<sub>LO</sub>) from each phase locked loop is added to the output signal of its associated HRG by a signal mixer to form an intermediate frequency IF signal including a (ω<sub>LO</sub>−ω<sub>R</sub>) component and a (ω<sub>LO</sub>+ω<sub>R</sub>) component.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Each HRG's natural frequency is measured and the frequency ω<sub>LO </sub>is determined by adding ω<sub>R </sub>to a pre-determined operating frequency. In one exemplary embodiment, the pre-determined operating frequency is 8.0 kilohertz (kHz). Thus, for example, if the natural frequency of an HRG is 4.06 kHz and the pre-determined operating frequency is 8.0 kHz, ω<sub>LO </sub>will be 12.06 kHz (i.e., 4.06 kHz+8.0 kHz).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The (ω<sub>LO</sub>+ω<sub>R</sub>) component is filtered by a bandpass filter such that the IF signal substantially only includes the (ω<sub>LO</sub>−ω<sub>R</sub>) component, or the pre-determined operating frequency. Each IF signal is transmitted to a respective inertial data processor, from which each output from the inertial data processors is compared to one another to determine a direction for the system.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus, the present invention provides a directional system utilizing two or more self-contained gyroscopes that is more accurate and cheaper to manufacture and maintain than previous systems. Notably, embodiments of the directional system include three HRG devices such that an x-coordinate, a y-coordinate, and z-coordinate can be determined.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Reference will now be made to various exemplary embodiments of the invention, which are illustrated in the accompanying figures. While the invention is described with reference to these exemplary embodiments, these embodiments do not limit the invention. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention is capable of being practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the important aspects of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods including a plurality of self-contained gyroscopes. Since each gyroscope is self-contained, if a gyroscope within the system breaks and/or malfunctions, the gyroscope can be replaced without needing to re-calibrate and/or adjust any other components of the system. Thus, the invention allows a system to be manufactured and/or repaired cheaper than current systems incorporating a plurality of gyroscopes.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of a gyroscope <b>300</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Gyroscope <b>300</b> may be any hardware and/or software suitably configured to produce a signal to indicate a direction gyroscope <b>300</b> is oriented. As such, gyroscope <b>300</b> may be any gyroscope known in the art or developed in the future. In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the invention, gyroscope <b>300</b> is a hemispherical resonator gyroscope (HRG) manufactured by Northrop Grumman Corporation of Los Angeles, Calif. As such, gyroscope <b>300</b> may be similar to HRG <b>100</b> discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, gyroscope <b>300</b> includes a readout section <b>330</b>, similar to readout section <b>130</b> discussed above, to produce a readout signal <b>315</b> similar to X readout signal <b>1310</b> and/or Y readout signal <b>1320</b> discussed above. Readout signal <b>315</b> includes a natural frequency (ω<sub>R</sub>) of gyroscope <b>300</b>. As discussed above, ω<sub>R </sub>is the individual operating frequency of gyroscope <b>300</b> and includes a frequency of approximately 4.1 kilohertz (kHz). However, gyroscopes with other natural operating frequencies are contemplated by the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Readout section <b>330</b> is in communication with a mixer <b>318</b>, wherein readout section <b>330</b> is also configured to transmit readout signal <b>315</b> to mixer <b>318</b>. Mixer <b>318</b> may be any hardware and/or software suitably configured to combine two or more signals. As such, mixer <b>318</b> may be any mixer known in the art or developed in the future. In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the invention, mixer <b>318</b> is configured to combine readout signal <b>315</b> with a reference signal with a pre-determined reference frequency (ω<sub>LO</sub>) to form an intermediate frequency (IF) signal having a (ω<sub>LO</sub>−ω<sub>R</sub>) component and a (ω<sub>LO</sub>+ω<sub>R</sub>) component. The reference signal is received from a phase locked loop (discussed below) and ω<sub>LO </sub>is determined by adding ω<sup>R </sup>to a desired operating frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, if the desired operating frequency is 8.0 kHz and ω<sub>R </sub>is 4.15 kHz, ω<sub>LO </sub>is 12.15 kHz (i.e., 8.0 kHz+4.15 kHz). Thus, in this example, when readout signal <b>315</b> is combined with the reference signal, the IF signal includes a frequency (ω<sub>IF1</sub>) having a 16.3 kHz component (ω<sub>LO</sub>+ω<sub>R</sub>) and an 8.0 kHz component (ω<sub>LO</sub>−ω<sub>R</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In accordance with one embodiment, mixer <b>318</b> is in communication with a bandpass filter <b>322</b>, wherein bandpass filter <b>322</b> may be any hardware and/or software suitably configured to allow components of a signal having a pre-determined frequency to pass through. As such, bandpass filter <b>322</b> may be any bandpass filter known in the art or developed in the future. In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the invention, bandpass filter <b>322</b> is configured to receive the IF signal and allow substantially only the (ω<sub>LO</sub>−ω<sub>R</sub>) component to pass through. In other words, the high frequency component (ω<sub>LO</sub>+ω<sub>R</sub>) is filtered from the IF signal. Thus, in the example above, the IF signal includes a frequency (ω<sub>IF1</sub>′) of 8.0 kHz after passing through bandpass filter <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Bandpass filter <b>322</b> is in communication with a data processor <b>333</b>, wherein data processor <b>333</b> is any hardware and/or software to process the IF signal having frequency ω<sub>IF</sub>′. In accordance with one exemplary embodiment, data processor <b>333</b> is configured to provide a representation of an angle (Δθ) from gyroscope <b>300</b>. Furthermore, the representation may be of an angle on an X-axis, Y-axis, or Z-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, bandpass filter <b>322</b> is in communication with a phase locked loop <b>340</b>, wherein phase locked loop <b>340</b> is any hardware and/or software suitably configured to receive the IF signal and maintain a constant phase angle (i.e., lock) on the frequency of the IF signal. As such, phase locked loop <b>340</b> may be any phase locked loop known in the art or developed in the future. In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the invention, phase locked loop <b>340</b> produces the reference signal including the frequency ω<sub>LO </sub>discussed above. Furthermore, phase locked loop <b>340</b> is in communication with mixer <b>318</b> and a signal inverter <b>343</b>, and provides the reference signal to mixer <b>318</b> and signal inverter <b>343</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Signal inverter <b>343</b> may be any hardware and/or software suitably configured to combine two or more signals. As such, signal inverter <b>343</b> may be any signal inverter known in the art or developed in the future. In accordance with one exemplary embodiment, signal inverter <b>343</b> is configured to receive the reference signal having frequency ω<sub>LO </sub>from phase locked loop <b>340</b> and receive a second IF signal with a frequency ω<sub>IF2 </sub>from a source (not shown), wherein ω<sub>IF2 </sub>includes a frequency (ω<sub>LO</sub>+ω<sub>R</sub>). Furthermore, signal inverter <b>343</b> is configured to combine the reference signal with the second IF signal to form a drive signal <b>345</b> and transmit drive signal <b>345</b> to a control drive segment <b>320</b> similar to control drive segment <b>120</b> discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Notably, when signal inverter <b>343</b> combines the reference signal with the second IF signal, drive signal <b>345</b> includes a frequency (ω<sub>R</sub>) (i.e., ω<sub>LO</sub>+ω<sub>R</sub>−ω<sub>LO</sub>). Thus, drive signal <b>345</b> will include the natural frequency of gyroscope <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a system <b>400</b> including a gyroscope <b>500</b> and a gyroscope <b>600</b> similar to gyroscope <b>300</b> discussed above. Gyroscope <b>500</b> includes a readout section <b>530</b>, a mixer <b>518</b>, a bandpass filter <b>522</b>, a data processor <b>533</b>, a phase locked loop <b>540</b>, and a signal inverter <b>543</b> configured similar to readout section <b>330</b>, mixer <b>318</b>, bandpass filter <b>322</b>, data processor <b>333</b>, a phase locked loop <b>340</b>, and signal inverter <b>343</b> discussed above, respectively. Furthermore, gyroscope <b>600</b> includes a readout section <b>630</b>, a mixer <b>618</b>, a bandpass filter <b>622</b>, a data processor <b>633</b>, a phase locked loop <b>640</b>, and a signal inverter <b>643</b> configured similar to readout section <b>330</b>, mixer <b>318</b>, bandpass filter <b>322</b>, data processor <b>333</b>, a phase locked loop <b>340</b>, and signal inverter <b>343</b> discussed above, respectively. Since gyroscopes typically operate at their own individual natural frequencies, gyroscope <b>500</b> and gyroscope <b>600</b> have natural frequencies different from one another. Thus, ω<sub>R1 </sub>and ω<sub>R2 </sub>are different frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the invention, system <b>400</b> is configured to operate in the range of about 100 Hz to about 100 kHz. In another embodiment, system <b>400</b> is configured to operate at approximately 8.0 kHz. As such, since ω<sub>R1 </sub>and ω<sub>R2 </sub>are different frequencies, phase locked loops <b>540</b> and <b>640</b> are configured to produce reference signals including frequencies (e.g., ω<sub>LO1 </sub>and ω<sub>LO2</sub>) different from one another. For example, if ω<sub>R1 </sub>is 4.18 kHz and ω<sub>R2 </sub>is 4.09 kHz, ω<sub>LO1 </sub>will be 12.18 kHz (8.0 kHz+4.18 kHz) and ω<sub>LO2 </sub>will be 12.09 kHz (8.0 kHz+4.09 kHz). Thus, the frequency (ω<sub>IF1</sub>) of the IF signal in gyroscope <b>500</b> will include an 8.0 kHz component (i.e., 12.18 kHz−4.18 kHz) and a 16.36 kHz component (i.e., 12.18 kHz+4.18 kHz), and the frequency (ω<sub>IF2</sub>) of the IF signal in gyroscope <b>600</b> will include an 8.0 kHz component (i.e., 12.09 kHz−4.09 kHz) and a 16.18 kHz component (i.e., 12.09 kHz+4.09 kHz).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, when the IF signal in gyroscope <b>500</b> and the IF signal in gyroscope <b>600</b> pass through bandpass filter <b>522</b> and bandpass filter <b>622</b>, respectively, the high frequency component (ω<sub>LO</sub>+ω<sub>R</sub>) of each signal is filtered such that each resulting IF signal includes a frequency (ω<sub>IF1</sub>′) of 8.0 kHz. Each respective IF signal is transmitted to a respective data processor (i.e., data processors <b>533</b> and <b>633</b>) and, thus, gyroscopes <b>500</b> and <b>600</b> each output an 8.0 kHz IF signal representing an angle (i.e., Δθ<sub>1 </sub>and Δθ<sub>2</sub>, respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, gyroscopes <b>500</b> and <b>600</b> each include a signal inverter (i.e., signal inverters <b>543</b> and <b>643</b>, respectively) to combine the reference signal with a respective second IF signal to form a drive signal (i.e., drive signals <b>545</b> and <b>645</b>, respectively) having a frequency equal to the natural operating frequency of its respective gyroscope. In other words, drive signal <b>545</b> includes a frequency of 4.18 kHz (i.e., ω<sub>LO1</sub>+ω<sub>R1</sub>ω<sub>LO1</sub>) and drive signal <b>645</b> includes a frequency of 4.09 kHz (i.e., ω<sub>LO2</sub>+ω<sub>R2</sub>−ω<sub>LO2</sub>) to match the natural frequencies of gyroscope <b>500</b> (i.e., ω<sub>R1</sub>) and gyroscope <b>600</b> (i.e., ω<sub>R2</sub>), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Since each of gyroscopes <b>500</b> and <b>600</b> are essentially self-contained, each of these gyroscopes can be replaced without affecting the output and performance of the other gyroscope. Moreover, system <b>400</b> may be assembled without needing to calibrate gyroscopes <b>500</b> and <b>600</b> since they are individual gyroscopes configured to operate at the same frequency. Thus, system <b>400</b> may be compatible with numerous different systems and/or systems manufactured by numerous different manufacturers.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram of one exemplary embodiment of a system <b>700</b> including three gyroscopes (e.g., gyroscope <b>800</b>, gyroscope <b>900</b>, and gyroscope <b>1000</b> for determining an x-coordinate, a y-coordinate, and a z-coordinate similar to system <b>400</b> discussed above. Gyroscope <b>800</b> includes a readout section <b>830</b>, a mixer <b>818</b>, a bandpass filter <b>822</b>, a data processor <b>833</b>, a phase locked loop <b>840</b>, and a signal inverter <b>843</b> configured similar to readout section <b>330</b>, mixer <b>318</b>, bandpass filter <b>322</b>, data processor <b>333</b>, a phase locked loop <b>340</b>, and signal inverter <b>343</b> discussed above, respectively. Furthermore, gyroscope <b>900</b> includes a readout section <b>930</b>, a mixer <b>918</b>, a bandpass filter <b>922</b>, a data processor <b>933</b>, a phase locked loop <b>940</b>, and a signal inverter <b>943</b> configured similar to readout section <b>330</b>, mixer <b>318</b>, bandpass filter <b>322</b>, data processor <b>333</b>, a phase locked loop <b>340</b>, and signal inverter <b>343</b> discussed above, respectively. Moreover, gyroscope <b>1000</b> includes a readout section <b>1030</b>, a mixer <b>1018</b>, a bandpass filter <b>1022</b>, a data processor <b>1033</b>, a phase locked loop <b>1040</b>, and a signal inverter <b>1043</b> configured similar to readout section <b>330</b>, mixer <b>318</b>, bandpass filter <b>322</b>, data processor <b>333</b>, a phase locked loop <b>340</b>, and signal inverter <b>343</b> discussed above, respectively. As discussed above, gyroscope <b>800</b>, gyroscope <b>900</b>, and gyroscope <b>1000</b> have natural frequencies different from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Similar to the discussion above, ω<sub>RX</sub>, ω<sub>RY</sub>, and ω<sub>RZ </sub>are different frequencies, and ω<sub>LOX</sub>, ω<sub>LOY</sub>, and ω<sub>LOZ </sub>are different frequencies. However, after ω<sub>RX </sub>is added to ω<sub>LOX </sub>by mixer <b>818</b>, ω<sub>RY </sub>is added to ω<sub>LOY </sub>by mixer <b>918</b>, and ω<sub>RZ </sub>is added to ω<sub>LOZ </sub>by mixer <b>1018</b> to form IF signals including a ω<sub>LOX</sub>−ω<sub>RX </sub>component, a ω<sub>LOY</sub>−ω<sub>RY </sub>component, and a ω<sub>LOZ</sub>−ω<sub>RZ </sub>component, respectively, and each IF signal is filtered by a bandpass filter (i.e. bandpass filters <b>822</b>, <b>922</b>, and <b>1022</b>, respectively), each resulting IF signal includes the same frequency (ω<sub>IF</sub>′). Thus, each of gyroscopes <b>800</b>, <b>900</b>, and <b>1000</b> operate at the same frequency and are capable of providing signals representing angles (i.e., Δθ<sub>X</sub>, Δθ<sub>Y</sub>, and Δθ<sub>Z</sub>) for three planes (i.e., x-plane, y-plane, and z-plane).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Since each of gyroscopes <b>800</b>, <b>900</b>, and <b>1000</b> are essentially self-contained, any of these gyroscopes can be replaced without affecting the output and performance of the other gyroscopes. Moreover, system <b>700</b> may be assembled without needing to calibrate gyroscopes <b>800</b>, <b>900</b>, and <b>1000</b> since they are individual gyroscopes configured to operate at the same frequency. Thus, system <b>700</b> may be compatible with numerous different systems and/or systems manufactured by numerous different manufacturers.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow diagram of one exemplary embodiment of a method <b>2000</b> to control two or more gyroscopes. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention, method <b>2000</b> initiates by determining an operating frequency for the gyroscopes (step <b>2005</b>). In one aspect of the invention, the operating frequency is in the range of about 100 Hz to about 100 kHz. In another aspect of the invention, the operating frequency is about 8.0 kHz.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Method <b>2000</b> also includes the step of measuring a first natural frequency (ω<sub>R1</sub>) of a signal output by a resonator of a first gyroscope (e.g., gyroscope <b>300</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, <b>800</b>, <b>900</b>, or <b>1000</b>) (step <b>2010</b>). Once the operating frequency is determined and the first natural frequency is known, method <b>2000</b> includes the step of determining a first reference frequency ω<sub>LO1 </sub>for a first reference signal (step <b>2015</b>). In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the invention, the first reference frequency is determined by adding the operating frequency to the first natural frequency. For example, if the operating frequency is 8.0 kHz and the first natural frequency is 4.12 kHz, the first reference frequency is 12.12 kHz. Thus, in general terms, the reference frequency may be referred to as 12.xx kHz since the “xx” is determined by the natural frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">After the operating frequency, the natural frequency, and the reference frequency are determined, the first output signal and the first reference signal are combined to form an IF signal including a ω<sub>LO1</sub>−ω<sub>R1 </sub>component (step <b>2020</b>). Doing the calculation, the IF signal will include a component having a frequency of 8.0 kHz (i.e., the desired operating frequency). Thus, the first gyroscope operates at a pre-determined frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Method <b>2000</b> repeats steps <b>2010</b> through <b>2020</b> for a second gyroscope (steps <b>2025</b> through <b>2035</b>). However, because of the nature of gyroscopes, the natural frequency of the resonator for the second gyroscope will be different than the natural frequency of the resonator for the first gyroscope. As such, for the second gyroscope to operate at the pre-determined operating frequency (e.g., 8.0 kHz), the frequency of the second reference signal will be different than the frequency of the first reference signal. However, once the second output signal is added to the second reference signal, the resulting IF signal will include a component ω<sub>LO2</sub>−ω<sub>R2 </sub>that is equal to the pre-determined operating frequency (i.e., 8.0 kHz). Thus, method <b>2000</b> includes the step of outputting a plurality IF signals with substantially the same frequency (step <b>2040</b>).</p>
