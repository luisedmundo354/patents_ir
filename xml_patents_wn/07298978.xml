<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An optical receiver in an optical communication system, and more particularly, to a method and an apparatus for optimizing a decision level of a signal output from an optical receiver to obtain a minimum bit error rate (BER) by measuring output characteristics of the optical receiver and adjusting a reference voltage of the optical receiver based on a measurement result. The provided method includes measuring the strength of an electric signal at a modulated frequency out of the frequency elements of the output electric signal in the optical receiver, generating a reference voltage based on the strength data of the electric signal, inputting the reference voltage to the optical receiver and re-measuring the strength of the electric signal output from the optical receiver to determine whether the strength of the signal is minimum, and maintaining the reference voltage when the strength of the signal is minimum and adjusting the reference voltage in other cases. Thus, the provided method optimizes the distribution of level one and level zero, i.e., a decision level, of the electric signal output from the optical receiver, so the efficiency and the performance of the transferred optical signal are maximized.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of Korean Patent Application No. 2002-57565, filed Sep. 23, 2002 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an optical receiver in an optical communication system, and more particularly, to a method and an apparatus for optimizing a decision level of a signal output from an optical receiver to obtain a minimum bit error rate (BER) by measuring output characteristics of the optical receiver and adjusting a reference voltage of the optical receiver based on a measurement result.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Optical signals transmitted through a plurality of optical amplifiers and a plurality of optical transmission lines are input to an optical receiver and converted into electric signals to be input to a clock and data recovery unit. In this process, the optical signals are compressed or dispersed due to dispersion and non-linear effects when passing through the plurality of optical transmission lines. In addition, natural emission noises are inserted to the optical signals while passing through the plurality of optical amplifiers, so noises are accumulated in level one of the optical signals. Thus, in order to determine whether the received optical signals are electrically level one or level zero while obtaining an optimum data characteristic, i.e., a minimum bit error rate (BER), in the clock and data recovery unit, the distribution of level one and level zero of electrical signals output from the optical receiver has to be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Here, a conventional optical receiver determines the level of an electric signal based on a fixed reference, so the conventional optical receiver cannot determine the level of the electric signal when the strength of the received optical signal or the eye diagram of the received optical signal is changed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a method for optimizing the distribution of level one and level zero of electric signals by controlling a reference voltage of a limiting amplifier (LA) through filtering a modulated frequency element from the frequency elements of electric signals output from an optical receiver, detecting the strength of the filtered signal, and determining the strength of the detected signal in a controller, in order to change an output level decision condition of the optical receiver while reflecting the changes in the strength of the optical signal or the eye diagram of the received optical signal in the optical receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for optimizing a decision level of an output signal in an optical receiver comprising measuring the strength of an electric signal at a modulated frequency out of the frequency elements of the output electric signal in the optical receiver; generating a reference voltage based on the strength data of the electric signal; inputting the reference voltage to the optical receiver and re-measuring the strength of the electric signal output from the optical receiver; and adjusting the reference voltage based on the re-measured strength data of the signal, wherein generating the reference voltage and re-measuring the strength of the signal are repeated until the measured strength of the signal is lower than a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the other aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for optimizing a decision level of a signal output from an optical receiver comprising a modulated frequency element extraction unit, which filters and extracts a modulated frequency signal element from various frequency elements of an electric signal output from an optical receiver; a signal strength detection unit, which detects the strength of the electric signal at the modulated frequency; a data storing unit, which stores the strength value of the electric signal; a reference voltage control unit, which outputs an optional reference voltage based on the strength data of the electric signal at the modulated frequency, measures the strength of the electric signal at the modulated frequency while varying the reference voltage to compare the measured strength with the stored strength value of the electric signal, and controls the reference voltage to minimize the measured strength of the electric signal; and a reference voltage generation unit, which generates and outputs the reference voltage adjusted in the reference voltage control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for optimizing a decision level of a signal output from an optical receiver comprising an optical receiver, which receives an optical signal and converts into an electric signal; an RF spectrum analyzer, which measures the spectrum of the electric signal at a frequency region to detect a modulated frequency and measures the strength of the electric signal at the detected modulated frequency; and a reference voltage supplier, which outputs an optional reference voltage based on the strength data of the electric signal, measures the strength of the electric signal at the modulated frequency while varying the reference voltage, and adjusts and supplies the reference voltage input to the optical receiver to minimize the measured strength of the signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a recording medium readable in a computer that includes a program for operating a method for optimizing a decision level of a signal output from an optical receiver in a computer.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">First, the strength of the electric signal is measured at the modulated frequency.

In the case where the strength of the measured signal is minimum, it is determined that a decision level is optimized, so the processes are finished. In other case, the reference voltage is adjusted in step S<b>880</b>, and the strength value of the extracted electric signal is updated and stored. Thereafter, adjusting the reference voltage is repeated until the strength value of the measured electric signal is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In other words, the reference voltage control unit outputs the DC voltage at the modulated frequency, which is filtered and extracted, based on the strength value of the electric signal.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The reference voltage control unit <b>940</b> outputs the predetermined DC voltage at the filtered and extracted modulated frequency based on the strength data of the electric signal.

The reference voltage generation unit <b>950</b> generates and outputs the reference voltage, which is adjusted in the reference voltage control unit <b>940</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The present invention can be realized as a code on a recording medium which can be read out by a computer. Here, the recording medium includes any kind of recording devices in which data are recorded, such as ROM, RAM, CD-ROM, a magnetic tape, a hard disk, a floppy disk, a flash memory, and an optical data recording device, while further including a carrier wave, i.e., transmission over the Internet. In addition, the recording media read out by a computer are distributed to computer systems, connected by a network, to record and execute codes, which can be read out by a computer, in a distribution manner.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As described above, the present invention optimizes the distribution of level one and level zero, i.e., the decision level, of the electric signal output from the optical receiver, so the efficiency and the performance of the transferred optical signal can be maximized.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In other words, in the conventional method, the optical signal, which is transferred by passing through the optical amplifier and the optical transmission line a plurality of times, is compressed or dispersed due to the distribution or non-linear effects in the optical lines. In addition, noises are accumulated in the level one of the optical signal due to the natural emission noises of the optical amplifier, so it is difficult to determine the level of the optical signal. However, the present invention controls the optical receiver to have the minimum BER without using an expensive BER measurer in order to efficiently determine level one and level zero of the signal.</p>
