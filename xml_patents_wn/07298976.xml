<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to an application entitled “BI-DIRECTIONAL OPTICAL CROSS-CONNECT DEVICE” filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on May 2, 2003 and assigned Serial No. 2003-28233, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical network. More particularly, the present invention relates to an optical cross-connect (OXC) device for connecting optical networks.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, practical use has been achieved of a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique adapted to transmit optical signals of different wavelengths through a single-core optical fiber. In additional, it is also now possible to transmit a larger quantity of data at high speed than previously known. Furthermore, the optical settings or switching travel paths of optical signals has been made possible in accordance with development of certain optical element techniques. As a result, the actual construction of an optical network based on the WDM technique is now possible. For such a WDM optical network, a bi-directional OXC device is used that includes a main unit comprising a pair of wavelength division multiplexers/demultiplexers and an optical switch, in which is similar to a general uni-directional OXC device, and an accessory unit used for separately processing forward and backward optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For each wavelength division multiplexer/demultiplexer there is an arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) used to achieve an easy optical signal channel extension and a simple control, yet having a high degree of integration. For the optical switch, a 2×2 space switch is mainly used. In addition, for each accessory unit adapted to process bi-directional optical signals, there are 3-port elements such as circulators, WDM filters, or wavelength interleavers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of a conventional WDM optical network. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the WDM optical network includes first and second WDM ring networks <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> each having a plurality of nodes (not shown) connected to one another by optical fibers. Additionally, an optical cross-over device (OXC) <b>130</b> enables communication between the first and second WDM ring networks <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each of the first and second WDM ring networks <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> perform intra-network communications using a forward optical signal comprising the first through n-th channels λ<b>11</b> to λ<b>1</b><i>n</i>, and a backward optical signal comprising first through n-th channels λ<b>21</b> to λ<b>2</b><i>n</i>. Here, “n” is a natural number. The first one of two reference numerals suffixed to “λ” represents a channel designations of the advancing direction of an optical signal associated with the channel. Moreover, the second reference numeral designates the order of the channel. For example, “λ<b>12</b>” designates the second channel of a forward optical signal, whereas “λ<b>23</b>” designates the third channel of a backward optical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The OXC device <b>130</b> includes first and second external ports <b>131</b> and <b>132</b>, EP<b>1</b> and EP<b>2</b> that are connected to the first ring network <b>110</b>, and third and fourth external ports <b>133</b> and <b>134</b>, EP<b>3</b> and EP<b>4</b> that are connected to the second ring network <b>120</b>. The OXC device <b>130</b> supports intra-network communication for each of the first and second ring networks <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. Additionally, the OXC device supports inter-network communication between the first and second ring networks <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. For example, the OXC device <b>130</b> outputs a forward optical signal, which is input thereto at the first external port <b>131</b>, to the second external port <b>132</b> or fourth external port <b>134</b>, while outputting a backward optical signal, which is input thereto at the fourth external port <b>131</b>, to the first external port <b>131</b> or third external port <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also, the OXC device <b>130</b> can perform a switching operation for the forward and backward optical signals in the unit of channels. For example, the OXC device <b>130</b> may output, to the second external port <b>132</b>, the first through m-th channels λ<b>11</b> to λ<b>1</b><i>m </i>of the forward optical signal which is input to the first external port <b>131</b>, while outputting the (m+1)-th through n-th channels λ 1(m+1) to λ<b>1</b><i>n </i>of the forward optical signal to the fourth external port <b>134</b>. Here, “m” is a natural number not more than “n”.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of the OXC device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the OXC device <b>130</b> includes first through fourth wavelength selective couplers (WSCs) <b>141</b> to <b>144</b>, that is, WSC<b>1</b> to WSC<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, there are 8 wavelength division multiplexers/demultiplexers (WDMs) <b>151</b> to <b>158</b>, that is, WDM<b>11</b> to WDM<b>24</b>, which are divided into first and second groups, each comprising first through fourth WDMs. There is also a plurality of switches (SWs) <b>161</b> to <b>166</b>, that is, SW<b>11</b> to SW<b>2</b><i>n</i>, divided into two groups, that is, first and second groups, each consisting of first through n-th SWs.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">With regard to certain designations, the “WDMxy” designates the y-th WDM of the x-th WDM group, and “SWxy” designates the y-th SW of the x-th SW group. For example, “WDM<b>12</b>” designates the second WDM of the first WDM group, whereas “SW<b>23</b>” designates the third SW of the second SW group. Each WSC has three ports, whereas each SW has four ports. Where it is assumed that one WSC or one SW is designated by a reference numeral “###”, its n-th port is designated by “n” in the drawings while being designated, in the following description, by a reference numeral “###n”. Also, it is assumed that the nn-th channel has an nn-th wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the respective first ports <b>1411</b> to <b>1441</b> of the WSC<b>1</b> and WSC<b>4</b> <b>141</b> to <b>144</b> are connected to the first through fourth external ports <b>131</b> to <b>134</b>. Respective ports <b>1412</b> to <b>1442</b> of the WSC<b>1</b> to WSC<b>4</b> <b>141</b> to <b>144</b> provide passages for forward optical signals, whereas respective ports <b>1413</b> to <b>1443</b> of the WSC<b>1</b> to WSC<b>4</b> <b>141</b> to <b>144</b> provide passages for backward optical signals. The WSC<b>1</b> and WSC<b>3</b> <b>141</b> and <b>143</b> output respective forward optical signals, which is input thereto at their first ports <b>1411</b> and <b>1431</b> and to their second ports <b>1412</b> and <b>1432</b>, while outputting respective backward optical signals which is input thereto at their third ports <b>1433</b> and <b>1443</b> to their first ports <b>1411</b> and <b>1431</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">On the other hand, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows the WSC<b>2</b> and WSC<b>4</b> <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> output respective backward optical signals, which is input thereto at their first ports <b>1421</b> and <b>1441</b>, to their third ports <b>1423</b> and <b>1443</b>, while outputting respective forward optical signals, which is input thereto at their second ports <b>1422</b> and <b>1442</b>, to their first ports <b>1421</b> and <b>1441</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Each of the WDM<b>11</b> to WDM<b>24</b> <b>151</b> to <b>158</b> has only one multiplexing port, and n demultiplexing ports. The WDMs operate to demultiplex an optical signal which is input thereto at the multiplexing port in the channel unit. Respective channels of the demultiplexed optical signal are output to the demultiplexing ports, while multiplexing channels which is input thereto at the demultiplexing ports output the resultant optical signal to the multiplexing port.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For example, each switch of the SW<b>11</b> to SW<b>1</b><i>n </i><b>161</b> to <b>163</b> in the first SW group has first through fourth ports: <b>1611</b> to <b>1614</b> in the case of SW<b>11</b> <b>161</b>; <b>1621</b> to <b>1624</b> in the case of SW<b>12</b> <b>162</b>; or <b>1631</b> to <b>1634</b> in the case of SW<b>1</b><i>n </i><b>163</b>. Each switch is switched between a “bar” state, in which the first and second ports are connected to each other, and the third and fourth ports are connected to each other, and a “cross” state in which the first and fourth ports are connected to each other, and the second and third ports are connected to each other. For example, in the case of the SW<b>11</b> <b>161</b>, its first and second ports <b>1611</b> and <b>1612</b> are connected to each other, and its third and fourth ports <b>1613</b> and <b>1614</b> are connected to each other in the bar state. Moreover, first and fourth ports <b>1611</b> and <b>1614</b> are connected to each other, and the second and third ports <b>1612</b> and <b>1613</b> are connected to each other in the cross state. Each switch in a respective SW group is connected at a first through fourth ports to respective corresponding demultiplexing ports of associated ones of the WDMs in the WDM group corresponding to the SW group.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For example, the SW<b>1</b><i>n </i><b>163</b> is connected at its first and third ports <b>1631</b> and <b>1633</b> to respective n-th demultiplexing ports of the WDM<b>11</b> <b>151</b> and WDM<b>13</b> <b>153</b>.

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The SW<b>11</b> <b>161</b> and SW<b>22</b> <b>165</b> are first set to be in their cross state by a control unit (not shown).

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">However, the conventional OXC device <b>130</b>, which uses a plurality of WDMs and a plurality of 2×2 space switches, as mentioned above, has a problem of high manufacturing costs because the WDMs are expensive. Furthermore, the OXC device <b>130</b> requires a complex switching procedure because demultiplexing, switching, and multiplexing operations should be carried out upon switching one input channel. In addition, the OXC device <b>130</b> has a low channel extensibility because although the number of processible channels may be increased in accordance with an increase in the number of demultiplexing ports, in some cases it may be necessary to completely replace the existing WDMs with appropriate new ones appropriate for usage.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Now, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following description of the present invention, a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it may obscure the subject matter of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The present invention provides an OXC device including circulating parts (CPs) or circulators (Cs) each having a plurality of ports. Where it is assumed that one circulating part or circulator is designated by a reference numeral “###”, its n-th port is designated by “n” in the drawings while being designated, in the following description, by a reference numeral “###n”. Forward and backward optical signals are input to the OXC device. The forward optical signal consists of first through n-th channels λ 11 to λ <b>1</b><i>n</i>, whereas the backward optical signal consists of first through n-th channels λ<b>21</b> to λ<b>2</b><i>n</i>. Here, the first one of two reference numerals suffixed to “λ” representing a channel designates the advancing direction of an optical signal associated with the channel, whereas the second reference numeral designates the order of the channel. For example, “λ<b>12</b>” designates the second channel of a forward optical signal, whereas “λ<b>23</b>” designates the third channel of a backward optical signal. Also, it is assumed that the nn-th channel has an nn-th wavelength. Here, “n” is a natural number.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration of the OXC device according to the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the OXC device designated by the reference numeral <b>200</b> includes first and second circulating parts <b>210</b> and <b>220</b>, that is, CP<b>1</b> and CP<b>2</b>, and first and second reflecting parts <b>230</b> and <b>240</b>, that is, R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first circulating part <b>210</b> includes first through fourth ports <b>210</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>210</b>-<b>4</b>. The first circulating part <b>210</b> is connected at its first port <b>210</b>-<b>1</b> to a first external port <b>201</b>, that is, EP<b>1</b>, while being connected at its third port <b>2103</b> to a second external port <b>202</b>, that is, EP<b>2</b>. The first and second external ports <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> are connected to a first ring network (not shown). The first circulating part <b>210</b> operates to output an optical signal, which is input to a higher-order port thereof, from a lower-order port thereof arranged adjacent to the higher-order port. For example, the first circulating part <b>210</b> outputs a forward optical signal, which is input thereto at its first port <b>210</b>-<b>1</b>, to its second port <b>210</b>-<b>2</b>, while outputting a backward optical signal, which is input thereto at its fourth port <b>210</b>-<b>4</b>, to its first port <b>210</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The second circulating part <b>220</b> includes first through fourth ports <b>220</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>220</b>-<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The second circulating part <b>220</b> is connected at its first port <b>220</b>-<b>1</b> to a third external port <b>203</b>, that is, EP<b>3</b>, while being connected at its third port <b>220</b>-<b>3</b> to a fourth external port <b>204</b>, that is, EP<b>4</b>. The third and fourth external ports <b>203</b> and <b>204</b> are connected to a second ring network (not shown). The second circulating part <b>220</b> operates to output an optical signal, which is input to a higher-order port thereof, from a lower-order port thereof arranged adjacent to the higher-order port. For example, the second circulating part <b>220</b> outputs a forward optical signal, which is input thereto at its first port <b>220</b>-<b>1</b>, to its second port <b>220</b>-<b>2</b>, while outputting a backward optical signal, which is input thereto at its fourth port <b>220</b>-<b>4</b>, to its first port <b>220</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first reflecting part <b>230</b> is connected to respective second ports <b>210</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>220</b>-<b>2</b> of the first and second circulating parts <b>210</b> and <b>220</b>.
