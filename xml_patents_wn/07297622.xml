<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to a wiring method. More specifically, the present invention relates to a wiring method to be performed on a thin film transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Information</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As is well known, a thin-film transistor (hereinafter also referred to as a TFT) has a configuration including an insulating film, a layer on which a drain electrode and a source electrode are formed, and a layer on which a gate electrode. The drain electrode/source electrode layer and the gate electrode layer are disposed on either side of the insulating film. When manufacturing such a thin-film transistor, the insulating film is preferably made thinner in order to improve productivity. However, since such an insulating film fulfills the role of preventing short-circuiting between the drain electrode/source electrode and the gate electrode, reducing the thickness of the insulating film can sometimes result in insufficient insulation between the drain electrode/source electrode and the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2002-190598 discloses a technique for resolving such problems. Specifically, the thickness of the gate electrode is reduced by adjusting the gradation of exposure using a so-called gray tone exposure technique, such that the portion of the insulating film on the gate electrode is made relatively thick to secure the requisite thickness of the insulating film between the drain electrode/source electrode and the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently a method has been proposed wherein a pattern is formed on a substrate using so-called ink jetting, which is a droplet ejection method for ejecting liquid material in a droplet form from a liquid ejection head. In this method, the liquid material (functional liquid) with which the pattern is to be formed is deposited in the shape of the pattern directly onto the substrate, and is then converted into the pattern using a heat treatment or a laser irradiation. This method has merits in that the need for photolithography is eliminated, the process is greatly simplified, and a lesser amount of raw material is required.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is preferable to reduce the thickness of the insulating film described above in order to improve the productivity even when a TFT is manufactured by applying such a droplet ejection method to form gate wiring or the like, where part of such gate wiring is also used as a gate electrode. In actuality, among techniques for forming gate wiring or the like using droplet ejection, no technique has yet been proposed that would secure the required thickness of the insulating film formed on the gate electrode while reducing the thickness of the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the above, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that there exists a need for an improved wiring method that overcomes the problems of the conventional art. This invention addresses this need in the art as well as other needs, which will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide a wiring method that reduces the occurrence of insufficient insulation even when the thickness of the insulation film is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A method of forming a wiring in a thin-film transistor in accordance with the present invention includes steps of: providing a bank having a groove defined thereon, the groove having a wiring formation area and a secondary area that is contiguously connected with the wiring formation area; placing a liquid material in the wiring formation area by depositing droplets of the liquid material, the liquid material containing a structural material for the wiring; and placing the liquid material in the secondary area, a per unit amount of the liquid material placed in the secondary area being smaller than a per unit amount of the liquid material deposited in the wiring formation area.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Selected embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the drawings. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that the following descriptions of the embodiments of the present invention are provided for illustration only and not for the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A method of forming a wiring in a thin-film transistor in accordance with the present invention includes steps of: providing a bank having a groove defined thereon, the groove having a wiring formation area and a secondary area that is contiguously connected with the wiring formation area; placing a liquid material in the wiring formation area by depositing droplets of the liquid material, the liquid material containing a structural material for the wiring; and placing the liquid material in the secondary area, a per unit amount of the liquid material placed in the secondary area being smaller than a per unit amount of the liquid material deposited in the wiring formation area.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the wiring method of the present invention, the liquid material in the wiring formation area is smaller in amount than the liquid material in the secondary area. Therefore, the thickness of the insulating film that is formed on the secondary area can be increased relatively as compared to the thickness of the insulating film formed on the wiring formation area. Thus, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of insufficient insulation on the secondary area. Therefore, when a wiring such as gate wiring is formed using the wiring method of the present invention, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of insufficient insulation even when the insulating film is made thinner.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the wiring method of the present invention, the wiring method can further include steps of: drying the liquid material in the wiring formation area; and drying the liquid material in the secondary area. A film of the liquid material in the wiring formation area is thicker than a film of the liquid material in the secondary area.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the wiring method of the present invention, the wiring formation area can be a gate wiring of the thin film transistor, and the secondary area can be a gate electrode of the thin film transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the wiring method of the present invention that employs such configuration, since the gate electrode is made thinner than the gate wiring, it is possible to ensure sufficient thickness in the insulating film on the gate electrode. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of insufficient insulation on the gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the wiring method of the present invention, the secondary area can be an accumulation and storage capacity of the thin film transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to the wiring method of the present invention, the wiring formation area can also be an accumulation and storage capacity wiring of the thin film transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the wiring method of the present invention that employs such configuration, since the accumulation and storage capacity is made thinner than the accumulation and storage capacity wiring, it is possible to ensure sufficient thickness in the insulating film over the accumulation and storage capacity. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of insufficient insulation over the accumulation and storage capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the wiring method of the present invention, in the placing of the liquid material in the secondary area, the liquid material can be placed in the secondary area by the liquid material deposited in the wiring formation area flowing into the secondary area due to the fluidity of the liquid material.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to the wiring method of the present invention that employs such configuration, the liquid material flows into the secondary area due to its natural fluidity. Thus, the amount of the liquid material placed in the secondary area is less than the amount of the liquid material placed in the wiring formation area. Therefore, the wiring in the secondary area can be formed to be thin easily by subsequently drying or otherwise treating the liquid material.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the wiring method of the present invention, in the placing of the liquid material in the secondary area, the liquid material can be placed in the secondary area by depositing droplets of the liquid material that are smaller than the droplets of the liquid material deposited in the wiring formation area.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to the wiring method of the present invention that employs such configuration, smaller droplets of the liquid material are deposited into the secondary area than in the wiring formation area. Therefore, the wiring in the secondary area can be easily formed to be thin by subsequently drying or otherwise treating the liquid material.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to the wiring method of the present invention, the placing of the liquid material in the secondary area can be performed after the drying of the liquid material in the wiring formation area. In the placing of the liquid material in the secondary area, the liquid material can be placed in the secondary area by depositing droplets of the liquid material that are smaller than the droplets of the liquid material deposited in the wiring formation area.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to the wiring method of the present invention that employs such configuration, smaller droplets of the liquid material are deposited into the secondary area after the droplets deposited into the wiring formation area are dried. When the liquid material is simultaneously deposited into the wiring formation area and the secondary area, there is a possibility that the amount of the liquid material deposited in both areas will be made uniform due to leveling. Therefore, it is preferable, for example, to first deposit the liquid material into the wiring formation area, dry the liquid material, and then deposit the liquid material into the secondary area.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The wiring method of the present invention can further include the step of placing an insulating film over the wiring formation area and the secondary area, a thickness of the insulating film over the wiring formation area being smaller than the thickness of the insulating film over the secondary area.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">First Bank Formation Step</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), a first bank B is formed by photolithography on the top surface of a cleaned glass substrate <b>610</b>, to allow a groove Ba having the size of 1/20 to 1/10 the size of one pixel pitch to be formed on the first bank B. Since photolithography is well known in the art, detailed explanation thereof will be omitted herein. This bank B must be optically transparent and liquid-repellent when formed. Suitable examples of the material for the bank B include acrylic resins, polyimide resins, olefin resins, melamine resins, and other such polymeric materials.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In order to make the bank B liquid-repellent after it is formed, CF<sub>4 </sub>plasma treatment (a plasma treatment using a gas with a fluorine component) or the like must be applied. Instead of the plasma treatment, liquid-repellent components (fluorine groups or the like) may instead be filled into the material of the bank B itself in advance. In this case, a separate treatment such as the CF<sub>4 </sub>plasma treatment or the like that renders liquid repellency can be dispensed with.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The angle of contact of the ejected ink on the bank B that has been made liquid-repellent as described above is preferably kept at 40° or greater, and the angle of contact on the glass surface is preferably kept at 10° or less. Specifically, the inventors have confirmed as a result of experimentation that, when an acrylic resin was employed as the material for the bank B, the angle of contact of electrically conductive microparticles (tetradecane solvent), for example, was able to be kept at about 54.0° when the bank B was rendered liquid repellent, while such contact angle is 10° or less when the bank B was not rendered liquid repellent. This angle of contact in the case the bank B was rendered liquid repellent was obtained when plasma treatment was performed under conditions of supplying methane tetrafluoride gas at a rate of 0.1 L/min with 550 W of plasma power.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Gate Wiring Step</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the gate wiring step, which follows the first bank formation step, droplets containing a gate wiring material are ejected according to a droplet ejection method to form the gate wiring <b>40</b> (gate electrode <b>41</b>) so as to fill in the groove Ba. The groove Ba is a drawing area defined by the bank B. The wiring method of the present embodiment is applied when the gate wiring <b>40</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Specifically, first, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), droplets of a functional liquid L (liquid material) containing the gate wiring material are deposited by a droplet ejection method onto specific locations along a gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b> (an example of the wiring formation area) that extends in the direction of the X-axis. When the droplets of the functional liquid L are deposited onto the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b>, the droplets are ejected onto the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b> from above the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b> using a droplet ejection method. In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), droplets of the functional liquid L are deposited at specific intervals along the direction in which the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b> extends (the X-axis direction). At this time, the droplets of the functional liquid L are also deposited in the vicinity of a connecting area <b>37</b> (intersecting area) where the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b> and a gate electrode formation area Ba<b>2</b> (an example of the secondary area) are contiguously connected to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>), the functional liquid L deposited in the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b> expands within the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b> due to the natural fluidity of the functional liquid L. Furthermore, the functional liquid L deposited on the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b> also expands in the gate electrode formation area Ba<b>2</b> due to the natural fluidity. The functional liquid L is thereby also deposited in the gate electrode formation area Ba<b>2</b> without droplets being ejected directly onto the gate electrode formation area Ba<b>2</b> from above the gate electrode formation area Ba<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Thus, by being deposited on the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b>, the functional liquid L can also be disposed on the gate electrode formation area Ba<b>2</b> due to the natural fluidity (capillary phenomenon) of the functional liquid L that is deposited on the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The amount of the functional liquid L that is deposited on the gate electrode formation area Ba<b>2</b> through the flow from the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b> as a result of the natural fluidity is less than the amount of the functional liquid L deposited on the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b>. Therefore, the thickness of the liquid film formed on the gate electrode formation area Ba<b>2</b> is less than the thickness of the liquid film formed on the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Examples of materials that can be employed as the gate wiring material (structural material) contained in the functional liquid L include Ag, Al, Au, Cu, palladium, Ni, W—si, electrically conductive polymers, and the like. Also, since the bank B is sufficiently liquid-repellent, the functional liquid L can be deposited being spilled from the groove Ba.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">After the functional liquid L is deposited onto the glass substrate <b>610</b>, an intermediate drying treatment is performed as necessary to remove the dispersion solvent and to ensure film thickness. The drying treatment can be performed, for example, by using a regular hot plate, electric furnace, or other device to heat the glass substrate <b>610</b>, or by lamp annealing.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The light source used in lamp annealing is not particularly limited. Possible examples of suitable light sources include an infrared lamp, a xenon lamp, a YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) laser, an argon laser, a carbonate gas laser, or an excimer laser that uses XeF, XeCl, XeBr, KrF, KrCl, ArF, ArCl, or the like. These light sources commonly have an output of equal to or greater than 10 W to equal to or lower than 5000 W. For the present embodiment, the light sources of 100 W to 1000 W suffice.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The intermediately dried film must have the dispersion solvent completely removed in order to ensure a good electrical connection between microparticles. Also, when the surface of the conductive microparticles is coated with an organic or other such coating material to improve dispersion, such coating material must also be removed. Therefore, the glass substrate <b>610</b> is subjected to a heat and/or light treatment after the ejection step.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The heat treatment and the light treatment are commonly performed in the atmosphere, but can also be performed in the presence of inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, and helium, as necessary. The temperature of the heat treatment and/or light treatment is appropriately determined in view of the boiling point of the dispersion solvent (vapor pressure), the type and the pressure of the atmospheric gas, the thermal behavior of the microparticles, such as the dispersibility and the propensity toward oxidation, the presence or absence and the quantity of the coating material, the upper limit of the heat resistance of the substrate, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, in order to remove a coating material composed of organic matter, the substrate must be baked at about 300° C. In this case, for example, the top of the bank B and the dried film of the functional liquid L may be coated in advance with a low-melting point glass.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Also, when the substrate is made of a plastic or other such material, the temperature of the heating treatment is preferably between the room temperature and about equal to or lower than 100° C.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In this manner, the dried film after the ejection maintains electrical connection between the microparticles, and is converted to the gate wiring <b>40</b> (gate electrode <b>41</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The gate electrode <b>41</b> that is part of the gate wiring <b>40</b> thus formed has a thickness that is thinner than that of the rest of the gate wiring <b>40</b>. More specifically, the per unit area amount of the functional liquid L deposited on the gate electrode formation area Ba<b>2</b> by flow of the function liquid L into the gate electrode formation area Ba<b>2</b> due the natural fluidity as described above is smaller than the per unit area amount of the functional liquid L deposited on the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b>. Accordingly, the thickness of the gate electrode <b>41</b> obtained by subjecting the functional liquid L to the intermediate drying treatment and the heating treatment and/or the light treatment is smaller than the thickness of the rest of the gate wiring <b>40</b>. Therefore, according to the wiring method of the present embodiment, the top surface of the gate electrode <b>41</b> is positioned lower than the top surface of the gate wiring <b>40</b>. Particularly, if the top surface of the gate wiring <b>40</b> is formed to be at the same level as the top surface of the bank B, the top surface of the gate electrode <b>41</b> is formed to be lower than the top surface of the bank B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Semiconductor Layer Formation Step</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>), a gate insulating film <b>613</b> (insulating film), an active layer <b>611</b>, and a contact layer <b>609</b> are formed continuously using the plasma CVD method. A silicon nitride film is used to form the gate insulating film <b>613</b>, an amorphous silicon film is used to form the active layer <b>611</b>, and an n<sup>+</sup>-type silicon film is used to form the contact layer <b>609</b> by varying the raw material gas and plasma conditions. When these films are formed by CVD, a heat history of 300° C. to 350° C. is required. Although heat history of such low temperature generally tends to cause transparency problems and heat-resistance problems, it is possible to avoid such problems by including silicon as a primary component in the principal chains of the basic framework of these films, while using a silica glass-based material having a structure of hydrogen carbide or the like in the side chains.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The gate electrode <b>41</b> herein is formed to be thinner than the other part of the gate wiring <b>40</b> as described above. As a result, a thicker insulating film <b>613</b> is formed on the gate electrode <b>41</b> than on the rest of the gate wiring <b>40</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Second Bank Formation Step</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the second bank formation step, which follows the semiconductor layer formation step described above, the contact layer <b>609</b> is etched in advance to secure a channel. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>), a second bank <b>614</b> for providing a groove <b>614</b><i>a </i>having the size of 1/20 to 1/10 the size of one pixel pitch is formed by photolithography on the top surface of the gate insulating film <b>613</b>. This second bank <b>614</b> must be optically transparent and liquid-repellent when formed. Suitable examples for the material of the second bank <b>614</b> include acrylic resins, polyimide resins, olefin resins, melamine resins, and other such polymeric materials.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In order to make the second bank <b>614</b> liquid-repellent, CF<sub>4 </sub>plasma treatment (a plasma treatment using a gas with a fluorine component) or the like must be applied. Instead of the plasma treatment, liquid-repellent components (fluorine groups or the like) may instead be filled into the material of the second bank <b>614</b> itself in advance. In this case, a separate treatment such as the CF<sub>4 </sub>plasma treatment or the like that renders liquid repellency can be dispensed with.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The angle of contact of the ejected ink on the second bank <b>614</b> that has been rendered liquid-repellent as described above should be preferably kept at 40° or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Source Wiring Step</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the source wiring step, which follows the second bank formation step, droplets containing a source wiring material are ejected by a droplet ejection method so as to fill in the groove <b>614</b><i>a</i>, which is a drawing area defined by the second bank <b>614</b>. Then, an intermediate drying treatment and a heat treatment and/or a light treatment are applied to form a source wiring <b>42</b> that intersects with the gate wiring <b>40</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Examples of suitable electrically conductive materials from which the source wiring <b>42</b> is to be formed include Ag, Al, Au, Cu, palladium, Ni, W—si, conductive polymers, and the like. It is possible to use the resulting source electrode <b>43</b> and the drain electrode <b>44</b> to form a precise wiring pattern without the materials spilling out of the second bank <b>614</b><i>a</i>, because the second bank <b>614</b> is made sufficiently liquid-repellent in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Also, insulating material <b>617</b> is deposited so as to fill in the groove <b>614</b><i>a </i>in which the source electrode <b>43</b> and the drain electrode <b>44</b> are disposed. As a result of the steps described above, a flat top surface <b>620</b> including the top surface of the bank <b>614</b> and the top surface of the insulating material <b>617</b> is formed over the substrate <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Thereafter, a contact hole <b>619</b> is formed in the insulating material <b>617</b>, a patterned pixel electrode (made of Indium Tin Oxide or ITO) <b>618</b> is formed on the top surface <b>620</b>, and the drain electrode <b>44</b> and the pixel electrode <b>618</b> are connected via the contact hole <b>619</b>. In this manner, the TFT array substrate P on which a TFT is formed is manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Thus, in the TFT array substrate P having a gate wiring <b>40</b> that is formed using the wiring method of the first embodiment, the gate electrode <b>41</b> is formed to be thinner than the rest of the gate wiring <b>40</b>. Therefore, the thickness of the gate insulating film <b>613</b> on the gate electrode <b>41</b> is greater than the thickness of the insulating film <b>613</b> disposed on the rest of the gate wiring <b>40</b>. It is therefore possible to reduce the occurrence of insufficient insulation between the source electrode <b>43</b> or drain electrode <b>44</b> and the gate electrode <b>41</b>, even when the insulating film is made thinner in order to improve the productivity of the TFT array substrate P.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Also, according to the wiring method of the first embodiment, the liquid film that forms on the gate electrode formation area Ba<b>2</b> can easily be made thinner than the liquid film disposed on the gate wiring formation area Ba<b>1</b> by allowing the liquid film to flow naturally into the gate electrode formation area Ba<b>2</b> due to its natural fluidity. Therefore, a thinner gate electrode <b>41</b> can be easily formed by subjecting the functional liquid L to an intermediate drying treatment as well as a heating treatment and/or a light treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Possible examples of the ejection technique for the droplet ejection method include a charge control system, a pressurized vibration system, an electromechanical conversion system, a thermoelectric conversion system, an electrostatic attraction system, and the like. The charge control system involves applying an electric charge to a material with an electric charge electrode and ejecting the material from nozzles while controlling the spraying direction of the material with a deflecting electrode. In the pressurized vibration system, an extremely high pressure of about 30 kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>is applied to the material to be ejected from the distal ends of the nozzles, wherein the material is ejected from the nozzles in a rectilinear fashion when the controlled voltage is not applied to the material, while the material is scattered but not ejected from the nozzles due an electrostatic repulsion between particles of the material when the controlled voltage is applied to the material. Also, the electromechanical conversion system utilizes a piezoelement (piezoelectric element) that has the property of deforming upon receiving a pulsed electrical signal. The material is ejected when the deformation of the piezoelectric element applies pressure via a flexible substance to the space in which the material is contained and the material is pushed out of the space.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the thermoelectric conversion system, the material is rapidly gasified to create bubbles by a heater provided in the space where the material is contained, and the material in the space is ejected due to the pressure from the bubbles. In the electrostatic attraction system, a small amount of pressure is applied to the space where the material is contained, a meniscus of the material is formed in the nozzles, and in this state the electrostatic attraction is applied to draw out the material. Other techniques can also be applied, including a system of utilizing changes in the viscosity of the fluid by way of an electric field, a system of spraying by discharge sparks, and the like. Droplet ejection methods have advantages in that there is relatively less amount of material that is wasted during use, and a desired amount of material can be accurately deposited at a desired location. The mass of one droplet of liquid material (fluid) ejected by droplet ejection methods is 1 to 300 nanograms, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the embodiment described above, the TFTs <b>30</b> are used as switching elements for driving the liquid crystal display apparatus <b>100</b>. TFTs can be applied to an organic EL (electro-luminescence) display device, for example, in addition to a liquid crystal display apparatus. An organic EL display device is an element wherein a thin film containing fluorescent inorganic and organic compounds are contained between a negative electrode and a positive electrode, such that excitons are produced by excitation that is caused by injection of electrons and holes into the thin film. Light is produced by utilizing the emission of light (fluorescent light/phosphorescent light) that occurs when the excitons recombine. A light-emitting full color EL device can be manufactured by treating as an ink the materials for forming light-emitting layers and hole injection/electron transfer layers, in other words the fluorescent materials for emitting red, green, and blue lights, and patterning the materials on the TFT array substrate P. An electrooptical device in accordance with the present invention includes such organic EL device.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The light-emitting element formation step is used to form the light emitting elements <b>451</b> by forming hole injection layers <b>452</b> and light-emitting layers <b>453</b> on the concave openings <b>444</b>, specifically over the pixel electrodes <b>45</b>. The light-emitting element formation step includes a hole injection layer formation step and a light-emitting layer formation step. The hole injection layer formation step has a first ejection step for ejecting a liquid material for forming the hole injection layer <b>452</b> onto the pixel electrodes <b>45</b>, and a first drying step for drying the ejected liquid material to form the hole injection layer <b>452</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Next, the second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>. In view of the similarity between the first and second embodiments, the parts of the second embodiment that are identical to the parts of the first embodiment will be given the same reference numerals as the parts of the first embodiment. Moreover, the descriptions of the parts of the second embodiment that are identical to the parts of the first embodiment may be omitted for the sake of brevity.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a plan view showing the schematic configuration of a TFT array substrate P on which an accumulation and storage capacity wiring <b>47</b> and an accumulation and storage capacity <b>46</b>, which is part of the accumulation and storage capacity wiring <b>47</b>, are formed by the wiring method of the second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As shown in the diagram, the accumulation and storage capacity wiring <b>47</b> is formed on the TFT array substrate P of the second embodiment so as to extend parallel to the X-axis direction of the gate wiring <b>40</b>. This accumulation and storage capacity wiring <b>47</b> is formed in a groove (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) that is formed in the bank B in the same manner as in the case of the gate wiring <b>40</b>, such that the accumulation and storage capacity wiring <b>47</b> is formed on the same layer as the gate wiring <b>40</b>. Also, part of the accumulation and storage capacity wiring <b>47</b>, specifically, the region located underneath the pixel electrodes <b>45</b>, is formed to be wide, and this widely formed region is configured as the accumulation and storage capacity <b>46</b>. An insulating film formed in the same step as the gate insulating film <b>613</b> is disposed between the accumulation and storage capacity <b>46</b> and the pixel electrodes <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As a result of additionally forming such accumulation and storage capacity <b>46</b>, the voltage from the pixel electrodes <b>45</b> is retained by the accumulation and storage capacity <b>46</b> for a period longer by three digits than the period during which the source voltage is applied. Therefore, the electric charge retaining characteristics of the TFT array substrate P can be improved. Consequently, it is possible to improve the contrast ratio of the electrooptical apparatus having such TFT array substrate P.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The accumulation and storage capacity wiring <b>47</b> described above is formed by the wiring method of the present embodiment in the same step as the gate wiring <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref><i>a</i>), a functional liquid L containing the material for forming the gate wiring <b>40</b> is ejected using the droplet ejection method and deposited in an accumulation and storage capacity wiring formation section Ba<b>3</b> (another example of the wiring formation area) that is defined by the bank B.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Then, droplets La that are smaller in amount of than the droplets ejected and deposited in the accumulation and storage capacity wiring formation section Ba<b>3</b> are ejected using the droplet ejection method and deposited in an accumulation and storage capacity formation section Ba<b>4</b> (another example of the secondary area), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref><i>b</i>). The per unit area amount of functional liquid La deposited in the accumulation and storage capacity formation section Ba<b>4</b> is thereby smaller than the per unit area amount of the functional liquid L deposited in the accumulation and storage capacity wiring formation section Ba<b>3</b>. Therefore, the thickness of the liquid film deposited on the accumulation and storage capacity formation section Ba<b>4</b> is smaller than the thickness of the liquid film deposited on the accumulation and storage capacity wiring formation section Ba<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Then, the accumulation and storage capacity wiring <b>47</b> and the accumulation and storage capacity <b>46</b> that is configured as a portion of the accumulation and storage capacity wiring <b>47</b> are formed by subjecting the droplets of the functional liquids L and La to an intermediate drying step and a heating treatment and/or a light treatment. The accumulation and storage capacity <b>46</b> thus formed is located underneath the top surfaces of the bank B, similar to the gate electrode <b>41</b>. Consequently, the thickness of the insulating film deposited on the accumulation and storage capacity <b>46</b> can be greater than the thickness of the insulating film deposited on the rest of the accumulation and storage capacity wiring <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Therefore, according to the wiring method of the second embodiment, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of insufficient insulation between the accumulation and storage capacity <b>46</b> and the pixel electrodes <b>45</b>, even when a thin insulating film is used in order to improve the productivity of the TFT array substrate P.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Also, according to the wiring method of the second embodiment, the liquid film disposed on the accumulation and storage capacity formation section Ba<b>4</b> can be easily made thinner than the liquid film disposed on the accumulation and storage capacity wiring formation section Ba<b>3</b> by ejecting and depositing a smaller amount of the functional liquid La onto the accumulation and storage capacity formation section Ba<b>4</b> than the amount of the functional liquid L deposited on the accumulation and storage capacity wiring formation section Ba<b>3</b> using a droplet ejection method. Consequently, an accumulation and storage capacity <b>46</b> having a reduced thickness can be formed by subjecting the functional liquids L and La to the intermediate drying treatment as well as the heating treatment and/or the light treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">To prevent the liquid films from having the same thickness due to leveling of the functional liquid L deposited on the accumulation and storage capacity wiring formation section Ba<b>3</b> and the functional liquid La deposited on the accumulation and storage capacity formation section Ba<b>4</b>, it is preferable to eject and deposit the functional liquid La onto the accumulation and storage capacity formation section Ba<b>4</b> after the intermediate drying treatment is applied and the functional liquid L that has been ejected and deposited onto the accumulation and storage capacity wiring formation section Ba<b>3</b> is solidified to form a dried film Lx, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>

The shapes and combinations of the structural components shown in the examples described above are merely examples, and various modifications are possible on the basis of the design requirements within a range that does not deviate from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">For example, in the embodiments described above, the TFTs <b>30</b> are all configured as bottom gate TFTs. However, rather than being applied solely to the formation of gate wiring for bottom gate TFTs, the wiring method of the present invention can also be applied to the formation of gate wiring for top gate TFTs.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Also, in the second embodiment described above, the accumulation and storage capacity <b>46</b> is configured as part of the accumulation and storage capacity wiring <b>47</b> that is formed separately from the gate wiring <b>40</b>. However, the wiring method of the present invention can also be applied to a case where a part of the gate wiring is formed to be wide, and this widened part is configured as the accumulation and storage capacity, for example.</p>
