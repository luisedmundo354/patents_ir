<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A Ni<sub>2</sub>Si-nSiC Ohmic contact is formed by pulsed laser ablation deposition (PLD) of Ni<sub>2</sub>Si source target deposited on a n-SiC substrate or SiC substrate wafer with SiC epilayer. The Ni<sub>2</sub>Si Ohmic contact on n-SiC was rapid thermal annealed at 950° C. for 30 s in a N<sub>2 </sub>ambient. The resultant Ohmic contact is characterized by excellent current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, an abrupt void free contact-SiC interface, retention of the PLD as-deposited contact layer width, smooth surface morphology, and absence of residual carbon within the contact layer or at the interface. The detrimental effects of contact delamination due to stress associated with interfacial voiding; and wire bond failure, non-uniformity of current flow and SiC polytype alteration due to extreme surface roughness; have been eliminated as has electrical instability associated with carbon inclusions at the contact-SiC interface, after prolonged high temperature and power device operation.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention relates to a semiconductor device manufacturing process. More particularly, the invention is a process for forming an Ohmic contact on a wide bandgap semiconductor material (SiC). More particularly, the invention is a process for forming a nickel silicide (Ni<sub>2</sub>Si) Ohmic contact to n-type SiC.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention relates to the technology of manufacturing a SiC based semiconductor device. All semiconductor devices require high quality, low resistivity thermally stable reliable n- and p-type Ohmic contacts. Ohmic contacts are essential for the transfer of signals between the SiC device and the external circuitry. Ohmic contact metallization design, selection and method of deposition heavily influence the electrical and physical properties of Ohmic contacts to all semiconductors. There are many metallization designs; however, the most common used in SiC device technology consists of single layer, bilayer, multilayer composite metallization schemes and compound intermetallics. Low resistance Ohmic contacts to n-type SiC can be obtained by depositing metallizations with appropriate work functions to achieve a barrier height reduction at the metal-SiC interface. The barrier heights of various contacts depend on the surface properties and electron affinity of the semiconductor, and the work function of the metal. For SiC, barrier heights do not follow the Schottky Mott theory and are typically constrained to high values. In practice, the degree of dependence of barrier height on choice of metal has been determined to be dependent on the bulk semiconductor properties, the nature of the surface before contact formation and the interfacial chemistry. At practical SiC interfaces, interface states cause Fermi level pinning which results in the formation of a potential barrier. The interface states affect the charge transfer between the metal and the SiC, hence control the Schottky barrier height.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Metal deposition can be achieved by a variety of methods; the most common being electron-beam (e-beam) evaporation, sputtering, and thermal evaporation. Sputtering and e-beam evaporation is preferred over thermal evaporation for Ohmic contact metal deposition. The reason for this centers on the fact that thermal evaporation methods involve either a resistance-heated source (refractory metal coiled into a filament) or an evaporation source that is heated by rf induction (utilizing a BN crucible) which results in contamination of the charge from the heater or crucible. This contamination leads to unwanted impurities which adversely affect the electrical properties of the condensed Ohmic contact metal film. The method of metal deposition heavily influences the grain size, uniformity, and metal-epilayer interface properties of the condensed contact film. Grain boundaries serves as diffusion pathways, thus minimization of grain boundary area is desirable to control unwanted elemental diffusion. For the same metal deposited by sputtering and e-beam evaporation, the e-beam evaporated films will possess a much larger grain size, which translates to less grain boundary area and lower diffusion pathways. Additionally, larger grain metal films possess higher hardness values which influence the overall mechanical durability of the metal film. E-beam evaporated metal films also have less gas incorporation in the condensed films than sputtered metal films, and as a result have a higher level of film purity. However, the film-substrate adhesion is usually enhanced for sputtered films since the condensing atoms have higher energy with respect to e-beam deposited films. Both e-beam and sputter deposition produce large area uniform films. The method of metal deposition is often determined by the choice of metal to be deposited, for example, since refractory metals are not easily deposited via e-beam evaporation, sputter deposition is preferred. Additionally, the metal deposition method is usually a strong function of equipment availability.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Deposition of an intermetallic Ohmic contact such as X<sub>2</sub>Y can be accomplished by sequential e-beam evaporation of each component layer (X and Y) separately with the correct thickness so as to achieve the correct stoichiometric ratio of 2X:1Y followed by a post metal deposition annealing step to achieve the uniform intermetallic phase, X<sub>2</sub>Y. Alternatively, the intermetallic phase X<sub>2</sub>Y can be produced by the sequential co-sputtering of two source targets (target #1 is composition X and target #2 is composition Y) such that two layers, X and Y, are deposited with the proper thickness and post metal deposition annealed in order to achieve the uniform intermetallic phase X<sub>2</sub>Y with the correct stoichiometric composition 2X:1Y. A single compound target with composition X<sub>2</sub>Y can also be sputter deposited onto the SiC substrate or SiC substrate with SiC epilayer, however the proper 2X:1Y stoichiometry is not easily achieved via this deposition technique. The physical vapor deposition technique, pulsed laser ablation deposition (PLD) has been extensively employed for the preparation/deposition of high quality thin films of multi-component metal-oxide ceramics. The principle desirable feature of PLD is that it is a non-equilibrium evaporation process which produces an intense plasma plume and transfers the target composition/stoichiometry (particularly metallic constituents in the multi-component systems) into the deposited film on a substrate. Thus, PLD is an excellent method for depositing an intermetallic phase X<sub>2</sub>Y (Ni<sub>2</sub>Si) onto a substrate (n-SiC) or SiC substrate with SiC epilayer where precise stoichiometric composition is necessary to achieve a highly conductive low resistivity metal film for Ohmic contact formation (such as Ni<sub>2</sub>Si-n-SiC).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Post metal deposition annealing is usually required to achieve Ohmic behavior in the deposited metal films on SiC. Annealing of metal contact-SiC structures has been achieved via conventional furnace annealing (CFA) and rapid thermal annealing (RTA). The choice of ambient annealing gas influences the electrical properties of Ohmic contact significantly. For CFA, the ambient atmosphere can range from vacuum annealing where metal oxidation is an issue, to flowing N<sub>2</sub>, Ar, and forming gas. The most common RTA ambient gases are N<sub>2</sub>, Ar, and forming gas. CFA requires longer processing times with respect to RTA and thus often enhances unwanted elemental diffusion. For annealing some contact metals to SiC the thermally induced interfacial reactions which are responsible for Ohmic behavior demand narrow time-temperature process windows, thus favoring rapid thermal processing. Specifically, RTA is a fast thermal processing method, 1-100 sec, which provides the advantages of (a) reduced thermal budget (anneal temperature×anneal time), and (b) rapid heating and cooling rates in the range of 30-500° C./sec. These advantages are critical to the formation of good Ohmic contacts since the desired interfacial phase formation usually occurs at some temperature (T<sub>1</sub>) for a time (t<sub>1</sub>), after which the processing temperature can be reduced rapidly by as much as 50° C. in 1 sec. Thus, undesired contact metal-SiC phase formation/phenomena having different activation energy than the desired contact metal-SiC phase formation are almost completely suppressed since only a fraction of a second would be available for the undesirable process or phase formation. The most common annealing method for SiC contact technology is RTA, but again, like metal deposition methods, the annealing mode is often a function of equipment availability.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Optimum contact performance is not only influenced by the material processing and design elements described above, but also relies on strict adherence to a set of fundamental contact-semiconductor requirements. Currently, there are several critical requirements for Ohmic contacts which must be satisfied in order to achieve high performance reliable SiC based devices. The most prominent of these is the attainment of a reproducible low specific contact resistance value. Additionally, the Ohmic contact must not significantly perturb device performance. In other words, the contact must supply the required current density with a voltage drop that is significantly small compared with the drop across the active region of the device. The contact must also possess good mechanical properties, that is, good metal adhesion during formation, subsequent processing and in service device operation. The metallization must not cause excessive stress in the underlying semiconductor since this can result in alteration of electronic characteristics. The Ohmic contact must be temporally and thermally stable. Additionally, the Ohmic contact must be environmentally stable under prolonged bias-temperature stress, humidity, and reactive ambient conditions. The contact metal-semiconductor interface must be uniform, shallow, and abrupt. In the case of alloyed contacts, the metal-semiconductor interface phase(s) must be laterally homogenous. This uniformity of metal-semiconductor interfacial reactions serves to minimize the spread in contact resistance values, suppress current nonuniformity and improve device reliability. The metallization must have a smooth surface morphology, which is critical for device wire bonding. Fabrication of the Ohmic contacts must be controllable and reproducible, that is, reactions and other properties which govern the contact resistance must be reproducible and the contact fabrication must be compatible with semiconductor processing. Finally, the drive towards lower contact processing temperatures should be adhered to whenever possible. This is critical for device integration issues, namely, integration of materials with differing thermal stability within a single device (heterostructures) and/or integration of several devices, composed of different materials, on a common substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">SiC is an excellent candidate for high temperature and high power device applications because of its combination of electronic and thermal properties, namely, wide energy bandgap, high electric breakdown field, large saturated electron drift velocity and high thermal conductivity. Based on these properties, devices fabricated from SiC promise superior performance to that of present day devices. Rapid advances in the growth, doping, and processing of SiC have led to the realization of several electronic and photonic devices including fast recovery high voltage diodes, metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), metal semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs), static induction transistors (SITs), junction field effect transistors (JFETs), UV photodiodes, and SiC bipolar devices, bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and hybrid bipolar transistors (HBTs). The wide bandgap and high thermal conductivity are attractive for high temperature digital integrated circuits and nonvolatile solid-state memories. Although progress with SiC based electronic devices has been encouraging, there are significant challenges to overcome in the development of physically, chemically, and electrically stable and reliable multilevel metallization technology capable of high packing density. An important requirement of all device technologies is the development of electrical contacts with low specific contact resistance and high stability and long term reliability. Ohmic contacts with low specific contact resistance and good thermal stability are necessary to obtain optimum performance from high temperature, high power, and high frequency devices. As the device dimensions continue to decrease, much more stringent requirements are being placed on the material, processing, and electrical performance of low resistance Ohmic contacts. Metallization of wide bandgap semiconductors (SiC) is complicated, particularly because of their high surface reactivity, low doping concentrations, and high density of interface states.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Nickel Ohmic contacts are deemed the industry standard contacts for SiC devices. Nickel Ohmic contacts to n-SiC possess a low specific contact resistance (ρ<sub>c</sub>) less than 5.0×10<sup>−5 </sup>Ω-cm<sup>2</sup>, and good physical thermal stability at temperatures up to 500° C. for ˜100 h. In addition, from the point of electrical integrity, nickel Ohmic contacts to n-SiC are reproducible.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is known that Ni-nSiC Ohmic contacts are formed by depositing pure metallic nickel on the n-SiC substrate or n-SiC substrate with SiC epilayer. This intermediate (Ni—SiC) is then furnace annealed at temperatures of about 950° C. for 2 to 5 minutes or rapid thermal annealed (RTA) at temperatures of about 950° to 1000° C. for 30 s-60 s. Annealing results in the formation of the intermetallic phase Ni-silicide (N<sub>2</sub>Si) overlying the SiC substrate or n-SiC substrate with SiC epilayer material. The resulting Ohmic contact composition is represented by the chemical formula Ni<sub>2</sub>Si—SiC. Formation of Ni<sub>2</sub>Si by annealing Ni—SiC at 950° C. to 1000° C. has been reported to cause a lower resistance of the initial Ni—SiC contact. Therefore, it is actually this Ni<sub>2</sub>Si—SiC composition and not pure Ni intermediate contact that displays the low specific contact resistance reported above.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It has been reported that the high temperature annealing process used to form this Ni<sub>2</sub>Si—SiC Ohmic contacts results in several undesirable features which cause device reliability issues and ultimate device failure. These features include:</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Substantial broadening of the contact layer thickness or metal-SiC interface expansion. The increase in contact thickness via consumption of the SiC substrate or n-SiC substrate with SiC epilayer is due to the high reactivity of Ni with Si to form Ni-silicide leaving behind both voids and unreacted carbon. Annealing the Ni—SiC contact results in a contact thickness increase of ≧100%. Such an increase in contact thickness makes the annealed Ni—SiC Ohmic contact not useable for device designs which posses shallow p-n junctions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A rough interface morphology heavily laden with Kirkendall voids. The voids, (resulting from the high reactivity of Ni with Si) at the interface will cause internal stress and possible delamination of the contact layer, which will compromise device reliability. The internal stress and contact delamination will be significantly amplified under the extreme thermal and electrical stresses typical of the power device operational environment and will ultimately result in device failure. The rough interface morphology makes the annealed Ni—SiC Ohmic contact not useable for device designs which posses shallow p-n junctions. Thus loss of a sharp interface will compromise device designs which possess shallow p-n junctions.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Carbon segregation at the metal-SiC interface and/or throughout the metal layer. It is known, via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of the annealed contact, that carbon is in the graphite state and that Si is bonded predominantly to Ni resulting in Ni-silicide formation. Dissociation of SiC, to Si and C in the presence of Ni atoms is possible at temperatures above 400° C. Thus, the dissociation of SiC at the Ni/SiC interface to Si and C is due to the reactivity of Ni. Carbon inclusions at the metal-SiC interface and/or within the contact layer are considered a potential source of electrical instability, especially after prolonged operation of the devices at high temperatures. At elevated temperatures redistribution of carbon inclusions will arise, resulting in significant degradation of the contact's electrical and microstructural properties.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Substantial roughening of the contact surface (on the order of tens of nanometers). For many device applications Ohmic contacts must be wire bonded to a die package. A rough surface morphology will most likely cause wire bonding difficulty and/or failure under the extreme thermal fatigue during high power and high temperature device operation. Additionally, rough surface morphology is not desirable for high current applications because it causes non-uniformity of current flow. In addition, contact surface roughness results in residual material stresses that may induce SiC polytype changes. Alteration of the SiC polytype also alters the electrical properties. For example, a polytype change from 4H to 6H degrades the electron mobility of the SiC and degrades the device.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Therefore, even though Ni contacts possess excellent electrical properties, the above mentioned features will lead to device reliability problems and ultimately cause device failure via contact degradation and/or wire bond failure after exposure to long term high power and high temperature device operational stresses. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) displays a cross sectional view schematic of the e-beam as-deposited Ni-nSiC Ohmic contact. A cross sectional view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph (showing the above mentioned undesirable features: residual carbon <b>101</b>, void formation <b>102</b>, rough surface morphology <b>103</b> and <b>105</b> and extreme contact broadening or interface broadening <b>104</b>) of the 950° C. annealed Ni—SiC is displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>).

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">All of the above mentioned phenomena have led the inventors to seek a method of forming a Ni<sub>2</sub>Si-nSiC Ohmic contact in the absence of the undesirable phenomena (residual carbon, void formation, rough surface morphology and extreme contact broadening or interface broadening) associated with the annealing of pure Ni-nSiC Ohmic contacts. The inventors have fabricated an improved Ohmic contact to n-SiC via direct deposition of the intermetallic phase, Ni<sub>2</sub>Si, known to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with SiC at high temperatures (900-1000° C.).</p>

Prior to metal deposition the wafers were cleaned in warm electronic grade trichoroethane (TCA), acetone and methanol followed by a rinse in deionized water. The Ni<sub>2</sub>Si metallization was pulse laser ablated from a Ni<sub>2</sub>Si (99.9% pure) source target under a base vacuum of less than 1.0×10<sup>−6 </sup>Torr using a Lambda Physik Complex <b>205</b> excimer laser (KrF-248 nanometer laser).

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">This process is shown in greater detail by a flow diagram showing the individual steps to the deposition/annealing process in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>).

Step <b>270</b>: the Ni<sub>2</sub>Si-n-type SiC Ohmic contact undergoes rapid thermal annealing in N<sub>2 </sub>ambient for 30 s at 950° C.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Subsequent to deposition the Ni<sub>2</sub>Si—SiC samples were rapid thermally annealed (RTA) in an AG Associates RTA for 30 sec at 700° C. and 950° C. Material characterization was performed on the PLD as-deposited and annealed samples. The contacts electrical quality was evaluated via current voltage characteristics using a HP 4140B semiconductor test system. The contacts composition, thickness, and interface quality was determined via Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) analysis with a NEC Pelletron accelerator using a 2 MeV He<sup>+</sup> ion beam with a scattering angle of 170° and a solid angle of 5.5 msr. Simulations were produced using the computer code RUMP. The contact structure was analyzed by glancing angle x-ray diffraction (GAXRD) with a Siemens D-5005 powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at 50 kV and 40 mA. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) was employed to assess elemental distribution within the contact and across the contact-SiC interface. AES analyses were obtained using a Perkin Elmer PH1660 scanning Auger microprobe. A Hitachi S4500 field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was utilized to assess the contact surface morphology, contact-SiC interface uniformity and film microstructure. DI Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to quantify the contacts surface roughness.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The electrical, structural, compositional, and interfacial properties of the PLD Ni<sub>2</sub>Si Ohmic contacts to n-SiC have been investigated as a function of annealing temperature. The I-V characteristics of the PLD as-deposited and annealed contacts to n-SiC are displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The as-deposited sample exhibited non-Ohmic behavior suggestive of a large barrier height. Annealing at 700° C. caused no improvement in the I-V characteristics. However, annealing at 950° C. resulted in excellent Ohmic behavior as demonstrated by the I-V characteristics which possess linear characteristics with small resistance and is symmetric with reversal of voltage polarity. Thus, annealing at 950° C. significantly enhanced the current conduction through the contacts. The fact that a thermal anneal was required to achieve good Ohmic behavior suggests that some minute reaction must have occurred. Such as interfacial reaction may have eliminated some interfacial contaminants (e.g. thin oxide layer) thereby releasing Fermi level pinning and inducing Ohmic behavior.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In order to assess and understand the contacts electrical characteristics RBS, GAXRD, AES, and FESEM analyses were performed on the PLD as-deposited and annealed contacts. The RBS spectra for the Ni<sub>2</sub>Si—SiC contacts are displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The surface energies of the film elements are marked by arrows. The high energy edge of the Si signal from the SiC substrate is shifted to lower energies with respect to that of the Si in the Ni<sub>2</sub>Si film, because the detected particles that are backscattered there lose energy in the overlying film. From the energy width of the Ni signal the contact thickness was determined to be ˜400 nm. The width of the Ni signal is the same for the as-deposited and 700° C. annealed sample, however, the 950° C. sample is slightly thinner as indicated by the higher energy position of the back edge of the Ni signal and front edge of the Si signal in SiC. The thinner film, 950° C. sample, is due to non-uniformity of the PLD process. Slight variations in film thickness across a PLD deposited film are inherent to the deposition technique since PLD maintains uniformity on a scale of ˜1×1 cm<sup>2</sup>. However, since Ohmic contact dimensions are on the scale of 10 s to 100 s of microns this non-uniformity of ˜1×1 cm<sup>2 </sup>is negligible and does not pose an issue for device manufacture. The fact that the back edge of the Ni signal did not shift to lower energies (width of the Ni signal did not increase) as a result of annealing indicates that there is no increase of the vertical dimension of the contact (that is, no broadening of the contact layer or interface expansion) as a result of annealing. The contact-SiC interface quality was assessed by comparing the slopes of the front edge of the Si signal in SiC and the back edge of the back edge of the Ni signal of the as-deposited spectrum with those of the annealed spectra. The slopes of the as-deposited and annealed contacts appear virtually identical, indicating a minimal amount of interaction between the contact and SiC as a result of annealing required for Ohmic contact formation.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The GAXRD data for the contacts annealed at 700° C. and 950° C. confirmed the presence of the Ni<sub>2</sub>Si phase. The AES depth profiles for the as-deposited and 950° C. annealed contacts are displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>). AES elemental depth profile for the PLD as-deposited sample shows a very sharp interface between the contact metallization and the SiC substrate or n-SiC substrate with SiC epilayer, however, slight oxygen enrichment is observed at the contact-SiC interface. The interfacial oxygen is most likely due to lack of an oxide etch step prior to the metal deposition. The AES depth profile for the 950° C. annealed sample shows the contact-SiC interface to be chemically abrupt with no interfacial oxygen present or signs of elemental interdiffusion. The high temperature, 950° C., anneal appears to have caused dissolution of the interfacial oxide, which in turn prompted the excellent electrical properties of this contact. The negligible level of the carbon signal within the annealed contact and at the contact-SiC interface indicates that no residual carbon is present within the film or accumulated at the interface as a result of the high temperature annealing process. The absence of residual carbon within the contact metallization is extremely desirable from the standpoint of device reliability. Carbon inclusions at the metal-SiC interface and/or within the contact layer are considered a potential source of electrical instability, especially after prolonged operation of the devices at high temperatures. At elevated temperatures redistribution of carbon inclusions will arise, resulting in significant degradation of the contact's electrical and microstructural properties. Thus, the direct deposition of Ni<sub>2</sub>Si served to eliminate carbon accumulation within the film and at the metal-SiC interface.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> displays the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) secondary electron cross-sectional micrographs of the as-deposited and 950° C. annealed contacts to SiC. For both the PLD as-deposited and annealed samples, the metal-SiC interfaces were morphologically abrupt and the contact layer thickness/interface width remained unchanged and uniform over large lateral distances with no evidence of void formation or contact delamination as a result of the annealing process.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Plan-view field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) micrographs, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, of the as-deposited and annealed contacts show the surfaces to be homogenous, smooth, crack and pinhole free. Quantification of the surface roughness was achieved via AFM. The average root mean square roughness values (R<sub>rms</sub>) for the PLD as-deposited and 950° C. annealed contacts were 0.037 nm and 0.067 nm respectively. The extreme surface smoothness of the annealed Ni<sub>2</sub>Si contact promotes strong reliable wire bonding and will ensure maintenance of wire-contact mechanical durability during high power and high temperature device operation. In addition, a smooth surface morphology ensures current uniformity and retention of the original SiC polytype with its inherent electrical properties.</p>
