<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/790,455 filed Feb. 22, 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,745,603.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">My invention relates to the structure and operation of a previously installed mechanical door lock which is upgraded with override electromagnetic lock components. In particular my invention relates to electromagnetic locking components and deadbolt (or hook bolt), all of which are enclosed within a hollow doorframe casing. However, my new lock is also adaptable to other doors or other closed containers or spaces which require a fail-secure electronic locking component which overrides previously installed mechanical locking components.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the preferred embodiment, my integrated lock is best suited to narrow stile doors, such as doors generally comprised of a glass core with a surrounding hollow metal frame. The lateral longitudinal plate comprises a longitudinal surface from which the bar or bolt extends through a rectangular opening. In addition to this lateral longitudinal plate, my invention comprises anterior and posterior plates. A longitudinal edge of each anterior or posterior plate is attached to a corresponding edge of the lateral longitudinal plate and forms a three-sided enclosure with two right angles.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the preferred embodiment of my invention, the mechanical deadbolt operates from a fully extended position to a fully retracted position within the rectangular opening through an arc of 90 degrees. The operating mechanism comprises a rocking lever mounted perpendicular to the deadbolt. The rocking lever physically engages the deadbolt through pins and slot connections.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The cylindrical lock in my preferred embodiment is of the conventional type operable by a key. This lock cylinder carries a cylindrical extended shaft in which the key is inserted. The cylindrical extended shaft comprises a rotating cam member that attaches to the extended shaft's interior end with two screws. The operator rotates this cylindrical extended shaft clockwise or counterclockwise by turning the key within it.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The inner end of the deadbolt is bifurcated, and the legs formed therefrom contain arcuate shaped apertures. The legs are pivotally attached to the lower end of a rocking lever by a pivot pin which extends though the lower portion of the rocking lever. The rocking lever is physically positioned above the deadbolt and is adjacent to the lock cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Two opposing roller cams are mounted on a sleeve, and the sleeve ends move in a limited manner within curved apertures within each anterior or posterior plate. Each of these apertures in each plate is arcuate and at its ends each has upwardly extending grooves. In operating the rocking lever, there is engagement of each opposing roller cam within each anterior and posterior plate and within the lever, by which each roller cam moves within the limits of a keyhole shaped aperture within the rocking lever.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">My invention does not change the function, purpose or intent of the prior art mechanical locking device: to secure the door against physical tampering. Instead, my new door lock provides a second level of security in addition to the conventional mechanical key method. With my new electromagnetic lock, a person (i) initially must have a card, fob or a correct code to enter onto a key pad, to (ii) subsequently release the keyed cylinder shaft for rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A second level of security is important when business owners confront certain days and/or hours in which it is difficult, impossible or very expensive for a locksmith to make a service call and re-key the locks. In contrast, with my invention the business owner easily recodes an access control device without requiring a professional locksmith.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Installation of my invention alleviates this problem by addition of the following to the existing mechanical deadbolt or hook bolt:</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">1) solenoid or other magnetic field generating device;</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">2) a solenoid cylindrical casing which connects the solenoid to a prior mechanical installed lock component;</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">3) a hollow stem inserted in the cavity of the solenoid cylindrical casing with a locking portion attached thereto; and</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">4) a small spring between the hollow stem and hollow cavity within the solenoid cylindrical casing,</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The access control portion of the electronic portion of my invention includes:</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">1) an exterior door or frame mounted reader (i.e, proximity, magnetic swipe, biometrics hand, finger or eye reader, bar code reader, Dallas touch chip reader, digital push button keypad reader, etc.);</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">2) a door controller device which contains a circuit board, including but limited to memory e-prompt components, relay battery and wire connectors;</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">3) a transformer power supply and the appropriate wire connecting components.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When combined with stand alone or audit controlled computer based systems, such an access control system enables the business owner to create a report showing authorized employee access with the appropriate time and date. The door controller device identifies, via the reader, the previous entered information as to who can or cannot gain access. The door controller device can also electronically add or delete authorized users. The authorized person inserts his key, rotates the extendible shaft or pivot pin, and gains access only after the card access system has enabled the authorized person to gain access.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When the door control time has expired, usually about five or six seconds) the power rapidly ceases, thereby preventing the key from turning within the exterior cylinder lock. To comply with relevant fire codes, the interior keyed cylinder lock (or non-keyed thumb turn) on the interior surface of the doorframe cannot be controlled by the cam retaining locking bar. The absence of cam retaining locking bar control thereby allows persons unrestricted egress from a room or building interior in emergencies.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The process of installation of the electromagnetic component is another feature of my invention. My novel process of installation provides a significant economic advantage for, but not exclusively, commercial office space or privately owned businesses within large buildings. In these buildings, locks can be simultaneously upgraded with electronic security components without replacement or modification of a door component.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, with my invention no new apertures are cut into the hollow metal doorframe casing to accommodate more expensive magnetic lock or electric strike hardware. Using my process, the operator removes the lateral, anterior and posterior plates and inserts a solenoid and associated components within the hollow metal doorframe casing.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The prior art discloses numerous mechanical locks cooperating with electrical components. However, these electrical components are not designed for installation after the mechanical locking component is installed within the doorframe. U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,997 (Milman) discloses a cylindrical barrel type lock wherein rotation of the barrel is prevented by one or more armatures. These armatures in turn are actuated by an electromagnet.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">U.S. Pat. No. 5,542,274 (Thordmark et al.) discloses a cylinder lock comprising a key operated cylinder plug. A latching element is located near the boundary surface between the lock cylinder and a plug. There is also an electrical blocking element which moves between a release position and a blocking position. U.S. Pat. No. 3,733,861 (Lester) discloses an early electronic recognition door lock. Lester also comprises a solenoid which is activated to withdraw an abutment member from a laterally sliding door bolt mechanism. U.S. Pat. No. 5,469,727 (Spahn et al.) discloses an electronic lock cylinder comprising a housing with a cylindrical core.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Electronic control circuits are coupled inductively via coils for transmission of coding information. There is separate assembly of the mechanical components and of the electronic components of the lock cylinder. Spahn's electronic lock cylinder differs in part from my pending invention in that there is no disclosure of a process which integrates the electronic and mechanical components after prior installation of the mechanical component within a door frame.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">U.S. Pat. No. 5,136,870 (Gartner et al.) discloses an electronic door lock. A digitally operated code input pad assembly enters a first code and a second code to open a second lock mechanism with the door spring bolt. These locks are adaptable for replacement of an ordinary deadbolt lock mechanism. However, Gartner's lock does not provide for subsequent installation within a doorframe of only the electronic lock component at a minimum cost and destruction of the doorframe.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Other early locks have even less technically in common with respect to upgrades with my present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 4,916,927 (O'Connell et al.) discloses a lock in which a solenoid can move an obstructing element entire into a recess. The presence or absence of the solenoid's magnetic field prevents turning of the shaft within a key cylinder. However, O'Connell's device must be installed with all its components simultaneously into a doorframe.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">U.S. Pat. No. 4,831,851 (Larson) discloses a lock mechanism comprising a mechanical combination lock and an electronic lock. The mechanical combination lock serves as a fail-safe entry in case of failure of the electronic lock. However, this lock is specifically applicable to small safe deposit boxes.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,784 (Gartner) discloses an electronic dial combination lock. U.S. Pat. No. 3,748,878 (Balzano et al.), discloses an electrically controlled manual unit for a door lock. This lock also comprises a cylinder which contains a solenoid. The solenoid is energized to engage a clutch for rotation of the knob and connecting cam. Balzon's system, however, does not comprise an electronic component which can be installed subsequent to the mechanical lock unit within a door frame.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">U.S. Pat. No. 5,636,880 (Miller)discloses an electronic lock which comprises a dead latch assembly for narrow stile locks, but not necessarily a hollow metal door frame casing comprising a door.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">No distinct solenoid housing, cylindrical solenoid casing, or cam retaining locking bar is disclosed as described by Applicant, infra.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, the operation of Miller's lock differs from that of Applicant's as it does not comprise a free standing electronically controlled obstructing component. In contrast, Applicant's electronically controlled element (cam retaining locking bar with attached stem and spring) rises within a magnetic field, and falls vertically in zero magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">My locking devise integrates previously installed mechanical locks with electronically controlled components which override entry-authorizing mechanical lock components. In particular, my new electromagnetic lock easily replaces a previously installed mechanical deadbolt with an improved electromechanically controlled deadbolt or hookbolt. My new lock is especially suited for small business properties with numerous narrow stile deadbolts, but who require a “second level” of electronic security. My lock installation also reduces costs and installation time from conventional locks with access control.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The scope of my invention includes physical and mechanical modifications of a variety of existing electronic and mechanical locking systems. However, my preferred embodiment is that of electronic upgrades to the deadbolt key activated device described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The addition of a solenoid or equivalent electromagnetic device with a hollow stem and attached cam-retaining locking bar to any pre-existing mechanical lock is common to all embodiments of my invention, be it for doorframe casings or other egress entrance structures. In the preferred embodiment, the assembling operator attaches a solenoid/cam retaining locking bar above the mechanical locking components previously installed within a hollow metal doorframe casing.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Accordingly, one purpose of my invention is to integrate mechanical lock components previously installed within hollow glass/metal door frames with a variety of existing or future access controlled locking devices, particularly those of a proximity access code reader variety.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Another purpose of my invention is to lower the cost per door frame of upgrading existing mechanical locks with electronic security features, such as electric strikes and magnetic locks.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Another purpose of my invention is to provide small businesses with hollow glass/aluminum doors to economically obtain secure and affordable access control locking devices to these doors.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, my new cam retaining locking bar greatly decrease a vandal's breakage of a locked door by wrenching the keyed cylinder with pliers or a wrench. These and other aspects of my invention will become apparent in the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and other embodiments of my invention.</p>

<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Introduction</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">My electromagnetic integrated lock <b>1</b> comprises electromagnetic lock components with integrated prior art dead bolts <b>10</b> or hook bolts <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Each deadbolt <b>10</b> or hook bolt <b>10</b><i>a </i>was previously installed within a predetermined metal hollow doorframe casing <b>22</b> which comprises a door. The great advantage of my integrated lock is enhanced security without undue destruction of the existing hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b> and previously installed mechanical lock components.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">My integrative lock components fit within any hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b>, but most preferably within a narrow stile glass core/aluminum doorframe casing. Other door frames with similar material, mechanical and other physical properties are also within the scope of my invention. Also included within my invention are integrated lock components for other securing and secured structures, such as safe deposit boxes or safes. These other secured structures must comprise the necessary space and wiring to place and connect the lock.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">My invention also comprises the method for installing an electromagnetic field generating device into a glass core/aluminum doorframe casing <b>22</b> containing a previously installed mechanical deadbolt <b>10</b> or hook bolt <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Using this method, the operator attaches a solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>and cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>with hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>above a pre-existing rocking lever <b>14</b> and deadbolt <b>10</b> within doorframe casing <b>22</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0115">The mechanical components of my invention operate as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0116">Extending shaft <b>35</b> rotates as force is applied through an authorized key <b>152</b>. Rotating movement of rotating cam <b>56</b><i>a </i>causes protruding member <b>56</b><i>a </i>to rotate downward. While rotating downward, protruding member <b>56</b><i>a </i>directly pushes upon first opposing roller cam <b>202</b> or second opposing roller cam <b>204</b>(depending upon whether these predetermined lock components are mounted in a left handed or right handed orientation). This direct force results in rotating cam <b>56</b> pushing against opposing roller cams <b>202</b> or <b>204</b>, and thereby stretching small springs <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b</i>. This direct force upon first opposing roller cam <b>202</b> and second opposing roller cam <b>204</b> also simultaneously pushes both opposing roller cams <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> downward through bulbular slot <b>14</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0117">First and second opposing roller cams <b>202</b>,<b>204</b> respectively move downward through bulbular slot <b>14</b><i>d </i>as long as rotating cam's force exceeds that of stretched first and second small springs <b>18</b><i>a</i>,<b>18</b><i>b</i>. Sleeve ends <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>move through curved apertures <b>86</b>,<b>88</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0118">Stretched small spring <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>now push sleeve ends <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>respectively upwardly into upwardly extending short grooves <b>90</b><i>aa</i>,<b>90</b><i>bb</i>, and <b>990</b><i>cc</i>, <b>90</b><i>dd </i>respectively. At the same time, lever pivot pin <b>50</b> travels downward within upper arcuate slot <b>37</b>, causing deadbolt <b>10</b> to rotate around bolt pivot pin <b>39</b> and retract deadbolt <b>10</b> to an open unlocked position.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0119">When rotating cam <b>56</b> is rotated, sleeve ends <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>move through curved apertures <b>86</b> or <b>88</b> respectively. This movement occurs when sleeve ends <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>are pushed upwardly by first small spring <b>18</b><i>a </i>and a second small spring <b>18</b><i>b</i>. Movement to a retracted position by deadbolt <b>10</b> and lever <b>14</b> ceases when sleeve ends <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>respectively finally lodge within upwardly extending short grooves <b>90</b><i>bb</i>, and <b>90</b><i>dd </i>respectively. Please see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>g. </i></p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0120">Conversely, during a transition from a retracted position to the usual locked sleeve ends <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>move in the opposite direction within first and second curved apertures <b>86</b>,<b>88</b> respectively. When returning to a locked position, each sleeve end <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>moves through curved apertures <b>86</b>,<b>88</b> respectively until lodged within upwardly extending first and second grooves <b>90</b><i>aa</i>, <b>90</b><i>cc </i>respectively. The position of rocking lever <b>14</b> and deadbolt is mechanically held in place within grooves <b>90</b><i>cc </i>and grooves <b>90</b><i>bb. </i></p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0121">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>g</i>, deadbolt <b>10</b> is in a retracted unlocked position. To lock, key <b>152</b> now twists in the opposite direction or until rotating cam <b>56</b> is restored to its original vertical position. At the same time the tension of first and second small springs <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>forces rocking lever <b>14</b> and deadbolt <b>10</b> to a default lock position again.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0122">When key <b>152</b> rotates and is then removed from cylinder lock <b>66</b>, rotating cam <b>56</b> rotates to its original vertical position.

For other embodiments, hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>is made from stainless steel pins. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>c</i>, hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>does not function or comprise a piston, because pistons are solid cylinders or disks which move back and forth in a larger cylinder under fluid pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0152">In the preferred embodiment, attached to hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>is cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b</i>. Cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>comprises a length <b>118</b><i>aa</i>, a width <b>118</b><i>bb</i>, and a thickness <b>118</b><i>c</i>. Cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>also comprises a small army <b>118</b><i>g </i>and a small ovoid slot <b>118</b><i>d </i>which grips hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0139" num="0153">The measurements of cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>in the preferred embodiment are approximately as follows: 6/8 inch in width, 1 and ¼ inch in length, and 1/16 inch in thickness. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>abuts rocking lever <b>14</b> and is parallel to longitudinal surfaces <b>14</b><i>e</i>,<b>14</b><i>f </i>of rocking lever <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0154">Hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>is approximately 3/16 inch in diameter and approximately 1 and ⅜ inches in length.

However, other attachment devices of hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>and cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>are also within the scope of my invention.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0155">Tension from third spring <b>123</b> against cylindrical solenoid casing <b>1</b><i>b </i>tends to return hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>and cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>to a lower position. Compression of third spring <b>123</b> against cylindrical casing surface <b>1</b><i>dd </i>also prevents inadvertent permanent magnetization of hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a</i>. Third small spring <b>123</b> pushes downward upon hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>and forces hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>from top metal surface <b>1</b><i>dd </i>of cylindrical solenoid casing <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0156">However, hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a</i>'s downward vertical movement is simultaneously limited by the rectangular notch of cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>around protruding member <b>56</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0146" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates my integrated lock components when posterior plate <b>26</b>, metal solenoid housing <b>150</b> and cylindrical solenoid casing <b>1</b><i>b </i>are removed. Rocking lever <b>14</b> is adjacent to cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>containing third spring <b>123</b> in default locked position. Hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>containing third spring <b>123</b> lies partially within solenoid housing <b>150</b> and solenoid casing <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0161">Cylindrical solenoid casing <b>1</b><i>b </i>stands within metal solenoid housing <b>150</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, my integrated invention operates as follows in the preferred embodiment and best mode:</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0162">When solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>generates a magnetic field, its force lines are concentrated primarily through hollow solenoid cavity <b>1</b><i>c</i>. When this field presents within hollow solenoid cavity <b>1</b><i>c</i>, then cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>moves vertically upward until attached hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>is further within hollow solenoid cavity <b>1</b><i>c</i>. When power is added to solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>to generate a magnetic field, hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>with attached cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>elevates approximately ⅜ inch.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0163">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>c </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>now disengages rotating cam <b>56</b>. In this upper position, cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>no longer restricts rotating cam <b>56</b> from rotating downward. As a result, rotating cam member <b>56</b> is now unhindered and rotates away from its blocking position of extendible shaft <b>35</b>. Force from rotating key <b>152</b> causes protruding member <b>56</b><i>a </i>to abut and exert force upon first opposing roller came <b>202</b> and second opposing roller cam <b>204</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0164">When force is exerted by rotating cam <b>56</b> upon opposing roller cams <b>202</b>,<b>204</b>, lever pivot pin <b>50</b> slides downward within slot <b>37</b>. At the same time, sleeve ends <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>move within curved apertures <b>86</b>,<b>88</b>, and deadbolt pin <b>58</b> within slot <b>38</b> retracts deadbolt <b>10</b> to an open unlocked position, as described supra.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0165">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, when voltage to solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is discontinued, there is no magnetic field to elevate cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>(and attached hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a</i>) vertically upward. Cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>falls vertically downward to grasp protruding member <b>56</b><i>a</i>. Protruding member <b>56</b><i>a </i>physically blocks authorized key <b>152</b> from turning rotating shaft <b>35</b>. First and second opposing roller cams <b>202</b>, or <b>204</b>(depending upon whether this is a right handed or left handed assembly) now cannot initiate the mechanical events which result in retraction of deadbolt <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0166">Tension of third spring <b>123</b> also contributes force, to return to the lower gripping position of cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>and attached hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>when there is no magnetic field. Again referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref><i>b</i>), the electronic and mechanical components are in the default locked position when there is no magnetic field. Cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>grips protruding member <b>56</b><i>a </i>rigidly so that rotating cam <b>56</b> prevents force upon opposing roller cams <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0167">As a result, there is no force upon first and second opposing roller cams <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> to initiate deadbolt <b>10</b> retraction. Consequently, electronically controlled cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>overrides key <b>152</b> access, when there is no magnetic field to elevate cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>to a non-gripping position.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0168">In the preferred embodiment, my invention uses proximity access codes for identification of authorized access and subsequent generation of voltage across solenoid <b>1</b><i>a</i>. The process, known as radio frequency identification (RFID), is a method of reading an electronic key card <b>301</b> without physical contact between card <b>301</b> and reading device <b>302</b>. The user holds electronic key card <b>301</b> to a reading device <b>302</b>, and within the reading device's detection range, similarly to that of a television remote control device.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0169">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, immediately thereafter a continuous 125 kHz (kilohertz) electromagnetic field <b>304</b> radiates from a metal coil within reading device <b>302</b>. When reading device <b>302</b> detects electronic key card <b>301</b>, card coil <b>307</b> within card <b>301</b> detects excitation signal <b>306</b> from reading device <b>302</b>. Excitation signal <b>306</b> in turn generates a small current in card coil <b>307</b>. This current powers a small integrated circuit within electronic key card <b>301</b>, when card <b>301</b> contains a unique identification number.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0170">Card coil <b>307</b> within electronic key card <b>301</b> transmits this identification (ID) number using a 62.khz electromagnetic field (which is one-half the value of excitation signal <b>306</b>). This 62.5 kHz electromagnetic field is an analogue RF carrier for the digital I.D. number, and is the receive signal in reading device In this context, an analogue RF carrier is actually an antenna within key card <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0171">Reading device <b>302</b> transmits the receive signal to RF receiver <b>310</b> within door controller <b>311</b>. Door controller <b>311</b> processes, error checks and converts receive signal to a digital signal. RF receiver <b>310</b> sends the digital signal with the identification number to microprocessor <b>312</b> within door controller In the preferred embodiment, door controller <b>311</b> is a SM Intelliprox model SM 1000/2000 smart module.

<p id="p-0159" num="0173">Door controller <b>311</b> allows access by switching the appropriate electrical relays to send low voltage current to solenoid <b>1</b><i>a</i>. This low voltage to solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>results in a magnetic force field, which elevates cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>with attached hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>away from rotating cam <b>56</b>. The user can mount proximity code access reader <b>302</b> within hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b>(preferred), an adjacent hollow metal doorframe casing, or an edge doorframe casing.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0174">When the appropriate voltage (12 VAC, 16 VAC, 24 VAC, or 12 VDC, 16 VDC, 24 VDC) (where VAC indicates voltage, alternating current, and VDC indicates voltage, direct current)is applied to solenoid <b>1</b><i>a</i>, a magnetic field is created. However, the preferred solenoid voltage in my invention is approximately 16 VAC. After the appropriate time interval dictated by proximity access code reader <b>302</b>, the voltage to solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>is discontinued. A subsequent magnetic force field of solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>then initiates another door access cycle by elevating hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>into solenoid cavity <b>1</b><i>c</i>, until the voltage is again discontinued.</p>
<p id="h-0065" num="0000">Installation Process</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0175">Prior to installation of my modified lock, the operator must determine what is known as the back set of the predetermined doorframe casing <b>22</b> with which he is working. Each hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b> comprises one of the following back sets: 31/32 inch; ⅞ inch; and 1 and ½ inch.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0176">In this context, a ‘back set’ refers to the distance from edge <b>30</b><i>aa </i>or <b>30</b><i>bb </i>of lateral longitudinal plate <b>30</b> to the center of cylinder lock <b>66</b> when inserted through anterior plate <b>24</b>. Each hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b> is precut for one particular back set. As a result, each back set distance is different, thus predetermining the exact dimensions of cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b</i>. Hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b> is also pre-cut with two one and ¼ inch apertures <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b</i>. Cylinder lock <b>66</b> and thumb turn <b>43</b> insert into these apertures respectively, after reinstallation of deadbolt <b>10</b>, infra.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0177">Proper identification of the existing lock type is also important for a proper fit within anterior, posterior and lateral longitudinal plates <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> respectively. In addition, the operator determines door orientation, i.e., left handed or right handed. Determination of the left or right handed orientation of hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b> assures that the appropriate cylinder lock <b>66</b> for only an authorized key <b>152</b> has first rotating cam <b>56</b> attached to extended shaft <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0178">A right handed doorframe will have the lock on the right side of the door, when the operator is facing the doorframe casing's exterior surface. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>, in a left handed door swing, there is approximately ⅛ inch offset towards large circular aperture <b>38</b><i>a </i>to the left.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0179">In a right handed door swing, there is approximately ⅛ inch offset to the right towards large exterior circular aperture <b>38</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, a left-handed doorframe casing has the keyed lock on the left side of the exterior surface of the door, and the hinges on the right edge of the doorframe casing. Thumb turn <b>43</b> is unrestricted because there are no conventional key access pins or electronic access features. This lack of pins and electronic access is a requirement for fire and other safety ordinances in building codes.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0180">Whether a door is right handed or left handed is an initial determination well known to those in this particular industry. The modification of the width of cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>(as well as that of solenoid <b>1</b><i>a</i>) does not affect the installation of my electromagnetic locking device with the following back sets: 31/32 inch; ⅞ inch; one and ⅛ inch; and one and ⅙ inch. Presently, a 1 and ⅛ inch back set is the most marketed measurement in this particular industry.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0181">Opposite edge <b>118</b><i>d </i>of cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>is precut or custom adjusted for each individual hollow doorframe casing's particular back set. The increased length of opposite edge <b>118</b><i>d </i>allows cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>to fit within lateral longitudinal plate <b>30</b> and posterior solenoid housing opposing wall <b>150</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0182">These two rigid vertical surfaces physically restrict cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>from lateral movement. Lateral longitudinal plate <b>30</b> and opposing wall <b>150</b><i>c </i>also discourages attempts to force or jam cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b</i>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, door lock components are positioned above a typical prior art door handle <b>101</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0183">In the best mode and preferred embodiment of my invention, the installation of solenoid <b>1</b><i>a</i>, solenoid casing <b>1</b><i>b</i>, solenoid housing <b>1</b><i>c</i>, and cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>is as follows:</p>
<p id="h-0066" num="0000">Removal of Deadbolt</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0184">The operator first loosens three trim plate screws (not seen) from the attached trim plate(not seen) in the preferred embodiment. He then loosens set screws <b>36</b><i>c </i>which retain cylinder lock <b>66</b>(and/or thumb turn <b>43</b>) within plates <b>24</b> or <b>26</b>. He continues to loosen set screws <b>36</b><i>c </i>until cylinder lock <b>66</b> and thumb turn <b>43</b> are sufficiently loose to unthread and remove.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0185">After cylinder lock <b>66</b> and thumbscrew <b>43</b> are removed, the operator removes top screw <b>36</b><i>e </i>and bottom screw <b>36</b><i>f </i>which attach deadbolt within hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b>. After removal from doorframe casing <b>22</b>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), deadbolt <b>10</b>, along with other mechanical components between attached plates <b>24</b>,<b>26</b>,<b>30</b>, are placed in an upright position within a vise.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0186">The vise clamps lateral longitudinal plate <b>30</b>, as well as anterior plate <b>24</b> and posterior plate <b>26</b>. If the hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b> has no pre-welded mounting tabs <b>430</b><i>a</i>, <b>430</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>) attachable mounting tabs for glass/aluminum doors are available as:</p>

<p id="h-0069" num="0000">and Afco No. AF11.</p>
<p id="h-0070" num="0000">In these instances, the operator uses shorter screws to fasten tabs <b>430</b>,<b>430</b><i>a</i>, so that the shorter screws <b>36</b><i>a </i>do not interfere with electronics and metal solenoid housing <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0071" num="0000">Wiring and Installation of Electronic Related Components</p>

<p id="h-0079" num="0000">Insertion of Solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>and Other Components Into Hollow Metal Doorframe Casing <b>22</b></p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0196">Solenoid <b>1</b><i>a</i>, although now electrically connected through doorframe casing <b>22</b> by aperture <b>77</b>, remains exterior to hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b> at this point in the installation process. Anterior plate <b>24</b>, posterior plate <b>26</b> and lateral longitudinal plate <b>30</b> remain attached to each other, and within a vise as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0197">Turning now to the subassembly of the new components, in some embodiments the operator inserts solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>into cylindrical solenoid casing <b>1</b><i>b</i>. In the preferred embodiment, as described supra, solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>comes pre-sealed on a hollow spool <b>1</b><i>e </i>within solenoid cylindrical casing <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0198">The operator next takes cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>and attaches it to metal hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>by insertion of small knob <b>118</b><i>a </i>into ovoid slot <b>118</b><i>g</i>. The operator also inserts small spring <b>123</b> into metal hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a</i>. The operator slides assembled cam locking retaining bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>and hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a</i>, into cylindrical casing cavity <b>1</b><i>c</i>. The operator aligns cam-retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>and cylindrical solenoid casing <b>1</b><i>b </i>within a predetermined metal solenoid housing <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0199">The operator now inserts a Dremel® wheel through large circular aperture <b>38</b><i>a</i>. He severs sleeve <b>192</b> and large pin <b>192</b><i>a </i>immediately adjacent to rocking lever <b>14</b>, and on the surface <b>14</b><i>e</i>, <b>14</b><i>f </i>which will abut cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b</i>. Whether the operator severs on first longitudinal surface lever <b>14</b><i>e </i>or second longitudinal lever surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>depends upon whether hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b> is right-handed or left-handed. As noted supra, this is predetermined in a manner well known in this particular industry. Please see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0200">Alternatively and in other modes, the operator can obtain precut mechanical lock components which are pre-cut for a right handed or left-handed installation. Generally, first longitudinal lever surface <b>14</b><i>e </i>requires large sleeve <b>192</b> and large pin <b>192</b><i>a </i>severed for a right-handed installation. Second longitudinal lever surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>requires sleeve <b>192</b> and pin <b>192</b><i>a </i>to be severed for a left handed doorframe installation.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0201">Using a hand drill or drill press with a ¼ inch drill bit, the operator now removes that portion of large pin <b>192</b><i>a </i>which remains attached to anterior plate <b>24</b>. The operator also sands first longitudinal lever surface <b>14</b><i>e </i>or second longitudinal lever surface <b>14</b><i>f </i>until either surface is smooth and flat (depending again upon whether the handle assembly is right handed or left handed).</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0202">The distance between anterior plate interior surface <b>24</b><i>b </i>and posterior plate interior surface <b>26</b><i>b </i>is slightly more than ⅝ of an inch. Similarly, the width and depth of metal solenoid housing <b>150</b> are both slightly less than ⅝ inch. This means that after large sleeve <b>192</b> and large pin <b>192</b><i>a </i>are removed, the operator can push metal solenoid housing downward so that mechanical fasteners attach metal solenoid housing <b>150</b> to anterior and posterior plates <b>24</b>,<b>26</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0203">After large sleeve <b>192</b> and large pin <b>192</b> are severed and removed, the operator manually positions metal solenoid housing <b>150</b> vertically downward between anterior late <b>24</b> and posterior plate <b>26</b>. At this point, metal solenoid housing <b>150</b> is adjusted to its final position. Small rivet tapped apertures of approximately ⅛ inch diameter <b>163</b><i>a</i>, <b>163</b><i>b</i>, <b>164</b><i>a</i>, <b>164</b><i>b </i>are drilled through metal solenoid housing walls <b>150</b><i>a</i>, <b>150</b><i>b</i>, <b>150</b><i>c</i>, <b>150</b><i>d</i>. Rivets <b>167</b> which are approximately ⅛ thick by ¼ inch long, or other similar small mechanical fasteners are fastened and secured into apertures <b>163</b><i>a</i>, <b>163</b><i>b</i>, <b>164</b><i>a</i>, <b>164</b><i>b</i>, and mechanically attach metal solenoid housing <b>150</b> to anterior plate <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0204">The operator now cuts cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b> to fit for either a right handed or left handed installation within the preferred back set of 1 and ⅛ inch. After this adjustment, cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>now fits into space created by cutting and sanding away large pin <b>192</b><i>a </i>and large sleeve <b>192</b>. The preferred appropriate Dremel® wheel for adjusting the length of cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>is model number #3950. This Dremel® wheel is available from:</p>

<p id="p-0191" num="0205">After metal solenoid housing <b>150</b> is positioned between anterior plate <b>24</b> and posterior plate <b>26</b>, the operator adjusts solenoid housing's lower edge <b>151</b><i>e</i>. Such adjustment is made with a hand held frictional wheel, drill, shears, or other appropriate tool well known in the locksmithing industry. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>b</i>, temporary assisting screw <b>36</b><i>b </i>supports cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>during installation.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0206">This same temporary assisting screw <b>36</b><i>b </i>is then loosened until cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>drops over rotating cam <b>56</b>. The operator removes temporary assisting screw <b>36</b><i>b </i>immediately thereafter. Cylinder lock <b>66</b> is then threaded into large circular aperture <b>38</b><i>a </i>for testing the operation of the newly installed components.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0207">This is the last step occurring within the vise, and prior to checking function and connecting wire segments <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>to long connecting <b>22</b> gauge wires <b>401</b><i>a </i>and <b>401</b><i>b</i>. In this manner, lower edge <b>151</b><i>e </i>sufficiently clears rocking lever <b>14</b> when solenoid housing <b>150</b> is properly aligned within anterior plate <b>24</b>, lateral longitudinal plate <b>30</b> and posterior plate <b>26</b>. Metal solenoid housing <b>150</b> must also allow rocking lever <b>14</b> to pivot when deadbolt <b>10</b> rotates from a default locked position to an open unlocked position.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0208">The operator now inserts cylindrical solenoid casing <b>1</b><i>b </i>into metal solenoid housing <b>150</b>. Casing <b>1</b><i>b </i>extends as far downward as possible without jamming cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b</i>. The operator drills approximately 7/64 inch diameter apertures <b>36</b> into metal solenoid housing <b>150</b>. Please see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>. These apertures are best drilled with a “pling” style tap and inserted with set screws <b>36</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0209">Set screws <b>36</b><i>c </i>retain and stabilize solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>within metal solenoid housing <b>150</b> until solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>requires replacement. Metal solenoid housing <b>150</b>, cylindrical solenoid casing <b>1</b><i>b</i>, solenoid <b>1</b><i>a</i>, and cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>with attached hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>are now assembled above rocking lever <b>14</b>. Deadbolt <b>10</b> remains attached to and interior to plates <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>30</b>, while the entire assembly remains exterior to metal hollow doorframe casing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0210">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b</i>, the next step is the physical installation of the mechanical and electronic lock components within attached plates <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> into hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b>. The operator tips attached anterior, posterior and lateral longitudinal plates <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> respectively through large rectangular aperture <b>77</b> past mounting tabs <b>420</b><i>a</i>, <b>420</b><i>b</i>. He finally and reinserts them upwardly into hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0211">Plates <b>24</b>,<b>26</b>,<b>30</b> are now upright and flush within hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b>. Lateral longitudinal plate <b>30</b> is also properly aligned with upper tab aperture <b>430</b><i>a</i>. The operator places small screws <b>36</b><i>a </i>(approximately 10/32 inch diameter×⅜ inch long)through top aperture <b>30</b><i>a </i>and bottom aperture <b>30</b><i>b</i>, and into hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b>. He then he tightens deadbolt <b>10</b> into hollow metal doorframe casing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0212">The operator next reinserts cylinder lock <b>66</b> into aperture <b>38</b><i>a </i>and thumb turn <b>43</b> into circular aperture <b>38</b><i>b</i>, and then tightens set screws <b>36</b><i>c</i>. He next checks for proper rotation of extendible shaft <b>35</b> by locking and unlocking now re-installed deadbolt <b>10</b> with key <b>152</b>. After lock cylinder <b>66</b> and thumb turn are re-installed, the operator loosens temporary assisting screw <b>36</b><i>b</i>, allowing cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>a </i>to grip rotating cam <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0213">Alternatively, an operator skilled in the art of locksmithing can partially prepare a hollow metal doorframe casing with components of a kit. In the best mode and preferred embodiment, each kit contains the following: pre-assembled solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>within cylindrical casing from Adams-Rite, solenoid housing <b>150</b>, hollow member <b>118</b><i>a</i>, small spring <b>123</b> and cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b</i>. Electronic reader and processors <b>302</b>,<b>307</b> as well as electronic key cards <b>301</b> and related equipment could also be included within each kit and remain within the scope of my invention.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0214">In the preferred embodiment and best mode, each kit is intended for one doorframe per service call per operator. However, kits with varying numbers of installation components, or kinds of components are also within the scope of my invention. For example, some kits would only include a cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b</i>, hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a</i>, third spring <b>123</b>, pre-assembled solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>from Adams-Rite® and solenoid housing <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0215">If a kit comprises the pre-assembled solenoid <b>1</b><i>a</i>, metal solenoid housing <b>150</b>, hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a</i>, third spring <b>123</b>, and cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b</i>, a person skilled in this particular art would require approximately one hour to install these new components as a retrofit. In this context, “retrofit” indicate the operator's use of Adams-Rite® dead bolts <b>10</b> or hook bolts <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0216">These particular dead bolts and hook bolts immediately supra are compatible with Adams-Rite® glass/aluminum hollow doorframe casings <b>22</b>, and are easily replaced by the operator's inventory in an emergency. The one-hour time frame, supra, includes the reinstallation of mechanical components rocking lever <b>14</b>, deadbolt <b>10</b><i>a</i>, extension pins <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>a</i>, first and second opposing roller cams <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and rotating sleeve <b>210</b>, and first and second springs <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0217">This same time frame also includes insertion and attachment of cylindrical solenoid casing <b>1</b><i>b </i>within metal solenoid housing <b>150</b>, cam retaining locking bar <b>1</b><i>b</i>, hollow stem <b>118</b><i>a </i>and their proper alignment; reinstallation of lateral longitudinal plate <b>30</b>, anterior plate <b>24</b>, posterior plate <b>26</b>, and removal of large pin <b>192</b><i>a </i>and sleeve <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0218">An additional time of approximately two to three hours is necessary required to connect my integrated lock to Keri smart module <b>145</b>(model IP 1000/2000) and proximity access code reader Cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>is the least vulnerable point for physical damage, because cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>a </i>physically blocks attempts to wrench lock cylinder <b>66</b> during unauthorized entry attempts.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0219">In addition, with my invention there is no irreparable cutting or physical alteration hollow metal door frame casing <b>22</b>. Instead installation of cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>a </i>and solenoid <b>1</b><i>a </i>preserves the physical integrity of the previously installed doorframe.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0220">My cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>greatly maximizes circumvention of cylindrical lock <b>66</b>, because it physically blocks intentional rotational motion even if cylinder lock <b>66</b> is destroyed. My cam retaining locking bar <b>118</b><i>b </i>also preserves the physical integrity of extending shaft <b>35</b>. This damage occurs when the unauthorized third party uses a conventional screw driver to rotate extending shaft <b>35</b> through key aperture <b>35</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0221">The retention of cylinder cam locking bar <b>118</b> fitting tightly around cylindrical lock shaft cam member <b>35</b><i>a </i>immediately slows and frustrates manual attempts to physically wrench the mechanical lock. Mechanical locks of the future can be upgraded for extra security with my new electromagnetic integrative security devices.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0222">The electronic override feature of my upgraded locking device from the access side of the door, does not affect the ability to immediately open the same hollow metal doorframe casing from its opposite side which faces the interior of the secured space, container or room. The opening of such a door frame casing by conventional devices as a thumb turn, is required by fire ordinances, supra. The thumb turn is completely removed from the electronic circuit required to override access, as opposed to egress.</p>
