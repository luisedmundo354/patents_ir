In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the user is shown wearing a communication module <b>103</b>, and a headset <b>160</b>. A shoe-mounted module <b>105</b> is also shown. As described below, the communication module <b>103</b>, and a headset <b>160</b> allows the user to communicate, navigate, keep track of time, etc. The communication module <b>103</b> can be configured to be worn on the wrist like a watch, integrated into clothing, jewelry, etc. Similarly, the shoe-mounted module <b>105</b> can also be configured to be worn as part of an attachment to user's clothing, as jewelry, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the system <b>100</b>, the elements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> work together to provide functionality and capability not provided by existing devices such as cellular telephones, Personal Digital Assistants, etc. In one embodiment, the wireless communication module <b>103</b> (or shoe-mounted module <b>105</b>) can communicate with a wireless computer (or computer network) <b>104</b>. The communication module <b>103</b> communicates with one or more electronic devices carried by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the shoe-mounted module <b>105</b> provided to the shoe <b>101</b> with a display positioned to be read by the wearer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of the shoe-mounted module <b>105</b>. The module <b>105</b> can be worn on the ankles, built into the user's shoes, attached to the user's shoes, and/or provided to the user's shoe. The module <b>105</b> includes a display <b>302</b> provided to a processor <b>381</b>. In one embodiment, an optional IMU <b>383</b> is provided to the processor <b>381</b> to provide information about the movement of the user's feet and/or shoe. In one embodiment, a vibrator <b>305</b> is provided to the processor <b>381</b>.

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The processor <b>381</b> uses the display <b>302</b> to provide information such as, for example, time of day, date, caller-id (from the cellular telephone), distance traveled, etc. Information such as time of day can be generated by the processor <b>381</b> without the need for the optional RF system <b>384</b>. Other information, such as, for example, Caller-Id information, is received via the RF system <b>384</b> and then provided to the user via the display <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The optional vibrator <b>305</b> can be used to alert the user and/or to provide feedback to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the shoe-mounted module <b>105</b> provides IMU information to the communication module <b>103</b>. The communication module <b>103</b> uses the information IMU to ascertain the direction of travel, speed, and path of the user. The communication module <b>103</b> uses the headset <b>160</b> to provide audible direction and route-finding information to the user. The user can use a microphone in the headset <b>160</b> to send voice commands to the communication module <b>103</b> and/or to communicate through a cellular telephone <b>108</b>. The user can also use buttons on a keypad on the communication module <b>103</b> to control the operation of the system and input commands into the system.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the communication module <b>103</b> is omitted and the shoe-mounted module <b>105</b> communicates with the cellular telephone <b>108</b> and/or headset <b>160</b>. The display on the shoe-mounted module <b>105</b> can, thus, be used to display information, such as, for example, caller id information, text messages, etc., from the cellular telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram of the communication (and information) module <b>103</b>. The communication module <b>103</b> is configured to be carried and/or to be worn on the wrist, belt, chest, etc. In the communication module <b>103</b>, an optional sound sensing device (e.g., a microphone) <b>404</b>, an optional vibration device <b>405</b>, an optional sound producing device (e.g., a loudspeaker) <b>406</b>, and a RF system <b>402</b> are provided to a processor <b>401</b>. A display <b>410</b>, a radio navigation receiver <b>402</b>, an Inertial Motion Unit (IMU) <b>403</b>, one or more ambient condition sensors <b>411</b>, and/or one or more biometric sensors <b>409</b> are optionally provided to the processor <b>401</b>. The radio navigation receiver can be, for example, a GPS receiver, a GLONASS receiver, a differential GPS receiver, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The sound sensing device is configured to sense sound waves (sonic and/or ultrasonic) such as, for example, a microphone, a transducer, etc. For convenience, and without limitation, the sound sensing device is referred to herein as a microphone with the understanding that other acoustic transducers can be used as well. For convenience, and without limitation, the sound producing device is referred to herein as a loudspeaker with the understanding that the sound producing device is configured to produce sound waves such as, for example, a loudspeaker, a transducer, a buzzer, etc. A power source <b>403</b> provides power for powering the communication device <b>103</b>. In one embodiment, each of the microphone <b>404</b>, the vibration device <b>405</b>, the loudspeaker <b>406</b>, the sensors <b>409</b>, <b>411</b>, the IMU <b>403</b>, the radio navigation receiver <b>402</b>, and the keypad and/or buttons <b>433</b> are optional and can be omitted. The communication module <b>103</b> can also include a light (not shown) for providing visual indications to the instructor, or to the video cameras <b>106</b>. The communication module <b>103</b> can be configured by communication with a computer, cell phone, and/or by using the buttons <b>433</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The microphone <b>404</b> is used to pick up sound waves such as, for example, sounds produced by the user, sounds produced by other people, and/or acoustic waves produced by an acoustic location device (sonic or ultrasonic), etc. In one embodiment, the system <b>100</b> includes facial-recognition processing to help the user know who is in the room, at door, etc. The processor <b>401</b> processes the sounds picked up by the microphone and, if needed, sends processed data to the computer system <b>104</b> and/or communication module <b>103</b> for further processing. The loudspeaker <b>406</b> is used to produce pleasant and/or warning sounds for the user and to provide information and instructions to the user. The microphone <b>404</b> and/or loudspeaker <b>406</b> can also be used in connection with an acoustic location system to locate the user using acoustic waves. In an acoustic location system, the microphone <b>404</b> and/or loudspeaker <b>406</b> communicate acoustically with acoustic sources or sensors placed about the house or yard to locate the user. The vibrator can be used in a manner similar to a vibrator on a cellular telephone to alert the user without disturbing other people in the area. The vibrator can also be used to alert the user to abnormal or potentially dangerous conditions (e.g., off course, approaching a stairwell, etc.). Blind people tend to rely more on their sense of hearing than sighted people. Thus, in one embodiment, the vibrator can be configured to provided different types of vibrations (e.g., different frequency, different intensity, different patterns, etc.) to send information to the user without interfering with the user's hearing.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The RF system <b>402</b> communicates with the computer network <b>104</b> either directly or through repeaters. In one embodiment, the RF system <b>402</b> provides two-way communications such that the communication module <b>103</b> can send information to the computer system <b>104</b> and/or cell phone <b>108</b> and receive instructions from the computer system <b>104</b> and/or cell phone <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, the computer system <b>104</b> and/or communication module <b>103</b> and the cell phone <b>108</b> communicate using a handshake protocol, to verify that data is received.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the communication module <b>103</b> includes one or more location and tracking systems, such as, for example, a GPS location system <b>402</b>, an IMU <b>403</b>, etc. The tracking systems can be used alone or in combination to ascertain the location of the user and to help the user navigate to a desired location. The GPS location system <b>402</b> and IMU <b>403</b> are provided to the processor <b>401</b> and powered by the power source <b>408</b>. The processor <b>401</b> controls operation of the GPS location system <b>402</b>, the IMU <b>403</b>, etc., and controls when the power source delivers power to the location and tracking systems. One or more biometric sensors <b>409</b> (e.g., temperature sensors, pulserate sensors, etc.) are provided to the processor <b>401</b>. In one embodiment, one or more RFID tags with biometric sensors are implanted in the user and the biometric sensors <b>409</b> includes an RFID tag reader to read the implanted sensors. In one embodiment, one or more devices, such as, for example, pacemakers, etc. are implanted in the user and the biometric sensors <b>409</b> includes the capability to communicate with the one or more medical devices.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, the RF system <b>402</b> includes a receive capability to receive radio location signals from one or more radio location transmitters as part of a radio location system.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The microphone <b>404</b> can be used to allow the user to send voice commands to the system <b>100</b>, to talk on the cellular telephone <b>108</b>, to record voice messages, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The communication module <b>103</b> sends low-battery warnings to the computer system <b>104</b> and/or to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram of the ear module <b>160</b>. The module <b>160</b> includes the microphone <b>304</b>, the speaker <b>306</b> and the RF system <b>309</b> provided to the processor <b>301</b>. In one embodiment, the module <b>160</b> includes, or is similar to, a bluetooth headset for a cellular telephone in that it provides audio communication with the communication module <b>103</b> and/or cellular telephone <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, the headset <b>160</b> also includes a camera <b>390</b> provided to the processor <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The various location systems have benefits and drawbacks. In one embodiment, the system <b>100</b> uses a combination of one or more of a GPS system, an IMU, and/or a radio-location system to locate the user. One or more of these systems are used synergistically to locate the user, to allow the user to keep track of distance traveled, and to help the user navigate to a desired location.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The IMU <b>403</b> uses one or more accelerometers and/or gyroscopes to sense motion of the communication module. The motion can be integrated to determine location. The IMU <b>403</b> provides relatively low power requirements and relatively high short-term accuracy. The IMU provides relatively lower long-term accuracy. An Inertial Motion Units (IMU) unit will work indoors or outdoors, and typically consumes less power than other location systems. However, IMU systems are prone to drift over time and tend to lose accuracy if not recalibrated at regular intervals. In one embodiment, the IMU is recalibrated from time to time by using data from one or more of the RFID tags, GPS, acoustic, IR, and/or RF location systems. In one embodiment, the IMU <b>403</b> is used to reduce power requirements for the GPS, IR, and/or RF location systems. In one embodiment, the GPS, IR, and/or RF location systems are placed in a low-power or standby mode when the IMU <b>403</b> senses that the communication module <b>103</b> is motionless or relatively motionless. If the IMB <b>403</b> senses that the communication module <b>103</b> is relatively motionless (e.g., motionless or moving at a relatively low velocity) then the user is either not moving or is moving slowly enough that tracking is not immediately needed. In one embodiment, the IMU <b>403</b> is a 4-axis system and thus, motion of the communication module <b>103</b> in any direction is sensed as motion and can be used to activate one or more of the other sensing systems. Thus, for example, if the user has been lying down and then stands up, the “up” motion will be sensed by the IMU <b>403</b> and the communication module will activate one or more tracking systems.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the system <b>100</b> assumes that the user will not move at a relatively constant and relatively low velocity for any significant length of time. Thus, in one embodiment, the IMU self-calibrates to a constant offset error (e.g., a constant slope in the X, Y or Z direction) and a deviation from that constant X, Y offset error (e.g., a change in slope) is recognized as a movement by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the IMU <b>403</b> is at least a 2-axis IMU that senses motion in at least two directions. In one embodiment, the IMU <b>403</b> is at least a 4-axis IMU that senses motion in at least three directions. In one embodiment, the IMU provides data used to determine the gait of the user, such as, for example, running, walking, going upstairs, going downstairs, stumbling, limping, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The IMU can be used alone or in combination with other tracking devices to obtain feedback on the motion of the user. Thus, for example, if the user has indicated a desire to go to room <b>25</b> of a building, the information system can provide guidance information to help the user. In one embodiment, guidance information includes instructions (e.g., turn left, walk straight ahead 40 feet, etc.). In one embodiment, guidance information can include audio tone information reminiscent of an airplane glideslope information system. Thus, for example, the information system can play a tone in the left ear (or couple sound into the bones of the left side of the body ) if the user is veering too far left. In one embodiment, the tones become louder as the informational error increases.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The IMU <b>403</b> can measure both dynamic acceleration as well as static acceleration forces, including acceleration due to gravity, so the IMU <b>403</b> can be used to measure tilt as well as horizontal and vertical motion. When the IMU <b>403</b> is oriented so both the X and Y axis are parallel to the earth's surface, it can be used as a two axis tilt sensor with a roll and pitch axis. Ninety degrees of roll would indicate that the user is lying on its side. In addition, when the IMU <b>403</b> indicates no movement at all, regardless of the orientation of the user, the user is asleep or inactive and the system is powered down, as described above. Thus, the IMU <b>403</b> can detect when the user is not standing.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The Global Positioning System (GPS) is accurate but often does not work well indoors, and sometimes does not have enough vertical accuracy to distinguish between floors of a building. GPS receivers also require a certain amount of signal processing and such processing consumes power. In a limited-power device such as the communication module <b>103</b>, the power consumed by a GPS system can reduce battery life. However, GPS has the advantages of being able to operate over a large area and is thus, particularly useful when locating a user that has escaped a confined area or is out of the range of other locating systems.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">GPS tends to work well outdoors, but poorly inside buildings. Thus, in one embodiment, the system <b>100</b> uses GPS in combination with the IMU and/or in combination with RFID tags when such tags are available. Thus, using the system <b>100</b>, the user can navigate through a first building, exit the building and walk to a second building, and then navigate through the second building. The system <b>101</b> can use different information systems during different portions of the user's journey.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, a building includes a data port near the entrance that provides information to the system <b>100</b> regarding the map of the building. When the user enters the building, the system <b>100</b> obtains the building map information from the data port so that the user can navigate through the building. In one embodiment, the map information provided by the data port includes dynamic information, such as, for example, construction areas, restrooms closed for cleaning, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment, the GPS system <b>402</b> operates in a standby mode and activates at regular intervals or when instructed to activate. The GPS system can be instructed by the computer <b>104</b> and/or to the user or the communication module to activate. When activated, the GPS system obtains a position fixed on the user (if GPS satellite signals are available) and updates the IMU. In one embodiment, a GPS system is also provided to the computer system <b>104</b> and/or communication module <b>103</b>. The computer system uses data from its GPS system to send location and/or timing data to the GPS system <b>402</b> in the communication module <b>103</b> allowing the GPS system <b>402</b> to warm start faster, obtain a fix more quickly, and therefore, use less power.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, the system <b>100</b> uses the ambient sensors <b>411</b> to monitor ambient conditions such as, for example, temperature, humidity, sunlight, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, one or more of the wearable modules of the system <b>100</b> includes an RF communication system for communication. Thus, the discussion that follows generally refers to the communication module <b>103</b> as an example, and not by way of limitation. Similarly, the discussion below generally refers to the computer <b>104</b> by way of example, and not limitation. It will also be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that repeaters <b>113</b> are useful for extending the range of the communication module <b>103</b> but are not required in all configurations. It will also be understood that the computer <b>104</b> can be a computer network, a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the communication module <b>103</b> has an internal power source (e.g., battery, solar cell, fuel cell, etc.). In order to conserve power, the communication module <b>103</b> is normally placed in a low-power mode. In one embodiment, the communication module <b>103</b> provides bi-directional communication and is configured to receive data and/or instructions from the other modules. Thus, for example, the computer <b>104</b> can instruct the communication module <b>103</b> to perform functions, to go to a standby mode, to wake up, to report battery status, to change wake-up interval, to run self-diagnostics and report results, etc. In one embodiment, the communication module <b>103</b> reports its general health and status on a regular basis (e.g., results of self-diagnostics, battery health, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, the communication module <b>103</b> samples, digitizes, and stores audio data from the microphone <b>304</b> when such data exceeds a volume threshold and/or when other sensors indicate that the audio data should be digitized and stored. For example, when sending voice commands, the user can press a button on the keypad <b>433</b> to indicate that a voice command is being given. The user can also use the keypad <b>433</b> to enter commands to the communication module <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, the communication module <b>103</b> provides two wake-up modes, a first wake-up mode for taking sensor measurements (and reporting such measurements if deemed necessary), and a second wake-up mode for listening for instructions from the central computer <b>104</b> and/or to the keyboard <b>433</b>. The two wake-up modes, or combinations thereof, can occur at different intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, the communication module <b>103</b> use spread-spectrum techniques to communicate with the modules of the system <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, the communication module <b>103</b> uses Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) techniques. In one embodiment, the communication module <b>103</b> uses frequency-hopping spread-spectrum. In one embodiment, the communication module <b>103</b> uses Bluetooth communication techniques. In one embodiment, the communication module <b>103</b> uses a combination of techniques to toke to the various modules of the system <b>101</b>, the cellular telephone <b>108</b>, the computer <b>104</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, an embedded RFID tag in the user includes one or more biometric sensors to allow the system <b>101</b> to monitor the health and condition of the user. In one embodiment, the embedded RFID tags include a temperature sensor to allow the monitoring system to monitor the user's temperature. In one embodiment, the embedded RFID tag includes one or more biometric sensors to measure the user's health and well-being, such as for example, temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respiration, blood oxygenation, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Radio frequency identification, or RFID, is a generic term for technologies that use radio waves to identify people or objects. There are several methods of identification, but the most common is to store a serial number that identifies a person or object, and perhaps other information, on a microchip that is attached to an antenna (the chip and the antenna together are called an RFID transponder or an RFID tag). The antenna enables the chip to transmit the identification information to a reader. The reader converts the radio waves reflected back from the RFID tag into digital information that can then be passed on to computers that can make use of it.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">An RFID system includes a tag, which is made up of a microchip with an antenna, and an interrogator or reader with an antenna. The reader sends out electromagnetic waves. The tag antenna is tuned to receive these waves. A passive RFID tag draws power from field created by the reader and uses it to power the microchip's circuits. The chip then modulates the waves that the tag sends back to the reader and the reader converts the new waves into digital data.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Radio waves travel through most non-metallic materials, so they can be embedded in packaging or encased in protective plastic for weather-proofing and greater durability. RFID tags have microchips that can store a unique serial number for every product manufactured-around the world.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Active RFID tags have a battery, which is used to run the microchip's circuitry and to broadcast a signal to a reader (the way a cell phone transmits signals to a base station). Passive tags have no battery. Instead, they draw power from the reader, which sends out electromagnetic waves that induce a current in the tag's antenna. Semi-passive tags use a battery to run the chip's circuitry, but communicate by drawing power from the reader. Active and semi-passive tags are useful for tracking high-value goods that need to be scanned over long ranges, such as railway cars on a track, but they cost relatively more. Passive RFID tags cost less than active or semi-active tags.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, the communication module <b>103</b> and/or the shoe-mounted module <b>105</b> can be used in connection with the cell phone <b>108</b>. Although the earpiece <b>160</b> can also be provided with an answer button, the earpiece <b>160</b> does not typically have a display to show caller information and thus, does not provide a convenient method for call screening. In one embodiment, the communication module <b>103</b> and/or the shoe-mounted module <b>105</b> receives a message from the cell phone <b>108</b> when an incoming call is detected. Information, such as, for example, the caller's telephone number, name, picture, etc., is displayed on the communication module <b>103</b> and/or the shoe-mounted module <b>105</b>. In one embodiment, if the user wishes to receive the call, the user can press a button on the communication module <b>103</b> to cause the communication module <b>103</b> to send an answer command to the cell phone <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, if the user wishes to receive the call, the user can press a button on the earpiece <b>160</b> to send an answer command to the cell phone <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, if the user wishes to receive the call, the user can use a wrist motion (e.g., a flick of the wrist, etc.) to cause the communication module <b>103</b> to send an answer command to the cell phone <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, if the user wishes to receive the call, the user can use a defined foot tap (e.g., single tap, double tap, sideways tap, etc.) or foot motion to cause the shoe-mounted module <b>105</b> to send an answer command to the cell phone <b>108</b>. Once the call is answered, the user can communicate with the cell phone <b>108</b> through the earpiece <b>160</b>, through a hand-free module (e.g., a hands-free microphone and speaker mounted in a vehicle, office, etc.), and the like. This allows the user to screen calls without having to pull the cell phone <b>108</b> from a pocket, purse, briefcase, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Although various embodiments have been described above, other embodiments will be within the skill of one of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, for example, although the above disclosure describes communication using a Bluetooth protocol, such description is used by way of example, and not by way of limitation. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other wireless and/or wired communication protocols and techniques can be used with Bluetooth and/or in the alternative. The invention is limited only by the claims that follow.</p>
