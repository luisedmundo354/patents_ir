<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/609,707 filed on Dec. 12, 2006, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a hard hat for use by personnel on a construction site where the hard hat includes electronic circuitry configured to directly or indirectly indicate location of personnel wearing the hard hats on the construction site, and store personal information uniquely associated with the personnel wearing the hard hats.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Maintaining workplace safety at construction sites is an arduous task. Construction sites pose unique and complicated challenges which make monitoring personnel safety difficult. For example, various people access a construction site throughout the life of a project, each person being responsible for a particular task or tasks. Some personnel may require access to certain areas of a construction site while others may not. For example, drivers require access to material loading and loading areas at a construction site while other workers require access to material processing areas for assembling delivered materials into useable construction material, e.g., a cement mixing zone for combining sand, water, etc. Still other personnel such as steel workers, plumbers, electricians, etc. require access to buildings being constructed at the site. Supervisors often have access to the entire site while other personnel such as inspectors may require limited access to particular areas during certain phases of a project. Authorization levels may change as a project advances, further complicating matters.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various considerations such as safety requirements, training, certification, trade, skill level, experience, etc. may dictate which personnel have authorization to enter a particular area and which ones do not. In some situations, failure to satisfy required safety standards such as those mandated by the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States can be costly and ultimately lead to shutdown of a construction site. For example, some areas of a construction site may contain hazardous materials. Personnel lacking sufficient safety equipment and training are prohibited from entering these areas. Unauthorized access or lack of supervision may result in fines or other sanctions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a result, tracking personnel activity and location at a construction site is a difficult task. Conventionally, some form of manual supervision is used. For example, personnel activity is conventionally monitored at a construction site by one or more supervisors who are physically present at the site or by personnel who remotely monitor cameras positioned throughout the construction site. Regardless, manual tracking of personnel activity at a construction site is expensive and unreliable at times, especially given the complex and dynamic nature of construction sites.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The methods, apparatus and computer program products taught herein provide a monitoring process for tracking personnel activity at a construction site. Personnel entering a construction site are issued construction hard hats, each hard hat having electronic circuitry. The electronic circuitry directly or indirectly indicates hard hat location and stores information pertaining to the person issued the hard hat. Sensors such as Radio Frequency (RF) sensors placed throughout the construction site detect the hard hat electronic circuitry as the circuitry moves within range of the sensors. When a sensor detects an in-range hard hat, the location of the hard hat is determined and personal information stored in its electronic circuitry is transferred to the sensor. The location and personal information is reported to a monitoring system. The monitoring system uses this information to track personnel movement, detect unauthorized activity, and generate reports.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one embodiment, activity at a construction site is monitored by processing personal information directly or indirectly received from electronic circuitry formed as part of one or more hard hats worn by personnel located at the construction site. The personal information is uniquely associated with individual ones of the personnel. One or more messages are generated based on the personal information received from the electronic circuitry and personnel location. In one embodiment, the messages warn those personnel who have entered an unauthorized area at the construction site, e.g., by causing a hard hat alarm to activate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another embodiment, a construction hard hat comprises electronic circuitry. The electronic circuitry is configured to directly or indirectly indicate location of the hard hat, store personal information uniquely associated with a person, e.g., a person wearing the hard hat or a person issued the hard hat. The electronic circuitry is also configured to wirelessly transmit the personal information, e.g., to one or more RF sensors deployed at a construction site. As such, the hard hat transmits information uniquely associated with the person wearing it when the person moves within range of one or more of the sensors. This information, in conjunction with the hard hat's location, may be used to determine whether the person has entered an unauthorized area.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Of course, the present invention is not limited to the above features and advantages. Those skilled in the art will recognize additional features and advantages upon reading the following detailed description, and upon viewing the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a system <b>10</b> that automatically monitors personnel activity at a construction site <b>12</b>. The construction site <b>12</b> has a plurality of sectors <b>14</b>-<b>22</b>, the sectors <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> representing different areas within the construction site <b>12</b>. Personnel entering the construction site <b>12</b> are issued a construction hard hat <b>24</b>. The term “construction hard hat” or “hard hat” means a safety helmet worn on a construction site and does not include other safety helmets such as sports helmets, bicycle helmets, motorcycle helmets, race car helmets, or military helmets. Each hard hat <b>24</b> has electronic circuitry <b>26</b> formed as a part of thereof, e.g., by being embedded therein or affixed thereto. The electronic circuitry <b>26</b> directly or indirectly indicates hard hat <b>24</b> location and stores information pertaining to the person issued the hard hat <b>24</b>. As such, location information and personal information may be periodically reported to the monitoring system <b>10</b> for processing. Monitoring system <b>10</b> uses the location information to track personnel movement about the site <b>12</b>. The monitoring system <b>10</b> uses the personal information to determine whether individuals present at the site <b>12</b> are authorized to be in the sectors <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> indicated by their location information. Monitoring system <b>10</b> also generates messages warning personnel to leave unauthorized areas. As such, personnel activity throughout the construction site <b>12</b> may be automatically monitored and personnel automatically notified when they enter restricted areas.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In more detail, one or more sensors <b>28</b> such as Radio Frequency (RF) sensors are located in each sector <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> of the construction site <b>12</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, five sensors <b>28</b> are located throughout the construction site <b>12</b>, each sensor <b>28</b> being located in one of the sectors <b>14</b>-<b>22</b>. The sensors <b>28</b> may have different signal detection ranges, and thus, are capable of covering areas of varying size. For example, the third through fifth sectors <b>18</b>-<b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> represent smaller areas at the construction site <b>12</b> as compared to the first and second sectors <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. As such, the sensors <b>28</b> located in the third through fifth sectors <b>18</b>-<b>22</b> cover smaller signal areas while the sensors <b>28</b> located in the first and second sectors <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> cover wider signal areas. Optionally, the sensors <b>28</b> may be directional, and thus detect signals propagating in some directions, but not others.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Regardless, the sensors <b>28</b> provide a communication bridge between the hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b> and the monitoring system <b>10</b>, thus facilitating the delivery of location and personal information to the monitoring system <b>10</b> for processing. To that end, the sensors <b>28</b> detect the presence of hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b> when the circuitry <b>26</b> comes within signal range of one or more of the sensors <b>28</b>. Location information associated with detected electronic circuitry <b>26</b> is provided to the monitoring system <b>10</b> along with personal information provided by the detected electronic circuitry <b>26</b>. As such, personnel wearing hard hats <b>24</b> at the construction site <b>12</b> may be monitored when they enter one of the sectors <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> covered by one or more sensors <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, a wireless communication link is established between one or more sensors <b>28</b> and in-range hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b>. To facilitate wireless communication, the hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b> and the sensors <b>28</b> have complimentary transmit and receive circuitry (not shown) for establishing wireless links such as Bluetooth links, WiFi links, WiMAX links, RFID links, ZigBee links, etc. Regardless as to the particular wireless communication protocol, the sensors <b>28</b> report the detection of in-range hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b> to the monitoring system <b>10</b>, e.g., via a local reporting system <b>30</b>. The local reporting system <b>30</b>, e.g., a computer located at the construction site <b>12</b> periodically sends reported information to the monitoring system <b>10</b> for processing when the monitoring system <b>10</b> is located remotely off-site. Alternatively, the monitoring system <b>10</b> may be located at the construction site <b>12</b>, thus obviating the local reporting system <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The sensors <b>28</b> may be connected to the local reporting system <b>30</b> or directly to the monitoring system <b>10</b> (if located on-site) via wireless links such as the kind previously described (Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.). Alternatively, the connection may be hard-wired, e.g., via an Ethernet link, phone line or other land line connection. Either way, the sensors <b>28</b> establish wireless communicative contact with the hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b> when personnel wearing the hard hats <b>24</b> come within range of the sensors <b>28</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the sensor <b>28</b> covering the second sector <b>16</b> detects the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> included in the hard hat <b>24</b> worn by the person who has entered the second sector <b>16</b>. This occurrence is reported for processing by the monitoring system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When a wireless communication link is established between electronic circuitry <b>26</b> included in a particular hard hat <b>24</b> and one of the sensors <b>28</b>, an indication of the circuitry's position is reported along with personal information stored by the circuitry <b>26</b>. The reported location and personal information is used to determine whether the person wearing the hard hat <b>24</b> is permitted in the sector <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> covered by the reporting sensor <b>28</b>, as described in greater detail later. In one embodiment, the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> directly determines its position, e.g., via the Global Positioning System (GPS) or via equivalent cellular location determining techniques such as Enhanced Observed Time Difference (E-OTD), cell of origin (COO), cell ID, angle of arrival, time of arrival, or radio frequency (RF) mapping techniques. The hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b> provides its location coordinates to one of the sensors <b>28</b> via a wireless communication link. The sensor <b>28</b> then reports the location coordinates to the monitoring system <b>10</b> for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment, the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> indirectly indicates its position by establishing a wireless communication link with one of the sensors <b>28</b>. According to this embodiment, when one of the sensors <b>28</b> detects the presence of hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b>, a wireless communication link is established and the sensor <b>28</b> reports detection of the electronic circuitry <b>26</b>. Since the position of the reporting sensor <b>28</b> is known to the monitoring system <b>10</b>, the in-range hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b> is known to be located somewhere within the coverage area of the reporting sensor <b>28</b>, e.g., somewhere within the sector <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> or a portion of the sector <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> covered by the sensor <b>28</b>. As such, the hard hat's position is indirectly determined when its electronic circuitry <b>26</b> establishes communicative contact with one or more of the sensors <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Turning now to the details of the construction hard hat <b>24</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> embedded therein, affixed thereto or otherwise associated therewith. According to this embodiment, the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> has one or more antennas <b>32</b> for facilitating receipt and transmission of wireless signals. Electronic circuitry <b>26</b> also has circuitry <b>34</b> for directly determining location and circuitry <b>36</b> for establishing a wireless communication link with one or more of the sensors <b>28</b>. The location determining circuitry <b>34</b> comprises a GPS receiver or a cellular-based equivalent for directly determining location coordinates such as latitude, longitude and altitude. The location coordinates are stored in memory <b>38</b> included in or associated with the electronic circuitry <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition, personal information associated with the person issued the hard hat <b>24</b> is also stored in the memory <b>38</b>. For example, personal information such as a personal identifier (e.g., employee serial number, social security number, etc.), medical history, medical conditions, trade, qualifications, certifications, proficiencies, training, education, prior safety violations, etc. may be stored in the memory <b>38</b>. Alternatively or in combination, the personal information may be uniquely associated with one or more groups of persons having a common attribute such as trade, qualification, experience or any other attribute as indicated by the personal information. Optionally, some personal information may be stored by the monitoring system <b>10</b>. However, at least a person's identifier is stored in the memory <b>38</b> so that person may be uniquely identified by the monitoring system <b>10</b>. As such, location coordinates and personal information are available for retrieval from the memory <b>38</b> and reporting via the RF communication circuitry <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The RF communication circuitry <b>36</b> enables the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> to communicate wirelessly with in-range sensors <b>28</b> located at the construction site <b>12</b>. For example, RF communication circuitry <b>36</b> may comprise any suitable circuitry for establishing a wireless communication link such as a WiFi transceiver, WiMAX transceiver, Bluetooth transceiver, ZigBee transceiver, RFID transponder or the like. After a communication link is established, the RF communication circuitry <b>36</b> transmits information stored in the memory <b>38</b> such as location coordinates and personal information to the sensor <b>28</b> it is in contact with.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Using RFID as a purely illustrative example, the RF communication circuitry <b>36</b> comprises an RFID transponder. One of the antennas <b>32</b> (e.g., a coil) detects an RF activation signal emitted by one of the sensors <b>28</b>. The RF activation signal emitted by the in-range sensor <b>28</b> enables communication with the RFID transponder and in the case of a passive RFID transponder, energizes the transponder. In response to detecting the RF activation signal, the RFID transponder accesses the memory <b>38</b> and transmits designated information to the activating sensor <b>28</b>, e.g., personal information associated with the person wearing hard hat <b>24</b> and location information obtained by the location determining circuitry <b>34</b>. To facilitate information transmission, the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> retrieves information such as personal information and/or location information from the memory <b>38</b>, as illustrated by Step <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The retrieved information is then prepared for transmission, as illustrated by Step <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For example, the information retrieved from the memory <b>38</b> is encoded in compliance with the underlying wireless communication protocol used to establish a wireless communication link with one or more of the sensors <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, the memory <b>38</b> comprises a rewriteable memory device capable of overwriting previously stored information (e.g., old location coordinates) and a write-once memory device which stores personal information that cannot be updated. Alternatively, the personal information may be stored in the rewriteable memory device, thus allowing it to be revised. In yet another alternative, some personal information may be stored in the rewriteable memory device while other personal information is stored in the write-once memory device. Regardless, the memory <b>38</b> stores information designated for transmission to one or more of the sensors <b>28</b> and optionally stores information received from the sensors <b>28</b> or other devices (not shown) in communicative contact with the hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b>. As such, personal information stored in the memory <b>38</b> may be updated over time. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that information stored in the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> may be transmitted to and from one or more of the sensors <b>28</b> via other wireless protocols, and thus, are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> embedded in the construction hard hats <b>24</b>, affixed thereto or otherwise associated therewith. According to this embodiment, the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> has one or more antennas <b>40</b> for facilitating receipt and transmission of wireless signals and circuitry <b>42</b> for establishing a wireless communication link with one or more of the sensors <b>28</b>. However, the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> does not have circuitry for directly determining location. Instead, the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> indirectly indicates its location when it establishes a wireless communication link with one of the sensors <b>28</b>. Since the position of the sensors <b>28</b> at the construction site <b>12</b> are known, the location of the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> can be approximated when it is detected by one of the sensors <b>28</b> as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The RF communication circuitry <b>42</b> enables the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> to communicate wirelessly with one or more of the sensors <b>28</b> as previously described. Memory <b>44</b> included in or associated with the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> stores personal information associated with the person issued the hard hat <b>24</b>. The memory <b>44</b> may be write-once, rewriteable, or some combination of both whereby some information stored in the memory <b>44</b> may be updated while other information may not. Personal information stored in the memory <b>44</b> is retrieved, prepared for transmission, and sent to one of the sensors <b>28</b> via the RF communication circuitry <b>42</b>, e.g., in accordance with the processing logic illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Optionally, the RF communication circuitry <b>42</b> may receive new personal information from one of the sensors <b>28</b> or from another device (not shown) at the construction site <b>12</b> such as a portable computer. The new information replaces old information stored in the memory <b>44</b>. For example, when a person receives new training or is permitted access to one or more of the sectors <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> once prohibited, this new information may be stored in the memory <b>44</b>. As such, when the person enters a newly authorized sector <b>14</b>-<b>22</b>, the newly stored information indicates the person now has the appropriate clearance. Conversely, revised personal information may indicate a person no longer has access to a particular one of the sectors <b>14</b>-<b>22</b>. Whether a person's information is updated or not, the monitoring system <b>10</b> uses personal information retrieved from the hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b> to monitor and report personnel activity at the site <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition to the features described above, the system of the present invention has the ability to determine if a hard hat <b>24</b> is being worn by personnel on the construction site. One or more sensors <b>45</b> may be included in, associated with, or operatively connected to the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>. Hard hat compliance on construction sites is sometimes an issue. By providing each hard hat with a sensor <b>45</b> to determine if the hard hat is being worn, construction entities can immediately determine if all personnel on the construction site are wearing their assigned hard hats, and if not, the identity of those that are not wearing their assigned hats. Moreover, the usefulness and integrity of the entire system of the present invention depends on personnel wearing assigned hard hats <b>24</b>. When personnel do not wear hard hats or wear a non-assigned hard hat, data processed by the monitoring system <b>10</b> is less reliable. The sensors <b>45</b> may comprise any device that detects whether a hard hat <b>24</b> is placed on a person's head, e.g., a body temperature sensor, pressure sensor, acoustic sensor, visual sensor, etc. Optionally, one or more of the sensors <b>45</b> may be capable of uniquely identifying the person wearing a hard hat <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to one embodiment, one or more of the sensors <b>45</b> is a biometric sensor that uniquely identifies the person wearing a hard hat <b>24</b>. In a purely illustrative example, a biometric sensor may uniquely identify a person based on his or her perspiration, odor, ear geometry, skin reflectivity (i.e., the skin's propensity to absorb/reflect light), etc. Biometric sensor and/or other sensor data may be stored in memory <b>38</b> or <b>44</b> and transmitted to monitoring system <b>10</b> via the wireless communication techniques previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The function of sensor <b>45</b> is to determine if the associated hard hat has been worn by a person. In addition, as discussed above, the sensor may also determine if the hard hat is being worn by the person assigned the hard hat. Sensor <b>45</b> can be incorporated into the hardhat <b>24</b> in various ways. For example, the sensor <b>45</b> can be associated with an inner head band within the hard hat <b>24</b>, attached or embedded in the hard hat, or incorporated into the electronic circuitry <b>26</b>. As discussed herein, the system of the present invention has the ability to determine when a hard hat <b>24</b> has entered the construction site or any portion of the construction site. Thus, the monitoring of personnel for hard hat wearing compliance can be triggered by personnel entering the construction site or any portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The monitoring system <b>10</b> processes received hard hat sensor data over time in addition to personnel location and personal information. As such, the monitoring system <b>10</b> is capable of not only tracking personnel activity throughout the construction site <b>12</b>, it may also determine whether personnel are wearing a hard hat <b>24</b>, and more particularly, the correct hard hat <b>24</b>. In the event a person is not wearing a hard hat <b>24</b> or is wearing the wrong hard hat <b>24</b>, the monitoring system <b>10</b> may issue a warning message, e.g., a message targeted to those hard hats <b>24</b> that report biometric data inconsistent with the personnel issued or otherwise assigned the hats.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning now to the details of the monitoring system <b>10</b>, the system <b>10</b> implements several functions <b>46</b>-<b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for monitoring personnel activity at the construction site <b>12</b>. The functions supported by the monitoring system <b>10</b> include information processing, message generation and information reporting. The monitoring system <b>10</b> comprises any suitable hardware and/or software such as one or more processors and corresponding software. The functions <b>46</b>-<b>50</b> may be implemented as physical circuits or sub-systems within the monitoring system <b>10</b>, or may be implemented in whole or in part as functional “circuits” embodied in computer program instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The information processing function <b>46</b> analyzes reported location and personal information, and optionally, hard hat sensor information reported by the hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b>. To that end, the monitoring system <b>10</b> receives personal information provided by the hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b> directly from the sensors <b>28</b> in communicative contact with the circuitry <b>26</b> or from the local reporting system <b>30</b>, as illustrated by Step <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Likewise, the monitoring system <b>10</b> receives corresponding location information either directly or indirectly indicated by the electronic circuitry <b>26</b>, as illustrated by Step <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The information processing function <b>46</b> analyzes the location and personal information to determine whether personnel present at the construction site <b>12</b> are located in unauthorized areas, as illustrated by Step <b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In the event of an unauthorized access, a warning message such as a signal is directed to the person wearing the offending hard hat <b>24</b>, as illustrated by Step <b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the information processing function <b>46</b> generates a virtual map <b>60</b> of the construction site <b>12</b> and associates each sector <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> with a corresponding zone <b>62</b>-<b>70</b> of the map <b>60</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the virtual map <b>60</b> where the five map zones <b>62</b>-<b>70</b> correspond to the five sectors <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> of the construction site <b>12</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The information processing function <b>46</b> associates each of the map zones <b>62</b>-<b>70</b> with sector-specific information stored in a database <b>72</b> with the corresponding sector <b>14</b>-<b>22</b>. Preferably, the sector-specific information identifies at least the area covered by each of the sectors <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> (sector area information) and the access authority associated with each of the sectors <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> (sector authorization information). When the monitoring system <b>10</b> receives reported location and personal information, the information processing function <b>46</b> accesses the virtual map <b>60</b> and identifies the zone <b>62</b>-<b>70</b> corresponding to the reported location information. The processing function <b>46</b> then retrieves the sector authorization information associated with the identified zone <b>62</b>-<b>70</b>. The processing function <b>46</b> compares the reported personal information with the retrieved sector authorization information to determine whether unauthorized access has occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the sector area information corresponds to respective records <b>74</b> that uniquely identify the sensor <b>28</b> located in each of the sectors <b>14</b>-<b>22</b>. That is, each of the sensors <b>28</b> is known to be located in a certain sector <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> of the construction site <b>12</b>. This sensor location information is stored in the database <b>72</b> as a series of sensor location records <b>74</b>. The information processing function <b>46</b> associates each of the sensor location records <b>74</b> with the map zone <b>62</b>-<b>70</b> that represents the sector <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> covered by the corresponding sensor <b>28</b>. As such, when one of the sensors <b>28</b> reports detection of in-range hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b>, the information processing function <b>46</b> searches the virtual map <b>60</b> for the sensor record <b>74</b> corresponding to the reporting sensor <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the event that two or more sensors <b>28</b> detect the same electronic circuitry <b>26</b> at approximately the same time, e.g., due to signal coverage overlap, the information processing function <b>46</b> determines which sector <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> is most likely located in. To that end, each of the sensors <b>28</b> reports a signal strength measurement. The signal strength measurement indicates the proximity of the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> to a particular one of the sensors <b>28</b>. The information processing function <b>46</b> analyses received signal strength measurement data when multiple sensors <b>28</b> report detection of the same electronic circuitry <b>26</b> at approximately the same time. The sensor <b>28</b> reporting the greatest signal strength measurement is identified. The information processing function <b>46</b> then searches the virtual map <b>60</b> for the sensor record <b>74</b> corresponding to the identified sensor <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the virtual map <b>60</b> where the sector area information corresponds to a range of GPS or other position coordinates <b>76</b> that pinpoint the areas covered by each of the sectors <b>14</b>-<b>22</b>. That is, each of the sectors <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> covers a known area at the construction site <b>12</b> which can be represented as a group of position coordinates <b>76</b>. Each grouping of position coordinates <b>76</b> is stored in the database <b>72</b>. Upon retrieval, the information processing function <b>46</b> associates each group of position coordinates <b>76</b> with the map zone <b>62</b>-<b>70</b> that represents the sector <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> including the corresponding group of coordinates <b>76</b>. As such, when in-range hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b> directly indicates its location by providing GPS or other position coordinates, the information processing function <b>46</b> searches the virtual map <b>60</b> for a group of position coordinates <b>76</b> that includes the reported coordinates.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Either way, when location information is reported to the monitoring system <b>10</b>, the information processing function <b>46</b> identifies which of the sectors <b>14</b>-<b>22</b> covers the area indicated by the location information. For example, when the person wearing the hard hat <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> enters the second sector <b>16</b>, the hard hat's electronic circuitry <b>26</b> directly or indirectly indicates the hard hat's location. In one case, the sensor <b>28</b> that detected the hard hat <b>24</b> is identified. In another case, GPS or other position coordinates are reported to the monitoring system <b>10</b>. The information processing function <b>46</b> uses either the identity of the reporting sensor <b>28</b> or the reported position coordinates to identify the second map zone <b>64</b> which is associated with the second sector <b>16</b>, e.g., by identifying the corresponding sensor location record <b>74</b> or group of position coordinates <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">After the map zone <b>62</b>-<b>70</b> associated with reported location information is accessed, the corresponding sector authorization information record <b>78</b> is retrieved from the database <b>72</b>. The information processing function <b>46</b> then compares the personal information provided by the hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b> with the retrieved authorization record <b>78</b> to determine whether the circuitry <b>26</b> is located in an unauthorized area. For example, the sector authorization information may correspond to the same types of personal information reported by the electronic circuitry <b>18</b>, e.g., medical history, trade, qualifications, certifications, proficiencies, training, education, etc. If the received personal information fails to satisfy one or more requirements indicated by the retrieved sector authorization information record <b>78</b>, then unauthorized access has occurred. For example, if the person who has entered the second sector <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is wearing a hard hat <b>24</b> that indicates his training or qualifications are not sufficient for the second sector <b>16</b>, the information processing function <b>46</b> indicates that an unauthorized access has occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the event that a person wearing the hard hat <b>24</b> enters a prohibited area on the construction site <b>12</b> or when the hard hat is worn by the wrong person or not worn at all, the message generation function <b>48</b> issues a message to the electronic circuitry <b>26</b> of the hard hat. The message indicates a safety breech. In one embodiment, the hard hat <b>24</b> has an alarm <b>80</b> that activates in response to a received warning message generated by the message generation function <b>48</b>. For example, the alarm <b>80</b> may vibrate, sound a warning or display a message. Optionally, the message generation function <b>48</b> also displays a warning at the monitoring system <b>10</b> for notifying personnel that a safety breech has occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The functions <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> of processing reported information and generating messages may be monitored over time by the report generation function <b>50</b>. In one embodiment, incidents of hard hats not being worn or worn by the wrong personnel are tracked over time and one or more reports are generated. The reports may indicate the propensity of certain personnel to not wear a hard hat or to wear a hard hat other than their own. In another embodiment, personnel location is tracked over time and one or more reports are generated. To that end, the monitoring system <b>10</b> periodically receives location information directly or indirectly indicated by the hard hat electronic circuitry <b>26</b>, as illustrated by Step <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The report generation function <b>50</b> generates one or more composite reports based on the received information, as illustrated by Step <b>302</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The reports may indicate composite personnel activity on a per-sector basis, a per-individual basis or both. The report generation function <b>50</b> may report personnel activity at the construction site <b>12</b> over a predetermined period of time, e.g., on an hourly, daily or weekly basis. By tracking and reporting worker movement over time, efficiency and productivity may be increased at the site <b>12</b>. Further, reports may be used to investigate accidents, assist in safety audits, identify trends, etc.</p>
