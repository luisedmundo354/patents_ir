<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a connector incorporating a communication control IC (integrated circuit), which is used for a wire harness or the like, and a wiring harness with communication control IC-incorporating connector that uses the said connector.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A motor vehicle is mounted with a large number of actuators formed by a motor, a relay, a solenoid, and the like as electric equipment, and a control system for decentralized controlling the electric equipment independently by means of data communication has already been developed. In this system, a wire harness as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is used. This wire harness <b>10</b> is constructed by installing a plurality of connectors <b>14</b> on a combination wire <b>12</b>, in which a plurality of electric insulated wires are collected, at desired intervals in the lengthwise direction, and is called a so-called bus wiring wire harness. Each of the connectors <b>14</b> in this wire harness <b>10</b> is inserted in and connected to a connector <b>18</b> (equipment-side connector) on the electric equipment <b>16</b> side mounted at portions of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The connector <b>14</b> on the wire harness <b>10</b> side incorporates a circuit board that distinguishes a signal (address) to the electric equipment to which the connector <b>14</b> is connected from signals transmitting on the combination wire <b>12</b> to carry out the control of the electric equipment (Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. 2004-172072). The connector of this type is also called a smart connector.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the conventional circuit board-incorporating connector, a female terminal in which a male terminal of the equipment-side connector is inserted is connected to a circuit board by soldering, and a solderless terminal to which an electric wire is connected is also connected to the circuit board by soldering.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, the incorporating of a communication control IC in place of the circuit board has been studied. In this case, however, since the lead of the communication control IC is connected by soldering to the female terminal in which the male terminal of the equipment-side connector is inserted, the inserting/drawing force of the male terminal is unfavorably applied to the lead of the IC.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also, in the conventional circuit board-incorporating connector, after the circuit board has been incorporated in a connector housing, soldering between the female terminal and the circuit board and soldering between the solderless terminal and the circuit board are performed (namely, the circuit board is incorporated at an early stage of a connector assembling process). Therefore, if a trouble is found during the assembly of connector, there is high possibility that the circuit board becomes wasteful. Also, if a trouble is found after the assembly of connector or after the assembly of wire harness, it is difficult to recover the circuit board. Since the communication control IC is more expensive than the circuit board, if a trouble is found after the communication control IC has been incorporated in the housing and the communication control IC becomes wasteful, the yield of assembling process is decreased, which results in an increase in cost.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A communication control IC-incorporating connector in accordance with the present invention is characterized in that a communication control IC is incorporated in a housing; an equipment-side connecting portion for connecting the equipment-side lead of the IC to the male terminal of an equipment-side connector is provided in the interior on the front end side of the housing, and a bus wiring-side connecting portion for connecting the bus wiring-side lead of the IC to the electric wire of a bus wiring circuit is provided in the interior on the rear end side of the housing; and in the equipment-side connecting portion, a two-way female connecting terminal in which the equipment-side lead inserting portion of the IC and the male terminal inserting portion of the equipment-side connector are provided alternately is incorporated.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also, a wiring harness with communication control IC-incorporating connector in accordance with the present invention is a wiring harness in which the communication control IC-incorporating connectors described above is installed to the electric wire of a bus wiring circuit.</p>

The bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> are bent at right angles to the lengthwise direction of the equipment-side leads <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the interior on the front side of the housing <b>22</b>, an equipment-side connecting portion <b>32</b> for connecting the equipment-side leads <b>26</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b> to a male terminal <b>30</b> of an equipment-side connector is provided, and in the interior on the rear side thereof, a bus wiring-side connecting portion <b>36</b> for connecting the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b> to electric wires <b>34</b> of a bus wiring circuit is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the equipment-side connecting portion <b>32</b>, a two-way female connecting terminal <b>38</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref> is incorporated. The two-way female connecting terminal <b>38</b> is provided an insertion portion <b>40</b> for the equipment-side leads <b>26</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b> and an insertion portion <b>42</b> for the male terminal <b>30</b> of the equipment-side connector in the direction different from each other. Between the insertion connectors <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, an elastic tongue element <b>44</b> folded from the inlet side of the insertion portion <b>42</b> is provided. This elastic tongue element <b>44</b> is formed so that in the state in which the equipment-side leads <b>26</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b> are inserted in the insertion portion <b>40</b> and the male connector of the equipment-side connector is not inserted in the insertion portion <b>42</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>, the elastic tongue element <b>44</b> does not come into contact with the equipment-side leads <b>26</b>, but if the male terminal <b>30</b> is inserted in the insertion portion <b>42</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(C)</figref>, the elastic tongue element <b>44</b> is pushed away by the male terminal <b>30</b> and comes into contact with the equipment-side leads <b>26</b>, by which an elastic repulsive force necessary for electrical connection is generated. The elastic tongue element <b>44</b> may be formed so that when the equipment-side leads <b>26</b> are inserted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>, the elastic tongue element <b>44</b> comes into contact with the equipment-side leads <b>26</b> with a contact pressure lower than the contact pressure necessary for electrical connection.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The two-way female connecting terminal <b>38</b> is incorporated in the housing <b>22</b> before the communication control IC <b>24</b> is incorporated in the housing <b>22</b>. When the communication control IC <b>24</b> is incorporated in the housing <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>, the equipment-side leads <b>26</b> do not come into contact with the elastic tongue element <b>44</b> (or come into contact merely with a low contact pressure), so that the equipment-side leads <b>26</b> can be inserted in the two-way female connecting terminal <b>38</b> with no insertion force (or with a small insertion force). Also, when the assembled connector <b>20</b> is fitted in the equipment-side connector (when a wire harness is incorporated in a vehicle), the two-way female connecting terminal <b>38</b> incorporated in the housing <b>22</b> receives the insertion force of the male terminal <b>30</b>, so that the insertion force is not exerted on the equipment-side leads <b>26</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b>. Therefore, the communication control IC <b>24</b> can be protected securely.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(B)</figref>, the bus wiring-side connecting portion <b>36</b> is provided with a portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>projecting downward on the rear end side of the housing <b>22</b>. On the rear surface of a downward projecting portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the housing, the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b>, which extend downward, are located, and on the front surface thereof, a plurality of electric wires <b>34</b> (formed by separating the combination wire of wire harness) constituting the bus wiring are arranged in the direction intersecting with the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b>. The leads <b>28</b> and the electric wires <b>34</b>, which are to be connected to each other, are connected at a cross portion of them via a cross connector <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The cross connector <b>46</b> has a solderless terminal for connecting the lead <b>28</b> under pressure to one side, and has a solderless terminal for connecting the electric wire <b>34</b> to the other end side. The solderless terminal at both ends is formed so that the direction of groove is at right angles. The cross connector <b>46</b> is installed to the downward projecting portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>22</b> before the communication control IC <b>24</b> and the electric wires <b>34</b> are incorporated. The bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> are connected under pressure to the solderless terminal on one end side of the cross connector <b>46</b> when the communication control IC <b>24</b> is incorporated in the housing <b>22</b>. The direction in which the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> are pushed in the solderless terminal on one end side of the cross connector <b>46</b> and the direction in which the equipment-side leads <b>26</b> are inserted in the two-way female connecting terminal <b>38</b> are the same. Therefore, the connection under pressure of the bus wiring-side lead <b>26</b> to the cross connector <b>46</b> and the insertion of the equipment-side leads <b>28</b> into the two-way female connecting terminal <b>38</b> can be carried out at the same time, so that the communication control IC <b>24</b> can be incorporated easily. Also, the incorporated communication control IC <b>24</b> can be removed from the housing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">After the communication control IC <b>24</b> has been incorporated in the housing <b>22</b>, a back lid <b>48</b> is mounted on the rear end surface of the housing <b>22</b>. Also, after the electric wires <b>34</b> have been connected under pressure to the cross connector <b>46</b>, a front lid <b>50</b> is mounted on the front surface of the downward projecting portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the housing. In the facing surface between the downward projecting portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the housing and the front lid <b>50</b>, guide grooves for the electric wires <b>34</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The communication control IC <b>24</b> may be incorporated in the housing <b>22</b> before or after the connector <b>20</b> is installed to the electric wires <b>34</b>. In the latter case, the most expensive part is incorporated finally, so that even if defective assembly occurs, damage can be kept at a minimum. Also, since the bus wiring wire harness is formed so that many connectors are installed on one combination wire, if one of the connectors or the communication control IC becomes defective, the whole of wire harness become defective. Even in such a case, the communication control IC can be removed, so that the expensive communication control IC can be recovered and reused. Therefore, the yield of assembling process is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Also, since the communication control IC-incorporating connector <b>20</b> is located at a position where the bus wiring side connecting portion <b>36</b> is offset from the axis line of engagement between the connector <b>20</b> and the equipment-side connector, when the connector <b>20</b> is engaged with the equipment-side connector, the bus wiring side connecting portion <b>36</b>, especially the electric wires <b>34</b>, does not become a hindrance. Therefore, the connector <b>20</b> can easily be assembled to the equipment-side connector automatically, for example, using a robot etc.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Also, for this communication control IC-incorporating connector <b>20</b>, since the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b> and the electric wires <b>34</b> are connected to each other at the cross portion thereof via the cross connectors <b>46</b> as described above, the number of connection patterns (combination of connection) of the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> and the electric wires <b>34</b> is 3×2×1=6 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(A)</figref> in the case where the number of the leads <b>28</b> is three and the number of electric wires <b>34</b> is three. If the number of the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> is increased by one, the combination becomes <b>24</b> sorts of 4×3×2×1 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref>, so that the utilization of this can determine the address of connector. If the configuration is made such that the address of connector can be identified by the connection pattern of the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> and the electric wires <b>34</b> in this manner, the same communication control IC <b>24</b> is manufactured in large quantities and is assembled without being distinguished, and the connection pattern of the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> and the electric wires <b>34</b> is merely changed, by which address can be given. Therefore, the communication control IC <b>24</b> can be standardized and can be decreased in cost.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows three electric wires <b>34</b> constituting the bus wiring. This number of electric wires <b>34</b> was determined so as to correspond to three electric wires (power line, grounding line, signal line) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.

This embodiment differs from embodiment 1 in that the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> extend in a straight line shape in the direction opposite to the equipment-side leads <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the interior on the front end side of the housing <b>22</b>, there is provided the equipment-side connecting portion <b>32</b> for connecting the equipment-side leads <b>26</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b> to the male terminal (corresponding to reference numeral <b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, not shown here) of the equipment-side connector, and in the interior on the rear end side of the housing <b>22</b>, there is provided the bus wiring-side connecting portion <b>36</b> for connecting the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b> to the electric wires <b>34</b> of the bus wiring circuit.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the equipment-side connecting portion <b>32</b>, the two-way female connecting terminal <b>38</b> configured in the same way as embodiment 1 is incorporated in the same way as embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">On the other hand, as in embodiment 1, the bus wiring-side connecting portion <b>36</b> is provided with the portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>projecting downward (front side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) on the rear end side of the housing <b>22</b>. In the downward projecting portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>22</b>, three (the same number as the number of the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b>) wire connectors <b>60</b> are incorporated. The wire connector <b>60</b> has a female terminal <b>62</b> connected to the bus wiring-side lead <b>28</b> on one end side thereof and has a solderless terminal <b>64</b> connected under pressure to the electric wire on the other end side thereof. In the downward projecting portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>22</b>, through holes <b>66</b> for housing the wire connectors <b>60</b> are formed. When the wire connectors <b>60</b> are inserted in the through holes <b>66</b>, the female terminals <b>62</b> of the wire connectors <b>60</b> are positioned so as to be in parallel with the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the front surface (surface on the front end side of the housing <b>22</b>) of the downward projecting portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>22</b>, three electric wires <b>34</b> (may be a band-shaped electric wire having three conductors) are arranged so as to be at right angles to the three wire connectors <b>60</b>. The three electric wires <b>34</b> are connected to the solderless terminals <b>64</b> of the three wire connectors <b>60</b>. The through holes <b>66</b> for housing the wire connectors <b>60</b> are formed by shifting the positions thereof in accordance with the arrangement pitch of the electric wires <b>34</b> so that the three wire connectors <b>60</b> are connected to the three electric wires <b>34</b> one to one. The three electric wires <b>34</b> are held at predetermined positions on the front surface of the downward projecting portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>22</b> by the front lid <b>50</b> having the wire guide grooves. This respect is the same as embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b> and the female terminals <b>62</b> of the wire connectors, which are arranged in parallel, are connected one to one by three bridge connectors <b>68</b> extending between them. Each of the bridge connectors <b>68</b> is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in a form of a bus bar consisting of a conductive metal sheet, and has a solderless terminal <b>70</b> connected under pressure to the bus wiring-side lead <b>28</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b> on one end side thereof and a male terminal <b>72</b> connected to the female terminal <b>62</b> of the wire connector on the other end side thereof. The male terminals <b>72</b> of the three bridge connectors <b>68</b> are formed by shifting the positions thereof in the wire arrangement direction in accordance with the positions of the female terminals <b>62</b> of the three wire connectors. The thus formed bridge connectors <b>68</b> are pushed in from the rear end side of the housing <b>22</b>, by which the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b> and the female terminals <b>62</b> of the wire connectors can be connected electrically one to one. This embodiment is the same as embodiment 1 in that the back lid <b>48</b> is mounted on the rear end surface of the housing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this embodiment, an electrical part housing portion <b>74</b> is provided on the side surface of the downward projecting portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>22</b>, and an electrical part <b>76</b> such as an electrolytic capacitor is incorporated in the electrical part housing portion <b>74</b>. The electrical part <b>76</b> is incorporated in the housing portion <b>74</b> so that the leads <b>78</b> extend in the direction at right angles to the bridge connectors <b>68</b>. On the bridge connector <b>68</b> to which the leads <b>78</b> of the electrical part <b>76</b> is connected, a solderless terminal <b>80</b> connected under pressure to the leads <b>78</b> is formed on the outside of the male terminal <b>72</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Therefore, when the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b> and the female terminals <b>62</b> of the wire connectors are connected to each other with the bridge connectors <b>68</b>, the leads <b>78</b> of the electrical part <b>76</b> can be connected at the same time. The electrical part <b>76</b> is incorporated as necessary, and is sometimes omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Next, a method for assembling the communication control IC-incorporating connector <b>20</b> of this embodiment is explained. First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the two-way female connecting terminal <b>38</b> is incorporated in the front end portion of the housing <b>22</b>, and the solderless terminals <b>64</b> of the wire connectors <b>60</b> are inserted in the through holes <b>66</b> in the housing <b>22</b>. Subsequently, the communication control IC <b>24</b> is incorporated in the housing <b>22</b>, by which the state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is formed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, only the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b> can be seen. When the communication control IC <b>24</b> is incorporated, as in embodiment 1, the equipment-side leads <b>26</b> can be inserted in the two-way female connecting terminal <b>38</b> with no insertion force (or with a very small insertion force in the case where the elastic tongue element <b>44</b> of the two-way female connecting terminal <b>38</b> is lightly in contact with the equipment-side leads <b>26</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(A)</figref>). Therefore, the communication control IC <b>24</b> can be attached or detached with a small force, so that there is little fear of damaging the expensive communication control IC <b>24</b> when the communication control IC <b>24</b> is attached or detached.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the electric wires <b>34</b> are arranged on the front surface of the downward projecting portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>22</b>, and the front lid <b>50</b> is installed to the housing <b>22</b>, by which the electric wires <b>34</b> are fixed at predetermined positions as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. When the wire connectors <b>60</b> are pushed in in this state, the solderless terminals <b>64</b> of the wire connectors <b>60</b> and the electric wires <b>34</b> are connected electrically to each other. The communication control IC <b>24</b> may be incorporated after the wire connectors <b>60</b> and the electric wires <b>34</b> have been connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the electrical part <b>76</b> is incorporated in the electrical part housing portion <b>74</b>, and the bridge connectors <b>68</b> are installed, whereby the bus wiring-side leads <b>28</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b> and the female terminals <b>62</b> of the wire connectors are connected to each other, and the leads <b>78</b> of the electrical part <b>76</b> are connected. It is preferable that the bridge connectors <b>68</b> be installed in a state of being attached to the inside of the back lid <b>48</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. This method is efficient because the bridge connectors <b>68</b> can be installed at the same time the back lid <b>48</b> is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The assembly is finished by carrying out the above procedure. If there arises the necessity of removing the communication control IC <b>24</b> for any reason after the assembly, the communication control IC <b>24</b> can be removed easily by merely removing the back lid <b>48</b> and the bridge connectors <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a state in which an equipment-side connector <b>18</b> (shown in two-dot chain line) is connected to the communication control IC-incorporating connector <b>20</b> configured as described above. The male terminal <b>30</b> of the equipment-side connector <b>18</b> is inserted in the two-way female connecting terminal <b>38</b>, and the elastic tongue element <b>44</b> is pushed away by the male terminal <b>30</b> and comes firmly into contact with the equipment-side leads <b>26</b> with a contact pressure necessary for electrical connection.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In this embodiment, the solderless terminal <b>70</b> is formed on one end side of the bridge connector <b>68</b> so that the solderless terminal <b>70</b> is brought into contact with the bus wiring-side lead <b>28</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b>. However, on one end side of the bridge connector <b>68</b>, for example, a female terminal may be formed in place of the solderless terminal <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Also, in this embodiment, the female terminal <b>62</b> is formed on the wire connector <b>60</b> side, and the male terminal <b>72</b> is formed on the bridge connector <b>68</b> side. However, inversely, a male terminal may be formed on the wire connector <b>60</b> side, and a female terminal may be formed on the bridge connector <b>68</b> side. Also, the connection of the wire connector <b>60</b> to the bridge connector <b>68</b> can be performed by a connecting means other than the connecting means using the female terminal and the male terminal. For example, a solderless terminal connected under pressure to a flat plate portion of the bridge connector <b>68</b> may be formed on the wire connector <b>60</b> side. In effect, the connecting means between the wire connector <b>60</b> and the bridge connector <b>68</b> has only to be a means that can connect the wire connector <b>60</b> to the bridge connector <b>68</b> by a pushing-in operation in the same direction when one end side of the bridge connector <b>68</b> is connected to the bus wiring-side lead <b>28</b> of the communication control IC <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the present invention, the equipment-side leads of the communication control IC are inserted from one end side into the two-way female connecting terminal attached to the housing, and the male terminal of the equipment-side connector is inserted from the other end side. Therefore, it is the two-way female connecting terminal that receives the inserting/drawing force of male terminal, and the inserting/drawing force of male terminal is not applied to the equipment-side leads of the communication control IC. For this reason, the communication control IC can be protected surely.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to the present invention, when the equipment-side leads of the communication control IC are inserted in the two-way female connecting terminal, namely, at the stage at which the communication control IC is incorporated in the housing, the equipment-side leads of the communication control IC are inserted in the two-way female connecting terminal substantially with no insertion force. Therefore, the communication control IC can be protected more surely.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to the present invention, the equipment-side leads of the communication control IC have only to be inserted in the two-way female connecting terminal, and the bus wiring-side leads of the communication control IC have only to be connected under pressure or pushingly connected to the cross connector. Therefore, connection by soldering, staking, or the like is unnecessary, and the incorporation of the communication control IC can be carried out easily. Also, the communication control IC has only to be incorporated after the two-way female connecting terminal and the cross connectors have been installed in the housing. Therefore, the expensive communication control IC can be incorporated at a later stage of connector assembling process, and if a trouble occurs during the connector assembling process, since the communication control IC is not incorporated, the waste of communication control IC can be reduced. Also, since the communication control IC can be removed after being incorporated, if a trouble occurs after the connector assembly, the communication control IC can be removed and recovered for reuse, which can improve the yield of assembling process. Further, a plurality of leads on the bus wiring side of the communication control IC and a plurality of electric wires of the bus wiring circuit can be connected selectively in a crossing portion, so that the connection pattern can be diversified, and the address of connector can be given not only by the communication control IC but also by the connection pattern of the connector and the electric wires.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the present invention, the connecting portion between the bus wiring-side lead of the communication control IC and the electric wire comes to a position offset from the engagement axis line of the connector. Therefore, when the connector engages with the equipment-side connector, the electric wire passing through the connector scarcely becomes a hindrance, so that automatic assembly of connector using a robot etc. can be carried out easily.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to the present invention, the insertion of the equipment-side leads of the communication control IC in the two-way female connecting terminal and the pushing connection of the bus wiring-side leads thereof to the cross connectors can be carried out in the same direction at the same time. Therefore, the communication control IC can be incorporated more easily. Also, since the incorporated communication control IC can be removed easily, at the time when a trouble occurs, the expensive communication control IC can be recovered and reused.</p>
