<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is related to U.S. application Ser. No. 10/789,774, filed Feb. 27, 2004, and is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to analog circuits, and in particular low dropout linear regulators and systems which incorporate low dropout linear regulators.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most linear regulators have feedback which needs some type of stability compensation, either external or internal compensation. To obtain more precise voltage regulation, larger gain is required which inherently makes the feedback less stable. These two trade-offs, large gain and stability, create a design challenge. Other design considerations require low current, reduced silicon area, and good power supply rejection. Many techniques have been implemented for stability compensation. The following patents constitute a sampling of conventional solutions: U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,908,566, 5,168,209, 5,637,992, 5,648,718, 5,744,944, 5,850,139, 5,945,818, 5,982,226, and 6,522,112. All of these techniques use some type of internal zero compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a simplified open loop transfer function of a linear regulator. A regulator with feedback becomes unstable if the open loop gain is &gt;0 dB and the phase is −180 degrees. This condition occurs if at least 2 poles exist below the unity gain bandwidth (UGB). The zero compensation method from the cited patents essentially adds 90 degrees back to the transfer function and keeps the loop stable. Methods to add zero compensation typically increase the power requirement of the circuit and increase the silicon area, especially if large capacitors are needed in silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The P<sub>0 </sub>pole in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is typically caused by a main compensating load capacitor C<sub>1</sub>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. P<sub>a </sub>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents a secondary pole that can be caused by parasitic capacitive loading (C<sub>p1</sub>) at the gate of T<sub>1 </sub>or by a parasitic capacitance (C<sub>p2</sub>) at the base of T<sub>pass</sub>, or even by the OpAmp itself. In general, a circuit arrangement can cause stability problems if at least 2 poles exist below the UGB (i.e., less than the unity gain frequency) and no zero compensation is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In essence there are many places where secondary poles can exist. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, nodes V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>3</sub>, V<sub>f</sub>, V<sub>out </sub>and the OpAmp are potential areas where poles exist. Node V<sub>3</sub>, however, can be the most difficult node to keep sufficiently low in parasitic capacitance, since it has to drive off the chip and at the base of the Pass transistor resulting in 10's of pF's.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The other traditional method of stability compensation is to rely on the ESR (equivalent series resistance) of the load capacitor. The ESR of the load capacitor can provide a compensating zero to offset the extra pole in the feedback typically from the amplifier stage. The issue with relying on the ESR of the capacitor is there can be a narrow range of ESR values allowed for a given design.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is need for an integrated linear regulator have relatively large gain while maintaining stability, with reduced chip layout area and reduced power consumption.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is directed to a linear regulator and circuits incorporating a linear regulator. A typical linear circuit according to the invention includes an external pass transistor that does not rely on internal compensation, provides high gain, and exhibits reduced silicon area and power requirements. Circuits according to the present invention provide sufficient bandwidth with an error amplifier and drive capability to keep any secondary poles sufficiently far from the unity gain bandwidth (UGB) while maintaining good power supply rejection. In accordance with the invention operation of the circuit does not rely on the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the load capacitor.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Circuits embodied in accordance with the present invention keep the secondary poles beyond the UGB. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for example. P<sub>b </sub>represents a secondary pole in the system. As long as the secondary poles are sufficiently beyond the UGB (i.e., greater than the unity gain frequency), the regulator will be stable. There are many places where secondary poles can exist. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for example, nodes V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>3</sub>, V<sub>f</sub>, V<sub>out </sub>and the OpAmp are potential areas where poles exist. Node V<sub>3</sub>, however, can be an especially difficult node to keep sufficiently low in parasitic capacitance, since it has to drive off the chip and at the base of the pass transistor T<sub>pass</sub>, resulting in capacitance of tens of pF's.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a linear regulator <b>100</b> includes an error amplifier comprising an OpAmp circuit. In one embodiment, a single conventional OpAmp device is used. The OpAmp includes a non-inverting input that is coupled to a node which receives a reference voltage, V<sub>ref</sub>. The OpAmp includes an inverting input that is coupled to a node V<sub>f</sub>. An output of the OpAmp is coupled to a node V<sub>1</sub>. A current mirror circuit comprising transistors T<sub>4 </sub>and T<sub>1 </sub>is coupled to the node V<sub>1</sub>. The OpAmp outputs by way of the node V<sub>1 </sub>a driving current to the current mirror circuit. A voltage source VDD<b>2</b> is provided to power the OpAmp. It can be appreciated by those of ordinary skill that alternative embodiments of the invention can incorporate an OpAmp circuit design configured around an arrangement of multiple OpAmp devices. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an example of a configuration in which the OpAmp component shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises multiple OpAmp devices.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A resistor R<sub>1 </sub>is coupled between a second voltage source VDD<b>1</b> and the drain of T<sub>1 </sub>at a node V<sub>2</sub>. Transistor device T<sub>2 </sub>is configured as a source follower, having a gate terminal that is connected to the node V<sub>2 </sub>and a source terminal that is connected to a current source represented schematically as I<sub>S</sub>. The source terminal of T<sub>2 </sub>is also coupled to I<sub>b </sub>flowing at a node V<sub>3</sub>. Typical devices used for transistor device T<sub>2 </sub>include, but are not limited to, P-type FET's (field effect transistors), N-type FET's, NPN BJT's (bipolar junction transistors), and PNP BJT's.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A pass circuit comprising element T<sub>pass </sub>has a control terminal that is connected to the node V<sub>3</sub>. The voltage source VDD<b>1</b> is connected to a first terminal of the pass element T<sub>pass</sub>. The pass element can be any of a number of transistor devices such as a BJT. Though, the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the device to be a device that is external to the linear regulator <b>100</b>, one of ordinary skill will understand that the pass element can be incorporated on-chip.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A second terminal of the pass element T<sub>pass </sub>is coupled to an output node V<sub>out </sub>to provide a regulated voltage to a load. A compensating capacitor C<sub>1 </sub>is coupled across the load. An equivalent series inductance (ESL) of the capacitor is schematically represented. A feedback path from the output node V<sub>out </sub>to the node V<sub>f </sub>is provided through the voltage divider network formed by a pair of resistors R<sub>f</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In operation, a circuit according to the invention operates to drive the base node V<sub>3 </sub>such that the bandwidth at that node is high enough to place a pole beyond the UGB. This ensures stability of the circuit while providing efficient operation for low quiescent current and good power supply rejection. Referring to the illustrative circuit according to the invention, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the output of the OpAmp component is a current which drives the diode-connected mirror of T<sub>4 </sub>and T<sub>1</sub>. Transistor device T<sub>1</sub>, with R<sub>1 </sub>connected to its drain node, provides gain and a DC operating point at node V<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As noted above, the transistor device T<sub>2 </sub>is configured as a source follower and thus operates as a low output impedance gain stage to provide a low impedance drive to node V<sub>3</sub>. Current source I<sub>S </sub>provides a bias current to T<sub>2 </sub>that is substantially less than the base current, I<sub>b</sub>. The voltage source VDD<b>1</b> provides a current to the pass transistor T<sub>pass </sub>and a common voltage reference to R<sub>1</sub>. It is noted that the voltage source VDD<b>2</b> does not have to be the same potential as VDD<b>1</b>. However, in a particular embodiment of the invention VDD<b>2</b> can be the same potential as VDD<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The compensating capacitor C<sub>1 </sub>provides the pole P<sub>0 </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Because T<sub>2 </sub>is configured as a source follower, its output impedance is low. Consequently, the source follower output can drive the parasitic capacitance C<sub>p </sub>of the pass element T<sub>pass </sub>that exists on node V<sub>3 </sub>to provide sufficient bandwidth so that the secondary pole P<sub>b </sub>can be located beyond the frequency of the UGB. This effect is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, where the second pole is. The current for T<sub>2 </sub>is provided primarily by the base of the pass element T<sub>pass</sub>. This configuration exhibits certain advantages. For example, since the current required to supply base current to T<sub>pass </sub>is low during low load current, the quiescent current for the total regulator is low.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another advantage with this configuration is that the source follower acts as a gain stage with an output impedance that decreases with an increase in load current. The current flow through transistor device T<sub>2 </sub>increases as the current draw through the load increases. This in turn decreases the output resistance of T<sub>2 </sub>thus increasing the bandwidth of node V<sub>3</sub>. More bandwidth at V<sub>3 </sub>is needed during higher current loads because the pole at V<sub>out </sub>increases as well with higher current loads. So the poles at V<sub>3 </sub>and V<sub>out </sub>track each other despite the load change. This is a desirable characteristic because it ensures stability during high current loads.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">I<sub>S </sub>is a small current to keep transistor device T<sub>2 </sub>turned ON when no base current is needed during low current demands of the load. The current I<sub>S </sub>serves as a replacement current when I<sub>b </sub>becomes very small during a low loading conditions, to ensure a bias current through the source follower while allowing the pass element T<sub>pass </sub>to shut off. This aspect of the invention ensures low quiescent power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">R<sub>1 </sub>is used to set a normal bias point for node V<sub>2 </sub>in the linear operating range of T<sub>pass </sub>and to keep the pole at a frequency sufficiently higher than the UGB to ensure stable operation. The resistor R<sub>1 </sub>is also used to keep the power supply rejection of the linear regulator low. If VDD<b>1</b> changes, node V<sub>2 </sub>will track this movement and force V<sub>3 </sub>to move in the same manner to keep the base-emitter voltage of T<sub>pass </sub>constant. As noted above, VDD<b>2</b> and VDD<b>1</b> could be the same potential, but can be different if the voltage VDD<b>2</b> for the OpAmp needs to be larger or smaller than VDD<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A key aspect of the invention, as embodied in the illustrative circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is to keep the resulting bandwidth from the combined effect of the nodes V<sub>f</sub>, V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>3 </sub>and the OpAmp approximately a factor of 10 higher than the UGB to maintain stability. With the illustrative circuit shown, keeping the bandwidths at these levels is reasonably achievable. Also, circuits according to the invention do not require a large amount of silicon area to implement and do not draw a large amount of current during operation. In fact, the OpAmp could be a series of OpAmps with several additional internal nodes, provided that the bandwidth of the nodes are sufficiently high.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As a final observation, consideration with any linear regulator of the equivalent series inductance (ESL) needs to be understood. The resonance of the capacitor C<sub>1 </sub>is determined by the capacitance and ESL. The resonance of the capacitor should be chosen to be higher than the UGB.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Generally, a linear voltage regulator circuit according to the present invention, can be used in many electronic circuits which require a regulated voltage. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows an example of the present invention as embodied in an electronic device. In particular, a hard disk drive system <b>500</b> is shown. Typical components include a magnetic head component <b>522</b> for reading tracks of data from a disk <b>512</b>. A signal representing the modulated light signal is sensed by a pre-amp circuit <b>524</b> and delivered to a data channel <b>526</b>. Main power from a computer (not shown) supplies power to the whole drive. However, the voltage requirements for the pre-amp circuit <b>524</b>, the data channel <b>526</b>, a controller <b>528</b>, and a motor and actuator circuit <b>530</b>, each have different supply level requirements, current draw, tolerance and voltage ripple requirements. Imbedded in the data channel <b>526</b> and the controller <b>528</b> typically are sensitive circuits such as phase-locked loops and signal processing circuitry which require tighter tolerance and less “noisy” supplies than the motor and actuator circuit <b>530</b>, for example. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, Vcc supplies power to a PNP transistor pass element <b>504</b>, and may be provided by a switching power supply and will have a higher tolerance and ripple.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A linear regulator circuit <b>502</b> in accordance with the present invention is provided to control the pass element <b>504</b>. The voltage nodes of <b>502</b> correspond to the same nodes as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The linear regulator circuit <b>502</b> of the present invention will supply a tighter tolerance and quieter supply to these sensitive circuits in the data channel and controller. The V<sub>out </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is the linear regulator output and supplies power to circuits <b>526</b> and <b>528</b> at Vdd. The voltage supply Vcc shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> couples to the VDD<b>1</b> supply of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Providing VDD<b>2</b> separate from VDD<b>1</b> allows a lower voltage to be used for the pass element than for the opamp. For example, VDD<b>2</b>=3.3V is a typical power supply voltage for an opamp. However, typical HDD electronics can be driven at a lower voltage of 2.5 V. Thus, setting VDD<b>1</b> to 2.5 V provides about a 0.8V drop in HDD supply voltage levels with corresponding drops in power loss and heat dissipation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates another configuration of a hard disk drive system <b>500</b>′. Here, the linear regulator circuit <b>502</b> is shown incorporated in the controller component <b>528</b>.</p>
