<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims benefit of priority under 35 USC §119 from the Japanese Patent Application No. 2004-57276, filed on Mar. 2, 2004, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit including a standard cell, a standard cell layout design method, and a layout design software product stored in a computer-readable recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In layout design of a semiconductor integrated circuit, a method of laying out standard cells having a predetermined height in the vertical direction (row direction) is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the structure of a typical standard cell. This standard cell has an inverter circuit structure including one p-channel transistor and one n-channel transistor. A gate electrode G, an n-well W<b>1</b> in which a p-channel transistor is formed, and a p-well W<b>2</b> in which an n-channel transistor is formed are laid out in correspondence with a planar structure formed on the surface portion of a semiconductor substrate. A space ha necessary in terms of design rules is present at the well boundary between the n-well W<b>1</b> and the p-well W<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When only logic is taken into consideration, the chip area can be reduced by making each standard cell small. Hence, the total area of a chip can be reduced by forming a standard cell having a small height.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this case, however, the driving capability of one standard cell is low. To form a standard cell with a high driving capability, standard cells SC<b>1</b> must be arrayed vertically in a plurality of stages, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. As a circuit, inverters having identical structures are connected in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As described above, the space ha is necessary at the well boundary. This decreases the efficiency of the area usable as transistors. The more the standard cells stacked in the vertical direction, the larger the space ha becomes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When a height h<b>1</b> of the standard cell is set small, the height in the vertical direction can be suppressed small. However, the length in the horizontal direction must be increased. A cell having a small height and a large width is not preferable from the viewpoint of the degree of freedom in standard cell layout in a chip. Hence, there is a limitation on suppressing the height h<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Conventionally, standard cells having one kind of vertical height (h<b>1</b>) are laid out. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, one row region includes a structure having two stages of standard cells SC<b>1</b> stacked vertically, a structure having one stage of standard cell SC<b>1</b>, and a structure having three stages of standard cells SC<b>1</b>. Hence, bent portions R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> form which connect a power supply voltage line Vcc and a ground voltage line Vss arranged on the upper and lower sides of the row region to the cells in different numbers of stages, resulting in a waste of area.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described above, conventionally, standard cells having one kind of vertical height are stacked in a plurality of stages in accordance with the driving capability. Accordingly, the area efficiency decreases.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The plurality of kinds of standard cells SC<b>1</b> to SCn having different vertical heights are prepared and selectively used in accordance with the driving capability. Accordingly, as compared to a structure including one kind of standard cells having the height h<b>1</b> stacked vertically, the vertical height and the chip area can be reduced while ensuring the same driving capability.</p>

When the standard cell SC<b>1</b> is allocated to the row region RSC<b>1</b>, the standard cell SC<b>2</b> is allocated to the row region RSC<b>2</b>, and the standard cell SC<b>3</b> is allocated to the row region RSC<b>3</b>, the total area of the chip can further be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart showing the procedures of a standard cell layout design method according to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">This layout design method can be stored in a computer-readable recording medium (e.g., a CD-ROM, an MO disk, or a floppy disk) as software which causes a computer to execute the layout design. When a computer is caused to load this program and execute the layout design, a layout apparatus having an arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">This apparatus comprises an input unit <b>101</b> which inputs data given by an operator, an arithmetic unit <b>102</b> which executes processing to be described later by using the input data and data stored in a storage unit <b>103</b> in advance, the storage unit <b>103</b> which stores the arithmetic result or the data input from the input unit <b>101</b>, and an output unit <b>104</b> which outputs the arithmetic result or the data stored in the storage unit <b>103</b> as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In step S<b>10</b> in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, data about the plurality of kinds of standard cells SC<b>1</b> to SCn having different heights, and for example, data such as the vertical sizes h<b>1</b> to hn and driving capabilities of the standard cells SC<b>1</b> to SCn are input to the input unit <b>101</b> and stored in the storage unit <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In step S<b>12</b>, data about the circuit structure of an integrated circuit is input to the input unit <b>101</b>. The arithmetic unit <b>102</b> calculates the number of each of the plurality of kinds of standard cells SC<b>1</b> to SCn on the basis of the driving capability required the circuit structure. The arithmetic unit <b>102</b> also calculates the area necessary for each of the standard cells SC<b>1</b> to SCn. For example, when the area necessary for laying out one standard cell SC<b>1</b> is A (A&gt;0), and M (M is an integer; M≧1) standard cells SC<b>1</b> are required, an area A<b>1</b>×M<b>1</b> is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In step S<b>14</b>, on the basis of the area obtained for each of the standard cells SC<b>1</b> to SCn, the arithmetic unit <b>102</b> calculates the numbers of stages of row regions RSC<b>1</b> to RSCn. For example, the total area necessary for laying out the standard cells SC<b>1</b> is A<b>1</b>×M<b>1</b>, and the area of one stage of the row region RSC<b>1</b> for the standard cells SC<b>1</b> is R<b>1</b>, the number of stages is determined from A<b>1</b>×M<b>1</b>/R<b>1</b> (the fractional portion is rounded up).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, assume that three stages of row regions RSC<b>1</b>, one stage of row region RSC<b>2</b>, and two stages of row regions RSC<b>3</b> are necessary. First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the row regions are arrayed in the vertical direction sequentially from, e.g., the lower side.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In step S<b>16</b>, circuit network information is input to the input unit <b>101</b>. The arithmetic unit <b>102</b> obtains the wiring length when the standard cells SC<b>1</b> to SCn are laid out in the arrayed state of the row regions RSC<b>1</b> to RSC<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The array of the row regions RSC<b>1</b> to RSC<b>3</b> is changed such that the critical wiring length that decides the operation of the entire integrated circuit. That is, the structure is optimized such that the integrated circuit can obtain a desired operation speed. For example, the arrayed state of the row regions RSC<b>1</b> to RSC<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is changed by arraying, vertically from the lower side, one stage of row region RSC<b>1</b>, one stage of row region RSC<b>2</b>, one stage of row region RSC<b>1</b>, two stages of row regions RSC<b>3</b>, and one stage of row region RSC<b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In step S<b>18</b>, the arithmetic unit <b>102</b> lays out the standard cells SC<b>1</b> to SC<b>3</b> respectively in the row regions RSC<b>1</b> to RSC<b>3</b> having the optimized array. After that, the output unit <b>104</b> outputs the arithmetic result.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the standard cells SC<b>1</b> to SCn are respectively laid out in the row regions RSC<b>1</b> to RSCn, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, power supply voltage lines Vcc and ground voltage lines Vss can linearly be arranged. The bent portions R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> which are conventionally formed as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> can be eliminated, and the area efficiency can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to this embodiment, the plurality of kinds of standard cells SC<b>1</b> to SCn having different heights are set in advance. The standard cells are laid out in the dedicated row regions RSC<b>1</b> to RSCn in accordance with the necessary driving capability. Accordingly, the chip area can be reduced as compared to the conventional structure in which one kind of standard cells SC are stacked vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The above-described embodiment is merely an example, and the present invention is not limited to this. For example, the standard cell need not always have an inverter circuit structure and can have an arbitrary circuit structure.</p>
