<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The field of the invention is data processing, or, more specifically, methods, systems, and products for routing telecommunications.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional telecommunications systems often provide a number of telephony devices on which a user may receive calls in a particular networked environment. Conventional telecommunications systems also provide a call routing to one or more of the individual telephony devices. To route a call to a particular user however, conventional telecommunications system route the call to a particular telephony device most likely to be near the user. For example, a telephone system in an office may route calls for a particular user to the telephony device in the user's office. Most users, however, are not static. That is, most users move about their networked environment. It would be advantageous therefore to route telecommunications to users based upon their location within their networked environment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Methods, systems, and products are provided for routing telecommunications to a user, the method including receiving a call, determining that the call is intended for the user, receiving an RFID signal from a user's RFID tag, determining the location of the user in dependence upon the RFID signal, and forwarding the call to a telephony device in dependence upon the user's location. In typical embodiments, determining that the call is intended for the user also include prompting the caller for the name of the user, receiving from the caller as speech the name of the user, converting the speech to a text, and retrieving a user record in dependence upon the text.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In typical embodiments, determining the location of the user in dependence upon the RFID signal also includes receiving a plurality of RFID signals from the RFID tag at a plurality of RFID reader locations and determining the location of the user in dependence upon the RFID reader locations and a rule. In typical embodiments, determining the location of the user in dependence upon the RFID signal also includes receiving a plurality of RFID signals at a plurality of RFID reader locations from the RFID tag, determining for each RFID reader an area of possible locations of the RFID tag, and determining the intersection of the areas of possible locations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In typical embodiments, determining for each RFID reader an area of possible locations of the RFID tag includes determining for each RFID reader a distance between the RFID reader and the RFID tag. In typical embodiments, forwarding the call to a telephony device in dependence upon the user's location also includes selecting a telephony device in dependence upon the user's location and transferring the call to the telephony device. Typical embodiments also include identifying location based routing preferences or the user, where forwarding the call to a telephony device in dependence upon the user's location also include transferring the call to a telephony device in dependence upon the user's location and the user's location based routing preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular descriptions of exemplary embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numbers generally represent like parts of exemplary embodiments of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Introduction</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention is described to a large extent in this specification in terms of methods for routing telecommunications. Persons skilled in the art, however, will recognize that any computer system that includes suitable programming means for operating in accordance with the disclosed methods also falls well within the scope of the present invention. Suitable programming means include any means for directing a computer system to execute the steps of the method of the invention, including for example, systems comprised of processing units and arithmetic-logic circuits coupled to computer memory, which systems have the capability of storing in computer memory, which computer memory includes electronic circuits configured to store data and program instructions, programmed steps of the method of the invention for execution by a processing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The invention also may be embodied in a computer program product, such as a diskette or other recording medium, for use with any suitable data processing system. Embodiments of a computer program product may be implemented by use of any recording medium for machine-readable information, including magnetic media, optical media, or other suitable media. Persons skilled in the art will immediately recognize that any computer system having suitable programming means will be capable of executing the steps of the method of the invention as embodied in a program product. Persons skilled in the art will recognize immediately that, although most of the exemplary embodiments described in this specification are oriented to software installed and executing on computer hardware, nevertheless, alternative embodiments implemented as firmware or as hardware are well within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Exemplary Architecture</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Methods, systems, and computer program products for routing telecommunications are explained with reference to the accompanying drawings, beginning with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> sets forth a line drawing illustrating an exemplary system for routing telecommunications. The term ‘telecommunications’ in this specification means the art of communicating over a distance by telephony device, telephone, telegraph, radio, or any other device designed to facilitate such communications between users. In this specification a ‘telephony device’ is any device useful in facilitating telecommunications between users. Telephony device include computers, digital communications equipment, analog communications equipment or any other communications device that will occur to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a networked environment (<b>106</b>), which in this example is a networked home environment for a user (<b>124</b>). The description of a networked home environment is for explanation only and not for limitation. In fact, systems for routing telecommunications to a user may be implemented in any networked environment such as a networked office, business, or other environment as will occur to those of skill in the art. Included within the networked home environment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are RFID readers (<b>118</b>, <b>111</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>112</b>) fixed at different locations within the home. The living room (<b>150</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has fixed with it three RFID readers (<b>118</b>, <b>111</b>, and <b>110</b>). The kitchen (<b>104</b>) of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has fixed within it one RFID reader (<b>116</b>). The bedroom (<b>107</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has fixed within it two RFID readers (<b>114</b>, <b>115</b>). The office (<b>129</b>) has fixed within it one RFID reader (<b>112</b>). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> an RFID tag (<b>119</b>) is located with or attached to the user (<b>124</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">“RFID” means Radio Frequency Identification, a technology useful in locating users (<b>124</b>) within the networked environment (<b>106</b>) by use of an antenna, a transceiver, and a transponder or ‘tag.’ RFID transceivers are treated in this specification as including the electronic devices needed to convert the information in a radio signal into useful computer data; in this specification, therefore, RFID transceivers are referred to as “RFID readers.” As the term ‘transceiver’ implies, however, RFID readers may read and write information to and from RFID transponders. RFID transponders are referred to in this specification as “RFID tags.” RFID tags are programmed with RFID identification codes unique to each RFID tag. A unique RFID tag located with the user is used to uniquely locate the user within the networked environment.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An RFID antenna emits radio signals to activate an RFID tag and read and write data to and from the tag. Antennas act as data conduits between tags and transceivers or RFID readers. Antennas are available in a variety of shapes and sizes. An RFID reader typically emits radio waves at power levels and at frequencies that are useful at ranges of anywhere from a few inches to 100 feet or more. When an RFID tag (<b>119</b>) passes through the electromagnetic field of a radio signal from an RFID antenna, the RFID tag detects the reader's activation signal. The reader decodes the data encoded in the tag's integrated circuit, typically a silicon chip.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">An RFID device that did not actively transmit to a reader was traditionally known as a ‘tag.’ An RFID device that actively transmitted to a reader was known as a transponder (TRANSmitter+resPONDER). It has become common in the industry, however, to interchange terminology and refer these devices as either tags or transponders more or less interchangeably. In this specification, for clarity of usage, the term ‘tag’ is used to refer generally to all RFID devices.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Tags are programmed with data that identifies the tag and therefore the user located with the tag. Tags can be either read-only, volatile read/write, or write once/read many (“WORM”) and can be either active or passive. Active tags generally use batteries to power the tag's radio transmitter and receiver. Active tags generally contain more components than do passive tags, so active tags are usually larger in size and more expensive than passive tag. An active tag's memory size varies according to application requirements; some systems operate with up to a megabyte or more of memory. The useful life of an active tag is related to its battery life. Passive tags can be either battery or non-battery operated, according to their intended applications.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Passive tags reflect the RF signal transmitted to them from a reader and add information by modulating the reflected signal to convey identifying or descriptive information stored in computer memory in the tag. A passive tag having a battery usually does not use its battery to boost the energy of the reflected signal. A passive tag typically would use a battery to maintain memory in the tag or power the electronics that enable the tag to modulate the reflected signal. Passive RFID tags often operate without a battery or other power source, obtaining operating power generated from an RFID reader. Passive tags are typically much lighter than active tags, less expensive, and offer a very long operational lifetime. The trade off is that passive RFID tags have shorter read ranges than active tags and require a higher-powered reader.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">RFID tags come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Animal tracking tags, inserted beneath an animal's skin, can be as small as a pencil lead in diameter and one-half inch in length. Some tags are screw-shaped to identify trees or wooden items, or credit-card shaped for use in access applications. The anti-theft hard plastic tags attached to merchandise in stores are RFID tags.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, RFID signals (<b>122</b>, <b>126</b>, and <b>124</b>), transmitted from RFID readers (<b>118</b>, <b>111</b>, and <b>110</b>) activates RFID tag (<b>119</b>), a small form-factor, passive tag located with the user. Tag (<b>119</b>) has stored in computer memory within it at least one unique identifications code or serial number that uniquely identifies the tag and therefore uniquely identifies the user located with the tag. The RFID readers are coupled for data communications with the communications gateway (<b>108</b>). “Coupled for data communications” means any form of data communications, wireless, 802.11b, Bluetooth, infrared, radio, internet protocols, HTTP protocols, email protocols, networked, direct connections, dedicated phone lines, dial-ups, serial connections with RS-232 (EIA232) or Universal Serial Buses, hard-wired parallel port connections, network connections according to the Power Line Protocol, and other forms of connection for data communications as will occur to those of skill in the art. Couplings for data communications include networked couplings for data communications. Examples of networks useful with various embodiments of the invention include cable networks, intranets, extranets, internets, local area networks, wide area networks, and other network arrangements as will occur to those of skill in the art. The use of any networked coupling among television channels, cable channels, video providers, telecommunications sources, and the like, is well within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The exemplary communications gateway (<b>108</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is capable of receiving from the RFID readers an indication that the RFID reader has received an RFID signal from an RFID tag located with the user. In many embodiments of the present invention, the RFID readers are advantageously wirelessly coupled for data communications with the communications gateway (<b>108</b>). In many alternative embodiments, the RFID readers transmit an indication that an RFID signal was received by the RFID reader to a communications application running on the communications gateway using various protocols such as Bluetooth, 802.11, HTTP, WAP, or any other protocol that will occur to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The exemplary communications gateway (<b>108</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is also capable of determining the location of the user within the networked environment (<b>106</b>) and routing calls to a selected telephony device (<b>132</b>, <b>131</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>) in dependence upon the user's location. As discussed in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b>, determining the location of the user in dependence upon RFID signals can be carried out by near field sensing of the user's tag at fixed locations within the networked environment or through the user of trilateration. The exemplary descriptions of near field sensing and trilateration are for explanation and not for limitation. In fact, there are many ways of determining the location of the user in dependence upon RFID signals that will occur to those of skill in the art and all such ways are will within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The exemplary communications gateway (<b>108</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is also coupled for data communications to a wide area network (<b>102</b>) to an enterprise server (<b>101</b>) which is coupled for data communications to a RFID-based telecommunications routing database (<b>128</b>) having stored within it a user account (<b>120</b>) record for the user (<b>124</b>) that contains preference data and other information useful to route telecommunication to a device within the networked environment in dependence upon the user's location within the networked environment. The communications gateway (<b>108</b>) supports both traditional telecommunications functions through a PSTN Network (“Public Swithed Telephone Network”) (<b>103</b>) as well as packet switched telephony through the WAN (<b>102</b>) such as for example VOIP (“Voice Over Internet Protocol”) telecommunications. The exemplary communications gateway (<b>108</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> communications gateway of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an OSGi-enabled gateway capable of telecommunications routing within the networked domain. OSGi Stands for ‘Open Services Gateway Initiative.’ The OSGi specification is a Java-based application layer framework that provides vendor neutral application and device layer APIs and functions for various devices using arbitrary communication protocols operating in networks in homes, cars, and other environments. OSGi works with a variety of networking technologies like Ethernet, Bluetooth, the ‘Home, Audio and Video Interoperability standard’ (HAVi), IEEE 1394, Universal Serial Bus (USB), WAP, X-10, Lon Works, HomePlug and various other networking technologies. The OSGi specification is available for free download from the OSGi website at www.osgi.org. Telephony APIs (“Application Programming Interface”) are available to implement call routing with the exemplary communications gateway of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Examples of telephony APIs include Java Telephony API available from Sun Microsystems, Inc., CallPath API available from IBM®, and others that will occur to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The system for routing telecommunications to a user of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is capable of receiving a call through a PSTN network (<b>103</b>) or a packet switch WAN (<b>102</b>) and determining that the call is intended for the user (<b>124</b>). The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is also capable of receiving one or more RFID signals (<b>126</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>122</b>) from a user's RFID tag (<b>119</b>) and determining the location of the user (<b>124</b>) in dependence upon the RFID signals (<b>126</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>122</b>). The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is also capable of identifying location based routing preferences for a user maintained in a user account (<b>120</b>) stored in an RFID based telecommunications database (<b>128</b>) accessible through an enterprise server (<b>101</b>) through the WAN (<b>102</b>). The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is also capable of identifying a particular a telephony device (<b>132</b>) among a plurality of telephony devices (<b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>) in the networked environment in dependence of location based routing preferences for a user and forwarding the call to the telephony device in dependence upon the user's location and the user's location based routing preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some cases a more than one telephony device (<b>131</b>, <b>132</b>) may be available to a user at a particular location within the networked environment. In such cases, the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is capable of receiving a call and determining that the call is intended for the user (<b>124</b>). The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is capable of receiving one or more RFID signals (<b>126</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>122</b>) from an RFID tag (<b>119</b>) located with the user (<b>124</b>); determining the user's location in dependence upon the RFID signals (<b>126</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>122</b>) and identifying a plurality of available telephony devices (<b>131</b>, <b>132</b>) in dependence upon the user's location. The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is capable of identifying a device-based preference for the user, selecting one (<b>132</b>) of the plurality of available telephony devices (<b>131</b>) in dependence upon the device-based preferences and forwarding the call to the selected telephony device (<b>132</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Users are often not static in a networked environment. That is, users often move around in a networked environment and often move from room to room. With the wide number of telephony devices and telecommunications methods available to a user, after receiving a call on a particular telephony device a user may move and in such cases the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is capable of rerouting the call to another telephony device in dependence upon an anticipated future location of the user. In such cases the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is capable of rerouting telecommunications to a user by receiving a plurality of RFID signals (<b>126</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>122</b>) from an RFID tag (<b>119</b>) located with the user (<b>124</b>); anticipating a user's future location in dependence upon the RFID signals (<b>126</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>122</b>); selecting a telephony device in dependence upon the anticipated future location; and rerouting an ongoing call to the selected telephony device. In such cases, the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> advantageously provides seamless telecommunications to the user across the networked environment without requiring user intervention to reroute the ongoing call to another telephony device.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As discussed above, the communications gateway (<b>108</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an OSGi enabled gateway. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in addition to being able to route telecommunications to the user (<b>124</b>), the communications gateway (<b>108</b>) is also capable of receiving device events from non-telephony devices within the networked environment and notifying the user of the receipt of such device events. Examples of such non-telephony devices capable of producing device events are coffee pots, ovens, dishwashers, computers, stereos, copy machines, and other devices that will occur to those of skill in the art. Such network-enabled devices are able to report their status to the communications gateway through events herein called device event. For example, a device event may be generated when the coffee pot has completed brewing a pot of coffee.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a networked coffee pot (<b>151</b>) is coupled for data communications with the communications gateway (<b>108</b>).

The use of a coffee pot in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is for explanation and not for limitation. The number and kind of networked devices, both telephony and non-telephony, capable of reporting a device event to a communications gateway is almost endless and all such devices are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is also capable of establishing RFID-based telecommunications routing for a user. In the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a user is empowered to log onto a communications application running on the communications gateway by use of a browser running on a laptop (<b>136</b>) in the user's office (<b>129</b>). The system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> establishes RFID based telecommunications routing by identifying the plurality of telephony devices (<b>131</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, and <b>136</b>) available to the user (<b>124</b>) in the networked environment and identifying the location of the telephony devices.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As discussed above, RFID-based telecommunications routing is often implemented through the use of a computers. For further explanation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> sets forth a block diagram of automated computing machinery comprising a communications gateway (<b>108</b>) useful in routing telecommunications to a user according to embodiments of the present invention. The communications gateway (<b>108</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in some exemplary architectures, an OSGi compatible services gateway. While exemplary embodiments of routing telecommunications to a user are described in this specification using OSGi, many other applications and frameworks will work to implement routing telecommunications to a user according to the present invention, and are therefore also well within the scope of the present invention. Commercial implementations of OSGi, such as JES and SMF, are also useful in implementing methods of the present invention. “JES” stands for Java Embedded Server. JES is a commercial implementation of OSGi that provides a framework for development, deployment, and installation of applications and services to embedded devices. “SMF” stands for “Service Management Framework™” available from IBM®. SMF is a commercial implementation of OSGi for management of network delivered applications on services gateways.</p>

Stored in RAM (<b>168</b>) is an operating system (<b>154</b>). Operating systems useful in computers according to embodiments of the present invention include Unix, Linux, Microsoft NT™, and many others as will occur to those of skill in the art. Operating system (<b>154</b>) in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is shown in RAM (<b>154</b>), but many components of an operating system typically are stored in non-volatile memory (<b>166</b>) also.</p>

The services framework (<b>190</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a hosting platform for running ‘services’. Services are the main building blocks for creating applications in the OSGi. An OSGi services framework (<b>190</b>) is written in Java and therefore, typically runs on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) (<b>150</b>).</p>

In this specification, communications applications are often discussed in the context of OSGi. However, the discussion of OSGi is for explanation and not for limitation. In fact, communications applications according to various embodiments of the present invention can be implemented in any programming language, C, C++, COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, and so on, as will occur to those of skill in the art, and communications applications developed in languages other than Java are installed directly upon an operating system or operating environment rather than a JVM.</p>

While exemplary embodiments of methods for routing telecommunications to a user are described in this specification using OSGi, many other applications and frameworks other than OSGi will work to implement methods of administering devices according to the present invention and are therefore well within the scope of the present invention. The services gateway (<b>108</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes a service framework (<b>190</b>). An OSGi service framework (<b>190</b>) is written in Java and therefore, typically runs on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) (<b>150</b>). In OSGi, the service framework (<b>190</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a hosting platform for running ‘services’ (<b>192</b>). The term ‘service’ or ‘services’ in this disclosure, depending on context, generally refers to OSGi-compliant services.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Services (<b>192</b>) are the main building blocks for creating applications according to the OSGi. A service (<b>192</b>) is a group of Java classes and interfaces that implement a certain feature. The OSGi specification provides a number of standard services. For example, OSGi provides a standard HTTP service that creates a web server that can respond to requests from HTTP clients.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">OSGi also provides a set of standard services called the Device Access Specification. The Device Access Specification (“DAS”) provides services to identify a device connected to the services gateway, search for a driver for that device, and install the driver for the device.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Services (<b>192</b>) in OSGi are packaged in ‘bundles’ (<b>193</b>) with other files, images, and resources that the services (<b>192</b>) need for execution. A bundle (<b>193</b>) is a Java archive or ‘JAR’ file including one or more service implementations (<b>192</b>), an activator class (<b>196</b>), and a manifest file (<b>194</b>). An activator class (<b>196</b>) is a Java class that the service framework (<b>190</b>) uses to start and stop a bundle. A manifest file (<b>194</b>) is a standard text file that describes the contents of the bundle (<b>193</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the exemplary architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes a communications application (<b>407</b>). In many embodiments of the present invention, the communications application is an OSGi service that carries out telecommunications routing according to embodiments of the present invention. The communications application (<b>108</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is packaged within a bundle (<b>193</b>) and installed on the services framework (<b>190</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The services framework (<b>190</b>) in OSGi also includes a service registry (<b>198</b>). The service registry (<b>198</b>) includes a service registration (<b>197</b>) including the service's name and an instance of a class that implements the service for each bundle (<b>193</b>) installed on the framework (<b>190</b>) and registered with the service registry (<b>198</b>). A bundle (<b>193</b>) may request services that are not included in the bundle (<b>193</b>) but are registered on the framework service registry (<b>198</b>). To find a service, a bundle (<b>193</b>) performs a query on the framework's service registry (<b>198</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As mentioned above, RFID-based telecommunications routing according to embodiments of the present invention advantageously routes telecommunications to users in dependence upon user preferences. Such user preferences include both location based routing preferences, as well as device-based routing preferences. The present section of this disclosure is directed toward routing telecommunications to a user in dependence upon location and, in some embodiments, using location- based routing preferences. For further explanation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> sets forth a flow chart illustrating an exemplary method for routing telecommunications to a user. The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes receiving (<b>402</b>) a call (<b>404</b>). In typical embodiments of the present invention, receiving (<b>402</b>) a call (<b>404</b>) includes receiving in a communications gateway a call transmitted through either a packet switched wide area network, the public switched telephone network or any other telecommunications-enabled network that will occur to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes determining (<b>406</b>) that the call (<b>404</b>) is intended for the user (<b>408</b>). In typical embodiments, determining (<b>406</b>) that the call (<b>404</b>) is intended for the user (<b>408</b>) is carried out a communications application bundle executing on the communications gateway. In some such embodiments, the bundle includes one or more services implementing an automated call hander and speech to text conversion. For further explanation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> sets forth a flow chart illustrating an exemplary method for determining that the call (<b>404</b>) is intended for the user (<b>408</b>). The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes prompting (<b>502</b>) the caller for the name of the user and receiving (<b>504</b>) from the caller as speech (<b>506</b>) the name of the user. Prompting (<b>502</b>) the caller for the name of the user may be carried out by playing a prerecorded prompt to the user requesting that the user speak the name of the intended recipient of the call.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also includes converting (<b>508</b>) the speech (<b>506</b>) to text (<b>510</b>). Off the shelf speech-to-text conversion and speech recognition software is commercially available and is available for use by communications applications of the present invention for use in determining that a call is intended for a particular user. Examples of such a commercially available products are ViaVoice™ available from IBM® and the Java Speech API available from Sun Microsystems, Inc.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also includes retrieving (<b>512</b>) a user record (<b>408</b>) in dependence upon the text (<b>510</b>). In the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, retrieving (<b>512</b>) a user record (<b>408</b>) in dependence upon the text (<b>510</b>) includes searching a database (<b>514</b>) containing user records on the text of the user's name. If the search returns a match, the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes returning to the executing communications application a user record for the identified user.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The exemplary user record (<b>408</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes a user ID (<b>410</b>) uniquely identifying the user. The exemplary user record (<b>408</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also includes an identification of the user's RFID tag (<b>414</b>) uniquely identifying the RFID tag. The exemplary user record (<b>408</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes a preference ID (<b>412</b>) identifying user preferences such as location-based routing preferences and device-based routing preferences discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Continuing again with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>: The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes receiving (<b>415</b>) an RFID signal (<b>416</b>) from a user's RFID tag (<b>414</b>). As discussed above, RFID tags are often available as either active RFID tags or passive RFID tags. The RFID signal in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> therefore can be either an RFID signal from an active RFID tag located with or attached to the user or an RFID signal from a passive RFID tag located with or attached to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also includes determining (<b>418</b>) the location (<b>420</b>) of the user in dependence upon the RFID signal (<b>414</b>). As discussed in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b>, determining the location of the user in dependence upon RFID signals can be carried out by near field sensing of the user's tag at fixed locations within the networked environment or through the user of trilateration. The exemplary descriptions of near field sensing and trilateration are for explanation and not for limitation. In fact, there are many ways of determining the location of the user in dependence upon RFID signals that will occur to those of skill in the art and all such ways are will within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also includes identifying (<b>418</b>) location-based routing preferences (<b>455</b>) for the user and forwarding (<b>422</b>) the call (<b>404</b>) to a telephony device (<b>134</b>) in dependence upon the user's location (<b>420</b>) and the user's location based routing preferences (<b>455</b>). Location-based routing preferences are preferences for a user describing a preferred routing of telecommunications in dependence upon the user's location. For example, an exemplary location-based routing preference may demonstrate that despite having more telephony devices available, a user will accept calls on telephony devices in the living room and the bedroom only. Therefore, when the user's location is within a range of locations predetermined to be closer to the living room, calls are routed to the living room. When the user's location is within a range of locations predetermined to be closer to the bedroom room, calls are routed to the bedroom.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, location-based routing preferences are implemented as a location-based preference record (<b>455</b>). The exemplary location-based preference record (<b>455</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes a user ID (<b>410</b>) uniquely identifying the user. The exemplary location-based preference record (<b>455</b>) also includes a location ID (<b>411</b>) identifying the user location for which the location based routing preference is to be implemented. The location ID (<b>411</b>) may be a lattitude and longitude, a room designation, a physical address, or a range of locations represented in any manner as will occur to those of skill in the art. The location-based preference record (<b>455</b>) includes a preference ID (<b>413</b>) uniquely identifying the routing preference associated with the location ID.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As discussed above, determining the location of a user through the use of RFID can be carried out in a number of ways. On way of determining the location of the user includes near field sensing of the RFID tag at fixed reader locations in the networked domain and applying a rule set to the identified fixed reader locations to approximate the location of the user. For further explanation therefore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> sets forth an exemplary method for determining the location of the user in dependence upon RFID signals. The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes receiving (<b>610</b>) a plurality of RFID signals (<b>414</b>) from a user's RFID tag at a plurality of RFID reader locations (<b>612</b>) and storing (<b>614</b>) the reader ID and date and time that the signal was received in a data structure representing an indication of the user's location.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a user location record (<b>602</b>) represents an indication of the user' location and each of which is created in response to receiving an RFID signal from the user's RFID tag at a fixed location within the networked domain and stored in a user location history (<b>920</b>) which is a collection of user location records. The exemplary user location record (<b>602</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes a user ID field (<b>410</b>) uniquely identifying the user. The user exemplary user location record (<b>602</b>) includes an RFID tag ID (<b>414</b>) identifying the user's RFID tag sending the RFID signal to the RFID reader located at a fixed location within the networked environment. The exemplary user location record (<b>602</b>) also includes a reader ID field (<b>604</b>) uniquely identifying the RFID reader receiving the RFID singal. The exemplary user location record (<b>602</b>) also includes a reader location (<b>605</b>) identifying the location of the RFID reader in the networked domain. The exemplary user location record also includes the date (<b>606</b>) and time (<b>608</b>) that the RFID reader received the signal.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also includes determining (<b>616</b>) the location (<b>420</b>) of the user in dependence upon the RFID reader locations (<b>605</b>) and a rule (<b>617</b>). Applying a rule to a plurality of fixed reader locations, each of which approximates a user's location provides increased accuracy to the approximate user location provided by sensing the user's RFID tag a fixed location within the networked environment.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For further explanation consider the following use case. RFID readers are fixed at various locations in a user's office. An RFID reader is fixed near the entrance of a copy room, an RFID reader is also fixed at various locations within the copy room. If the RFID reader at the entrance of the copy room receives an RFID signal from the user's RFID tag and the RFID readers within the copy room receive an RFID signals soon thereafter, it is determined that the user is within the copy room. A rule useful in describing this use case is:</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Near field sensing of the user at fixed points in the networked domain advantageously provides a rough estimate of the user's location within the networked environment. Applying rules to the near field sensing of a user at plurality of fixed locations provides increased accuracy in approximating the user's location.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As just discussed above, near field sensing of a user at fixed points in the networked environment is a mechanism for locating the user without attempting to specifically locate the RFID tag itself. The user is located only by determining that the user's RFID tag is within the range of one or more RFID readers. A user may be more accurately located through the use of a method called trilateration. For further explanation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> set forth line drawings that when taken together illustrate a method for determining the location of the user in dependence upon received RFID signals that uses trilateration. The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> includes receiving a plurality of RFID signals from the user's RFID tag (<b>612</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>) at a plurality of RFID reader locations (<b>612</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>b</i>, and <b>612</b><i>c </i>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and determining for each RFID reader a distance (A, B, and C on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) between each he RFID reader and the user's RFID tag.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> also includes determining for each RFID reader (<b>612</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>b</i>, and <b>612</b><i>c </i>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) an area (<b>704</b><i>a</i>, <b>704</b><i>b</i>, and <b>704</b><i>c </i>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of possible locations of the RFID tag in dependence upon the distance (A, B, and C on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) between the RFID readers (<b>612</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>b</i>, and <b>612</b><i>c </i>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) and the RFID tag (<b>612</b>). In the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the area (<b>704</b><i>a</i>, <b>704</b><i>b</i>, and <b>704</b><i>c </i>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of possible locations of the RFID tag is represented by an area defined by a radius equal to the distance (A, B, and C on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) between each RFID reader and the RFID tag. The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> also includes determining the intersection (<b>702</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of the areas (<b>704</b><i>a</i>, <b>704</b><i>b</i>, and <b>704</b><i>c </i>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of possible locations of the RFID tag. The intersection of the areas (<b>704</b><i>a</i>, <b>704</b><i>b</i>, and <b>704</b><i>c </i>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of possible locations is the approximate location of the RFID tag and therefore the user. As will occur those of skill in the art, increasing the number of RFID readers available for use in the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> often decreases the area of intersection.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown above, the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> includes determining the distance (A, B, and C, on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) between the RFID readers (<b>612</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>b</i>, and <b>612</b><i>c </i>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) and the users RFID tag (<b>612</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). One way of determining the distance (A, B, and <b>3</b>, on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) between the RFID readers (<b>612</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>b</i>, and <b>612</b><i>c </i>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) and the users RFID tag (<b>612</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is carried out by sending from each RFID reader an RFID singnal. If another RFID signal is returned by an RFID tag, the method includes determining the period of time between sending the first RFID signal and receiving the response signal from the RFID tag. This period of time is then divided by two and then divided by the speed of the RFID signal to determine the distance between the reader and the tag.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Because radio signals travel at the speed of light, accurately measuring the send and response time of signal travel between a reader and tag may be cumbersome. Another method of determining the distance (A, B, and C, on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) between the RFID readers (<b>612</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>b</i>, and <b>612</b><i>c </i>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) and the users RFID tag (<b>612</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) that is less cumbersome includes using varying signal strengths to vary the range of the RFID reader. In such cases, an RFID reader sends an RFID signal, and if a tag responds, the reader sends another signal with less strength. The reader repeatedly sends signals of diminishing strength until the tag no longer responds. The strength of each signal has a predetermined range of effectiveness. Therefore, by systematically reducing the range of effectiveness of the reader, the distance (A, B, and C, on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) between the RFID readers (<b>612</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>b</i>, and <b>612</b><i>c </i>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) and the users RFID tag (<b>612</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) can be approximated as being between the range of effectiveness of the signal for having the last response from a tag and the range of effectiveness for the signal for which there was no response from the tag. Systematically varying the signal strength to approximate the distance between the reader and tag provide a less cumbersome method of determining the distance (A, B, and C, on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) between the RFID readers (<b>612</b><i>a</i>, <b>612</b><i>b</i>, and <b>612</b><i>c </i>on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) and the users RFID tag (<b>612</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Rerouting Ongoing Telecommunications to a User</heading>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Users are often not static in a networked environment. That is, users often move around in a networked environment and often move from room to room. With the wide number of telephony devices available to a user, after receiving a call on a particular telephony device a user may move and in such cases it is advantageous to reroute the call to another telephony device in dependence upon an anticipated future location of the user. For further explanation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> sets forth another exemplary method for rerouting telecommunications to a user. The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> includes receiving (<b>620</b>) a plurality of RFID signals (<b>416</b>) from an RFID tag (<b>414</b>) located with the user (<b>408</b>) and anticipating (<b>622</b>) a user's future location (<b>624</b>) in dependence upon the RFID signals (<b>416</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Anticipating (<b>622</b>) a user's future location (<b>624</b>) in dependence upon the RFID signals (<b>416</b>) can be carried out using a combination of the methods for locating a user described above.

A user location history is a data structure containing identifications of previous locations of a user indexed by the date and time (<b>924</b>) the user was at the previous location. The exemplary user location history of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> includes a user ID (<b>410</b>) uniquely identifying the user location.

A line through four locations in a user location history indicates the user is traveling north through the door to the living room. A communications gateway implementing this exemplary location prediction rule predicts that the user is leaving the office and entering the living room. The communications gateway implementing this rule therefore predicts that the user's future location is in the living room.

For example, a coffee pot may be configured to send a device event notifying the communications gateway that the pot has finished brewing without requiring the gateway to poll the coffee pot. Alternatively, receiving (<b>820</b>) a device event (<b>822</b>) includes polling the device periodically for the status of the device.
