<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to ceiling fans and specifically to a system for quickly mounting and connecting a ceiling fan to a ceiling and existing electrical wiring.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Traditionally, ceiling fans have been installed by a laborious, time consuming and often cumbersome practice. The conventional ceiling fan includes a ceiling plate which is secured to an electric outlet box by passing the lead wires of the outlet box through a central circular opening in the ceiling plate. Mounting screws are passed through two elongated openings in the ceiling plate to threadingly engage with two threaded holes diagonally separated from each other on the periphery of the outlet box. Alternatively, wood screws are passed through the ceiling plate and the outlet box and into a wood stud which supports the outlet box. In either event, the screws are tightened until the ceiling plate is securely mounted on the outlet box. The typical ceiling plate includes a hanging hook.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When a typical ceiling fan assembly is mounted to the ceiling plate, the motor, fan blades and an optional light assembly are secured to a canopy by a down rod or hanger rod. The down rod passes through a central opening in the canopy with a ball mount located at an end of the down rod engaged by a periphery of the opening of the canopy. A radially inwardly extending prong projecting from the periphery of the opening of the canopy engages a slot in the ball mount to allow pivoting of the fan assembly with respect to the canopy.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The canopy includes at each of two opposite locations, a hole and an L-shaped groove. When assembled, the fan assembly is lifted by the canopy so that one hole on one side of the canopy is fitted through the free end of the ceiling hook. The fan assembly is thereby suspended from the ceiling hook.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The electrical lead wires from the ceiling plate are then connected to the lead wires from the fan motor. When the electrical connections are completed, a screw is installed in each of the two screw holes located on opposite sides of the ceiling plate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The installer of the fan assembly, who is usually positioned at an elevated height by a ladder or some other means, must then lift the entire fan assembly and free the fan assembly from the ceiling plate by removing the canopy from engagement with the free end of the ceiling hook. The amount of allowable movement of the fan assembly is limited by the connection of the electrical wire leads. Therefore, only a small amount of movement of the fan assembly is possible before strain is placed on the connections of the wire leads.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The canopy and fan assembly are lifted until the L-shaped grooves on opposite sides of the canopy are fitted over the shanks of the screws secured in the opposite sides of the ceiling plate. The canopy is at first lifted vertically until the shank of each screw engages the bottom of the portion of the L-shaped groove which is initiated at the uppermost edge of the canopy. The canopy and therefore the entire fan assembly is then twisted so that the shanks of the screws in the ceiling plate slide in the remaining portion of the L-shaped grooves in the canopy.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The canopy of the fan assembly is twisted until the holes at the opposite sides of the canopy are aligned with the two remaining screw holes in the opposite sides of the ceiling plate. A third and fourth screw are inserted, respectively, through the opposite sides of the canopy and into the ceiling plate to anchor the canopy and thus the entire fan assembly on the ceiling plate and suspend the fan from the ceiling.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, it is seen that a need has long existed for a ceiling light mounting system that could be more easily and quickly mounted a ceiling fan. It thus is to the provision of such that the present invention is primarily directed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a preferred form of the invention, a ceiling fan hanging system for a ceiling fan having an electric motor with electric wiring to a structure having electric wiring comprises a ceiling mounting plate, a canopy mounting plate, coupling means for coupling the ceiling mounting plate to the canopy mounting plate, electrical connecting means for electrically connecting the electric wires of the ceiling fan motor to the electric wires of the structure, and a canopy adapted to be mounted to the canopy mounting plate. The electric connecting means includes a slide moveably mounted to the canopy mounting plate, a first electrical connector mounted to the slide, and a second electrical connector mounted to the ceiling mounting plate and configured to mate with the first electrical connector. The slide is moveable between a disengaged position wherein the first connector is disengaged from the second connector and an engaged position wherein the first connector is electrically engaged with the second connector.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">With reference next to the drawings, there is shown a ceiling fan hanging system <b>10</b> in a preferred form of the invention which is adapted to be utilized with a conventional ceiling fan <b>11</b>. The ceiling fan <b>11</b> includes a fan motor housing <b>12</b>, a plurality of fan blades <b>13</b> to the motor, and a switch housing to which an optional light kit may be mounted. A downrod <b>15</b> extends from the motor in the motor housing to the ceiling fan canopy assembly <b>16</b> which includes the hanging system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The canopy assembly <b>16</b> includes a ceiling mounting plate <b>17</b>, a canopy mounting plate <b>18</b>, a canopy <b>19</b>, and a canopy trim ring <b>20</b>. The ceiling mounting plate <b>17</b> has a generally planar central surface <b>23</b> and a peripheral rim <b>24</b>. The central surface <b>23</b> has a central opening <b>25</b> therethrough, two elongated mounting slots <b>26</b>, two loops <b>27</b>, and three L-shaped mounting hooks or tabs <b>28</b>. A mounting screw is passed through each mounting slot <b>26</b>. A male electrical connector <b>32</b> is fixedly mounted to the central surface <b>23</b>. The male electrical connector <b>32</b> has five wire receivers <b>33</b> corresponding with five prongs <b>34</b>. Each wire receiver <b>33</b> includes an unshown set screw that fixes the position of an electrical wire <b>35</b> mounted within the wire receiver <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The canopy mounting plate <b>18</b> is configured to be mounted flush with and about the ceiling mounting plate <b>17</b>. The canopy mounting plate <b>18</b> also includes a generally planar central surface <b>37</b> and a peripheral rim <b>38</b>. The peripheral rim <b>38</b> includes three canopy mounting brackets <b>40</b>, each having a screw mounting hole <b>41</b> therein. The central surface <b>37</b> has a central opening <b>42</b> therethrough configured to allow the passage of the female electrical connector <b>32</b> and unobstructed access of the mounting plate central opening <b>25</b>, two loop openings <b>43</b> configured to allow the passage of the mounting plate loops <b>27</b> therethrough, and three hook openings <b>44</b> therethrough configured to allow the passage of the ceiling mounting plate hooks <b>28</b> therethrough. A Y-shaped slide <b>46</b> is mounted to the canopy mounting plate for reciprocal movement. The slide <b>46</b> has two arm <b>47</b> and a central push plate or tab <b>48</b>. Each arm <b>47</b> is configured to be releasably received within a mounting plate loop <b>27</b> extending through a loop opening <b>43</b>. The slide <b>46</b> is mounted for reciprocal movement relative to the central surface <b>37</b> through four U-shaped guides <b>49</b> extending from the central surface <b>37</b>. A female electrical connector <b>51</b> is mounted to the slide <b>46</b>. The female connector <b>51</b> has five electrical wire receivers <b>52</b> and five prong receivers <b>53</b> configured to receive or mate with the five prongs <b>34</b> of the male electrical connector <b>32</b>. Again, the wire receivers <b>52</b> include unshown set screws. The reciprocal movement of the slide <b>46</b> moves the female electrical connector <b>51</b> between an disengaged position wherein the prong receivers <b>53</b> are disengaged from the male connector prongs <b>34</b> and an engaged position wherein the prong receivers <b>53</b> are electrically engaged with the male connector prongs <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The canopy <b>19</b> includes a central opening <b>54</b> which is preferably trilobular in shape to received a trilobular ball <b>55</b> coupled to the end of the downrod <b>15</b>. The canopy <b>19</b> also has three screw mounting holes <b>56</b> which are alignable with the three screw mounting holes <b>41</b> of the canopy mounting plate <b>18</b>. Three screws <b>57</b> pass through the canopy mounting holes <b>56</b> and are threaded into the screw mounting holes <b>41</b> of the canopy mounting plate <b>18</b> to secure the canopy <b>19</b> to the canopy mounting plate <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The canopy trim ring <b>20</b> is configured to fit about the top end of the canopy <b>19</b> in order to hide the canopy mounting screws <b>57</b> from view. The trim ring <b>20</b> has an internally extending resilient flange which is snap fitted over the top edge of the canopy to maintain its position relative to the canopy.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In use, with the downrod <b>15</b> extending through the central opening <b>54</b> of the canopy <b>19</b>, the canopy <b>19</b> is mounted to the canopy mounting plate <b>18</b> through the use of the three mounting screws <b>57</b>. The electrical wires <b>59</b> from the motor and optional light kit which extend through the downrod and ball are mounted within the wire receivers <b>52</b> of the female electrical connector <b>51</b> and secured with the set screws. It should be understood that these wires <b>59</b> may be secured in the manufacturing facility so that an installer need not do so. Similarly, the canopy may be mounted to the canopy mounting plate through the three screws <b>57</b> at the manufacturing facility.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The ceiling mounting plate <b>17</b> is mounted to the outlet box by two screws which extend through the ceiling mounting plate slots <b>26</b> and into either the outlet box or into a ceiling joist. The electrical wires <b>35</b> of the structure or building are mounted within the wire receivers <b>33</b> of the male electrical connector <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With the Y-shaped slide <b>46</b> in its disengaged position, the combined canopy <b>19</b> and canopy mounting plate <b>18</b>, with its associated fan assembly, is lifted to a position wherein the three canopy mounting plate hooks <b>28</b> pass through the three hook openings <b>44</b>. The combined canopy and canopy mounting plate is then rotated relative to the ceiling mounting plate <b>17</b> so that the ceiling plate hooks <b>28</b> ride upon and engage the canopy mounting plate central surface <b>37</b>, the portion of the canopy mounting plate which engages the hook may be referred to as a hook receiver. This engagement of the hook <b>28</b> maintains the relative positions of the two plates <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> and restricts the combined canopy and canopy mounting plate from falling.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With the combined canopy and canopy mounting plate in place, the Y-shaped slide <b>46</b> is slid in an inboard direction to its engaged position. This movement of the slide <b>46</b> is accomplished by the installer simply pushing upon the central push tab <b>48</b>, thereby causing the slide arms <b>47</b> to be extended through the loops <b>27</b> of the ceiling mounting plate. It should be noted that if the canopy mounting plate <b>18</b> is not resting in its fully rotated position the slide arms <b>47</b> will not extend through the loops <b>27</b>, thereby indicating to the installer that the canopy mounting plate is not properly positioned. The proper passing of the slide arms <b>47</b> into the loops <b>27</b> prevents the counter rotation and thereby separation of the canopy mounting plate <b>18</b> from the ceiling mounting plate <b>17</b>. Further inboard movement of the slide <b>46</b> causes the female electrical connector prong receivers <b>53</b> to receive within the prongs <b>34</b> of the male electrical connector <b>32</b>, i.e. further movement of the slide electrically couples the female and male electrical connectors together. Hence, the slide first interlocks the canopy mounting plate to the ceiling mounting plate then causes an electric coupling of the structural electric wires to the motor and optional light kit electrical wires.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Once the electric connectors <b>32</b> and <b>51</b> are electrically coupled together the canopy trim ring <b>20</b> is raised to a position over the top end of the canopy wherein the trim ring flange is snap fit over the top edge of the canopy. This positioning of the trim ring obscures from view the mounting screws <b>57</b> and the slide push tab <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The fan may be unmounted or otherwise removed from the ceiling by simply reversing the just described process.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It thus is understood that the ceiling fan may be substantially pre-wired prior to mounting of the ceiling fan. As such, during the installation procedure the installer need only lift the ceiling fan for a very short time period during the rotational coupling of the canopy mounting plate <b>18</b> to the ceiling mounting plate. Furthermore, the electrical connection is accomplished quickly and safely through the coupling of the female and male connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should be understood that the relative positions of the hooks and hook openings may be reversed, i.e., the ceiling mounting plate <b>17</b> may include the hooks while the canopy mounting plate <b>18</b> includes the hook openings.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It thus is seen that a ceiling fan hanging system is now provided that overcomes problems associated with the prior art. It should be understood that many modifications may be made to the specific preferred embodiment described herein without departure from the spirit and scope of the invention as described by the following claims.</p>
