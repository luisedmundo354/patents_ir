<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of operating an RF communicator adapted for an automatic meter reading (AMR) system includes maintaining the communicator in a low-power standby mode and automatically responding to bubble-up events that are spaced apart by time durations. The step of responding includes initiating the RF communicator to exit the standby mode and enter into an active operating mode, and thereafter return to the standby mode. A time duration between successive bubble-up events is automatically adjusted. One method of automatically adjusting a bubble up rate includes automatically setting the bubble-up rate to a relatively higher rate during a time of relatively high expectation of an occurrence of a communication attempt, and automatically setting the bubble-up rate to a relatively lower rate during a time of relatively low expectation of an occurrence of a communication attempt.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to communications systems and, more particularly, to a communications system utilizing an adaptive energy management scheme.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Current automatic meter reading (AMR) systems include, as one of the major components of the system, a large number of endpoints, each endpoint being comprised of an ERT® (encoder, receiver, transmitter) that is interfaced to a utility meter. In a typical system, the ERT® obtains a consumption reading from the utility meter, such as consumption of water, gas, or electricity. A conventional endpoint which includes a communicator, such as a radio transceiver, transmits the consumption information to an intermediate receiver device according to the AMR system paradigm. In some endpoint applications, battery power is preferred. For example, gas or water meters that are battery-powered do not need to be connected to, and reliant upon, line power. Even electricity consumption meters, which are by their nature connected to the line power, can benefit from an independent power source. An independently-powered endpoint can inform the central utility about any occurrence of power outage or unauthorized tampering.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Battery-powered endpoints have been designed to limit the power consumed in day-to-day operation. One well-known design feature is a bubble-up mode of operation, in which an endpoint “bubbles-up,” or activates its transceiver to communicate or attempt to communicate with the AMR data collection system, according to a preset schedule. The time duration or period between bubble-up events may typically span seconds or minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some AMR systems have a fixed, or installed, meter reading infrastructure that listens for transmissions from utility meter endpoints occurring on a bubble-up basis. In other systems, a typical endpoint bubbles up at a pre-set time to activate its receiver circuitry, which becomes receptive to a signal from an intermediate receiver or the like that prompts the endpoint to send the consumption reading to the reader or receiver. Some AMR systems utilize portable or vehicle-mounted reading devices that are transported along a meter reading route by utility personnel. A meter reading route is generally planned to pass within communications proximity to the utility meters to be read. Some AMR systems use a combination of fixed and mobile meter reading devices where, for example, the fixed devices communicate with endpoints at regular scheduled intervals, and the mobile devices communicate with selected endpoints on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Utility meters are generally read on periodic intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc. The meter reads may occur at regularly spaced, pre-determined times in each period such as, for example, on the first day of each month. A challenge for systems designers is accommodating a common practice among utilities to vary the meter reading frequency of each occurrence. Variations may be due to factors such as scheduling changes, migration to different AMR systems, work backlogs, downtime, and the like. For example, a utility may ordinarily request information from a given meter on a semi-monthly basis during one portion of the year, and on a weekly basis during another portion of the year. It is also common practice among utilities to take readings from utility meters, and return to a particular area shortly thereafter to request additional data or repeated data from certain utility meters. Therefore, actual communication between meter and reader does not necessarily take place on a consistent schedule.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A short bubble up cycle (a high bubble-up frequency) can improve system performance by creating a greater likelihood of achieving communications between a utility meter endpoint and a receiver (or reader). In a situation in which a mobile reader follows a route that passes near a given meter, there exists a narrow window of opportunity for the meter endpoint to successfully interface with the reading device during the time that the reader is within communications proximity to the meter. Therefore, one challenge associated with bubble-up operation is pre-setting a frequency for bubble-up events. System designers must trade off system communications reliability, which is improved with more frequent bubble-ups, against battery-powered endpoint energy consumption, which is improved with less frequent bubble-ups.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">One aspect of the invention is generally directed to an operating mode for devices that work with automatic meter reading (AMR) systems. In one example application, a bubble-up operating mode according to one embodiment of the invention is implemented in utility meter endpoint devices that are a part of an AMR system. While the invention is not necessarily limited to such an application, the invention will be better appreciated using a discussion of example embodiments in such a specific context.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">AMR system <b>100</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, utilizes the invention which includes at least one utility measurement device including, but not limited to, electric meters <b>102</b>, gas meters <b>104</b> and water meters <b>106</b>. Each of the meters may be either electrically or battery powered. The system further includes at least one endpoint (or ERT®) <b>108</b>, wherein each corresponds and interfaces to a meter. Each of the endpoints (or ERT®) <b>108</b> preferably incorporates a radio frequency (RF) device, e.g., the Itron, Inc. ERT®. The system additionally includes one or more readers, which may be fixed or mobile, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to include: (1) a mobile hand-held reader <b>110</b>, such as that used in the Itron Off-site meter reading system; (2) a mobile vehicle-equipped reader <b>112</b>, such as that used in the Itron Mobile AMR system; (3) a fixed radio communication network <b>114</b>, such as the Itron Fixed Network AMR system that utilizes the additional components of cell central control units (CCUs) and network control nodes (NCNs); and (4) a fixed micro-network system, such as the Itron Micronetwork AMR system that utilizes both radio communication through concentrators and telephone communications through PSTN. Of course, other types of readers may be used without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Further included in AMR system <b>100</b> is a head-end, host processor <b>118</b> that incorporates software that manages the collection of metering data and facilitates the transfer of that data to a utility or supplier billing system <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In AMR system <b>100</b>, endpoints <b>108</b> can support one-way meter reading, 1.5-way meter reading, or two-way meter reading systems. A one-way meter reading system provides a reader that listens to messages sent asynchronously from each endpoint. In a one-way meter reading system, endpoints do not need to receive any information from the reader. In a 1.5-way meter reading system, the reader sends prompting signals to endpoints, which, in turn, listen for, and respond to the prompting signals by simply transmitting their messages. In a two-way meter reading system, endpoints also listen for, and respond to prompting signals issued by the reader. In addition, a two-way meter reading system enables the reader to communicate with and command the endpoint while also enabling the endpoint to respond to the reader's communications and commands.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a utility meter endpoint <b>208</b>. Endpoint <b>208</b> interfaces with a utility meter <b>210</b>, receives consumption and other relevant data from utility meter <b>210</b>, and communicates the data to AMR system <b>212</b>. Endpoint <b>208</b> includes an interface system <b>214</b>, which operatively couples to utility meter <b>210</b> via coupling <b>215</b>. In one embodiment, coupling <b>215</b>A includes electrical and mechanical components for making a physical and electrical connection between utility meter <b>210</b> and endpoint <b>208</b>. For example, coupling <b>215</b>A can include electrical connectors and conductors that carry electrical signals from utility meter <b>210</b> to interface hardware in interface system <b>214</b> that converts the electrical signals into a digital representation that is readable by a CPU <b>216</b>. Interface system <b>214</b> is, interfaced with CPU <b>216</b> via interface <b>215</b>B. In one embodiment, interface <b>215</b> includes a portion of a data bus and of an address bus.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this example embodiment, CPU <b>216</b> is a controller that oversees operation of endpoint <b>208</b>. In one embodiment, CPU <b>216</b> includes a microprocessor system that has memory, instruction processing, and input/output circuits. CPU <b>216</b> interfaces with radio transceiver <b>218</b> via interface <b>217</b>. In one embodiment, interface <b>217</b> includes a portion of a data bus and of an address bus, which is then coupled to an antenna <b>220</b>. In operation, interface hardware <b>214</b> forwards and converts utility meter data for further processing by CPU <b>216</b>. CPU <b>216</b> processes and stores the data at least temporarily, and instructs transceiver <b>218</b> to communicate the metered data to AMR system <b>212</b> at appropriate times.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Endpoint <b>208</b> operates in a low-power standby mode during a majority (&gt;50%) of the time. While in the standby mode, interface system <b>214</b>, CPU <b>216</b>, and transceiver <b>218</b> are effectively shut down to reduce power consumption. Timer <b>222</b> operates to periodically wake up the shut-down systems so that they enter into an active operating mode. In one embodiment, timer <b>222</b> is an independent circuit that is interfaced with CPU <b>216</b>. In another embodiment, timer <b>222</b> is implemented as a watchdog timer in a microcontroller that is a part of CPU <b>216</b>. In either embodiment, one feature of timer <b>222</b> is that timer <b>222</b> consumes relatively little energy for operating. Also, upon expiration of a settable time duration set into timer <b>222</b>, timer <b>222</b> provides a signal that initiates bringing online the systems that are in standby mode. In a related embodiment, the settable time duration is set in timer <b>222</b> by CPU <b>216</b> via a setup signal <b>223</b>. For example, setup signal <b>223</b> can be carried via a data bus.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one example embodiment, endpoint <b>208</b> includes a power supply <b>224</b>. In one embodiment, power supply <b>224</b> includes one or more batteries. Power supply <b>224</b> provides conditioned power to interface system <b>214</b>, CPU <b>216</b>, and transceiver <b>218</b> via a switchable power bus <b>225</b>. Power supply <b>224</b> provides conditioned power to timer <b>222</b> via a power line <b>226</b>. Timer <b>222</b> provides a control signal <b>228</b> to power supply <b>224</b> that causes power supply <b>224</b> to apply power to power bus <b>225</b>. CPU <b>216</b> provides a control signal <b>230</b> to power supply <b>224</b> that causes power supply <b>224</b> to remove power from power bus <b>225</b>. In operation, beginning in a standby mode, timer <b>222</b> has been configured with a set time duration by CPU <b>216</b> via setup signal <b>223</b>. Timer <b>222</b> monitors the passing of the time duration and, at the expiration of the time duration, timer <b>222</b> provides a signal to power supply <b>224</b> to energize power bus <b>225</b>. Once power is applied via power bus <b>225</b> to CPU <b>216</b>, interface system <b>214</b>, and transceiver <b>218</b>, CPU <b>216</b> begins executing a program that gathers data from utility meter <b>210</b> via interface system <b>214</b>, and momentarily activates transceiver <b>218</b>. Once the data gathering program is complete, CPU <b>216</b> sets a time duration into timer <b>222</b> and initiates the clock while generating a timing, and generates a control signal <b>230</b> to power down the systems that have been powered via power bus <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The operation cycle described above is one example of endpoint activity during a bubble-up event. In a related embodiment, during each bubble-up event, transceiver <b>218</b> transmits the utility meter data via wireless communication <b>221</b>. In this embodiment, the AMR system is presumed to be in a continuous receptive state to transmissions by endpoints. In another related embodiment, during each bubble-up event, transceiver <b>218</b> enters into a receptive operating mode, and forwards received signals to CPU <b>216</b> for analysis. CPU <b>216</b> then determines whether to respond to any received signal.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one example embodiment, CPU <b>216</b> is programmed to respond to a valid pseudo-noise (PN) sequence that includes a wakeup preamble. Receipt by CPU <b>216</b> of a valid PN sequence initiates communication <b>221</b> between endpoint <b>208</b> and AMR system <b>212</b>. In this example embodiment, AMR system can communicate any number of instructions, configuration changes, requests for data transmission, or the like, to endpoint <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, setup signal <b>223</b>, at different times, can set timer <b>222</b> with different time durations. In effect, these different time durations cause the time between bubble-up events to be different. The inverse of the time duration between bubble-up events, the inverse of the period of each bubble-up cycle, or the repetition rate (or frequency) of bubble-up events, shall be generally referred to herein as bubble-up rate.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a related embodiment, the bubble-up rate is set and varied by CPU <b>216</b>. Varying the bubble-up rate can be advantageous in certain applications. One such application, in which varying the bubble-up rate is useful for extending battery life without substantially compromising communications performance, is described below. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that there may be other applications in which automatically varying the time between bubble-up events is useful.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one application, a battery-powered endpoint, such as utility meter endpoint <b>208</b>, utilizes a variable bubble-up rate for communicating with a fixed AMR system that generally initiates communication with endpoints according to scheduled communication times. For example, scheduled communication times can be maintained according to a policy instituted by the utility provider in which each endpoint is read every fourteen (14) days. In a more flexible example communication policy, during each communication the AMR system informs each endpoint of the date/time of, or the time interval until, the next communication attempt. In this example application, it is desirable to conserve battery energy between communication attempts. To this end, in one embodiment, utility meter <b>208</b> bubbles-up more frequently around the time of an expected communication attempt, and bubbles-up less frequently at other times.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates an example bubble-up rate profile <b>300</b>.

A reference timeline <b>302</b> is provided, along with reference time instances t<sub>1</sub>-t<sub>21</sub>, which correspond to occurrences of various events described below. Bubble-up rate profile <b>300</b> is formed during operation of endpoint <b>208</b> as endpoint <b>208</b> adjusts its bubble-up rate. Endpoint <b>208</b> adjusts its bubble-up rate according to the following rules:

        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0033">5. If an expected communication does not occur, after a predetermined time t<sub>p</sub>, endpoint <b>208</b> increments the bubble-up rate, in steps having time duration t<sub>1</sub>, up to a maximum bubble-up rate, which is maintained until a successful communication occurs. This rule is useful if a communication fails to occur at the scheduled time due to difficulty establishing communication with endpoint <b>208</b>. The rule is designed to increase the probability of a successful communication by increasing the bubble-up rate.</li>

<p id="p-0030" num="0034">Bubble-up rate profile <b>300</b> includes periods <b>301</b><i>a</i>-<b>301</b><i>e </i>(referred to generally as periods <b>301</b>) during which bubble-up rate R is at relatively higher rates, such as rates R<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>3</sub>. During periods other than periods <b>301</b>, bubble-up rate R is at a relatively lower at a rate of R<sub>1</sub>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates the relationship between the bubble-up rate R and bubble-up events. Bubble-up events are indicated generally at <b>350</b> and at <b>352</b>. Each bubble-up event <b>350</b>, <b>352</b> includes an operation cycle of endpoint <b>208</b> in which endpoint <b>208</b> enters an active operating mode from a low power standby mode, performs designated functions, such as activating transceiver <b>218</b> and possibly communicating with AMR system <b>212</b>, and returns to the low power standby mode. Bubble-up events <b>350</b>, including individual bubble-up events <b>350</b><i>a </i>and <b>350</b><i>b</i>, occur at an interval T<sub>1</sub>. Bubble-up events <b>352</b>, including <b>352</b><i>a </i>and <b>352</b><i>b</i>, occur during period <b>301</b> and have an interval T<sub>2</sub>, which is shorter in time relative to interval T<sub>1</sub>.

In one embodiment, periods T<sub>1</sub>, and T<sub>2 </sub>are on the order of seconds, or tens of seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0035">Endpoint <b>208</b> expects communication attempts at certain time instances. In one embodiment, at any instant in time, endpoint <b>208</b> expects only the next future communication attempt. In another embodiment, endpoint <b>208</b> maintains the current date/time, and expects one or more future events at defined times. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, communication attempts that are expected by endpoint <b>208</b> are each marked with an “X” corresponding to the time at which each event is expected, and indicated generally at <b>304</b>. For example, expected communication attempt <b>304</b><i>a </i>is expected to occur at time t<sub>2</sub>. Actual communications attempted by AMR system <b>212</b> are each represented by an “O” marked on timeline <b>302</b>, and indicated generally at <b>306</b>. Thus, communication attempt <b>306</b><i>a </i>coincides in time with expected communication attempt <b>304</b><i>a </i>at time t<sub>2</sub>. Successful communications are each represented by a “dot” and indicated generally at <b>308</b>. For example, successful communication <b>308</b><i>a </i>coincides in time with expected communication attempt <b>304</b><i>a </i>and actual communication attempt <b>306</b><i>a </i>at time t<sub>2</sub>. In one embodiment, a successful communication is defined by endpoint <b>208</b> receiving a valid command and control frame from AMR system <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0036">Bubble-up rate profile <b>300</b>, during the time preceding t<sub>1</sub>, remains at a constant minimum bubble-up rate R<sub>1</sub>. At time t<sub>1</sub>, and in anticipation of expected communication attempt <b>304</b><i>a </i>occurring at time t<sub>2 </sub>(according to Rule 3 described above), endpoint <b>208</b> increases the bubble-up rate to rate R<sub>2 </sub>for a time duration t<sub>a</sub>=t<sub>2</sub>−t<sub>1 </sub>(indicated at <b>320</b>). Increased bubble-up rate R<sub>2 </sub>creates conditions in which an occurrence of a successful communication is more probable. In this example, the time duration between t<sub>a </sub>corresponds to a preconfigured anticipatory period that has been selected to accommodate some degree of variation between the actual and expected times of each communication attempt. At time t<sub>2</sub>, communication attempt <b>306</b><i>a </i>occurs as expected, and results in successful communication <b>308</b><i>a</i>. At time t<sub>3</sub>, endpoint <b>208</b> reduces its bubble-up rate back to rate R<sub>1</sub>. During the time immediately following a communication, there is typically an increased likelihood that a follow-up communication will occur. To facilitate such follow-up communication attempts, for a time duration t<sub>h </sub>(indicated at <b>322</b>) between t<sub>3 </sub>and t<sub>2</sub>, bubble-up rate profile <b>300</b> remains at increased rate R<sub>2 </sub>pursuant to Rule 4 described above. In one embodiment, the time duration t<sub>h </sub>to maintain increased bubble-up rate R<sub>2 </sub>after each communication event <b>308</b> is pre-configured in the control software of endpoint <b>208</b>. In a related embodiment, time duration t<sub>h </sub>can be varied to accommodate changes in a utility's AMR practices.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0037">Example events during period <b>301</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) illustrate one approach to responding to a follow-up communication directed at endpoint <b>208</b>. In the time preceding time t<sub>4</sub>, endpoint <b>208</b> expects a communication <b>304</b><i>b </i>at time t<sub>5</sub>. Accordingly, at time T<sub>4</sub>, endpoint <b>208</b> increases its bubble-up rate from R<sub>1 </sub>to R<sub>2 </sub>pursuant to Rule 3 described above. An actual communication <b>306</b><i>b</i><sub>1</sub>, occurs at time t<sub>5</sub>, and results in a successful communication <b>308</b><i>b</i><sub>1</sub>. Following communication <b>308</b><i>b</i><sub>1</sub>, the bubble-up rate remains at R<sub>2 </sub>for a holding time t<sub>h </sub>(indicated at <b>324</b>) according to Rule 4 described above. Before expiration of time period t<sub>h </sub><b>324</b>, another communication attempt, <b>306</b><i>b</i><sub>2</sub>, occurs at time t<sub>6</sub>, and results in successful follow-up communication <b>308</b><i>b</i><sub>2</sub>. A new holding time period t<sub>h </sub><b>326</b> begins at time t<sub>6</sub>, and extends until time t<sub>7</sub>, at which time the bubble-up rate is decreased back to rate R<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0038">Example events during period <b>301</b><i>c </i>illustrate another approach to dealing with a follow-up communications. At time t<sub>9</sub>, a successful communication <b>308</b><i>c</i><sub>1 </sub>occurs. For a time period t<sub>h</sub>, as indicated at <b>328</b>, the bubble-up rate is maintained at increased rate R<sub>2</sub>. Before expiration of time period t<sub>h </sub><b>328</b>, a follow-up communication <b>308</b><i>c</i><sub>2 </sub>occurs at time t<sub>10</sub>. However, unlike the example events described above with respect to time period <b>301</b><i>b</i>, follow-up communication <b>308</b><i>c</i><sub>2 </sub>does not cause endpoint <b>208</b> to wait an additional time duration t<sub>h </sub>before reducing the bubble-up rate back to R<sub>1</sub>. Thus, the bubble-up rate returns to rate R<sub>1 </sub>at time t<sub>11</sub>, which occurs at a time duration t<sub>h </sub>following successful communication <b>308</b><i>c</i><sub>1</sub>. This example approach can be useful when additional follow-up communications are considered unlikely soon after an initial follow-up communication such as communication <b>308</b><i>c</i><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0039">Example events during period <b>301</b><i>d </i>illustrate one approach of dealing with situations where an expected communications event fails to occur within an expected time period. Expected communication attempt <b>304</b><i>d </i>is anticipated to occur at time t<sub>13</sub>. Pursuant to Rule 3 described above, at time t<sub>12</sub>, which is time duration t<sub>a </sub><b>330</b> before expected communication attempt <b>304</b><i>d</i>, bubble-up rate R is increased to R<sub>2</sub>. However, around time t<sub>13</sub>, a successful communication does not occur. This failure may be due to failure of the AMR system to attempt communication. Alternatively, the failure may be due to a failure to receive an attempted communication <b>306</b><i>d</i><sub>1 </sub>by endpoint <b>208</b>. Pursuant to Rule 5 described above, endpoint <b>208</b> maintains the bubble-up rate R for a preconfigured time t<sub>p </sub>after the time of expected communication attempt <b>304</b><i>d</i>. Thus, beginning at time t<sub>13</sub>, endpoint <b>208</b> begins measuring time duration t<sub>p</sub>. At the end of time duration t<sub>p </sub>(time t<sub>14</sub>), endpoint <b>208</b> increments bubble-up rate R pursuant to Rule 5 described above, and maintains the rate for a time duration t<sub>i</sub>, indicated at <b>334</b> until time t<sub>15</sub>. At times t<sub>15</sub>-t<sub>16 </sub>bubble-up rate R is sequentially incremented for durations t<sub>i </sub>(<b>336</b>, <b>338</b>). At time t<sub>17</sub>, bubble-up rate R is incremented up to maximum rate R<sub>3 </sub>and maintained at R<sub>3</sub>. At time <b>318</b>, a communication attempt <b>306</b><i>d</i><sub>2 </sub>results in successful communication <b>308</b><i>d</i>. In response, endpoint <b>208</b> maintains bubble-up rate R for a time duration t<sub>h </sub><b>340</b> to accommodate any potential follow-up communications and is then reduced back to minimum bubble-up rate R<sub>1 </sub>at time t<sub>19</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0040">In one example embodiment, following a delayed communication such as communication <b>308</b><i>d </i>described above, endpoint <b>208</b> expects the next communication attempt <b>304</b><i>e </i>to occur according to a predetermined schedule that does not take into account any delay in the previous communication <b>308</b><i>d</i>. In another embodiment, the next expected communication attempt <b>304</b><i>e </i>is expected to occur at a different time that accounts for the delay of the earlier communication <b>308</b><i>d</i>. In either case, at time t<sub>20</sub>, in anticipation t<sub>a </sub>of expected communication <b>304</b><i>e</i>, bubble-up rate R is increased to rate R<sub>2 </sub>to facilitate communication attempt <b>306</b><i>e </i>resulting in successful communication <b>308</b><i>e </i>at time t<sub>21</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example operation cycle <b>400</b> of an endpoint device that utilizes an adaptive variable bubble-up rate according to one embodiment of the invention. The bubble-up rate in this example is adaptive in the sense that the rate automatically adjusts in response to potentially changing AMR practices. An example endpoint device implementing operation cycle <b>400</b> utilizes three timers: (1) a bubble-up timer, (2) a command and control frame (C&amp;C) timer, and (3) a hold time counter. The bubble-up timer is analogous to timer <b>222</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that controls the initiation of each bubble-up event. In one embodiment, bubble-up events occur every 15 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0042">In one example embodiment, the bubble-up timer counts down from a set time duration representing the bubble-up period and, upon expiration of the set time duration, generates a signal that causes the endpoint device to begin bubbling up. However, persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the bubble-up timer can be configured any number of ways to provide a reference time duration. For example, the bubble-up timer can be configured to count from a first value to a second value based on a reference timing signal. In one example embodiment, the bubble-up timer is implemented with an electronic counter circuit that is clocked by a timing signal of a known frequency. In an alternative embodiment, the bubble-up timer is implemented by a microcontroller running a software program. In the example embodiment described below, the bubble-up timer is configured so that it has a minimum set point and a maximum set point. Otherwise, the bubble-up timer can be set to various time durations within the range defined by the minimum and maximum set points.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0043">The C&amp;C timer measures the time between valid command and control frames, which represents the time between successive, successful communication events involving the endpoint device. The time between command and control frames is generally long enough to include a large plurality of bubble-up cycles. For example, in one embodiment, the C&amp;C timer represents 30.5 days. In another example embodiment, the C&amp;C timer is implemented with an electronic counter circuit that is clocked by a timing signal of a known frequency. In an alternative embodiment, the C&amp;C timer is implemented by a microcontroller running a software program.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0044">The hold time counter provides a reference hold period during which the bubble-up rate is maintained at its set level. The hold period is generally long enough to include a smaller plurality of bubble-up cycles. For example, in one embodiment, the hold period is 24 hours. In one example embodiment, the hold time counter is implemented as an electronic counter circuit clocked by a known timing signal. In another embodiment, the hold time counter is implemented in software running on a microcontroller. In example operation cycle <b>400</b> described below, the hold time counter counts occurrences of bubble-up events from a preset maximum M, to zero, at which point the hold time is reached. Timing is achieved in this arrangement because each bubble-up cycle takes a certain amount of time T. Thus, the hold period is equal to M*T time units. In example operation cycle <b>400</b>, the hold time counter can be set to represent three potentially different time periods: (1) a follow-up communication hold period, (2) a bubble-up rate decrease step hold period, and (3) a bubble-up rate increase step hold period. The use of these time periods is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">During a majority of the time, the endpoint device operating according to operation cycle <b>400</b> is in a low-power standby mode between bubble-up events. In this mode, indicated at <b>402</b>, the bubble-up timer is counting down to the next bubble-up event. In one example embodiment, the bubble-up timer is a digital counter circuit that counts down to zero from a set value based on a clocking signal having a known frequency. However, persons skilled in the art will recognize that the bubble-up timer can be implemented any number of ways within the spirit of the invention. For example, the bubble-up timer can be implemented as a counter that counts up to a second set value from a first set value. Also, the bubble-up timer can be implemented with a microprocessor running a software program.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">At <b>404</b>, the bubble-up timer expires, or indicates that the set time duration has elapsed. In response, the endpoint device begins performing the various functions associated with a bubble-up event, such as receiving utility meter data, activating the transceiver circuit, potentially engaging in communications with an AMR system, and the like. In one example embodiment, the bubble-up event also includes the activities described below to adaptively configure the endpoint device for the next bubble-up operation cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047">At <b>406</b>, the endpoint device determines whether or not a successful communication has occurred during the present bubble-up cycle. If a valid wakeup sequence was detected (indicating a successful communication), at <b>408</b>, the C&amp;C timer is read. As described above, the C&amp;C timer measures the time duration between valid command and control frames. In one embodiment, the endpoint device maintains a log of C&amp;C timer measurements. In one example embodiment, the most recent 12 measurements are kept in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue. At <b>410</b>, the most recent measurement made at <b>408</b> is entered into the queue, and the least recent entry in the queue is purged. At <b>412</b>, the C&amp;C timer is reset and restarted.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048">The time between successful communications is useful for estimating the time of the next expected communication attempt. At <b>414</b>, the next expected communication attempt is computed. One method of computing the next expected communication attempt involves taking an average of the logged C&amp;C timer measurements. In one example embodiment, where 12 measurements are stored in queue, the two highest and two lowest values are discarded prior to averaging the remaining 8 values. By utilizing a running average to predict each next expected communication attempt, the endpoint device will adapt to changing AMR practices.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0049">At <b>416</b>, also in response to the detection of the valid wakeup sequence, the bubble-up timer is set to its minimum value, thereby causing the endpoint device to bubble-up at the highest allowed bubble-up rate. In one example embodiment, the minimum bubble-up timer setting is 5 seconds. At <b>418</b>, the hold time counter is set to represent a time duration referred to above as the follow-up communication hold period. During the follow-up communication hold period, the endpoint maintains a maximum bubble-up rate to maintain the highest probability of achieving a successful follow-up communication between the endpoint device and the AMR system. The follow-up communication hold period is analogous to time duration t<sub>h </sub>described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. At <b>420</b>, regardless of whether a valid wakeup sequence was detected at <b>406</b>, the endpoint device determines if the hold time counter has expired. If the hold time counter has not expired, the hold time counter is decremented at <b>422</b>, and operation cycle <b>400</b> is repeated at the maximum bubble-up rate. If the hold time counter has expired, this indicates that the bubble-up rate can be reduced to conserve energy. At this point, it is implicit that occurrence of a communication event has become less likely.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0050">In example operation cycle <b>400</b>, the bubble-up rate is varied according to preconfigured steps. Accordingly, when it is time to increase or decrease the bubble-up rate, the rate is changed by a specific amount, resulting in a new bubble-up rate. The new bubble-up rate is maintained for a minimum time, or for a minimum number of bubble-up events. The hold time counter is used to determine the duration of each step. The size of steps increasing the bubble-up rate can be different from the steps decreasing the bubble-up rate.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">When the bubble-up profile is at a point where the bubble-up rate can be changed (i.e. when the hold timer has expired), endpoint device first determines the direction of the bubble-up rate change. In example operation cycle <b>400</b>, at <b>424</b>, the endpoint device determines the direction of the bubble-up rate change by testing whether ¾ of the time until the next expected communication attempt has elapsed. At ¾ of the time until the next expected communication attempt and later, there is an increasing likelihood that a communications attempt will occur. Thus, if ¾ of the time until the next expected communication attempt has not elapsed, the endpoint device takes steps to decrease the bubble-up rate by correspondingly incrementing the bubble-up timer. Thus, at <b>426</b>, the endpoint device determines whether the bubble-up timer is already set at its maximum limit. If it is, then there is no need to further increment the bubble-up timer, and the operation cycle is repeated. If, however, the bubble-up timer is not at its maximum limit, then, at <b>428</b>, the hold time counter is set to represent the bubble-up rate decrease step hold period. Next, at <b>430</b>, the bubble-up rate is incremented by a step size associated with incrementing the bubble-up rate. In one example embodiment, this “up” step size is 1 second.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0052">In the next sequential cycle <b>400</b>, the hold timer will not have expired at <b>420</b>. Thus, the timer will be decremented towards its expiration and the cycle will repeat. After expiration of the hold time counter, the bubble-up timer will be incremented towards its maximum limit. Eventually, the bubble-up timer will remain at its maximum limit until ¾ of the time until the next expected communication event elapses (determined at <b>424</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0053">After ¾ of the time until the next expected communication event has elapsed, the endpoint device begins incrementing the bubble-up rate by correspondingly decrementing the bubble-up timer at <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>, and <b>436</b>. As the current time approaches the time of the next expected communications attempt, the probability of an actual communications attempt occurring, increases. Accordingly, at <b>432</b>, the endpoint device determines whether the bubble-up timer is already set at its minimum limit. If it is, then there is no need to further decrement the bubble-up timer, and the operation cycle is repeated. If, however, the bubble-up timer is not at its minimum limit, then, at <b>434</b>, the hold time counter is set to represent the bubble-up rate increase step hold period. Next, at <b>436</b>, the bubble-up rate is incremented by a step size associated with decrementing the bubble-up rate. In one example embodiment, this “down” step size is 2 seconds. Eventually, the bubble-up timer will reach its minimum setting and remain at that setting until a follow-up communication hold period after the next successful communications event.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example bubble-up rate profile <b>500</b> that is produced by operation of an endpoint device utilizing example operation cycle <b>400</b> described above. In this embodiment, the bubble-up rate R is varied according to the expectation level of an upcoming communication attempt. Example operation profile is plotted against time axis <b>502</b>. Expected communication attempts are indicated respectively at <b>504</b><i>a</i>-<b>504</b><i>d</i>, and are referred to generally as expected communication attempts <b>504</b>. Actual communication attempts are indicated generally at <b>506</b>, while actual successful communications events are indicated generally at <b>508</b>. Bubble-up rates Rmin, Rmax and R<b>2</b>-R<b>6</b>, are plotted along the vertical bubble-up rate axis R. Rate Rmin represents the minimum bubble-up rate, which corresponds to the maximum bubble-up timer setting above with referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Rate Rmax represents the maximum bubble-up rate, which corresponds to the minimum bubble-up timer setting discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0055">Example bubble-up rate profile <b>500</b> represents bubble-up rate R varying over time within rate limits Rmax and Rmin. At time prior to t<b>1</b>, bubble-up rate R is at rate Rmax in expectation of expected communication attempt <b>504</b><i>a</i>. At time t<b>1</b>, communication attempt <b>506</b><i>a </i>occurs, resulting in successful communication <b>508</b><i>a</i>. During a bubble-up event, pursuant to detection <b>406</b> of example operation cycle <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), the endpoint device detects a valid wakeup sequence contained in the communication attempt <b>506</b>. The endpoint device proceeds to calculate the time of next expected communication event <b>504</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0056">During follow-up communication hold period t<sub>f </sub><b>510</b>, the endpoint device maintains the bubble-up rate R at R<sub>max</sub>. After the expiration of the follow-up communication hold period t<sub>f </sub><b>510</b>, the probability of another communication attempt begins to decrease and the endpoint device can have a lesser expectation of such an event occurring. Therefore, the bubble-up rate may be decreased to conserve energy. Accordingly, at time t<sub>2</sub>, the hold period expires, and the endpoint device begins to step down bubble-up rate R. The hold time counter is re-set to rate decrease step hold period t<sub>sd </sub><b>512</b>. Rate decrease step hold period t<sub>sd </sub><b>512</b> is tolled beginning at time t<sub>2</sub>. At time t<sub>3</sub>, rate decrease step hold period t<sub>sd </sub><b>512</b> expires. During time period t<sub>3</sub>-t<sub>2</sub>, the bubble-up rate R is maintained at rate R<sub>6</sub>. This step-wise bubble-up rate reduction is continued sequentially, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for the time periods t<sub>4</sub>-t<sub>3</sub>, t<sub>5</sub>-t<sub>4</sub>, t<sub>6</sub>-t<sub>5</sub>, and t<sub>7</sub>-t<sub>6</sub>bubble-up rate R is set respectively to R<sub>5</sub>, R<sub>4</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, and R<sub>2</sub>. Each bubble-up rate decrease is achieved by incrementing the bubble-up timer by one up step, pursuant to <b>430</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). In this example, each timer up step is designated as r<sub>u</sub>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and indicated at <b>514</b>. At time t<sub>7</sub>, the bubble-up rate reaches pre-defined minimum limit R<sub>min</sub>, and this rate is maintained until the time t<sub>8 </sub>to begin increasing the bubble-up rate in anticipation of the next expected communication attempt <b>504</b><i>b </i>occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0057">As more time passes following a successful communication event, the probability of an occurrence of a communication attempt begins to increase, so the endpoint device can begin to increase its bubble-up rate accordingly. At time t<sub>8</sub>, ¾ of the time to the next expected communication attempt has elapsed. The ¾ elapsed time period has been pre-defined in this embodiment as the point at which the endpoint will expect an increased likelihood of a communication attempt. Pursuant to decisions <b>424</b> and <b>432</b>, and steps <b>434</b> and <b>436</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) the hold time counter is re-set to a rate increase step hold period t<sub>si </sub><b>516</b>. Beginning at time t<sub>8</sub>, bubble-up rate R is incremented by decrementing the bubble-up timer by one down step r<sub>d</sub>. In this example, down step r<sub>d </sub>is equal in magnitude to twice the up step r<sub>u </sub>(r<sub>d</sub>=2r<sub>u</sub>). Thus, during time period t<sub>9</sub>-t<sub>8</sub>, bubble-up rate R is maintained at R<sub>3</sub>. Likewise, during the period t<sub>10</sub>-t<sub>9</sub>, bubble-up rate R is at rate R<sub>5</sub>. At time t<sub>10</sub>, bubble-up rate R is incremented again to the maximum bubble-up rate limit R<sub>max</sub>, which corresponds to a minimum bubble-up timer limit. At its maximum rate R<sub>max</sub>, bubble-up rate R facilitates the greatest probability of achieving a successful communication between the endpoint device and the AMR system.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0058">At time t<sub>11</sub>, communication attempt <b>506</b><i>b</i><sub>1 </sub>occurs resulting in successful communication <b>508</b><i>b</i><sub>1</sub>. A follow-up communication hold period t<sub>f </sub><b>518</b> is observed. Also, time period T<sub>A </sub>between successful communications <b>508</b><i>b</i><sub>1 </sub><b>508</b><i>a </i>is logged in the C&amp;C queue according to steps <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), and is used for calculating the time of the next expected communication attempt. At time t<sub>12 </sub>an unexpected follow-up communication <b>506</b><i>b</i><sub>2 </sub>occurs resulting in successful communication <b>508</b><i>b</i><sub>2</sub>. In response, another follow-up communication hold period t<sub>f </sub><b>520</b> is observed. In this example embodiment, the time period T<sub>B </sub><b>524</b> between follow-up communication <b>508</b>B<sub>2 </sub>and communication <b>508</b><i>b</i><sub>1 </sub>is disregarded from the computation of the next expected communication attempt. The time of expected communication attempt <b>504</b><i>b </i>has been determined based on the averaging successful communication events occurring prior to communication <b>508</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0059">Because in this example, successful communication <b>508</b><i>b</i><sub>1 </sub>coincides with the time of expected communication attempt <b>504</b><i>b</i>, time duration T<sub>A </sub>is equal to the previously-computed average time durations between the relevant past communication events. Accordingly, the time of the next communication event <b>504</b><i>c </i>is expected to also occur at time t<sub>14</sub>, which is at a time duration T<sub>A </sub>(indicated at <b>526</b>) following communication event <b>508</b><i>b</i><sub>1</sub>. However, the next actual communication attempt <b>506</b><i>c </i>does not coincide with the expected communication attempt <b>504</b><i>c</i>. Instead, it occurs at a later time t<sub>15</sub>, and results in successful communication <b>508</b><i>c</i>. The endpoint device logs time duration T<sub>C </sub><b>528</b> for calculating the next expected communication attempt <b>504</b><i>d</i>. The next expected communication attempt <b>504</b><i>d </i>is expected at a time duration T<sub>D </sub><b>530</b> following the previous successful communication <b>508</b><i>c</i>. Time duration T<sub>D </sub><b>530</b> is somewhat longer than time duration T<sub>A</sub>, but less than time duration T<sub>C</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0060">In the manner described above in this example embodiment, the bubble-up rate R is varied roughly in proportion to the expectation level of an occurrence of a future communication attempt <b>504</b>. Over time, the bubble-up rate variation defines a bubble-up profile <b>500</b>; bubble-up profile <b>500</b> being neither predetermined, nor fixed. Rather, bubble-up profile <b>500</b> dynamically varies depending on the occurrences or non-occurrences of communications events, and the relative timing between the communications events.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0061">The above-described example operation cycle <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is simply one way of realizing a dynamically adjustable bubble-up rate for an endpoint device according to one aspect of the present invention. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that aspects of the present invention can be embodied in a variety of alternative embodiments. For example, an example endpoint device can compute an expectation function, over time, of a future occurrence of a communication event. The example endpoint device can then use the present expectation level to set the bubble-up rate. In this example embodiment, the bubble-up rate is varied more closely in proportion with the expectation function. In a related embodiment, the bubble-up rate is varied without regard to hold times. Hence, when viewed over time, the bubble rate profile will appear as a smoother function, without the step-wise bubble-up rate changes depicted in example bubble-up rate profiles <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A) and 500</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
