<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of co-pending International Application no. PCT/DK03/00265, filed Apr. 23 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for processing of liquids or pastes which due to their high viscosity are difficult to effectively subject to mechanical and thermal processes without extensive loss of product and extensive cleaning of the processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">By use of two piston equipped storage cylinders interconnected by a process chamber, the liquid or paste to be processed is pushed and/or pulled from one cylinder to another, each time passing through the process chamber, until the process is completed. The final product is then pushed out by the pistons through a processing head discharge valve for further processing or packaging.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As both cylinders can be almost completely emptied by the pistons, the only product residue left is that in the relatively small process chamber. Thus the process has a high yield.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The process chamber can expose the product to a series of different processes, for instance mixing in of additives, chopping, blending, milling, heating, cooling and evaporation all depending on which process configuration the process chamber has, and as the velocity and internal pressure of the liquid or paste being processed is completely controlled between the two cylinder pistons, this increases the accuracy of the process.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, the present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for processing highly viscous fluids or pastes such as fruit preserves, candy, liquorice and other liquids or pastes of various kinds which require mixing, blending heating/cooling or other mechanical or chemical processes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Products which become highly viscous during the process are very hard to handle. Normal processes such as agitation, grinding, heating, cooling become almost impossible to perform without use of special pumps, agitators and mills. Use of such special equipment installed in the process line often results in low yield. Most known processes with highly viscous products use a combination of heating and mixing vessels with attachment of re-circulation mills and blenders. As the viscosity increases the product becomes more and more difficult to handle and empty from the vessel, and mixing effectively when re-circulating back to the same vessel becomes impossible as highly viscous fluids do not mix well.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Blending and chopping of a highly viscous product is made difficult as the product tends to bridge or activate around the blending knife, thus preventing the knife from getting into contact with the product.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object of the invention is to have full control over the product through the entire process, incl. to have the product pressurised as it passes through the blender/mixer head as well as an external heat exchanger, and to do this in a matter that results in a high yield.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the invention, this is achieved by means of an apparatus for processing a liquid or a paste, in particular for processing a highly viscous or sticky liquid or paste, said apparatus comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">two or more cylindrical storage chambers,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">one or more interconnecting conduits adapted and arranged for interconnecting said storage chambers,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0013">one or more processing means for processing said liquid or paste, said processing means being associated with said interconnecting conduit, and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0014">a piston arranged axially displaceable for displacing said liquid or paste from one cylindrical storage chamber to another through said interconnecting conduit such that said liquid or paste is processed by said processing means during said displacement.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0015">Hereby, a simple and easily controllable apparatus is achieved that requires very little cleaning and has very reduced dead space resulting in very reduced loss of yield.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0056" num="0062">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, two cylinders <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are arranged parallel to one another and with their axes in the same plane. Pistons <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> are arranged axially displaceable inside cylinders <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, respectively, by means of piston rods <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, respectively. Each rod is outside the respective cylinder connected to a not shown drive cylinder which has the same stroke length as the respective pistons <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0063">In the end of the cylinder there is a flange <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, respectively, (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) with outlets <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>, respectively, to conduits <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, respectively, leading to a processing chamber <b>13</b> for such processing applications as mixing, blending, milling, chopping and direct steam injection for heating. Thus, in its intended position, the process chamber <b>13</b> forms part of the connection between the two cylinders <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0064">The processing chamber <b>13</b> has the following features: a process cavity <b>14</b> for mounting for example a mixer/blender/chopper tool <b>15</b> driven by a shaft <b>16</b> rotated by a motor <b>17</b>; a check valve <b>18</b> for a product/additive dispensing or inlet line <b>19</b>; a steam, liquid or gas injection nozzle <b>20</b> and an extrusion outlet valve <b>21</b> leading to a product discharge line <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0065">The process chamber can be formed as a string or series of several interconnected cavities, each cavity containing a different device such as a rotating or injection device; the cavities may contain several blending-mixing knives or rollers for milling, etc. Typical for the configuration is that the product must pass through the string of cavities to get from one cylinder to the other. Each cavity can also have its own injection valve; additives will typically be injected in the mixing cavity; steam or gas could also be injected in this cavity for heating, sterilising, foaming or otherwise affecting the product.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0066">If the product needs heating or cooling, the cylinders <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> can be connected to a not shown external heat exchanger such as a so-called scraped heat exchanger which is ideally suited for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0067">In the wall of the conduits <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> to the cylinder inlets <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> there are connected outlets <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> of two additional small cylinders <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>, respectively, each with a piston <b>27</b> and <b>28</b>, respectively, the end of each cylinder <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> forming a perfect seal with the walls of the conduits <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. The cylinders <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> each have a volume which exceeds the internal volume of the conduits <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> plus the processing chamber <b>14</b>. To avoid a so-called dead space in the process of pushing a column of product from for example cylinder <b>1</b> to the cylinder <b>2</b>, the piston <b>28</b> in cylinder <b>26</b> will retract from its closed position and allow already processed product to fill the cylinder <b>26</b>. When the entire product in cylinder <b>1</b> has been forced through the process chamber <b>14</b> and into cylinder <b>2</b> the piston <b>3</b> in cylinder <b>1</b> is stroked out and the piston <b>28</b> in cylinder <b>26</b> forces the small volume of product in cylinder <b>26</b> into cylinder <b>2</b>. This will assure that all the product in cylinder <b>2</b> or the discharge side of the chamber <b>14</b> has been processed. When the flow is reversed from cylinder <b>2</b> to cylinder <b>1</b>, the same procedure is repeated by means of the cylinder <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0068">A typical process can be visualised as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0069">The product is pumped or sucked into cylinder <b>1</b> through the valve <b>18</b> as the piston <b>3</b> retracts. During this process pistons <b>4</b>, <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> are in their forward positions allowing no product to enter cylinders <b>2</b>, <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>, respectively. Then the drive for cylinder <b>1</b> is activated to force the product through the processing chamber <b>14</b> into cylinder <b>2</b>, wherein the piston <b>4</b> now will retract corresponding to the rate of filling of cylinder <b>2</b>. During this process additives or steam can be injected into the processing chamber <b>14</b> giving the product a thorough mix, heat, blend, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0070">When the cylinder <b>1</b> is empty, the process reverses and the product is pushed from cylinder <b>2</b> to cylinder <b>1</b> by the piston <b>4</b>. During this procedure the processing means in chamber <b>14</b> can still be active.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0071">This process can be repeated as many times as it takes to obtain the desired degree of processing, for instance viscosity, grain size, temperature, etc. The dead space cylinders <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> are active during each cycle to improve the uniformity of the process.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0072">An important feature is to pressurise the product during its passing through the processing chamber <b>14</b> as this allows for some unique properties such as minimising cavitation. This is done by applying a variable back-pressure to the receiving cylinder drive rod, varying from almost equal to the discharge cylinder pressure (the same product pressure in both cylinders <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>) to no pressure at all (nil product pressure in the receiving cylinder)</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0073">When the product is ready, the discharge valve <b>21</b> is opened and both pistons <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> move forward to discharge the volume of product from both cylinders <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0074">Since the pistons <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> scrape <b>100</b>% of the cylindrical surface of the cylinders <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the loss of product mainly relates to the volume of the processing chamber <b>14</b> and conduits <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, and since this can be made to constitute a relatively small fraction of the gross volume, a high yield can be expected.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0075">The entire process and associated cleaning can be computer controlled and therefore automatic.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0076">A further refinement of the process is to install a not shown jacket enveloping each main cylinder <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> for heating the product by steam or hot liquid, while at the same time introducing vacuum suction through an outlet at the end of each main cylinder <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> opposite the processing outlets <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> through vacuum conduits <b>29</b> and <b>30</b>, respectively. This process will then reduce the level of liquid in the product by evaporation.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0077">A practical way to this is to retract the piston (<b>3</b> and/or <b>4</b>) to a top position allowing the vacuum suction outlet <b>29</b> and <b>30</b> to be exposed to the product surface. When heat is applied to the jacket, the evaporation will start. By not adding heat to the product, the evaporation causes the temperature to fall and thus the process can be used for cooling the product.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0078">A further refinement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> where a housing <b>31</b> or vacuum head is mounted on the drive side of one of the process cylinders <b>32</b>. This head has a larger inside diameter than the process cylinder. On the head one or more outlets/inlets <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> are provided with valves <b>35</b>. When the piston <b>36</b> with seal <b>37</b> and retainer <b>38</b> is pulled into the head <b>31</b>, a passage is open to the inside of the cylinder <b>32</b>. This passage can be used typically for intake of raw material through inlet <b>33</b>or evacuation of air through outlet <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0079">Above the piston <b>38</b> nozzles <b>39</b> are provided through which water or cleaning fluid can be injected to either add water to the process or to clean the space behind the piston <b>36</b> or for that mater the entire cylinder <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0080">As a further refinement the cylinder <b>32</b> may be equipped with an agitator <b>40</b> which is driven by a shaft <b>41</b> extending through the piston shaft <b>42</b> and supported by a seal bearing <b>43</b>. The purpose of the agitator is to assist in the pre-mixing of raw material and liquids in the cylinder <b>32</b> prior to pushing the product out through valve <b>48</b> for commencing the push-pull process. The cylinder has machined grooves <b>46</b> and <b>47</b> for mounting connection brackets <b>45</b> to the vacuum head <b>41</b> and the support flange <b>49</b>. This feature allows for easy mounting and exchange of cylinder and head without distorting the honed inside surface of the cylinder <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0081">The process can also be divided into a series of several sub-processes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> where cylinders A-B-C-D are interconnected in series through processing chambers <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. This can be an advantage where several separate processes are required. In this alternative the processing is continuous in contrast to the batch processing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an arrangement where the cylinders are connected in parallel. This is an advantage where producing continuously to a filling line and where for example the process in process chamber <b>1</b> is going on between cylinders A and B and finished product in cylinder C is being pushed to the filling line or for further processing. When the cylinder C is empty the process shifts between cylinders A and C and now cylinder B discharges product.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> show an arrangement where cylinders A<b>1</b>-A<b>3</b> and B<b>1</b>-B<b>3</b> are arranged in clusters of <b>3</b> cylinders, the clusters being interconnected over valves A<b>1</b><i>a</i>-A<b>3</b><i>c </i>and B<b>1</b><i>a</i>-B<b>3</b><i>c </i>and two processing chambers <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. Another arrangement could have <b>2</b> or <b>4</b> or more cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0084">In this arrangement it is possible to shift the product between cylinders and thus avoiding the dead space cylinders <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, by operating the valves A<b>1</b><i>a</i>-A<b>3</b><i>c </i>and B<b>1</b><i>a</i>-B<b>3</b><i>c</i>, respectively associated with the receiving cylinders in different sequences. Thus, if Cylinders A<b>1</b>-A<b>3</b> are discharging into cylinders B<b>1</b>-B<b>3</b>, all valves A<b>1</b><i>a</i>-A<b>3</b><i>c </i>are fully open, while valves B<b>1</b><i>a</i>-B<b>3</b><i>c </i>are opened and closed individually in predetermined sequence so that the cylinders B<b>1</b>-B<i>r </i>are filled at different rates. Vice versa when discharging from cylinders B<b>1</b>-B<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0085">The 3 cylinders on each side of the process chambers <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> can be driven by a common outside source like a hydraulic cylinder located in the geometrical centre of the 3 cylinders. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a common drive cylinder <b>41</b> connected to each cylinders piston rod <b>42</b> by brackets <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0086">A larger process system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> where <b>2</b> clusters are shown. Each cluster is driven by its own hydraulic cylinder <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> each affecting the three process cylinders by means of a load bracket <b>53</b> and <b>54</b>, respectively. Each process cylinder is equipped with a vacuum head <b>55</b> for connection to a common manifold heat exchanger <b>62</b>, receiver <b>63</b> and vacuum pump <b>64</b> through valves clusters <b>56</b>, <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> and <b>69</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0087">Intake of raw material to the intake cylinder cluster is through valves <b>75</b>, <b>76</b>, <b>77</b> and intake of raw material into the process line is through valve <b>78</b>. Discharge valves from the intake cylinder cluster are referenced <b>79</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0088">A processing unit or chamber <b>82</b> is provided with a valve <b>83</b> for injecting steam, gas or liquid into the process chamber <b>82</b>. From the process chamber <b>82</b> the product can pass through a heat exchanger <b>84</b> that is cooled or heated through connections <b>85</b>, <b>86</b> to a not shown outside energy source. The cooled or heated product is now passed on via a valve <b>87</b> to the second or receiving cluster of three cylinders where its distributed to the three process cylinders by valves <b>88</b>, <b>89</b>, <b>90</b>. By opening and closing these valves individually while receiving the product it is possible to mix the product in such a way that the dead-space problem can be eliminated as described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. When the process is completed, the product is discharged through valve <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0089">A typical process can be described as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0090">Product such as powder or liquid is sucked into the first or intake cluster by means of valves <b>75</b>,<b>76</b>,<b>77</b> or through valves <b>78</b>,<b>79</b>,<b>80</b>,<b>81</b>. When the cylinders are full, the hydraulic cylinder <b>51</b> acts on the pistons of the cylinders in the intake cluster and forces the product out through valves <b>79</b>,<b>80</b>,<b>81</b> to the processing unit <b>82</b>. During this process additives can be added through valve <b>78</b>. In the processing unit <b>82</b> the product can be mixed, blended, sliced, sheared, etc depending on the configuration of the unit.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0091">During this process steam to heat, gas to interact, etc. can be injected through valve <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0092">The product passes to the heat exchanger <b>84</b>, where its cooled or heated if required or bypassed via open valves <b>92</b>,<b>93</b> with valves <b>94</b>, <b>95</b> closed.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0093">Inside the second or receiving cluster vacuum can be pulled through valves <b>69</b>,<b>70</b>,<b>71</b> and if the product is heated evaporation could start as the product moves into the cylinders. The vapours from this process are condensed in the condenser <b>62</b> and accumulated in the receiver <b>63</b> which connects to the vacuum pump <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0094">Heating/cooling and processing in the process head and evaporation can now be repeated by pushing the product back from the receiving cluster into the intake cluster. When the process is completed the product is forced out through valve <b>91</b> while valve <b>87</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0095">A combination of process cylinders is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> where a series of process cylinders <b>1</b>′, <b>2</b>′, <b>3</b>′ are connected to a common manifold which here takes the form of a cylinder <b>4</b>′ with a piston <b>5</b>′. The manifold cylinder <b>4</b>′ is connected to the processing unit <b>6</b>′ provided with a discharge valve <b>7</b>′ and an intake valve <b>8</b>′. A second combination of cylinders <b>9</b>′, <b>10</b>′, <b>11</b>′ are also connected to a common manifold <b>12</b>′ in the form of a cylinder with a piston <b>13</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0096">The purpose of this configuration is to eliminate the dead space problem and also to minimise loss of product in the system. During cycling of product between the two combinations of cylinders the manifold cylinders are used as dead space cylinders as described earlier in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. When the process is completed, all the pistons in the process cylinders move down to discharge the product through the valve <b>7</b>′. When this is done, the pistons <b>5</b>′ and <b>13</b> move in to discharge what product is left in the manifolds <b>4</b>′ and <b>12</b>′. This process leaves only the product trapped in the process unit <b>6</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0097">In a further refinement, an additive injection cylinder <b>14</b>′ may be connected to the processing unit <b>6</b>′ through valve <b>8</b>′ for injecting additives into said unit. The injection cylinder <b>14</b>′ allows for very accurate synchronising of additives into the product as the displacement of the piston in this cylinder can be mechanically or electronically synchronised with the displacement of the product cylinders <b>1</b>′-<b>3</b>′ and/or <b>9</b>′-<b>11</b>′.</p>
