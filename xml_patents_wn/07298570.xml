<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure describes systems and techniques relating to signal processing, for example, interpreting readback signals obtained from a magnetic storage medium.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Signal processing circuits are frequently used to read storage media and interpret obtained analog signals as discrete values stored on the media. For magnetic storage media, a transducer head may fly on a cushion of air over a magnetic disk surface. The transducer converts magnetic field variations into an analog electrical signal. The analog signal is amplified, converted to a digital signal and interpreted (e.g., using maximum likelihood techniques, such as using a Viterbi detector). Tracking of stored data during a read operation is frequently performed using feedback or decision aided gain and timing control.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The head-media combination in typical magnetic recording systems has associated transfer characteristics that include an asymmetrical signal amplitude response, where an input signal having equivalent amplitudes on the positive and negative sides of the waveform results in an output signal having different amplitudes on the positive and negative sides of the waveform. Such amplitude asymmetry has been compensated for by adding to a readback signal an asymmetry adjustment signal, which is the readback signal squared and then scaled by a controlled asymmetry factor. The controlled asymmetry factor has previously been based on a comparison of the positive peak value with the negative peak value in the readback signal, which thus minimizes amplitude error at the peak values.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure includes systems and techniques relating to interpreting signals on a channel having an asymmetrical signal amplitude response. According to an aspect of the described systems and techniques, a signal processor, such as a read channel transceiver device usable in a magnetic recording system, includes an asymmetry correction circuit configured to receive an analog signal and to compensate for asymmetry in the received analog signal, a signal equalizer configured to receive an input signal responsive to an output of the asymmetry correction circuit and to generate an equalized signal, a discrete time sequence detector operable to examine the equalized signal, and a control circuit that provides a coefficient adjustment to the asymmetry correction circuit to affect the asymmetry compensation based on an estimate of non-linearity derived from the equalized signal and an output of the discrete time sequence detector.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The estimate can be a least mean squared estimate of the non-linearity in the equalized signal. The coefficient adjustment can include one or more values received by the asymmetry correction circuit to control the asymmetry compensation. These values can be coefficient values or coefficient adjustment values (e.g., a coefficient adjustment can be a coefficient value q<sub>N,t+1 </sub>or a coefficient adjustment value μ·(y<sub>R</sub>−y<sub>A</sub>)·y<sub>1</sub><sup>N</sup>, when the one or more values are generated according to an equation, q<sub>N,t+1</sub>=q<sub>N,t</sub>+μ·(y<sub>R</sub>−y<sub>A</sub>)·y<sub>1</sub><sup>N</sup>, as described further below). The asymmetry correction circuit, the signal equalizer, the discrete time sequence detector and the control circuit can form at least a portion of a read channel in a storage access device, and the analog signal can be a readback signal obtained from a storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The described systems and techniques can result in improved asymmetry correction in a read channel of a storage device, allowing a larger portion of the dynamic range of the head-media combination to be used. Non-linearity observed on the digital side of a read channel, based on the target channel and least mean squared error techniques, can be used to provide a feedback signal that controls the asymmetry correction applied on the analog side of the read channel. The total output signal can be considered in optimizing one or more coefficients applied in an asymmetry correction circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The systems and techniques described can employ a straight forward equation to calculate an error term for the adaptation of an asymmetry correction coefficient, and can be applied regardless of the particular type of target channel being used. Moreover, the asymmetry correction can be applied at multiple higher orders of non-linearity, allowing the asymmetry correction to be tailored to a particular target channel of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects and advantages may be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a read channel in a storage system that performs amplitude asymmetry correction. The storage system includes a storage medium <b>100</b> and read head <b>102</b>. The storage medium can be read-only or read/write media and can be magnetic-based, optical-based, semiconductor-based media, or a combination of these. Examples of the storage medium include hard disk platters in a hard disk drive, a floppy disk, a tape, and an optical disk (e.g., laser disk, compact disk, digital versatile disk). The storage medium is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as a disk for illustration only; the systems and techniques described herein can be used with other storage media types or in non-storage applications (e.g., communications equipment).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The read head <b>102</b> can be part of a read-write head assembly that reads the storage media <b>100</b> under the control of a servo or actuator. An analog readback signal is generated and can be sent to a pre-amplifier <b>105</b>. The system can include an analog front end (AFE) <b>110</b>, which can provide filtering and gain control. The AFE <b>110</b> can have inputs from both a DC control unit <b>140</b> and an automatic gain control (AGC) unit <b>150</b>, and the AFE <b>110</b> can include a variable-gain amplifier (VGA), which can be regulated by the AGC <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The AFE <b>110</b> includes an asymmetry correction circuit (ASC) <b>112</b> configured to receive the analog readback signal and to compensate for asymmetry in the analog readback signal based on a coefficient adjustment received from a control circuit <b>130</b>, such as a least mean squared (LMS) control circuit described below. The AFE <b>110</b> can also include a continuous time filter (CTF) <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An analog to digital converter (ADC) <b>115</b> converts the readback signal from continuous-time domain to discrete-time domain, and a signal equalizer <b>120</b> shapes the signal to a desired target response. The ADC <b>115</b> can be a 6-bit ADC. The signal equalizer <b>120</b> can be a finite impulse response (FIR) digital filter, such as a 9-tap or 10-tap FIR, which can be programmable or adaptive. For example, the system can include an FIR adaptation unit <b>125</b> that provides a control input to an FIR <b>120</b>. Moreover, a CTF, ADC and FIR taken together can be viewed as the signal equalizer within the read channel.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A discrete time sequence detector <b>135</b> examines and interprets its input as discrete values stored on the media <b>100</b>. Timing control circuitry, including a timing control unit <b>160</b> and/or a phase locked loop (PLL), can be used to regulate the filtered signal provided to the detector <b>135</b>, and the DC control unit <b>140</b> can also apply a DC correction at one or more locations in the main read path. The sequence detector <b>135</b> can include one or more components, such as a Viterbi detector. The main read path can combine partial-response equalization with maximum-likelihood sequence detection (PRML) using a discrete-time approach (e.g., the class-IV partial response target (PR-IV)).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An output of the sequence detector <b>135</b> can be provided to a post processor, such as a media noise processor (MNP) that identifies and corrects errors in a detected sequence. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art, multiple components can be included after the component that obtains the binary sequence from the output of the signal equalizer, and these multiple components can be separate electronic components or integrated into a single sequence detector <b>135</b>. For example, a single Viterbi detector component in a read channel can be used to obtain the binary sequence and also to reconstruct the ideal target channel output as described further below, or a Viterbi detector component can be used to obtain the binary sequence and another component, which is responsive to an output of the Viterbi detector component, can be used to reconstruct the ideal target channel output.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In general, an output of the sequence detector <b>135</b>, such as an output coming directly from the sequence detector <b>135</b> or from a post processor, is provided to a control circuit <b>130</b>. The control circuit <b>130</b> provides the coefficient adjustment to the ASC <b>112</b> to affect the asymmetry compensation based on an estimate of non-linearity derived from the equalized signal and the output of the discrete time sequence detector.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the introduction of non-linearity in the readback signal and the subsequent compensation for this non-linearity. H(jω) <b>200</b> represents the transfer characteristics of the head-media combination, absent asymmetry. An asymmetry component <b>205</b> represents the asymmetry introduced by the head when reading the media. This asymmetry adds non-linear component(s) to the signal and can thus be represented by the following polynomial: x+p<sub>2</sub>·x<sup>2</sup>+p<sub>3</sub>·x<sup>3</sup>+p<sub>4</sub>·x<sup>4</sup>+ . . . , where x is the readback signal, and p<sub>2</sub>,p<sub>3</sub>,p<sub>4</sub>, . . . are the amounts of higher order non-linearity added to the signal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a graph illustrating an example plot <b>300</b> of the transfer function for input U to output V. As illustrated, the second order term of the asymmetry polynomial is typically the most significant high order term.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An ASC <b>210</b> compensates for the asymmetry by applying an asymmetry correction based on a model of the asymmetry in the channel. This asymmetry correction can be represented by the following polynomial: x−q<sub>2</sub>·x<sup>2</sup>−q<sub>3</sub>·x<sup>3</sup>−q<sub>4</sub>·x<sup>4 </sup>. . . , as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The asymmetry correction employed by the ASC <b>210</b> can be limited to the second order (x−q<sub>2</sub>·x<sup>2</sup>) or additional higher order terms can be included in the asymmetry correction. In general, one or more coefficients, q<sub>2</sub>,q<sub>3</sub>,q<sub>4</sub>, . . . , are adjusted so as to cancel the corresponding non-linear elements in the readback signal. The non-linearity introduced by the ASC <b>210</b> thus counteracts the non-linearity introduced into the readback signal by the head-media combination, before passing the readback signal on to a CTF <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The one or more coefficients can be decided adaptively, on the fly, to counteract non-linearity in the readback signal as it is observed. An LMS control circuit <b>230</b> can actively adjust the one or more coefficients used by the ASC <b>210</b> based on an estimate of non-linearity derived from the output of an FIR <b>220</b> and an output of a Viterbi detector <b>225</b>. The FIR output provides a signal that reflects the non-linearity in the channel, and the Viterbi detector output can be used to reconstruct the ideal target channel output to calculate the error signal used. As noted above, this reconstruction can be performed by the Viterbi detector itself or another component responsive to an output of the Viterbi detector.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a graph illustrating an example plot <b>400</b> of the asymmetry reflected at the FIR output without any asymmetry correction. As illustrated, the FIR output indicates the asymmetry in the signal and can thus be used to decide how adjustments to the asymmetry correction should be made to cancel that asymmetry. The example plot <b>400</b> shows ideal FIR output plotted against the real FIR output for a given target channel. Since asymmetry correction is the signal aspect being addressed here, the rest of the channel can be assumed to be ideal (e.g., any additive white noise can be disregarded because it does not affect the asymmetry processing being described), and the FIR equalizer can be assumed to be doing a perfect job in equalizing the signal to the target.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Thus, the relationship between the input and the output of the read channel can be defined by the target polynomial for the read channel. Based on that target polynomial, the ideal output of the FIR can be determined, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The non-linearity in the read channel can be seen by fitting a curve <b>410</b> to the data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, such as by minimizing the mean squared error. This curve <b>410</b> characterizes the relationship between the real output and the ideal output and directly reflects the non-linearity in the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">If there is a second order non-linearity in the readback signal due to a magnetic recording (MR) head, this is reflected as a second order non-linearity at the FIR output, and likewise for third, fourth or higher non-linearity in the readback signal. The non-linearity reflected at the FIR output may not be of the same magnitude as that introduced by the MR head, but will be of the same trend. This information from the FIR output indicates when non-linearity remains in the channel, and can thus be used to adjust the asymmetry correction.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The non-linearity in the FIR output can be modeled by the following asymmetry polynomial, y<sub>A</sub>=α·y<sub>1</sub>+β·y<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>+χ·y<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup>+C, where y<sub>1 </sub>is the ideal channel output given by the linear target polynomial, and y<sub>A </sub>is the real output according to the asymmetry model. Using this model, the coefficients of the asymmetry polynomial can be determined and used to adjust the asymmetry correction. Although only terms up to the third order are considered here, higher order terms can be added and addressed in the same manner.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To determine the coefficients, an error signal is defined according to the following equation, e=y<sub>R</sub>−y<sub>A</sub>, where y<sub>A </sub>models the non-linearity in the channel, and y<sub>R </sub>is the real FIR output. Non-linearity in the readback signal can thus be removed by making y<sub>A </sub>as close to y<sub>R </sub>as possible in the sense of least mean squared error. With this error signal defined, the coefficients used by the ASC can be adjusted using standard least mean squared error criteria based on the square of the error signal.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">One or more gradients can be defined, and the coefficients of the asymmetry polynomial can be adjusted accordingly:</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">This technique can determine the non-linearity at the FIR output and can be directly applied to the adjustment of the coefficients in the ASC. The asymmetry correction can be made stronger or weaker as needed based on the non-linearity observed at the FIR output. For example, the updating equation for β can be applied directly to the second order correcting term in the asymmetry correction imparted by the ASC. Thus, the overall mean squared error value(s) can be minimized to thereby optimize the coefficient(s) in the ASC.</p>
