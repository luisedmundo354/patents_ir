<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present document incorporates by reference the entire contents of Japanese priority document, 2003-427572 filed in Japan on Dec. 24, 2003.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a motor driving unit that that drives an object with the help of a driving force of an electric motor, and a vehicle-door mirror that is equipped with the motor driving unit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Motor driving units that drive objects with the help of driving forces of electric motors are know. Such motor driving units include a driving force transmission mechanism that transmits the driving force of the electric motor to the object, and a control circuit that control, such as switching off power supply to the electric motor, the electric motor. Such motor driving units are used in powered retractable door mirrors and power windows of vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A conventional motor driving unit is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. It is assumed here that,the motor driving unit is used in a powered retractable door mirror (hereinafter, “door mirror”) of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the door mirror includes a mirror base <b>1</b>, a shaft holder <b>2</b>, a motor driving unit <b>3</b>A, and a mirror assembly that is the object to be driven by the motor driving unit <b>3</b>A. The mirror base <b>1</b> is fixed to a door (not shown) of a vehicle. The shaft holder <b>2</b> holds a shaft <b>21</b> and is fixed to the mirror base <b>1</b>. The motor driving unit <b>3</b>A is rotatably pivoted by the shaft <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The mirror assembly includes a housing <b>4</b>, a fixing bracket <b>5</b> that includes a power unit etc., and a mirror <b>6</b>. The mirror assembly is rotatably pivoted by the shaft <b>21</b> via the motor driving unit <b>3</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The motor driving unit <b>3</b>A includes an electric motor <b>33</b>, a clutch mechanism <b>35</b>, and a speed reduction mechanism (driving force transmission mechanism) <b>36</b>. The clutch mechanism <b>35</b> transmits the driving force of the electric motor <b>33</b> to the mirror assembly. The motor driving unit <b>3</b>A further includes a switching circuit (motor drive control circuit). When the mirror assembly comes to a predetermined position, the switching circuit switches off the power supply to the electric motor <b>33</b> and stops the mirror assembly at a standing position (in-use position) or a retracted position (rearward tilted position).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the switching circuit includes a first PTC (positive temperature coefficient) element PTC<b>1</b>, a second PTC element PTC<b>2</b>, a first diode D<b>1</b>, a second diode D<b>2</b>, a relay contact R-S, a start-up condenser C, a relay self-holding resistance R-R, a relay-coil R-C, and a discharge resistance RD.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The switching circuit is connected electrically to a power supply ACC (+) side and an earthing (−) side via a retraction control switch (not shown) and a harness (not shown). The retraction control switch is for switching to the standing position or to the retracted position, and is disposed in an interior of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When an operator operates the retraction control switch, the motor driving unit <b>3</b>A is operated (by driving the electric motor <b>33</b> and operating the speed reduction mechanism <b>36</b> etc.) and the mirror assembly is moved to the standing position or the retracted position. When the mirror assembly reaches the standing position or the retracted position, the switching circuit switches off the power supply to the electric motor <b>33</b> so that the mirror assembly stops at that position.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Generally the electric motor <b>33</b> produces a high-frequency induced-noise due to a change in the amount of electric current flowing during driving (a momentary voltage fluctuation at a start-up of drive, while switching from normal rotation to reverse rotation etc.). The induced noise affects peripheral equipments. For example, if the motor driving unit is used in functional parts of the vehicle such as the powered retractable mirror and the power window, the induced noise affects equipments in the interior of the vehicle such as radio, television, and electronic control unit (ECU) that performs an engine control etc. Moreover, if the motor drive control is used as a switching device of top light in a house, it affects equipments such as radio and television in the house.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">One approach to avoid the induced noise from affecting the peripheral equipment is to enclose the peripheral equipment in a casing that blocks the induced noise.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, induced noise not only from the electric motor but also induced noises from various sources affect the peripheral equipment. For example, the relay contact R-S also produces noise. Therefore, it is necessary to block these induced noises that are in various frequency bands. The conventional technology focuses only on blocking the induced noise form one source, that is, the electric motor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is an object according to the present invention to solve at least the problems in the conventional technology.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A motor driving unit according to an aspect of the present invention includes an electric motor that drives an object; and a circuit board that includes a control circuit that controls driving of the electric motor. The electric motor and the circuit board are disposed with a predetermined distance therebetween in such a manner that the electric motor. Moreover, the circuit board includes a pseudo condenser in the form of a conductor pattern, wherein the pseudo condenser is disposed at a position facing the electric motor.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Embodiments of the present invention are described below in detail with reference to accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A first embodiment of the motor driving unit according to the present invention is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>. It is assumed that the motor driving unit is used in a powered retractable door mirror (hereinafter, “door mirror”) of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The door mirror according to the first embodiment includes a motor driving unit <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, and <b>2</b> depict the structure of the motor driving unit <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The motor driving unit <b>3</b> includes a gear case <b>31</b> and a cover <b>32</b>. A space in the gear case <b>31</b>, which is covered by the cover <b>32</b>, includes an electric motor <b>33</b> which drives the unit, a motor case <b>34</b> that holds the electric motor <b>33</b>, a power transmission mechanism (a clutch mechanism <b>35</b> and a speed reduction mechanism <b>36</b>) that transmits the driving force of the electric motor <b>33</b>, and a switching circuit board <b>37</b> (a motor drive control circuit board on which a motor drive control circuit is mounted) on which a switching circuit is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">To start with, a housing <b>311</b> for the clutch mechanism <b>35</b> and a housing <b>312</b> for the speed reduction mechanism <b>36</b> are disposed in parallel and the clutch mechanism <b>35</b> and the speed reduction mechanism <b>36</b> are installed in the housing <b>311</b> and the housing <b>312</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A hole <b>313</b> is cut through a bottom portion of the housing <b>311</b> of the clutch mechanism <b>35</b> to insert a shaft <b>21</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The clutch mechanism <b>35</b> is fixed to the shaft <b>21</b> in the hole <b>313</b> through a washer <b>40</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The motor case <b>34</b> is fixed to the gear case <b>31</b> to cover an opening of the housing <b>312</b> of the speed reduction mechanism <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The following is a description of the motor case <b>34</b>. The motor case <b>34</b> includes a mounting base <b>341</b> for the electric motor <b>33</b> (hereinafter, “motor mounting base”). The motor mounting base <b>341</b> is a cylindrical outer wall that has a shape similar to an outer shape of the electric motor <b>33</b>. The electric motor <b>33</b> is accommodated and held inside this cylindrical outer wall. A notch <b>341</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is cut on a portion facing the switching circuit board <b>37</b> in the outer wall, which is described later.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An output shaft <b>331</b> of the electric motor <b>33</b> is coupled with a first worm gear <b>361</b> of the speed reduction mechanism <b>36</b> via a joint <b>332</b>. For this reason, a hole <b>341</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is cut through a bottom portion of the motor mounting base <b>341</b> to insert the output shaft <b>331</b> and the joint <b>332</b>. The hole <b>341</b><i>b </i>is cut such that it continues through the housing <b>312</b> of the speed reduction mechanism <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A groove <b>342</b> in which a bottom edge of the switching circuit board <b>37</b> is inserted, and a claw <b>343</b> that is inserted through a hole <b>371</b> of the switching circuit board <b>37</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 2</figref>, are cut in the motor case <b>34</b>. The switching circuit board <b>37</b> is held by the motor case <b>34</b> with the groove <b>342</b>, the claw <b>343</b>, and a groove <b>322</b> in the cover <b>32</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The switching circuit that is mounted on the switching circuit board <b>37</b> includes a first PTC element PTC<b>1</b>, a second PTC element PTC<b>2</b>, a first diode D<b>1</b>, a second diode D<b>2</b>, a relay contact R-S, a start-up condenser C, a relay self-holding resistance R-R, a relay coil R-C, and a discharge resistance RD as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Moreover, the switching circuit is connected electrically to a power supply side ACC (+) and an earthing (−) side via a retraction control switch and a harness, which are not shown in the diagram. The retraction control switch is for switching to the standing position or to the retracted position and is disposed in the interior of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The switching circuit board <b>37</b> according to the first embodiment is provided with a conductor pattern <b>372</b> that is disposed in a position facing a metal case of the electric motor <b>33</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The conductor pattern <b>372</b> faces the metal case such that it is at a predetermined distance from the metal case of the electric motor <b>33</b> via at least the notch <b>341</b><i>a </i>in the motor case <b>34</b>. The conductor pattern <b>372</b> is connected electrically to an earthing (−) side of the relay coil R-C according to the first embodiment. Thus, the conductor pattern <b>372</b>, the metal case, and a dielectric substance (air) between these two form a pseudo condenser Cp shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the switching circuit board <b>37</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for the sake of convenience of description, a switching circuit structure of components such as resistance that are mounted, is not shown in the diagram.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to the first embodiment, the pseudo condenser Cp is provided between the electric motor <b>33</b> and the switching circuit (in this case, between the relay coil R-C and the earthing (−) side). Therefore, if there is a momentary voltage fluctuation in the electric motor <b>33</b> at the time of start up of drive of the electric motor <b>33</b>, an electric charge equivalent to the voltage fluctuation is stored in the pseudo condenser Cp. By absorption of the voltage fluctuation by the pseudo condenser Cp, induced noise that is generated from the electric motor <b>33</b> is absorbed, thereby enabling to reduce or eliminate such induced noise.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Normally, larger is the electrostatic capacity of the condenser, better is the noise absorption. The electrostatic capacity is proportional to an area of the conductors facing each other and increases in inverse proportion with a distance between the conductors. Therefore, to achieve effective absorption by the pseudo condenser Cp according to the first embodiment, it is desirable to increase area of the conductor pattern <b>372</b> and the notch <b>341</b><i>a, </i>as well as to decrease the distance (the predetermined distance) between the electric motor <b>33</b> and the conductor pattern <b>372</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The motor case <b>34</b> is fitted inside an outer wall <b>314</b> of the gear case <b>31</b> and is fixed with a screw S.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The clutch mechanism <b>35</b> includes a clutch holder <b>351</b>, a clutch gear <b>352</b>, a spring <b>353</b>, and a push nut <b>354</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The clutch mechanism is formed by fitting the washer <b>40</b>A, the clutch holder <b>351</b>, the clutch gear <b>352</b>, and the spring <b>353</b> one after another on the shaft <b>21</b> that is inserted in the housing <b>311</b> of the gear case <b>31</b> and by compressing the spring <b>353</b> with the push nut <b>354</b>. While doing so, protruding portions <b>351</b><i>a </i>that are formed on a top surface of the clutch holder <b>351</b> are engaged with recesses <b>352</b><i>a </i>formed on a bottom surface of the clutch gear <b>352</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The speed reduction mechanism <b>36</b> includes the first worm gear <b>361</b> that is coupled with the output shaft <b>331</b> of the electric motor <b>33</b> via the joint <b>332</b>, a helical gear <b>362</b> that is engaged with the first worm gear <b>361</b>, and a second worm gear <b>363</b> that is engaged with the helical gear <b>362</b>. The second worm gear <b>363</b> is engaged with the clutch gear <b>352</b> of the clutch mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The driving force of the electric motor <b>33</b> is transmitted to the shaft <b>21</b> via the clutch mechanism <b>35</b> and the speed reduction mechanism <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The cover <b>32</b> is fixed to the gear case <b>31</b> that is equipped with various components. A cylindrical part <b>321</b> with it's both ends open, is formed on the cover <b>32</b> at a position opposite to the hole <b>313</b> that is cut through the gear case <b>31</b>. An inner wall of the cylindrical part <b>321</b> functions as a bearing of the shaft <b>21</b> and the cylindrical part <b>321</b> also functions as an inserting hole for the harness that is not shown in the diagram. The harness is also inserted through the shaft <b>21</b> that is hollow.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The groove <b>322</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> in which at least a top edge of the switching circuit board <b>37</b> is fitted, is cut on an inner side of the cover <b>32</b>. The groove <b>322</b> may be cut such that a side edge and an inclined edge of the switching circuit board <b>37</b>, which are not shown in the diagram, are fitted in it.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Thus, the cover <b>32</b> structured in such a manner has the switching circuit board <b>37</b> fitted in the groove <b>322</b> on the inner side as well as an outer wall <b>323</b> of it's bottom edge fitted into the outer wall <b>314</b> of the gear case <b>31</b>. The cover <b>32</b> can be fixed by any method, such as hot melting or screwing.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Thus the motor driving unit <b>3</b> is rotatably pivoted by the shaft <b>21</b> that is held by the shaft holder <b>2</b> via a ball <b>39</b> and a washer <b>40</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and rotates the mirror assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An operation of the powered retractable door mirror according to the first embodiment is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When an operator operates the retraction control switch (not shown in the diagram) that is provided in the interior of the vehicle, the electric motor <b>33</b> of the motor driving unit <b>3</b> is driven. The driving force of the electric motor <b>33</b> is transmitted via the output shaft <b>331</b> of the motor, the joint <b>332</b>, and the speed reduction mechanism <b>36</b>, to the clutch gear <b>352</b> that is fixed to the shaft <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">While the driving force of the electric motor <b>33</b> is transmitted to the clutch gear <b>352</b>, since the clutch gear <b>352</b> in the motor driving unit <b>3</b> cannot rotate with respect to the shaft <b>21</b>, the second worm gear <b>363</b> of the speed reduction mechanism <b>36</b> rotates around the clutch gear <b>352</b> as a center. The rotation of the second worm gear <b>363</b> causes the mirror assembly included in the motor driving unit <b>3</b> (components such as a housing <b>4</b>, a fixing bracket <b>5</b>, and a mirror <b>6</b> included in the motor driving unit <b>3</b>) to rotate around the shaft <b>21</b> as a center.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When the mirror assembly reaches the standing position or the retracted position, the power supply to the electric motor <b>33</b> is cut off by switching operation of the switching circuit and the mirror assembly stops at the predetermined position.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">If the transmission power from the electric motor <b>33</b> is in excess or if there is an impact on the mirror assembly, the clutch gear <b>352</b> rotates while resisting thrust exerted by the spring <b>353</b>, and the protruding portions <b>351</b><i>a </i>on the clutch holder <b>351</b> and the recesses <b>352</b><i>a </i>on the clutch gear <b>352</b> are disengaged. Due to this, the load on the electric motor <b>33</b> is released, thereby avoiding any damage.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At the start-up of the electric motor <b>33</b>, the voltage in the electric motor <b>33</b> fluctuates momentarily. When the voltage fluctuates, according to the first embodiment, the electric charge equivalent to the voltage fluctuation is stored in the pseudo condenser Cp, thereby enabling to reduce or to eliminate the induced noise generated from the electric motor <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Thus, according to the first embodiment, the induced noise from the electric motor <b>33</b> can be reduced or eliminated near the electric motor <b>33</b> and any adverse effect on the peripheral equipment installed in the vehicle can be avoided. This allows better reception of signal by the radio and the television, and enables to prevent malfunctioning of the ECU.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A second embodiment of the motor driving unit according to the present invention is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The motor driving unit used in the powered retractable door mirror according to the second embodiment is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The powered retractable door mirror according to the second embodiment includes the motor driving unit <b>3</b> provided in the powered retractable door mirror according to the first embodiment with a change incorporated in the switching circuit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A switching circuit mounted on the switching circuit board according to the second embodiment is provided with an additional circuit structure, which is a following noise-eliminating device, added to the components of the inductive load system in the switching circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">To start with, the relay contact R-S is provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as a component of the inductive load system and at a time of ON/OFF, a counter electromotive force is generated in this relay contact R-S, thereby causing the induced noise of high frequency. For this reason, according to the second embodiment, a combination of a condenser C<b>1</b> and a resistance R, which are connected in series, is provided in parallel to the relay contact R-S to reduce or to eliminate the induced noise that is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, the relay coil R-C is connected as a component of the inductive load system as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and the induced noise of high frequency is generated in this relay coil R-C as well. For this reason, according to the second embodiment, a condenser C<b>2</b> is connected in parallel with the relay coil R-C as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to reduce or to eliminate the induced noise that is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Furthermore, as described in the first embodiment, the induced noise is also generated from the electric motor <b>33</b> which is a component of the inductive load system. To deal with this, according to the second embodiment, a coil L<b>1</b> is connected in series to a power supply ACC (+) side of the electric motor and a coil L<b>2</b> is connected in series to an earthing (−) side of the electric motor <b>33</b>. The coils L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> connected in such a manner, convert the induced noise generated from to electric motor to heat energy, thereby reducing or eliminating the induced noise. Instead of using the two coils L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> for the reduction or elimination of the induced noise, any one of the coils may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to the second embodiment, the coils L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> are connected in series and condensers C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>, and C<b>5</b> are connected in parallel, which reduce or eliminate the induced noise generated in the electric motor <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to the second embodiment, a pseudo condenser Cp is formed between the electric motor <b>33</b> and the conductor pattern <b>372</b>. The conductor pattern <b>372</b> is connected electrically between the condenser C<b>3</b> and C<b>4</b>, thereby forming the pseudo condenser Cp as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Thus, according to the second embodiment, the pseudo condenser Cp not only reduces or eliminates the induced noise as according the first embodiment, but can reduce or eliminate the induced noise in an effective manner because of the coils L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> and the condensers C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>, and C<b>5</b>. Moreover, the switching circuit according the second embodiment is provided with a noise eliminating device for each inductive load system, which enables to reduce or to eliminate the induced noise in the circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, according to the second embodiment, the noise eliminating device is provided for each inductive load system. However, it is not necessary to provide the noise eliminating device for each of the inductive load systems and may be provided according the requirement of level of reduction or elimination. In other words, the noise eliminating device may be provided to at least any one of the inductive load systems.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A third embodiment of the motor driving unit according to the present invention is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref>. The motor driving unit used in the powered retractable door mirror according the third embodiment is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The powered retractable door mirror according to the third embodiment includes the motor driving unit <b>3</b> according to the first embodiment with a provision of a short-circuiting device <b>41</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. The short-circuiting device <b>41</b> allows conduction between the metal case of the electric motor <b>33</b> and the conductor pattern <b>372</b> in the switching circuit board <b>37</b>. According to the third embodiment, a pressure welded spring that is made of a conductive material such as a metal that is pressure welded by bending between the metal case of the electric motor <b>33</b> and the conductor pattern <b>372</b> in the switching circuit board <b>37</b>, is used as the short-circuiting device <b>41</b>. A switching circuit according to the third embodiment, which is provided with the short-circuiting device <b>41</b>, is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Thus, by providing the short-circuiting device <b>41</b> that is connected electrically the induced noise generated from the electric motor can be reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A fourth embodiment of the motor driving unit according to the present invention is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>, and <b>9</b>. The motor driving unit used in the powered retractable door mirror according to the fourth embodiment is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The powered retractable door mirror according to the fourth embodiment includes the motor driving unit <b>3</b> according to the second embodiment with a provision of the short-circuiting device <b>41</b> according to the third embodiment. A switching circuit according to the fourth embodiment that includes the short-circuiting device <b>41</b> is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. This enables to reduce or to eliminate the induced noise in each inductive load system according to the second embodiment as well as to reduce or to eliminate the induced noise generated from the electric motor <b>33</b> by the short-circuiting device <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The motor driving unit is assumed to be used in powered retractable door mirrors of vehicles. However, the motor driving unit according to the present invention can also be used as a switching device of a power window of a vehicle or an expansion device of an antenna or a switching device of top light in a house.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to the motor driving unit of the present invention, a pseudo condenser is formed by a conductor pattern of a motor drive control circuit and an electric motor facing each other. Therefore, when there is a momentary voltage fluctuation in the electric motor, an electric charge equivalent to the voltage fluctuation is stored in the pseudo condenser, which enables to reduce or eliminate the induced noise generated from the electric motor. Moreover, by providing the powered retractable door mirror with the motor driving unit, the induced noise that is generated from the powered retractable door mirror, is reduced or eliminated. This improves reception of signal by the radio or the television in the interior of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Thus, the motor driving unit according to the present invention is useful for reducing or eliminating the noise that is generated by the motor driving unit itself and in particular is suitable when equipment that are easily affected by noise are disposed nearby.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Although the invention has been described with respect to a specific embodiment for a complete and clear disclosure, the appended claims are not to be thus limited but are to be construed as embodying all modifications and alternative constructions that may occur to one skilled in the art which fairly fall within the basic teaching herein set forth.</p>
