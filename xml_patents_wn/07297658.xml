<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to non-photosensitive thermographic materials, particularly black-and-white direct thermographic materials, having a unique adhesive layer (“carrier” layer) between the imaging layers and a polymeric support. The invention also relates to methods of imaging such direct thermographic materials.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Silver-containing direct thermographic imaging materials are non-photosensitive materials that are used in a recording process wherein images are generated by the direct application of thermal energy and in the absence of a processing solvent. These materials have been known in the art for many years and generally comprise a support having disposed thereon one or more imaging layers comprising (a) a relatively or completely non-photosensitive source of reducible silver ions, (b) a reducing agent composition (acting as a black-and-white silver developer) for the reducible silver ions, and (c) a suitable binder. Thermographic materials are sometimes called “direct thermal” materials in the art because they are directly imaged by a source of thermal energy without any transfer of the image or image-forming materials to another element (such as in thermal dye transfer).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a typical thermographic construction, the image-forming thermographic layers comprise silver salts of long chain fatty acids. The preferred non-photosensitive reducible silver source is a silver salt of a long chain aliphatic carboxylic acid having from 10 to 30 carbon atoms, such as behenic acid or mixtures of acids of similar molecular weight. At elevated temperatures, the silver(I) of the silver carboxylate is reduced by a reducing agent (also known as a developer), whereby elemental silver is formed. Imagewise heating, such as by using a thermal print-head, results in a black-and-white image.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Problem to be Solved</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As noted above, direct thermographic materials are imaged by a recording process whereby images are generated by imagewise heating a recording material containing chemical components that change color or optical density in an imagewise fashion. Such materials generally include one or more thermographic (imaging) layers on a polymeric support. Adhesion between those layers and the support is a concern because of the high temperatures to which the material is exposed during imaging and transport through an imaging device. There is a risk that pieces of the imaged material can flake off during this process causing debris and damage to both the imaged material and imaging equipment. In addition, there is a concern that various chemicals can migrate out of the material into the imaging device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 6,436,622 (Geisler) describes direct thermographic materials that include an adhesion-promoting or carrier layer between the imaging layers and the polymeric support. Polyisocyanates are described for use as hardeners for binders in the thermographic layers. Polyisocyanates have also been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,313,065 (Horsten et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,275,932 (Weigel et al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,548 (Bjork et al.) as hardeners for topcoat layers of thermographic materials.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There remains a need, however, for improved adhesion between the imaging layers and the polymeric support in thermographic materials.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">The direct thermographic materials can be used to provide black-and-white silver images using non-photosensitive silver salts, reducing agents, binders, and other components known to be useful in such materials.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">The direct thermographic materials can be used in black-and-white thermography and in electronically generated black-and-white hardcopy recording. They can be used as output media, in radiographic imaging (for example digital medical imaging), X-ray radiography, and in industrial radiography. Furthermore, the absorbance of these thermographic materials between 350 and 450 nm is desirably low (less than 0.5), to permit their use in the graphic arts area (for example, in imagesetting and phototypesetting operations), in the manufacture of printing plates, in contact printing, in duplicating (“duping”), and in proofing.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">The direct thermographic materials are particularly useful as output media for medical imaging of human or animal subjects in response to visible or X-radiation for diagnostic purposes. Such applications include, but are not limited to, thoracic imaging, mammography, dental imaging, orthopedic imaging, general medical radiography, therapeutic radiography, veterinary radiography, and auto-radiography.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">In direct thermographic materials, the components needed for imaging can be in one or more thermographic layers on one side (“frontside”) of the support. The layer(s) that contain the non-photosensitive source of reducible silver ions, or both, are referred to herein as thermographic, emulsion, or thermally sensitive imaging layer(s).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">Where the materials contain thermographic imaging layers on one side of the support only, various non-light sensitive, non-imaging layers can be disposed on the “backside” (non-emulsion or non-imaging side) of the materials, such as, primer layers, interlayers, opacifying layers, subbing layers, carrier layers, auxiliary layers and/or conductive layers. Particularly important non-imaging layers include a backside conductive layer containing an antistatic agent and an outermost backside protective layer.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0025">In such embodiments, various non-imaging layers can also be disposed on the “frontside,” imaging, or emulsion side of the support, including primer layers, interlayers, opacifying layers, subbing layers, auxiliary layers carrier layers, and other layers readily apparent to one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0026">In some embodiments, the direct thermographic materials are “double-sided” and have thermographic imaging layer(s) on both sides of the support. In such constructions, each side can also include one or more carrier layers, primer layers, adhesive layers, interlayers, antistatic or conductive layers, auxiliary layers, and other layers readily apparent to one skilled in the art. An outermost protective layer can be on either or both sides of the support.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Definitions</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0027">As used herein:</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">In the descriptions of the thermographic materials, “a” or “an” component refers to “at least one” of that component (for example, the polyisocyanate crosslinking agents described below).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">The term “black-and-white” refers to an image formed by silver metal.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">“Thermographic material(s)” means a dry processable integral element comprising a support having at least one thermographic emulsion layer or a set of thermographic emulsion layers, (wherein the source of reducible silver ions is in one layer and other components or additives are distributed, as desired, in the same layer or in one or more additional coated layer), that provides a black-and-white silver image. Such additional layers include protective layers, carrier layers, conductive layers, and subbing or priming layers. These materials preferably have at least one outermost protective layer on the imaging side that is in direct contact with the imaging means during thermal imaging. These materials also include multilayer constructions in which one or more imaging components are in different thermographic layers, but are in “reactive association.” For example, one layer can include the non-photosensitive source of reducible silver ions and another layer can include the reducing agent, but the two reactive components are in reactive association with each other. Preferably these materials have at least one outermost protective layer as described herein located above all thermographic layers. By “integral,” we mean that all imaging chemistry required for imaging is in the material without diffusion of imaging chemistry or reaction products (such as a dye) from or to another element (such as a receiver element).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">Also, unless otherwise indicated, the terms “thermographic material” and “direct thermographic material” are meant to refer to embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">When used in thermography, the term, “imagewise exposing” or “imagewise exposure” means that the material is imaged using any means that provides an image using heat. This includes, for example, analog exposure where an image is formed by differential contact heating through a mask using a thermal blanket or infrared heat source, as well as by digital exposure where the image is formed one pixel at a time such as by modulation of a thermal print-head or by thermally imaging with a modulated scanning laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">The materials of this invention are “direct” thermographic materials that are imaged using a digital exposure and thermal imaging is carried out in a single thermographic material containing all the necessary imaging chemistry. Direct thermal imaging is distinguishable from what is known in the art as thermal transfer imaging (such as dye transfer imaging) in which the image is produced in one material (“donor”) and transferred to another material (“receiver”) using thermal means.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">“Catalytic proximity” or “reactive association” means that the reactive components are in the same layer or in adjacent layers so that they readily come into contact with each other during thermal imaging and development.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">“Emulsion layer,” “imaging layer,” “thermographic layer,” or “thermographic emulsion layer,” means a thermally sensitive layer of a thermographic material that contains at least the non-photosensitive source of reducible silver ions. It can also mean a layer of the thermographic material that contains, in addition to the non-photosensitive source of reducible silver, additional desirable components. These layers are usually on what is known as the “frontside” of the support.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0036">The frontside protective layer is the outermost layer on the imaging side of the material that is in direct contact with the imaging means. The backside protective layer is the outermost layer on the side of the support opposite to that containing the imaging layer(s).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0037">“Non-photosensitive” means not intentionally light sensitive. The direct thermographic materials described herein are non-photosensitive meaning that no photosensitive silver halide(s) has been purposely added or created.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0038">“Simultaneous coating” or “wet-on-wet” coating means that when multiple layers are coated, subsequent layers are coated onto the initially coated layer before the initially coated layer is dry.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0039">The sensitometric terms, absorbance, contrast, Dmin, and Dmax have conventional definitions known in the imaging arts. In thermographic materials, Dmin is considered herein as image density in the areas with the minimum application of heat by the thermal print-head. The term Dmax is the maximum image density achieved when the thermographic material is thermally imaged with a given amount of thermal energy. The sensitometric term absorbance is another term for optical density (OD).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0040">“Transparent” means capable of transmitting visible light or imaging radiation without appreciable scattering or absorption.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">The phrases “silver salt” and “organic silver salt” refer to an organic molecule having a bond to a silver atom. Although the compounds so formed are technically silver coordination complexes or silver compounds they are often referred to as silver salts.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0042">The terms “double-sided,” “double-faced coating,” and “duplitized” are used to define thermographic materials having one or more of the same or different thermographic layers disposed on both sides (frontside and backside) of the support.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0043">“Silver Efficiency” is defined as Dmax divided by the silver coating weight. It is a measure of the amount of silver that has developed under a given set of exposure and development conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">As is well understood in this art, for the chemical compounds herein described, substitution is not only tolerated, but is often advisable and various substituents are anticipated on the compounds used in the present invention unless otherwise stated. Thus, when a compound is referred to as “having the structure” of a given formula, any substitution that does not alter the bond structure of the formula or the shown atoms within that structure is included within the formula, unless such substitution is specifically excluded by language (such as “free of carboxy-substituted alkyl”).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0045">As a means of simplifying the discussion and recitation of certain substituent groups, the term “group” refers to chemical species that may be substituted as well as those that are not so substituted. Thus, the term “alkyl group” is intended to include not only pure hydrocarbon alkyl chains, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, t-butyl, cyclohexyl, iso-octyl, and octadecyl, but also alkyl chains bearing substituents known in the art, such as hydroxyl, alkoxy, phenyl, halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br, and I), cyano, nitro, amino, and carboxy. For example, alkyl group can include ether and thioether groups (for example CH<sub>3</sub>—CH<sub>2</sub>—CH<sub>2</sub>—O—CH<sub>2</sub>— and CH<sub>3</sub>—CH<sub>2</sub>—CH<sub>2</sub>—S—CH<sub>2</sub>—), haloalkyl, nitroalkyl, alkylcarboxy, carboxyalkyl, carboxamido, hydroxyalkyl, sulfoalkyl, and other groups readily apparent to one skilled in the art. A skilled artisan would exclude substituents that adversely react with other active ingredients as not being inert or harmless.</p>

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Non-Photosensitive Source of Reducible Silver Ions</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048">The non-photosensitive source of reducible silver ions used in the direct thermographic materials can be any silver-organic compound that contains reducible silver(I) ions. Such compounds are generally silver salts of silver coordinating ligands.

<p id="p-0078" num="0078">A combination of one or more hydroxyphthalic acids and one or more phthalazinone compounds can be included in the thermographic materials. Hydroxyphthalic acid compounds have a single hydroxy substituent that is in the meta position to at least one of the carboxy groups.

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Binders</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0084">The non-photosensitive source(s) of reducible silver ions, the reducing agent(s), toners, and any other thermographic layer additives are generally combined with one or more binders that are generally hydrophobic in nature. Thus, organic solvent-based formulations can be used to prepare the thermographic materials.</p>

Copolymers (including terpolymers) are also included in the definition of polymers. The polyvinyl acetals (such as polyvinyl butyral and polyvinyl formal) and vinyl copolymers (such as polyvinyl acetate and polyvinyl chloride) are particularly preferred. Particularly suitable hydrophobic binders are polyvinyl butyral resins that are available under the names MOWITAL® (Kuraray America, New York, N.Y.), S-LEC® (Sekisui Chemical Company, Troy, Mich.), BUTVAR® (Solutia, Inc., St. Louis, Mo.), and PIOLOFORM® (Wacker Chemical Company, Adrian, Mich.).</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0087">The binder(s) should be able to withstand the thermal imaging conditions described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088">The polymer binder(s) is used in an amount sufficient to carry the components dispersed therein. Preferably, a binder is used at a level of from about 10% to about 90% by weight (more preferably at a level of from about 20% to about 70% by weight) based on the total dry weight of the layer.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0089">It is particularly useful in the direct thermographic materials to use predominantly (more than 50% by weight of total binder weight) hydrophobic binders in both imaging and non-imaging layers on both sides of the support. In particular, the outermost layers are generally formulated and disposed on the support with one or more hydrophobic binders such as cellulose ester polymer binders. Of these binders, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, and cellulose acetate propionate are preferred.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Support Materials</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0090">The direct thermographic materials comprise a polymeric support that is preferably a flexible, transparent film that has any desired thickness and is composed of one or more polymeric materials, depending upon their use. The supports are generally transparent (especially if the material is used as a photomask) or at least translucent, but in some instances, opaque supports may be useful. They are required to exhibit dimensional stability during thermal imaging and development and to have suitable adhesive properties with overlying layers. Useful polymeric materials for making such supports include polyesters, cellulose acetate and other cellulose esters, polyvinyl acetal, polyolefins, polycarbonates, and polystyrenes. Preferred supports are composed of polyesters or polycarbonates, such as polyethylene terephthalate film.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0091">Opaque supports can also be used, such as dyed polymeric films and resin-coated papers that are stable to high temperatures. Support materials can contain various colorants, pigments, and dyes if desired. For example, the support can contain conventional blue dyes that differ in absorbance from colorants in the various frontside or backside layers as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,442 (Van Achere et al.). Support materials may be treated using conventional procedures (such as corona discharge) to improve adhesion of overlying layers, or subbing or other adhesion-promoting layers can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0092">The support thickness can be within the range of from about 2 to about 15 μm. Preferably, the support thickness is from about 4 to about 10 μm.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Protective Layer</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0093">The direct thermographic materials may have at least one non-thermally sensitive protective layer. Such layers can also be known as a “topcoat” or an “overcoat layer.” on at least the imaging side of the support. Preferably, this protective layer is the outermost layer on the imaging side. A wide variety of materials are useful as binders or other components in such outermost protective layers as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,536,696 (Horsten et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,817,598 (Defieuw et al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 6,313,065 (noted above). Such protective layers can include matte agents (organic or inorganic particles), “slip” agents, lubricants, pigments, “thermomeltable” particles, reinforcing agents, antistatic agents, conductive agents, coating aids, and tinting agents. It is particularly desired that the outermost protective layer have a dynamic coefficient of friction of less than 0.3 when the thermographic material is moved in contact and relative to an imaging means such as a thermal print-head (including an array of thermal print-heads). This “slip” property is usually provided by incorporating one or more lubricants into the outermost protective layer. The protective layer can include mixtures of lubricants such as one or more solid lubricants and one or more liquid lubricants.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0094">In some embodiments, the thermographic materials comprise an outermost protective layer on the imaging side that comprises two or more specific lubricants from designated classes of compounds. The protective layer provides both protective and transport (or “slip”) properties.

<p id="p-0106" num="0106">Generally speaking, a wax is a substance that is a solid at ambient temperature and that has a low viscosity at just above its melting point. Typically, a wax is a substance having the following properties: (1) crystalline to microcrystalline structure, (2) capacity to acquire gloss when rubbed (as distinct from greases), (3) capacity to produce pastes or gels with suitable solvents or when mixed with other waxes, (4) low viscosity at just above the melting point. See <i>Grant &amp; Hackh's Chemical Dictionary </i>(5<sup>th </sup>Edition), page 628, hereby incorporated by reference. Waxes differ from fats in that fats are esters of trihydric lower alcohols.</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0111">The total amount of lubricants in the protective layer is generally of from about 0.01 to about 1.5 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and preferably from about 0.1 to about 0.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0112">One or more binders may also be used in the protective layer. In preferred embodiments, polymeric thermoplastic binders are employed. Examples of such materials include but are not limited to, poly(styrene/acrylonitrile) (for example a 70/30 monomer weight ratio), polyvinyl butyral (available commercially as BUTVAR® B-79 or S-LEC® BL5Z or MOWITAL® SB45H), poly(vinyl alcohol-co-acetal), poly(vinyl alcohol-co-benzal), polystyrene, poly(vinyl acetate), cellulose acetate butyrate (available commercially as CAB 171-15), cellulose acetate propionate, cellulose acetate, ethyl cellulose, cellulose triacetate, poly(methyl methacrylate), and copolymers derived from methyl methacrylate. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the binder is CAB 171-15.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0113">The amount of the binder(s) present in the protective layer is generally in an amount of from about 50 to about 95 weight % of the total protective layer.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0114">The protective layer can also contain matting agents such as particles of starch, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, silica, calcium carbonate, and polymeric beads including beads of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,992,101 (Jelley et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 2,701,245 (Lynn). The matting agents can be composed of any useful material and may have an average size in relation to the protective layer thickness that enables at least some of them to protrude through the outer surface of the protective layer, as described for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,536,696 (noted above). If matting agents are present, they generally comprise from about 0.2 to about 10 dry weight % of the protective layer. It may be desirable that the outermost protective layer that is in contact with thermal imaging means has a dynamic coefficient of friction less than 0.3 as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,817,598 (noted above), incorporated herein by reference for the measurement of coefficient of friction. This may be accomplished with an appropriate use of lubricants and matting agents as one skilled in the art would readily understand.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0115">In particular, the outermost layers are generally formulated with one or more hydrophobic binders such as cellulose ester polymer binders. Of these binders, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, and cellulose acetate propionate are preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0116">If desired, the protective layers can include one or more polyisocyanate crosslinking agents to “harden” the layer(s). Useful polyisocyanate crosslinking agents are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,313,065 (noted above), U.S. Pat. No. 5,275,932 (noted above), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,548 (noted above), all incorporated herein by reference. Various catalysts such as tertiary amines can be used in combination with the polyisocyanates.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0117">Polymeric fluorinated surfactants may also be useful in the protective layer as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,468,603 (Kub).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0118">In addition, nanometer size particles can be used as reinforcing agents in the protective layer. Such particles are described in for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2004/0198602 (Pham) that is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0119">In general, the outermost protective layer has a dry thickness of from about 0.1 to about 10 μm. Preferably the protective layer dry thickness is from about 1 to about 6 μm, and more preferably, it is from about 2 to about 5 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0120">Alternatively, and preferably, the direct thermographic materials have two non-thermally sensitive protective layers on at least the imaging side of the support. These two protective layers are in direct contact with each other. The outermost (“first”) protective layer is farther from the support than the innermost (“second”) protective layer. The first protective layer is preferably the outermost layer of the thermographic material but it does not need to be if a desirable “slip” layer is applied over it. However, since the first protective layer contains predominantly all of the lubricants and matte agents used to facilitate transport during imaging, it can serve as the “slip” layer. The second protective layer is substantially free of lubricants and matte agents meaning that none are purposely incorporated therein but some may migrate from overlying or underlying layers.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0121">By locating the lubricants, matte agents, and other components desired to facilitate transport in the outermost (or “first”) protective layer, less lubricant can be used and still achieve the desired “slip” properties. It is particularly desired that the outermost (“first”) protective layer have a dynamic coefficient of friction of less than 0.3 when the thermographic material is moved in contact and relative to an imaging means such as a thermal print-head. This “slip” property is usually provided by incorporating one or more lubricants into the outermost protective layer. Mixtures of lubricants such as one or more solid lubricants and one or more liquid lubricants can be used. The dynamic coefficient of friction can be measured as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,817,598 (noted above).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0122">In duplitized thermographic materials, the same or different first and second protective layers can be disposed on both sides of the support as long as the first protective layer is farther from the support on both sides thereof and the second protective layer on both sides of the support is substantially free of lubricants and matte agents.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0123">When present, matting agents are preferably located in the first protective layer.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0124">In dual-protective layer constructions, the first protective layer has a dry thickness of from about 0.1 to about 5 μm, preferably from about 0.3 to about 3 μm, and more preferably, from about 1 to about 2 μm. The second protective layer generally has a dry thickness of from about 0.1 to about 5 μm, preferably from about 0.5 to about 4 μm, and more preferably, from about 1 to about 3 μm. The ratio of dry thickness of the first protective layer to the second protective layer is generally from about 1:20 to about 3:1 and preferably from about 1:10 to about 2:1.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0125">Additional details regarding direct thermographic materials having dual protective layers and their use can be found in copending and commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 11/166,309 (filed on even date herewith by Kenney, Baird, Kub, Ishida, and Ramsden, entitled “Direct Thermographic Materials with Dual Protective Layers”) that is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Non-Light Sensitive Adhesive Layer</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0126">The thermographic materials include a non-light sensitive adhesive layer between the support and one or more thermographic layers on each side of the support that includes thermographic layers. This adhesion layer is sometimes called a “carrier” layer when the non-light sensitive adhesion layer formulation is applied simultaneously with and “carries” the thermographic layer coating formulations onto the support. Details about such coating techniques and compositions of “carrier” layer formulations are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 6,436,622 (Geisler), incorporated herein by reference. Simultaneous multilayer coating using carrier layers is preferred in high-speed manufacturing processes. If the thermographic material is duplitized, the non-light sensitive adhesive layer can have the same or different composition and thickness on both sides of the support. For the remainder of this section, the term “carrier” layer will be used in reference to the non-light sensitive adhesive layer. In preferred embodiments, the carrier layer is the only layer between the support and the thermographic layers on either or both sides of the support. Thus, the carrier layer is directly disposed on the support without the use of additional primer or subbing layers and allows the support can be used in an “untreated” and “uncoated” form before application of the carrier layer and other layers.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0127">The carrier layer formulation comprises one or more polyisocyanate crosslinking agents dispersed within one or more hydrophobic crosslinkable polymer binders. Such crosslinking agents have at least two isocyanate groups that may or may not be blocked with groups that are readily displaced during the hardening or crosslinking action. Thus, by “polyisocyanate,” we mean to include “polyisocyanate precursor compounds.” The polyisocyanates can comprise aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, or aromatic groups, or a combination thereof. They are also intended to include “polymeric isocyanates” that are polymeric compounds having repeating isocyanate groups along the polymer backbone.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0128">As used herein, “aromatic” polyisocyanates are intended to include compounds having the isocyanate group attached directly to a carbocyclic aromatic group, while “aliphatic” and “cycloaliphatic” polyisocyanates, while they may contain aromatic groups, have the isocyanate group attached only to a fully saturated carbon atom. The aromatic polyisocyanates are preferred in the practice of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0129">More particularly, useful polyisocyanate crosslinking agents can be represented by the following Structure (I):

wherein L is a linking group comprising an alkylene group having at least 6 carbon atoms, a cycloalkylene group, or an arylene group, and m is an integer of at least 1 (preferably, 1, 2, or 3, and more preferably 1 or 2). L can also include any combination of one or more alkylene, cycloalkylene, or arylene groups that are separated by hetero linking groups such as oxy, carbonyl, thio, sulfonyl, sulfonamido, imino, and isocyanurate groups as long as such groups do not adversely affect the crosslinking function of the polyisocyanate (for example, cause crosslinking of the polyisocyanate with itself).
</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0130">By “alkylene” group, we mean substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon chains having 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the chain wherein possible substituents include alkoxy, isocyanurate, and other groups that would not adversely affect the compound's crosslinking function. Preferably, the substituted or unsubstituted alkylene group has 6 to 12 carbon atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0131">By “cycloalkylene” group, we mean a substituted or unsubstituted cyclic hydrocarbon chain having 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the chain wherein possible substituents include alkoxy and other groups that would not adversely affect the compounds crosslinking function.

<p id="p-0132" num="0132">By “arylene” group, we mean a substituted or unsubstituted carbocyclic aromatic group such as a substituted or unsubstituted phenylene, biphenylene, or naphthylene group having one or more substituents that would not adversely affect the compounds crosslinking function.

<p id="p-0136" num="0148">The polyisocyanate crosslinking agent is generally present in an amount of at least 10%, preferably from about 10 to about 75%, and more preferably from about 10% to about 30%, based on the dry weight of the hydrophobic crosslinkable polymer binders in the carrier layer coating formulation. The choice and amount of polyisocyanate is dependent upon the type and amount of crosslinkable polymer binders in the carrier layer as well as the rate of crosslinking desired.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0149">To enhance crosslinking of the polymer binders, the carrier layer may also include one or more “catalysts” that are known to accelerate the rate of reaction. Such compounds include, but are not limited to, tertiary amines such as DESMORAPID® PP and diazabicyclooctane (DABCO) and transition metal catalysts such as dibutyltin laurate, bismuth neodecanoate and zinc octanoate. Such catalysts can be present in an amount of at least 0.004 g/g of polyisocyanate, and preferably from about 0.001 to about 0.01 g/g of polyisocyanate.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0150">The hydrophobic crosslinkable binders in the carrier layer are water-insoluble polymers that have active sites that will react with an isocyanate group. Such reactive sites include substituents with reactive hydrogen atoms, such as hydroxy groups, thiol groups, carboxy groups, amino groups, amido groups, and other groups readily apparent to one skilled in polymer chemistry. Examples of useful hydrophobic crosslinkable polymer binders include, but are not limited to, polyvinyl acetal resins (such as polyvinyl butyral), cellulosic polymers, polyesters, polycarbonates, epoxy resins, rosin polymers, polyketone resins, vinyl polymers, maleic anhydride ester copolymers. Such polymers can be obtained from several commercial sources or prepared using known starting materials and reaction conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0151">Preferably, the carrier layer comprises a single-phase mixture of two or more different hydrophobic polymer binders that include a “first” polymer serving to promote adhesion of the carrier layer to the polymeric support, and a “second” polymer. In such embodiments, the first polymer can be a polyvinyl acetal, cellulosic polymer, polyester, polycarbonate, epoxy resin, rosin polymer, polyketone resin, vinyl polymer, or maleic anhydride ester copolymer, and the second polymer can be a polyvinyl acetal resin, cellulosic resin, vinyl polymer, or maleic anhydride-ester copolymer. More preferably, the first polymer is a polyester and the second polymer is a polyvinyl acetal or a cellulosic polymer. Upon coating and drying, crosslinking occurs by reaction of the polyisocyanate with active sites on at least one of the two or more polymer binders.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0152">It is also desirable that the second polymer be compatible with the film-forming polymer binder(s) of the one or more thermographic layers. For example, the thermographic layers and the carrier layer independently can contain at least one polyvinyl acetal or cellulosic polymer binder.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0153">Representative “second” polymers include polyvinyl acetals, cellulosic polymers, vinyl polymers (as defined above for the “first” polymer), acrylate and methacrylate polymers, and maleic anhydride-ester copolymers. The most preferred “second” polymers are polyvinyl acetals (such as polyvinyl butyral) and cellulosic ester polymers (such as cellulose acetate, cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose acetate propionate, hydroxymethyl cellulose, cellulose nitrate, and cellulose acetate butyrate). Polyvinyl butyral is a particularly preferred second polymer. Of course, mixtures of these second polymers can be used in the carrier layer. These second polymers are also soluble or dispersible in the organic solvents described above.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0154">The weight ratio of “first” polymer to “second” polymer in the carrier layer is generally from about 1:9 to about 1:1, and preferably from about 2:8 to about 4:6. A most preferred polymer combination is of polyester and polyvinyl butyral having a weight ratio of about 3:7.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0155">The carrier layer is generally coated out of one or more miscible organic solvents including, but not limited to, methyl ethyl ketone (2-butanone, MEK), acetone, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol, or any mixture of any two or more of these solvents.</p>

No. 6,689,546 (LaBelle et al.), and in copending and commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 10/930,428 (filed Aug. 31, 2004 by Ludemann, LaBelle, Koestner, Hefley, Bhave, Geisler, and Philip), U.S. Ser. No. 10/930,438 (filed Aug. 31, 2004 by Ludemann, LaBelle, Philip, Koestner, and Bhave), U.S. Ser. No. 10/978,205 (filed Oct. 29, 2004 by Ludemann, LaBelle, Koestner, and Chen), U.S. Ser. No. 10/999,858 (filed Nov. 30, 2004 Ludemann, Koestner, LaBelle, and Philip), and U.S. Ser. No. 11/000,115 (filed Nov. 30, 2004 by Ludemann, LaBelle, Philip, and Geisler). All of the above patents and patent applications are incorporated herein by reference. Particularly useful backside conductive layers and their formulations are described in more detail below. Several conductive metal antimonates are commercially available from Nissan Chemical Industry, Ltd. (Japan) under the tradename CELNAX® CXZ-401M. The metal antimonate particles in the conductive layer are predominately (more than 50% by weight of total particles) in the form of non-acicular particles as opposed to “acicular” particles. By “non-acicular” particles is meant not needlelike, that is, not acicular. Preferably the metal antimonate is zinc antimonate (ZnSb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0171">The conductive layer also includes one or more binder materials that are usually polymers that are generally soluble or dispersible in the organic solvents noted above. Polyvinyl acetals, polyesters, cellulosic ester polymers, and vinyl polymers such as polyvinyl acetate and polyvinyl chloride are particularly preferred, and the polyvinyl acetals, polyesters, and cellulosic ester polymers are more preferred. Blends of these various polymers can also be used to advantage in the conductive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0172">The conductive layer is generally coated out of one or more miscible organic solvents including, but not limited to, methyl ethyl ketone (2-butanone, MEK), acetone, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol, or any mixture of any two or more of these solvents. Alternatively, the conductive layer can be coated using aqueous solvents and hydrophilic binder or a polymer latex.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0173">In addition to the conductive particles described above, other conductive materials may be present in a buried conductive backside layer or other backside layers. Such compositions include fluorochemicals that are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,699,648 (Sakizadeh et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,762,013 (Sakizadeh et al.). Both of these patents are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0174">Layers to promote adhesion of one layer to another in thermographic materials are also known, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,891,610 (Bauer et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,804,365 (Bauer et al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 4,741,992 (Przezdziecki). Adhesion can also be promoted using specific polymeric adhesive materials as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,928,857 (Geisler et al.).</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0175">Layer formulations described herein can be coated by various coating procedures including wire wound rod coating, dip coating, air knife coating, curtain coating, slide coating, or extrusion coating using hoppers of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,681,294 (Beguin). The formulations can be coated one at a time and dried before application of another layer. Preferably, two or more formulations can be coated simultaneously by coating the multiple layers on top of a first applied layer while that layer is still wet using the same or different coating fluids or solvent mixtures using the procedures described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,761,791 (Russell), U.S. Pat. No. 4,001,024 (Dittman et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 4,569,863 (Keopke et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,340,613 (Hanzalik et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,405,740 (LaBelle), U.S. Pat. No. 5,415,993 (Hanzalik et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,525,376 (Leonard), U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,608 (Kessel et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,849,363 (Yapel et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,530 (Jerry et al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,861,195 (Bhave et al.), and GB 837,095 (Ilford). Simultaneous multiple layer slide coating is particularly preferred (for example the crosslinked adhesion-promoting carrier layer, the non-photosensitive thermographic imaging layer, and the one or more protective layers described above).</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0176">A typical wet coating thickness for the emulsion layer can be from about 10 to about 200 μm, and the layer can be dried in forced air at a temperature of from about 20° C. to about 100° C. The coated materials can be dried in forced air at a temperature of from about 20° C. to about 100° C. It is preferred that the thickness of the layer be selected to provide maximum image densities greater than about 0.2, and more preferably, from about 0.5 to 5.0 or more, as measured by an X-rite Model 361/V Densitometer equipped with 301 Visual Optics.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Imaging/Development</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0177">The direct thermographic materials can be imaged in any suitable manner consistent with the type of material using any suitable source of thermal energy. The image may be “written” simultaneously with development at a suitable temperature using a thermal stylus, a thermal print-head (including an array of thermal print-heads), or a laser, or by heating the material as it is moved while in contact with a heat absorbing material. The thermographic materials may include a dye (such as an IR-absorbing dye) to facilitate direct development by exposure to laser radiation. The dye converts absorbed radiation to heat. Thermal development is carried out with the materials being in a substantially water-free environment and without application of any solvent to the materials.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Use as a Photomask</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0178">The direct thermographic materials are sufficiently transmissive in the range of from about 350 to about 450 nm in non-imaged areas to allow their use in a method where there is a subsequent exposure of an ultraviolet or short wavelength visible radiation sensitive imageable medium. For example, imaging and development of the materials affords a visible image. The thermographic materials absorb ultraviolet or short wavelength visible radiation in the areas where there is a visible image and transmit ultraviolet or short wavelength visible radiation where there is no visible image. The materials may then be used as a mask and positioned between a source of imaging radiation (such as an ultraviolet or short wavelength visible radiation energy source) and an imageable material that is sensitive to such imaging radiation, such as a photopolymer, diazo material, photoresist, or photosensitive printing plate. Exposing the imageable material to the imaging radiation through the visible image in the thermographic material provides an image in the imageable material. This method is particularly useful where the imageable medium comprises a printing plate and the thermographic material serves as an imagesetting film.</p>

<p id="p-0185" num="0197">The adhesion to the support of thermographic coatings was measured using a “cross-hatch” adhesion test performed according to ASTM D3359-92A. Non-imaged thermographic samples as well as thermographic samples that had been imaged to a Dmax greater than 3 were evaluated. Frontside coatings were cut with a razor blade in a cross-hatched pattern, a 1 inch (2.54 cm) wide piece of commercially available 3M Type 610 semi-transparent pressure-sensitive tape was placed on the pattern and then quickly lifted off. The amount of coating removed from the film is the measure of adhesion. The adhesion test ratings are from 0 to 5 where 0 refers to complete removal of the coating and 5 refers none or very little coating removed. A rating of “2” or greater is considered to be acceptable for developed samples. 3M Type 610 semi-transparent pressure-sensitive tape was obtained from 3M Company (Maplewood, Minn.).</p>

<p id="p-0211" num="0223">Each of the carrier layer, thermographic emulsion layer, and protective layer formulations were simultaneously coated onto 7 mil (178 μm) blue tinted polyethylene terephthalate support using a precision multilayer slide coater equipped with an in-line dryer. The coatings were dried at 185° F. (85° C.) for about five minutes. The dried coating weight of the carrier layer was 0.05 g/ft<sup>2 </sup>(0.54 g/m<sup>2</sup>). The dried coating weight of the single thermographic layer was 1.55 g/ft<sup>2 </sup>(16.68 g/m<sup>2</sup>). The dried coating weight of the outermost protective layer was 0.4 g/ft<sup>2 </sup>(4.31 g/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0224">The resulting thermographic sheets were imaged with an AGFA DryStar™ Model 2000. Sheets were developed to Dmax of greater than 3.0 and compared with an unprocessed sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0225">The results, shown below in TABLE II, demonstrate that Invention Samples 1-2 and 1-3 incorporating isocyanate in the carrier layer show a surprising increase in Dmax (that is, improved silver efficiency) when compared with Comparative Sample 1-1 that does not incorporate isocyanate. Similarly, Invention Samples 1-4 through 1-9 incorporating isocyanate in the carrier layer show also show an increase in Dmax with increasing amount of isocyanate added to the carrier layer.</p>
