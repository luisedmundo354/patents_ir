<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an imaging sensor system and, more particularly, to an imaging sensor system that images in two or more spectral bands.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An imaging sensor system forms an image of a target on an imaging sensor. The imaging sensor converts the incident light image to electrical or optical signals for further processing such as pattern recognition functions. The imaging sensor system is distinct from a non-imaging sensor system, which reacts to the presence of the target but does not form an image of the target.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One potential application of imaging sensor systems is the detection of buried anti-personnel or anti-vehicle explosive mines. Such explosive mines, if undetected, may pose a hazard long after an area is otherwise thought to be safe for use. Once detected, such explosive mines may be neutralized or avoided, in the course of preparing the mined area for subsequent use.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The buried explosive mines may be detected based upon the spectral differences in the thermal emissivities of disturbed and undisturbed soils. One technique based upon this principle is to image the area being searched in two infrared wavelengths. The images are mathematically processed using appropriate algorithms to establish the presence of disturbed soil, which in turn suggests the possible presence of a buried explosive mine.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One approach to performing this explosive-mine detection based upon thermal emissivity differences requires the optical alignment of multiple sets of optics and the calibration of the imaging sensors. Such alignment and calibration are difficult to perform initially, and it is difficult to keep the multiple sets of optics aligned and calibrated during service. Further, the available apparatus is bulky and expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is a need for an improved approach to the detection of buried explosive mines using the differences in the emissivities of disturbed and undisturbed soils, and for other applications that image light in two different spectral bands. The present invention fulfills this need, and further provides related advantages.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides an imaging sensor system that simultaneously images in two different spectral bands a light beam traveling on a light path from a target. Only a single common optics and a single common imaging sensor are required for imaging the two different spectral bands. The use of common optics and a common imaging sensor avoids the need to align the optics and maintain the optics in alignment, and the need to calibrate and maintain the relative calibration of two different imaging sensors. The imaging sensor system is also compact and light in weight. The imaging sensor system may be extended to more than two different spectral bands by extensions of the present approach, the use of filters, and the like. In an application of interest, the detection of buried explosive mines, the reduced size and weight, and the reduced requirements for alignment and calibration are important advantages because the application requires that the apparatus be used in a rugged environment by relatively unskilled personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with the invention, an imaging sensor system images in two different spectral bands a light beam traveling on a light path from a target. (As used here, a “spectral band” may refer to a single discrete wavelength or to a range of wavelengths.) The sensor system comprises an imaging sensor operable to image light of the two different spectral bands, and a common optics having at least one reflective or refractive optical element. That is, the light beam of each of the two different spectral bands from the target reaching the imaging sensor encounters each optical element of the common optics. A wavelength-selective beamsplitter lies on the light path between the target and the imaging sensor. The wavelength-selective beamsplitter splits the light beam into two subbeams, one subbeam for each of the two different spectral bands, that are respectively incident upon two different locations of the imaging sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The imaging sensor is preferably a single common imaging sensor that images the light of the two different spectral bands. Two different imaging sensors may be used, but this embodiment is less desirable because it increases the difficulties in calibrating the two imaging sensors and maintaining that calibration during service.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The wavelength-selective beamsplitter preferably comprises a dichroic reflector having a mirror and a wavelength-selective dichroic element. The mirror is desirably a planar mirror having a mirror plane, and the wavelength-selective dichroic element is preferably a planar wavelength-selective dichroic reflector having a dichroic plane. In this embodiment, the mirror plane is not parallel to the dichroic plane. In operation, the wavelength-selective dichroic element reflects a first wavelength to a first location on the imaging sensor and passes the second wavelength to the mirror. The mirror reflects the second wavelength to a second location on the imaging sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The common optics and the wavelength-selective beamsplitter may be positioned in any operable relation. In the preferred embodiment, the wavelength-selective beamsplitter lies on the light path between the target and the common optics. There is also preferably a sensor window positioned such that the light path passes through the sensor window before it encounters the wavelength-selective beamsplitter, the common optics, and the imaging sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One of the problems that can occur in some imaging sensor systems is that stray light may enter the sensor system to cause ghost images. To avoid such ghost images, there may be an external light baffle positioned such that the light path encounters the light baffle before it passes through the sensor window. An internal baffle may be used instead of or in addition to the external baffle. Spectral filters that individually pass only the spectral bands of interest to the imaging sensor may also be employed. The spectral filters block any stray light that is not of the respective spectral bands of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">There is typically provided a mount that supports the imaging sensor, the common optics, and the wavelength-selective beamsplitter, as well as any other components such as the light baffle(s) and the spectral filters. The application of most current interest is the use of the imaging sensor system to detect buried explosive mines based upon the thermal emissivity differences of disturbed and undisturbed soils. For that application, the mount supports the imaging sensor, the common optics, and the wavelength-selective beamsplitter, as well as any other components, in an orientation so that the target is on or in the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A method for detecting buried explosive mines comprises the steps of providing an imaging sensor system as described above, aiming the imaging sensor system toward the ground such that the target is on or in the ground, and analyzing images produced by the two subbeams on the imaging sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present approach provides an imaging sensor system that images the target in two different spectral bands for subsequent analysis. By using a wavelength-selective beamsplitter, common optics and a common imaging sensor may be used. The use of the common optics avoids the alignment problems associated with separate optics for each spectral band. The use of the common imaging sensor avoids the calibration problems associated with separate sensors for each spectral band. The present approach also allows a significant reduction in the size and weight of the two-spectral-band imaging sensor system.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of the preferred embodiment, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention. The scope of the invention is not, however, limited to this preferred embodiment.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> schematically depict an imaging sensor system <b>20</b> that images a light beam <b>22</b> traveling in two (or more) different spectral bands λ<b>1</b> and λ<b>2</b> on a light path <b>24</b> from a target <b>26</b>. The “spectral bands” λ<b>1</b> and λ<b>2</b> may each refer to a single discrete wavelength or to a range of wavelengths, and there may be other wavelengths present in the light beam <b>22</b> as well. The spectral bands λ<b>1</b> and λ<b>2</b> may be in any range, such as the ultraviolet, visible, or infrared, but are preferably in the infrared for the applications of most interest.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The sensor system <b>20</b> includes an imaging sensor <b>28</b> operable to image respective light subbeams <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the respective different spectral bands λ<b>1</b> and λ<b>2</b>. The imaging sensor <b>28</b> preferably includes at least one focal plane array <b>30</b>, and preferably exactly one focal plane array <b>30</b>. If exactly one focal plane array <b>30</b> is used, that focal plane array <b>30</b> must be capable of imaging light of both spectral bands λ<b>1</b>, and λ<b>2</b>. The use of exactly one focal plane array <b>30</b> is preferred for use as a common imaging sensor, as it is not necessary to calibrate two different focal plane arrays which may have different performance characteristics. In this case, the respective light subbeams <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>of spectral bands λ<b>1</b> and λ<b>2</b> are imaged as respective images <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b </i>onto respective different focal plane array parts <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the common imaging sensor <b>28</b>, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The two images may be immediately adjacent, or there may be a non-imaging stripe <b>31</b> separating the two images <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b </i>to ensure that there is no overlap of the images <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The imaging sensor system <b>20</b> further includes a common optics <b>32</b> having at least one powered reflective or refractive optical element <b>34</b>, indicated schematically as a single lens <b>36</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and as a practical set of four lenses <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The common optics <b>32</b> may include any operable combination of reflective and/or refractive optical elements <b>34</b> that image the light beam <b>22</b> from the target <b>26</b> onto the imaging sensor <b>28</b>. In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, the common optics <b>32</b> is integrated with the imaging sensor <b>28</b> into a single unit. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref> respectively illustrate the beam paths of the two spectral bands λ<b>1</b> and λ<b>2</b> for a single physical embodiment of the structure.)</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">By “common optics” is meant that a respective light subbeam <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>of each of the two different spectral bands λ<b>1</b> and λ<b>2</b> from the target <b>26</b> reaching the imaging sensor <b>28</b> encounter, that is, either reflect from (in the case of reflective optical elements <b>34</b>) or are refracted by (in the case of refractive optical elements <b>34</b>, as illustrated), each optical element <b>34</b> of the common optics <b>32</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the light subbeams <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>need not, and typically do not, encounter exactly the same locations of the optical elements <b>34</b> of the common optics <b>32</b> in each case, but they do encounter each of the optical elements <b>34</b>. Consequently, it is not necessary to align initially, and to maintain in alignment during service, two different sets of optical elements.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A wavelength-selective beamsplitter <b>46</b> is disposed on the light path <b>24</b> between the target <b>26</b> and the imaging sensor <b>28</b>. In the illustrated preferred embodiment, the wavelength-selective beamsplitter <b>46</b> lies on the light path <b>24</b> between the target <b>26</b> and the common optics <b>32</b>, but it could, for example, lie between the common optics <b>32</b> and the imaging sensor <b>28</b>, or between elements of the common optics <b>32</b>. The wavelength-selective beamsplitter <b>46</b> splits the light beam <b>22</b> into the two light subbeams <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>that are incident upon two different locations of the imaging sensor <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The wavelength-selective beamsplitter <b>46</b> preferably comprises a dichroic reflector <b>47</b> having a mirror <b>48</b> and a wavelength-selective dichroic element <b>50</b>, arranged so that the light path <b>24</b> from the target <b>26</b> encounters the wavelength-selective dichroic element <b>50</b> before it encounters the mirror <b>48</b>. Dichroic elements <b>50</b> are known for other applications, and are typically fabricated by depositing a stack of thin layers on a transparent substrate. The dichroic element <b>50</b> reflects light of a first spectral band and passes light of a second spectral band. The mirror <b>48</b> is preferably a planar mirror having a mirror plane M, and the wavelength-selective dichroic element <b>50</b> is planar having a dichroic plane D. The mirror plane M is not parallel to the dichroic plane P, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref> illustrate the operation of the preferred wavelength-selective beamsplitter <b>46</b> using the dichroic reflector <b>47</b>. The common light beam <b>22</b>, including light of both spectral bands λ<b>1</b> and λ<b>2</b>, encounters the dichroic reflector <b>47</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the light of spectral band λ<b>1</b> reflects from the dichroic element <b>50</b>. The light subbeam <b>22</b><i>a </i>of spectral band λ<b>1</b> is focused by the common optics <b>32</b> onto the imaging sensor <b>28</b> as the first image <b>29</b><i>a</i>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the light subbeam <b>22</b><i>b </i>of spectral band λ<b>2</b> passes through the dichroic element <b>50</b>, is reflected from the mirror <b>48</b>, and again passes through the dichroic element <b>50</b>. Because the mirror plane M is not parallel to the dichroic plane P, there is a resulting spatial separation of the light subbeam <b>22</b><i>b </i>from the light subbeam <b>22</b><i>a</i>. The light subbeam <b>22</b><i>b </i>is focused by the common optics <b>32</b> onto the imaging sensor <b>28</b> as the second image <b>29</b><i>b</i>, which is spatially separated from the first image <b>29</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The angles of the mirror <b>48</b> and the dichroic element <b>50</b> may be altered so that the first light subbeam <b>22</b><i>a </i>is reflected to another area, such as the lower part of the imaging sensor <b>28</b> in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and the second light subbeam <b>22</b><i>b </i>is reflected to another area, such as the upper part of the imaging sensor <b>28</b> in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The imaging sensor <b>28</b>, the common optics <b>32</b>, and the wavelength-selective beamsplitter <b>46</b> are preferably packaged in the interior of a housing <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>). The housing <b>52</b> protects these components from the external environment, and also provides a convenient structure to hold the components in the proper positions and orientations. To transmit the light beam <b>22</b> into the interior of the housing <b>52</b>, a sensor window <b>54</b> is positioned such that the light path <b>24</b> passes through the sensor window <b>54</b> before it encounters the wavelength-selective beamsplitter <b>46</b>, the common optics <b>32</b>, and the imaging sensor <b>28</b>. There may additionally be a mount <b>56</b> that supports the housing <b>52</b> (where used), the imaging sensor <b>28</b>, the common optics <b>32</b>, and the wavelength-selective beamsplitter <b>46</b> in an orientation of interest for the particular application. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, the mount <b>56</b> is affixed to the housing <b>52</b> and may be selectively adjusted to point the imaging sensor system <b>20</b> at any target <b>26</b> of interest. For the application of most current interest as described in the Background, the detection of buried explosive mines, the mount <b>56</b> is structured to point the imaging sensor system <b>20</b> at targets <b>26</b> that are on or in the ground. That is, the target <b>26</b> in this application is typically soil, and particularly the disturbed soil that is above a buried explosive mine.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The presence of the two reflective elements, the mirror <b>48</b> and the dichroic element <b>50</b>, raises the possibility of ghost images reaching the imaging sensor <b>28</b>. That is, referring to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, some light of spectral band λ<b>2</b> (or other wavelengths) could be reflected to the location of the first image <b>29</b><i>a</i>, and/or some light of spectral band λ<b>1</b> (or other wavelengths) could be reflected to the location of the second image <b>29</b><i>b</i>, in each case possibly causing incorrect interpretations of the images. To minimize such ghost images, a light baffle <b>58</b> may be positioned such that any light paths that may cause ghost images are physically blocked from reaching the imaging sensor <b>28</b>. The light baffle <b>58</b> may be inside or outside of the housing <b>52</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref> illustrate light baffles <b>58</b> positioned exterior to the housing <b>52</b> so that the stray light paths encounter the light baffles <b>58</b> before they pass through the sensor window <b>54</b>. The housing <b>52</b> and the internal structure within the housing <b>52</b> may also serve as baffles to block stray light paths.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">To further reduce the stray light, a spectral filter <b>60</b> including individual spectral filters <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>is preferably placed in front of the imaging sensor <b>28</b>, so that the spectral filter <b>60</b> lies between the target <b>26</b> and the imaging sensor <b>28</b>, and most preferably so that the spectral filter <b>60</b> lies between the dichroic reflector <b>47</b> and the imaging sensor <b>28</b>. The spectral filter <b>60</b> intercepts the light beam <b>22</b> before it reaches the imaging sensor <b>28</b>. The spectral filters <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>are selected to pass only the respective spectral bands λ<b>1</b> and λ<b>2</b>, and not pass other wavelengths that might be present in any stray light.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a prior art approach that is not within the scope of the present invention. Light beams <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b </i>from a target <b>72</b> pass through filters <b>74</b><i>a </i>and <b>74</b><i>b </i>to achieve wavelength separation, through separate optics <b>76</b><i>a </i>and <b>76</b><i>b</i>, and thence to separate imaging sensors <b>78</b><i>a </i>and <b>78</b><i>b</i>. Each of the light beams <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b </i>do not encounter each optical element of the separate optics <b>76</b><i>a </i>and <b>76</b><i>b</i>. The approach of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> requires that the separate optics <b>76</b><i>a </i>and <b>76</b><i>b </i>be aligned and maintained in alignment with their respective imaging sensors <b>78</b><i>a </i>and <b>78</b><i>b</i>, and that the imaging sensors <b>78</b><i>a </i>and <b>78</b><i>b </i>be calibrated and maintained in calibration with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The application of the imaging sensor system <b>20</b> of most current interest is the detection of explosive mines that are buried in the ground. In this application, the imaging sensor system <b>20</b> as described herein is aimed toward the ground such that the target <b>26</b> is on or in the ground, and the images <b>29</b><i>a </i>and <b>29</b><i>b </i>produced by the two subbeams <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>of respective spectral bands λ<b>1</b> and λ<b>2</b> on the imaging sensor <b>28</b> are analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present approach has been reduced to practice. The prototype performs in the manner discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Although a particular embodiment of the invention has been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications and enhancements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited except as by the appended claims.</p>
