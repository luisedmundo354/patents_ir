<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention concerns nonvolatile charge-trapping memory devices with increased cell density and preferred production methods of such devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Nonvolatile memory cells that are electrically programmable and erasable can be realized as charge-trapping memory cells, which comprise a memory layer sequence of dielectric materials with a memory layer between confinement layers of dielectric material having a larger energy band gap than the memory layer. The memory layer sequence is arranged between a channel region within a semiconductor body and a gate electrode provided to control the channel by means of an applied electric voltage. Charge carriers moving from source to a drain through the channel region are accelerated and gain enough energy to be able to penetrate the lower confinement layer and to be trapped within the memory layer. Alternatively, the application of a high gate voltage enables charge carriers to tunnel through the lower confinement layer and to be trapped in the memory layer. The trapped charge carriers change the threshold voltage of the cell transistor structure. Different programming states can be read by applying the appropriate reading voltages. Examples of charge-trapping memory cells are the SONOS memory cells, in which each confinement layer is an oxide and the memory layer is a nitride of the semiconductor material, usually silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typical applications of memory products require a steady miniaturization of the memory cells. A reduction of the area that is required by an individual memory cell can be obtained by shrinking the cell structure or by an increase of the number of bits that can be stored within one memory cell transistor structure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the publication of Suk-Kang Sung et al.: “Fabrication and Program/Erase Characteristics of 30-nm SONOS Nonvolatile Memory Devices” in IEEE Transactions of Nanotechnology 2, 258-264 (2003), which is incorporated herein by reference, the fabrication of SONOS nonvolatile memory devices is described, which comprises a process sequence of a sidewall patterning technique. A layer sequence of silicon, silicon dioxide, and silicon nitride is provided, and the silicon nitride is laterally confined by an etching step. A layer of amorphous silicon is applied conformally all over the surface. An anisotropic etching produces a sidewall spacer adjacent to the silicon nitride layer. The nitride is removed, and the remaining spacer is used as a mask to structure the silicon dioxide layer. The silicon dioxide structure is then used to etch the pattern into the silicon layer. This process sequence is applied to fabricate SONOS memory devices on SOI substrates. A narrow silicon channel with 30 nm width was defined using the sidewall patterning technique. A memory layer sequence of oxide, nitride, and oxide was applied, on which a 100 nm thick polysilicon layer was deposited as gate material. The gate electrode was also patterned by means of the sidewalls patterning technique.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The publication of K. G. Anil et al.: “Layout Density Analysis of FinFETs” in Proceedings of the 33rd European Solid-State Device Research, pp. 139-142, which is incorporated herein by reference, describes FinFETs with either direct patterning or spacer patterning of the active area. The spacer lithography is especially applied to increase the effective device width of the FinFETs. An optimization of the aspect ratio is also discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The publication of M. Specht et al.: “Sub-40 nm tri-gate charge trapping nonvolatile memory cells for high-density applications” in VLSI, 2004 Symposium on VLSI Technology, pp. 244-245, which is incorporated herein by reference, describes tri-gate charge-trapping nonvolatile memory cells in a NAND-type array. The channel region is located on three sides of a silicon fin, which is bridged by a wordline to form the triple gate having a length in the range from 30 nm to 80 nm.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the present invention provides a nonvolatile memory device with increased cell density comprising charge-trapping memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further aspect, the invention provides means to integrate two memory transistors within the minimal lithography dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In still a further aspect, this invention provides a special production method for the inventive device structures.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The charge-trapping memory cell according to a preferred embodiment of this invention comprises a semiconductor substrate with a main surface carrying a plurality of parallel fins provided as bitlines and arranged at a distance of down to about 40 nm from one another, the fins having a lateral dimension with respect to the main surface of less than about 30 nm and being subdivided into a plurality of disjointed pairs of adjacent first and second fins. A memory layer sequence is provided for charge-trapping and arranged on surfaces of the fins. A plurality of parallel wordlines are arranged at a distance from one another across the fins, and source/drain regions are located in the fins between the wordlines and at the ends of the fins. There are contact areas of the source/drain regions at the ends of the fins, each contact area being common to the fins of one of the pairs. A first plurality of select transistors is located in the first fins between the plurality of wordlines and the contact areas, and a second plurality of select transistors is located in the second fins between the plurality of wordlines and the contact areas. Select lines are provided that connect the first plurality of select transistors, and further select lines are provided that connect the second plurality of select transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferred embodiments comprise first and second pluralities of select transistors at both ends of the fins, at least some of the select transistors being normally-on transistors. It is advantageous that the fins can be formed in bulk substrate material. The contact areas are preferably located in self-aligned fashion between the first and second fin of the respective pair of fins and laterally limited by the fins.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The method for production of a charge-trapping memory cell according to the invention comprises the following steps: a hard mask layer and a sacrificial layer are applied onto a main surface of a semiconductor substrate; a resist mask that covers parallel strips on the sacrificial layer is formed; the sacrificial layer is etched by means of the resist mask, leaving sacrificial strips, after which the resist mask is removed; a layer of a spacer material is conformally deposited and etched back to form sidewall spacers at lateral sides of the sacrificial strips; a further resist mask is applied to cover striplike areas of the main surface running transversely across the sacrificial strips; the sacrificial strips are removed except for parts that are covered by the further resist mask, which is then removed; the hard mask layer is etched using the spacers and remaining parts of the sacrificial strips as a mask; the substrate is then etched by means of the hard mask layer as a mask to form parallel fins; a dielectric material is deposited in spaces between the fins and removed as well as the hard mask layer from the fins; a further resist mask comprising openings in areas of intended select transistors is formed; an implantation of a dopant is performed in these areas according to a desired threshold voltage of the select transistors; a memory layer sequence of dielectric materials provided for charge-trapping is deposited; and an electrically conductive material is deposited and structured, which is provided for wordlines running transversely over the fins and for select lines across the areas of the select transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following brief description of the drawings, detailed description and appended claims and drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a plan view onto the arrangement of wordlines and bitlines and the locations of the memory cells. The memory cells are situated in fins <b>10</b>, which are ranged in parallel at a distance from one another. In the preferred embodiment, the distance is down to about 40 nm so that two cell transistors occupy the area of only 4F<sup>2</sup>. The fins are provided as bitlines and each comprise select transistors so that every memory cell can be addressed individually. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the select lines <b>13</b> leading to the select transistors <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>' that are arranged at the ends of the fins <b>10</b> in source/drain regions <b>51</b>. Transistors <b>14</b> are normally-on select transistors enabling a current flow through the channel even if the gate voltage V<sub>g</sub>=0. Transistors <b>14</b>' are standard select transistors with no current if V<sub>g</sub>=0.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0045">Between the select lines <b>13</b>, there is a plurality of wordlines <b>12</b> parallel to the select lines and to one another, which are provided to address the individual memory transistors. The contact areas <b>11</b> of the fins <b>10</b> are preferably arranged self-aligned to the fins <b>10</b>. The extremely reduced dimension of the fins is achieved by means of the spacer technology according to the publications mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0046">The features of the charge-trapping memory cells will be further explained by the description of an especially adapted production method. This process is integrated in the standard CMOS process, including the preparation of the substrate with n-doped and p-doped wells. Shallow trench isolations are formed where necessary.</p>

A resist mask <b>4</b> is formed on the sacrificial layer <b>3</b> and may be trimmed into the shape shown by dashed lines.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the structure of the resist mask <b>4</b> in a plan view. The dashed lines show the limits of the mask openings after an optional trimming of the resist to obtain smaller resist strips.

The remaining parts of the sacrificial layer <b>3</b> are strips having the lateral dimensions indicated by the vertical dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a cross-section according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> after the application of a layer <b>50</b> of spacer material. This layer is conformally deposited on the whole surface so that its thickness is essentially uniform. The dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> show the limits of the intended sidewall spacers. These spacers are produced in the way which is known per se by an anisotropic etching in the vertical direction. This anisotropic etching reduces the thickness of the layer <b>50</b> uniformly in the direction perpendicular to the main surface of the substrate <b>1</b>. The sections of the layer <b>50</b> which are adjacent to the strips of the sacrificial layer <b>3</b> have comparatively larger vertical dimensions so that after the etching, which is performed down to the surface of the hard mask layer <b>2</b>, only sidewall spacers of the indicated shape remain.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the cross-section according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> after the anisotropic etching of the spacers <b>5</b>. The spacers <b>5</b> have a width, which is much smaller than a corresponding dimension, which is obtained by standard lithography. The spacers <b>5</b> are then used as a mask to etch trenches into the hard mask layer <b>2</b> and the substrate <b>1</b>, which are indicated with dashed lines in the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The remaining semiconductor material between the trenches forms the fins in the substrate <b>1</b>. The spacer material is preferably silicon oxide. If the hard mask layer is nitride, the hard mask layer and the semiconductor substrate can be etched selectively to the oxide of the spacers <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a diagrammatical plan view onto an intermediate product, before the remaining parts of the sacrificial layer <b>3</b> are removed. A further resist mask <b>6</b> is applied to the surface, which covers the regions provided for the contact areas of the fins. Therefore, when the sacrificial layer <b>3</b> is removed between the spacers <b>5</b>, it is left in the areas that are provided for the contact areas. After the removal of the rest of the sacrificial layer <b>3</b> and the hard mask layer <b>2</b>, the surface of the substrate <b>1</b> is structured into fins running parallel to one another and being arranged at a distance from one another, disjointed pairs of two neighboring fins being connected by the semiconductor material of the contact areas. The trenches between the fins are thus limited to the regions outside the contact areas. The semiconductor material of the substrate <b>1</b> has been doped to a suitable depth to form separate electrically conductive bitlines along the fins. Therefore, each pair of fins can be addressed via the contact area at the end of the two fins belonging to the respective pair. In order to enable an address of each bitline separately, select transistors are provided that switch each bitline individually.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the diagrammatic plan view according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> after the etching of the trenches to form the fins <b>10</b> and the removal of the further resist mask <b>6</b> to lay bare the contact areas <b>11</b> that limit the trenches in the longitudinal direction. Another mask is applied which is provided for the production of the normally-on select transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0053">This is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which shows the diagrammatic plan view according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> after the application of a further resist mask having openings <b>7</b> in the areas of the intended normally-on select transistors <b>14</b>. The rest of the fins and the contact areas are covered by this mask; therefore, the contours of the fins have been represented as hidden contours with dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. This further mask is used to perform an implantation intended for normally-on transistors in the areas provided for the select transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a cross-section according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> after the production of wordlines. After the etching of the trenches and the application of the further resist mask to implant the select transistors, a dielectric material <b>8</b>, for instance an oxide layer, can be deposited into the trenches and partially removed by chemical mechanical polishing so that only bottom parts of the trenches are filled with the dielectric material. A memory layer sequence <b>9</b> is applied all over the surface and is intended as a storage means. It can be partly removed, but is at least provided over the fins. This memory layer sequence comprises a memory layer of a dielectric material that is suitable for charge-trapping. The memory layer is arranged between upper and lower boundary layers or confinement layers having a larger energy bandwidth. The memory layer sequence may be an oxide-nitride-oxide layer sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0055">Preferably, but optionally, a metal layer <b>15</b> is deposited to form low-resistivity gatelines, which can be TaN. Then the material of the wordlines <b>12</b> is deposited, which may be polysilicon. The wordline <b>12</b> may be provided with a silicide layer <b>16</b> to reduce the electric resistivity. Both the metal layer <b>15</b> and the memory layer sequence <b>9</b> can be only 10 nm thick. If the fins are also 10 nm thick, the memory cell array can be realized to have a pitch of 40 nm. In this embodiment, the distance of the neighboring fins is 30 nm.</p>
