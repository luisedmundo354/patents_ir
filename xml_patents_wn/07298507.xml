<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application claims priority from a Japanese patent application No. 2000-020579 filed on Jan. 28, 2000, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a system for producing products, apparatus for managing productions, and a method for producing designated products. In particular, the present invention relates to a system for printing print pictures, which are the output of image data, and a method for producing the print pictures.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A print picture service, which prints out image data photographed by a digital camera as high-precision print pictures, is provided. In the print picture service according to the conventional art, customers hand over photographed image data to shops such as photo shops and make orders such as the quantity of the prints. The customers then visit the photo shops again, pay for the prints, and receive printed pictures. Also, customers can make orders for printing by inputting photographed image data from terminals placed in photo shops.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, a service that reads photo films or developed pictures, converts the read films or pictures to digital image data, and accumulates the converted image data in an image server, is provided. In this case, customers make orders for printing through a network or from terminals placed in shops. Since the above described image server accumulates customers' image data, orders for extra copies of pictures can be received from the customers. The Japanese Patent Applications Laid-Open No. H10-13589, No. H10-302045, and No. H11-4311 disclose a system for recording or sending digital image data with identification information.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the print picture service according to the conventional art described above, when photographed image data is input and then when orders are made, printers start printing print pictures instantly. Since customers pay for the service in exchange for receiving the printed pictures, shops may incur monetary damages if customers do not come to collect the ordered pictures or input false orders intentionally, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, since it takes time for print orders of which customers select image data of their choice and decide the quantity of prints, smooth service can be easily provided if the contents of orders are previously determined.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The invention will now be described based on the preferred embodiments, which do not intend to limit the scope of the present invention, but exemplify the invention. All of the features and the combinations thereof described in the embodiment are not necessarily essential to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic block diagram showing a product production system according to the first embodiment. The present embodiment relates to a system for reading out from, for example, memory cards image data photographed by customers using, for example, a digital camera and printing the read-out image data as print pictures.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The product production system <b>10</b> produces products for which customers <b>14</b> order. The products according to the present embodiment are output images, which are an outputs of image data received from the customers <b>14</b> in other forms of media. Here, although a case that output images are printed as print pictures is described as an example, the output image may be provided by being stored in a CD-R, for example. According to the present embodiment, a printer that prints out large quantities with high-speed is used. Thus, orders may be received from a plurality of customers.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The product production system <b>10</b> includes a first terminal <b>20</b>, a second terminal <b>40</b>, a production unit <b>50</b>, a production management apparatus <b>60</b>, an order information storing unit <b>100</b>, an image data storing unit <b>110</b>, and a customer information storing unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The first terminal <b>20</b> reads image data photographed by the customer <b>14</b> using a device such as a digital camera. The first terminal <b>20</b> inputs order information, which the customer <b>14</b> designates ordering items such as the quantity of printing print pictures. The first terminal <b>20</b> may input customer identification information for identifying information relating to the customer <b>14</b>. The first terminal <b>20</b> includes a display unit for displaying information such as ordered items, and an operation unit for the customer <b>14</b> to operate the first terminal <b>20</b>. The first terminal <b>20</b> is placed in stores, such as photo shops, convenience stores, and supermarkets. The first terminal <b>20</b> may be placed beyond the view of a shop clerk <b>18</b> in stores. If the first terminal <b>20</b> is placed where the customer <b>14</b> collects the ordered product, the first terminal may be the same terminal as a second terminal, which is described later. The image data may include a plurality of photographed images. A plurality of the first terminal <b>20</b> may be placed in stores. The product production system <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment responds to a large amount of print orders received from a plurality of customers <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The first terminal <b>20</b> inputs identification information for identifying the ordered items. The identification information maybe information that the customer <b>14</b> himself or herself remembers. The identification information may be information that a store issues. The information that the customer <b>14</b> himself or herself remembers maybe, for example, information relating to the identity of the customer <b>14</b>, such as a telephone number or a birthday. In such a case, the customer manually inputs identification information to the first terminal <b>20</b>. The information that the store issues may be, for example, order information, which the first terminal <b>20</b> issues by the first-ordered-first order, and specific information such as a bar code to distribute in stores. In such cases, the customer <b>14</b> may manually input order information to the first terminal <b>20</b> or may instruct the first terminal <b>20</b> to read the bar code.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The second terminal <b>40</b> is an apparatus for re-inputting the identification information input by the first terminal <b>20</b> in order to authenticate the order information. The second terminal <b>40</b> is placed within view of the shop clerk <b>18</b>, for example, around the counter where the shop clerk <b>18</b> is always in attendance. For example, if the customer <b>14</b> gives identification information to the shop clerk <b>18</b> at the counter, the shop clerk <b>18</b> inputs identification information to the second terminal <b>40</b>. If the identification information is a bar code, the customer <b>14</b> hands out the bar code to the shop clerk <b>18</b> and the shop clerk <b>18</b> instructs the second terminal <b>40</b> to read the bar code. Since the second terminal <b>40</b> is placed in view of the shop clerk <b>18</b>, the customer <b>14</b> himself or herself may input identification information to the second terminal <b>40</b> in front of the shop clerk <b>18</b> as another embodiment. The customer <b>14</b> who gives the identification information to the second terminal <b>40</b> or the shop clerk <b>18</b> may be another person from the person who makes an order for the product <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When identification information is re-input to the second terminal <b>40</b>, the order information input to the first terminal <b>20</b> is authenticated as a correct order. The second terminal <b>40</b> has an access right to authenticate order information for at least either the order information storing unit <b>100</b> and the image data storing unit <b>110</b>. As an authentication method for order information, an order to start producing may be output to the production unit <b>50</b> when the identification information input to the first terminal <b>20</b> is input to the second terminal <b>40</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Thus, even if the first terminal <b>20</b> is placed beyond the view of the shop clerk <b>18</b>, the receival of false orders may be prevented since those who have input an order have to come in front of the shop clerk <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Also, since simple information, such as information the customer <b>14</b> remembers or bar codes, is used for identification information, the authentication of order information may be easily achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The order information storing unit <b>100</b> stores order information input through the first terminal <b>20</b> by associating with identification information. The order information storing unit <b>100</b> includes order expiry date information, which defines the expiry date for storing order information, and stores order information at least for a predetermined period of time. Moreover, the order information storing unit <b>100</b> may authenticate order information by extending the term defined by the order expiry date information when identification information input by the first terminal <b>20</b> is re-input to the second terminal <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The image data storing unit <b>110</b> stores image data input through the first terminal <b>20</b> by associating with identification information. The image data storing unit <b>110</b> includes image data expiry date information, which defines the expiry date for storing image data information, and stores image data for a predetermined set period of time. Also, the image data storing unit <b>110</b> may authenticate order information by extending the term defined by the image data expiry date information when identification information input by the first terminal <b>20</b> is re-input to the second terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The customer in formation storing unit <b>120</b> stores information relating to the customer <b>14</b>. The information relating to the customer <b>14</b> is, for example, information of each customer <b>14</b> relating to the purchase history of products.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The production management apparatus <b>60</b> manages the printing of print pictures ordered by the customer <b>14</b> by referring to the order information storing unit <b>100</b>, the image data storing unit <b>110</b>, and the customer information storing unit <b>120</b>. The production management apparatus <b>60</b> may, for example, instruct the production unit <b>50</b> to produce the product <b>16</b> designated as order information when the production management apparatus <b>60</b> receives from the second terminal <b>40</b> an order to start producing. As another embodiment, the production management apparatus <b>60</b> may include at least one of the order information storing unit <b>100</b>, the image data storing unit <b>110</b>, and the customer information storing unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The production unit <b>50</b> receives authenticated order information and image data and produces the product <b>16</b> designated in the order information. The production unit <b>50</b> is, for example, a printer for printing print pictures. The printer used as the production unit <b>50</b> prints out a large amount of print pictures at a high speed. The production unit <b>50</b> receives a large amount of production orders from a plurality of the customers <b>14</b> and processes sequentially. The production unit <b>50</b> may be placed at a shop where at least either the first terminal <b>20</b> or the second terminal <b>40</b> is placed. The production unit <b>50</b> may undertake a process of production orders input from a plurality of the first terminals <b>20</b> place data plurality of shops.

The production unit <b>50</b> receives order information from the order information storing unit <b>100</b>. The production unit <b>50</b> may start producing the product <b>16</b> designated in the order information after receiving from the production management apparatus <b>60</b> an order to start producing.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The first terminal <b>20</b>, the second terminal <b>40</b>, the order information storing unit <b>100</b>, the image data storing unit <b>110</b>, the customer information storing unit <b>120</b>, the production management apparatus <b>60</b>, and the production unit <b>50</b> maybe connected to one another through a network <b>12</b>. The network <b>12</b> may be, for example, a LAN, or Local Area Network, using a means such as an Ethernet. For example, the Internet, such as a public line or a leased line, may be used as the network <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The product <b>16</b>, such as a print picture and a CD-R, produced by the production unit <b>50</b> are handed to the customer <b>14</b>, who made an order, at the shop where at least one of the first terminal <b>20</b> and second terminal <b>40</b> is placed, in exchange for the payment. Since the production order of the product <b>16</b> is authenticated by inputting the identification information twice, shops may be able to expect the customer <b>16</b> to come to receive the product <b>16</b> without false orders. Thus, damages made by false orders maybe decreased even if the customer <b>14</b> pays later in person.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The second embodiment according to the present invention is described in the following. The present embodiment relates to a system that the customer <b>14</b> previously converts photo films photographed by the customer <b>14</b> to image data, orders desired images from image data, and then prints out the ordered images as print pictures.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a functional block diagram showing a production management system according to the second embodiment. The production management system <b>210</b> according to the present embodiment includes a first terminal <b>20</b>, a second terminal <b>40</b>, a production unit <b>50</b>, a production management apparatus <b>60</b>, an image input device <b>80</b>, an order information storing unit <b>100</b>, an image data storing unit <b>110</b>, and a customer information storing unit <b>120</b>. The production management system <b>210</b> according to the present embodiment includes almost the same structural elements as the product production system <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except for the first terminal <b>20</b> and the image input device <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The image input device <b>80</b> is, for example, a scanner for reading photo films and converting the read image into digital image data. The scanner used as the image input device <b>80</b> is a film scanner that converts photo films into digital images at a high speed or a photo scanner that converts print pictures into digital images.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The image input device <b>80</b> includes a transceiving unit <b>82</b>, an identification information input unit <b>84</b>, and an image input unit <b>86</b>. The transceiving unit <b>82</b> exchanges data with a network <b>12</b>. The image input unit <b>86</b> is the scanner body that converts photo films into digital images. The identification information input unit <b>84</b> reads identification information that identifies image data input from the image input unit <b>86</b>. The image data converted by the image input unit <b>86</b> is stored in the image data storing unit <b>110</b> by associating with identification information. The identification information according to the present embodiment is given by a bar code on a tag card of a paper medium. The identification information input unit <b>84</b> is a bar code reader.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">According to the present embodiment, firstly the customer <b>14</b> leaves a photo film at the counter of a photo shop or the like. A shop clerk makes the image input unit <b>86</b> of the image input device <b>80</b> read the photo film received from the customer <b>14</b>. Then the shop clerk <b>18</b> makes the identification information input unit <b>84</b> read the tag card that has identification information. The image data is sent to the production management apparatus <b>60</b> along with identification information. The production management apparatus <b>60</b> records image data in the image data storing unit <b>110</b> by associating with identification information. The shop clerk <b>18</b> then hands over a tag card having identification information to the customer <b>14</b>. Here, the identification information is, for example, associated with a plurality of images included in one photo film. If the customer <b>14</b> leaves a plurality of photo films, the identification information may be associated with a plurality of images included in those photo films.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a functional block diagram showing the detailed first terminal according to the second embodiment. The customer <b>14</b> makes an order from the first terminal <b>20</b> for printing print pictures of the image data recorded in the image data storing unit <b>110</b>. The first terminal <b>20</b> displays the image data corresponding to the identification information when the customer <b>14</b> inputs the identification information. The first terminal <b>20</b> includes an image compression/extension means <b>34</b>. The image compression/extension means <b>34</b> compresses or extends the image data received by the transceiving unit <b>22</b> and displays the compressed or extended image data on the display unit <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Therefore, the customer <b>14</b> may be able to check the photographed images of the photo film on the display unit <b>24</b> of the first terminal <b>20</b> and order print pictures by selecting only images that the customer wants to print out.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The customer <b>14</b> makes the identification information input unit <b>26</b> read the tag card having identification information. The transceiving unit <b>22</b> sends identification information to the production management apparatus <b>60</b>. The production management apparatus <b>60</b> receives identification information through the network <b>12</b>. If the image data associated with the identification information input from the identification information input unit <b>26</b> is stored in the image data storing unit <b>110</b>, the production management apparatus <b>60</b> sends the image data to the first terminal <b>20</b>. The transceiving unit <b>22</b> receives the image data sent from the production management apparatus <b>60</b>. The image compression/extension means <b>34</b> extends the image data and displays the extended image data on the display unit <b>24</b>. The image compression/extension means <b>34</b> otherwise displays the image data as compressed images on the display unit <b>24</b>. The customer <b>14</b> selects from the order information input unit <b>28</b> images that he or she wants to print out as print pictures according to the instruction displayed on the display unit <b>24</b> and inputs order information, such as the quantity, for each image. The transceiving unit <b>22</b> sends the order information. The production management apparatus <b>60</b> receives the order information through the network <b>12</b>. The customer <b>14</b> may input customer identification information from the customer identification information input unit <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The display unit <b>24</b> of the first terminal <b>20</b> displays image data. The customer <b>14</b> makes an order for printing print pictures in the same way as the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">According to the present embodiment, the authentication of order information is easily achieved by using identification information that identifies image data read from photo films.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">According to the present embodiment, the image input unit <b>86</b> may be able to convert, for example, developed pictures and posters into image data. The production unit <b>50</b> and the image input device <b>80</b> described in the present embodiment may be achieved by the same apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As another embodiment of the first and second embodiments, if order information is input from the first terminal <b>20</b>, the production management apparatus <b>60</b> may instruct the risk ratio calculating unit <b>76</b> to calculate the risk ratio and may instruct the production unit <b>50</b> to start printing print pictures if the risk ratio is below a predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">For example, the credibility of the customer <b>14</b> may be calculated from the customer identification information input from the first terminal <b>20</b>. If the credibility is high, the production unit <b>50</b> instantly starts printing print pictures when the customer <b>14</b> inputs order information to the first terminal <b>20</b>. On the other hand, if the credibility is low, the production unit <b>50</b> starts printing print pictures when the customer <b>14</b> inputs order information to the first terminal <b>20</b> and re-inputs identification information from the second terminal <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Also, risk ratios maybe calculated based on the print charge calculated by the rate calculating unit <b>78</b>. If the charge is low, the production unit <b>50</b> instantly starts printing print pictures when the customer <b>14</b> inputs order information to the first terminal <b>20</b>. On the other hand, if the charge is high, the production unit <b>50</b> starts printing print pictures when the customer <b>14</b> inputs order information to the first terminal <b>20</b> and re-inputs identification information from the second terminal <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Since photo prints are not printed until the customer <b>14</b> re-inputs identification information from the second terminal <b>40</b> when the risk ratio is high, monetary damages of shops may be decreased, as well as being able to make a print order of print pictures easier since the customer <b>14</b> does not need to re-input identification information from the second terminal <b>40</b> when the risk ratio is low.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As another embodiment of the first and second embodiments, the first terminal <b>20</b> may be placed at remote places from the shops. For example, the first terminal <b>20</b> may be a personal computer and computer peripherals placed at a customer's home. In such a case, the customer <b>14</b> may be able to confirm a large amount of orders or troublesome orders outside of shops and make a temporary order.</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">These programs may be read from a recording medium and executed directly to the RAM disk <b>306</b> or read out to the RAM disk <b>306</b> after being temporarily installed in the hard disk drive <b>310</b> and executed. Moreover, the above programs may be stored in one recording medium or a plurality of recording media. Further, those programs may be stored in coded formats.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">An optical recording medium, a magnetic recording medium such as an MD, an optical magnetic recording medium such as a PD, a tape medium, and a semiconductor memory such as an IC card or a miniature card, may be used as a recording medium other than the floppy disk <b>324</b> and the CD-ROM <b>326</b>. Also, a storage device such as a hard disk or a RAM disk set in a server system connected to a leased communication line or the Internet may be used as a recording medium, and the programs may be provided to the computer <b>300</b> through the communication networks. These recording media are used only for manufacturing the production management apparatus <b>60</b>, and thereby it is obvious that manufacturing or selling of those recording media as a business constitute an infringement of the patent right based on the present application.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The structural elements of the second terminal <b>40</b> and the production unit <b>50</b> described in all the embodiments of the present application may be achieved by one apparatus. Also, the transceiving unit <b>42</b> of the second terminal <b>40</b> may receive image data and order information from the image data storing unit <b>110</b> and the order information storing unit <b>100</b>, respectively, and may output to the production unit <b>50</b> that image data and order information through a leased line.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Moreover, the structural elements of the production unit <b>50</b> and the production management apparatus <b>60</b> described in all the embodiments in the present application may be achieved by the same apparatus. Various databases , such as the order information storing unit <b>100</b>, the image data storing unit <b>110</b>, and the customer information storing unit <b>120</b>, may be connected to the production management apparatus <b>60</b> through a communication line, such as the Internet, or a local communication line, such as a LAN.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The identification information input unit <b>26</b> of the first terminal <b>20</b> may be a receipt printer that issues a receipt having a reference number, according to all the embodiments described in the present application. The customer <b>14</b> may receive the receipt having a reference number and input the reference number as identification information.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">According to the embodiments of the present invention, the first terminal <b>20</b> may have a means for processing images displayed on the display unit <b>24</b>, though the means is not shown in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">According to the product production system <b>10</b> of the first embodiment, since order information is authenticated by inputting identification information from the second terminal <b>40</b> placed at a place where the shop clerk <b>18</b> can monitor, false orders may be prevented even if the first terminal <b>20</b> is placed beyond the view of the shop clerk <b>18</b> as the customer <b>14</b> who input an order has to come in front of the shop clerk <b>18</b>. Also, the authentication of order information may be able to be easily achieved since simple information, such as information the customer <b>14</b> himself or herself remembers or a bar code, is used as identification information.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">According to the product production system <b>10</b> of the second embodiment, the customer <b>14</b> may be able to check the photographed images of the photo film on the display unit <b>24</b> of the first terminal <b>20</b> and order print pictures by selecting only images that the customer wants to print out.
