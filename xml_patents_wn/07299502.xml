<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to computing systems and networks therefor. More specifically, the present invention relates to document management systems implemented over a computing network.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The availability of the Internet or World Wide Web, wide area networks and local area networks have enabled fast, convenient electronic document sharing. One technique for sharing documents involves the use of email attachments. However, this approach requires an identification of recipients and may be limited, by some network administrators with respect to file size.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, an alternative approach involving the use of a web site to share documents is often preferred. This approach involves a posting of documents available for download on the site. A user, equipped with a browser, running on a computer accesses the site and selects the documents to be downloaded. While this approach is more effective with respect to the transfer of larger documents, access control is limited in that those that have access to the site generally have access to all of the documents listed as being available on same. Hence, there is a need for a more flexible yet secure system for providing access control to shared documents. There is an associated need to be able to verify the identity of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, for many applications, there is a need for a capability of customizing the information to be shared based on the recipient's clearance level, i.e., presentation security. For example, in a case where a new software product is to be released, it would be useful to be able to provide only user interface and command data for nontechnical readers charged with the responsibility of preparing a user manual and technical data for technically trained readers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is a further need for providing for secure transmission from a secure site such that eavesdroppers may not be able to gain unauthorized access to the document while in transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Finally, there is a need for a system or method for maintaining an audit trail of submission, accesses and modifications to a document.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">While document management systems are known, generally, conventional systems do not provide adequate security, present detail or control, secure transmission, information on the work flow process and the ability to track simultaneous changes on shared documents. Hence, a need remains for a system or method for providing these features in a document management system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The need in the art is addressed by the document management system and method of the present invention. The inventive system includes a server for providing data from a stored document. Software is provided on the server for encrypting the data. A communications subsystem is included for transporting the encrypted data from the server to the client. Software is provided at the client for decrypting the encrypted data.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The inventive method includes the steps of: using a client machine to access a server via a network and to request data therefrom; encrypting at least a portion of said data on said server; communicating said encrypted data from said server to said client; and decrypting said data on said client.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the illustrative embodiment, the inventive method operates under the control of an agent residing on the server. The encrypting software is a first applet residing on the server and the decrypting software is a second applet residing on the client. In the illustrative implementation, the second applet is communicated from the server to the client. Several mechanisms are included for verifying the user's identity including a digital signature, a private key and a public key.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Illustrative embodiments and exemplary applications will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings to disclose the advantageous teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">While the present invention is described herein with reference to illustrative embodiments for particular applications, it should be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings provided herein will recognize additional modifications, applications, and embodiments within the scope thereof and additional fields in which the present invention would be of significant utility.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention provides a system and method for viewing documents in a manner that is both secure, customized to the individual viewing or modifying the document, and maintains an audit-trail of changes to the document.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing an illustrative embodiment of the document management system of the present invention. The system <b>10</b> includes an information management system <b>20</b> with documents organized in folders stored in a database <b>22</b>. In the best mode, the information management system <b>20</b> is implemented via a server on a network. The information management system <b>20</b> further includes agents <b>24</b>, e.g., software programs associated with folders, that regulate the operation of the system <b>10</b> in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. For example, the agent <b>24</b> performs tasks on behalf of users when a predetermined event happens in the associated folder. As discussed more fully below, examples of events include “document added”, “document deleted”, “request for view”, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the document management server <b>20</b> further includes an applet <b>26</b>. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, applets are mini-software programs or routines. In accordance with the present teachings, the applet <b>26</b> performs several functions, one of which is to encrypt selected documents <b>28</b> retrieved from folders in the database <b>22</b>. As discussed more fully below, a second applet <b>32</b> is transmitted from the document management server <b>20</b> to a client machine (e.g., personal computer, netpliance, etc.) over the network link <b>40</b>. The applet at the client machine performs several functions including decryption of a document <b>34</b> received over the network <b>40</b> from the server <b>20</b> and providing the decrypted document <b>36</b> to a browser <b>38</b> on the client for viewing, editing etc. by a user. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the browser <b>38</b> may be any document viewing program without departing from the scope of the present teachings.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention is designed to operate with users having specified privileges to view, make comments, approve, disapprove or track changes to documents. The first step in secure document access is to submit the document in a secure manner to the information management system. To do this, the user browses to the appropriate folder on the information management system and selects the “submit” menu option. The user indicates the document to be submitted. For example, the user would indicate that he or she wanted to submit a secure purchase order request. The agent associated with the folder would download an applet to the client machine. This applet would encrypt the document and load it back up to the agent. It would be stored in the associated folder. In this example, it would be stored in the purchase order folder. The document has been submitted in a secure manner to the information management system and is stored in a secure manner in it.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As part of secure document submittal, the agent checks the authentication of the submitter to be certain that he or she is authorized to make document submittals. One way of checking authentication is to check the digital signature of the submitter. This is accessible through the web browser, among other ways.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Customized, secure access to shared documents can be achieved in the following manner. First, the user browses to the appropriate folder in the information management system and selects the view option. Next, the agent associated with the folder checks that the user is authenticated to view the document. If the user is not authenticated, it tags the attempt as a tag in the document and prevents the user from viewing it. If the user is authorized, the process continues. Then, the agent downloads the document (which is encrypted) to the user's machine and also downloads an applet to the user's machine. The applet then decrypts the document and generates a view that is specific to the user. This view would include the original document, any previous comments the user made, a means of submitting new comments and any other processing commands specific to the user. An example of this would be “Document Approval” by the user. The document management method of the present invention is discussed more fully below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow diagram illustrative of the document management method of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), in accordance with the inventive method <b>100</b>, after the user browses to a selected document folder, at step <b>102</b>, the agent <b>24</b> procures the user's digital signature from the browser. As is well-known in the art, digital signatures are digital codes that are issued by an issuing authority (like VeriSign) and are specific to a user or entity. They may be used to sign documents, authenticate user's identities and may be used in encryption.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Next, at step <b>104</b>, the agent <b>24</b> gets the user's access rights from the database <b>22</b>. If, at step <b>106</b>, the agent <b>24</b> determines that the user has access rights to the system <b>20</b>, then, at step <b>108</b>, the agent creates a random (e.g., 128 bit) session key. Next, (step <b>110</b>) the agent <b>24</b> encrypts a file list appropriate for the user's access rights with a session key. At step <b>112</b>, the agent <b>24</b> generates a message digest of the file list and, at step <b>114</b>, encrypts the message digest with the agent's private key.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Private and public keys are well-known in the art. A private key is one portion of a digital signature issued by an issuing authority. It is kept secret and not shared. A public key is another portion of a digital signature issued by an issuing authority. It is shared with others. They are mirror images of each other and together they enable public and private key encryption.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">At step <b>116</b>, the agent gets the user's public key from the database and at step <b>118</b>, encrypts the session key with the user's public key. Then the agent downloads the applet <b>32</b> to the client along with the encrypted session key, access rights/file list, and message digest.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">At step <b>120</b>, the client applet <b>32</b> decrypts the session key with the user's private key. Next, at step <b>122</b>, the applet <b>32</b> decrypts the access rights/file list with the session key. At step <b>124</b>, the applet <b>32</b> generates a message digest of the file list. One preferred method for generating a message digest is to use the SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) from NIST published in 1994 and part of the ANSI X9.30 standard. At step <b>126</b>, the applet <b>32</b> decrypts the agents message digest of the file list. At step <b>128</b>, the applet <b>32</b> compares the agent message digest with the applet message digest and, if they are equal, then, at step <b>130</b>, the applet <b>32</b> generates a user interface based on the access rights of the user. (If they are not equal, access is denied.)</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>), when the user selects ‘file’ and ‘view’ the applet <b>32</b> sends the file ID and ‘view’ command to the agent <b>24</b>. In response, at step <b>132</b>, the agent <b>24</b> checks the database for verification of the user's access rights. At step <b>134</b>, the agent procures the encrypted file from the database <b>22</b>. Next, the agent decrypts the file with the agent's private key (step <b>136</b>). At step <b>138</b>, the agent <b>24</b> generates a random session key. At step <b>140</b>, the agent <b>24</b> encrypts the file with the session key. At step <b>142</b>, the agent <b>24</b> generates a message digest of the file. At step <b>144</b>, the agent encrypts the message digest with the agents private key and at step <b>146</b>, encrypts the session key with the user's public key. Next, the encrypted session key and encrypted file are downloaded to the client.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At step <b>148</b>, the applet <b>32</b> decrypts the session key with the user's private key. At step <b>150</b>, the applet <b>32</b> decrypts the file with the session key. At step <b>152</b>, the applet <b>32</b> generates a message digest of the file. The applet <b>32</b> then decrypts the agents message digest with the agent's public key. At step <b>156</b>, the applet <b>32</b> compares the agent's message digest with the applet's message digest. If they are equal, then at step <b>158</b>, the applet <b>32</b> displays the file content in the user interface window. (If they are not equal, access is denied.)</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>), the user may modify the file. If, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>d</i>), the user desires to submit changes in the document, then, after selecting ‘submit changes’ at step <b>160</b>, the applet <b>32</b> adds tags for user's changes. At step <b>162</b>, the applet <b>32</b> generates a random 128 bit session key. At step <b>164</b>, the applet <b>32</b> encrypts the file with the session key and, at step <b>166</b>, generates a message digest of the file. Next, the applet <b>32</b> encrypts the message digest with the applet's private key and encrypts the session key with the user's private key (steps <b>168</b> and <b>170</b>). The applet <b>32</b> then sends the encrypted file, session key and message digest to the agent <b>24</b> on the server <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Then, in accordance with the illustrative method, at step <b>172</b>, the agent <b>24</b> decrypts the session key with the user's public key. At step <b>174</b>, the agent <b>24</b> then decrypts the file with the session key and at step <b>176</b> generates a message digest of the file. At step <b>178</b>, the agent decrypts the applet's message digest with the applet's public key <b>178</b>. At step <b>180</b>, the agent <b>24</b> compares the agent's message digest with the applet's message digest. If they are equal, then at step <b>182</b>, the agent <b>24</b> adds tags for user, submission, time and date. (If they are not equal, the changes are rejected.) Next, at step <b>184</b>, the agent <b>24</b> encrypts the file with the agent's public key. At step <b>186</b>, the agent <b>24</b> then writes the encrypted file to the file system.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>e</i>), if the user selects ‘view history’, then at step <b>188</b>, the applet <b>32</b> displays the document history in the user interface (browser) window.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Those skilled in the art may write an agent <b>24</b> and applets <b>26</b> and <b>32</b> suitable for a given application without undue experimentation and without departing from the scope of the present teachings.</p>

    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0035">1. Authentication of a user's identity, using digital signatures.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0036">2. Verification, using digital signatures, of an individual's authority to submit documents, access documents, modify documents or view the history of these operations on a document.</li>

        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0043">9. Integrity of data, using encryption, between the client and the server.
<br/>
The advantages of the invention over what has been done before include:
</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0044">1. The processes involving documents are automated. This increases efficiency.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0045">2. Individuals' access rights are checked before they can submit, view or modify documents. The software agent checks the user's digital signature before allowing the user to submit, view or modify a document. For example, only the doctor has the right to submit the prescription form and only the pharmacist has the right to view it. The state pharmacy board has the right to audit the process and see what happened.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0012" num="0046">3. The documents remain encrypted while they are stored in the information management system and while they are being submitted to or are being downloaded from the information management system. This guarantees that they can not be tampered with while they are stored in the information management system or that they cannot be viewed, even if they are intercepted while being downloaded from the information management system to the client machine.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0013" num="0047">4. Other systems do not provide a customized view of a document. Individuals view the whole document or nothing. This invention provides a view of a document customized to the individual. For example, a document could be added that describes a new printer and its associated software. One view of the document, appropriate for engineers, would show all the technical details of the printer and the software. A separate view, appropriate for technical writers, would show the user interface and user commands so they could write the printer's manuals.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0014" num="0048">5. Unlike the inventive system, other systems do not maintain an audit trail of submission, accesses and modifications to a document. The advantage of this is that an analysis may be performed on how efficient and effective work processes are. For example, an analysis may be done on who submits the most work orders and how quickly individual workers process them.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0049">In short, although other document management systems are known to allow multiple users to view a shared document, none of these solutions appear to provide document encryption where the encryption is accomplished on the client machine and the document is transferred to the information management system in a secure, encrypted form. None of the other solutions appear to use digital signatures to verify that the person who wants access to the shared document is allowed that access, and none appear to provide a customized view of the document that is customized to the individual trying to access the document. Further, no other product, known to the present applicant, provides a complete audit trail of accesses, modifications, and process approvals or disapprovals.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0050">Thus, the present invention has been described herein with reference to a particular embodiment for a particular application. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the present teachings will recognize additional modifications applications and embodiments within the scope thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0051">It is therefore intended by the appended claims to cover any and all such applications, modifications and embodiments within the scope of the present invention.</p>
