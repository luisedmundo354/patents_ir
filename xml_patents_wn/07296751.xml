<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to its major aspects and broadly stated the present invention is a module for packaging optical illumination, optical receive, and electrical signal processing components of an optical reader.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The module includes a frame which carries a printed circuit board, preferably a printed circuit board (PCB) and various optical components. In one embodiment, the frame includes a back plate having a retainer for receiving an optical lens barrel, and a recess for receiving and aligning an image sensor which is carried by the PCB. The frame may also include resilient fingers which enable the frame to receive certain optical components of the module in an adhesiveless snap-fitting arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a preferred assembly method for assembling the module, the PCB is first mounted onto the frame's back plate such that the image sensor of the PCB is received and aligned by the recess of the back plate. Next, illumination and aiming LEDs are soldered to the PCB to mount the LEDs. As a space conserving measure, the LEDs may be mounted so that a portion of rear surfaces of the illumination LEDs oppose a portion of the top surface of the image sensor when mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">After the LEDs are mounted to the PCB, additional components are incorporated in the module. In a preferred embodiment, a lens barrel is incorporated in the retainer, then an aperture plate having domed apertures for shaping light rays emanating from the aiming LEDs is placed over the LEDs. Finally, a diffuser lens plate for diffusing light rays emanating from the illumination LEDs is snap-fit into the frame. By providing spacers between the aperture plate and the diffuser plate, both of the aperture plate and the diffuser plate are secured in a stationary position inside the module by snap fitting of the diffuser plate onto the frame without use of adhesives or any other mechanical securing apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition to having diffusers for diffusing illumination light, the diffuser plate may also include lenses for focusing light generated by the aiming LEDs. In one embodiment of the invention, the aiming LEDs and their associated optics project a solitary horizontal aiming line onto a target in a field of view.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The printed circuit board may be a full function printed circuit board which carries a solid state image sensor and essentially the entirety of electronic circuitry required for supporting essentially all of the processing and control operations to be performed by the optical device in which the module is to be incorporated. Circuitry incorporated in the single PCB includes signal processing circuitry for processing signals generated from the image sensor, image capture circuitry for storing image data, and decoding and/or recognizing circuitry for decoding and/or recognizing indicia represented in image data that has been stored.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In order to accommodate the full function circuit board, the rear surface of the frame's back plate should be made to have a central recess for aligning and receiving the image sensor, and peripheral recesses for accommodating circuit elements such as electrical components and/or wiring which may emanate from the front surface of the full function printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The complementary components of the module are shaped so that the completed module exhibits a cubic rectangular form, thereby reducing the overall volume consumed by the entirety of optical components and at least the image sensing component of the reader in which the module is installed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A major feature of the invention is the incorporation of essentially all of the illumination elements required of an optical reader, including illumination and aiming light sources, and an image sensor onto a single circuit board. This significantly simplifies assembly, reduces material consumption, and thereby reduces the overall cost of producing the module.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Another feature of the invention is the snap fitting arrangement between the plate components of the module and the frame. The snap fitting arrangement for mounting several components of the frame eliminates the need for adhesives or other mechanical mounting agents, simplifies assembly, and thereby further reduces costs.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another feature of the invention is the positioning of the LEDs to partially oppose the image sensor when mounted. This feature reduces the required overall size of the module, thereby allowing incorporation of the module into smaller readers and further reducing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Still another feature of the invention, in one embodiment, is the incorporation of essentially the entirety of electronic circuitry components required for essentially all of the signal processing and control operations required of the optical reader in which the module is to be incorporated in a single PCB. This feature enables essentially all of the electrical component required of an optical device in which the module is to be incorporated to be installed simply by installing the module in the device.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Another feature of the invention is the projection of a solitary horizontal aiming line by the module's aiming LEDs and their associated optics. The projection of a solitary horizontal aiming line for aiming reduces the space requirements of the aiming optics and reduces costs.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Yet another feature of the invention is the packaging of the entirety of the optical elements and at least the image sensor of the electrical components of an optical reader into a packaged module having a rectangular cube configuration. The rectangular cube configuration is stackable and highly space efficient and as such. enables simplified transport of the module and installation of reader optical and electrical components into reader housings of smaller size than was previously possible.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition to minimizing the size of the module, the module's configuration provides protection for internal components. The module's closed wall configuration provides a containment for internal components of the module, and substantially prevents outside objects from coming in contact with sensitive internal components of the module such as the module's image sensor and LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">These and other details, advantages and benefits of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description of the preferred embodiment herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An embodiment of an imaging module <b>10</b> according to the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1D</figref>. Imaging module <b>10</b> is specifically designed for use in an indicia reader such as a bar code reader, an optical character recognition (OCR) reader or in a reader having both bar code and OCR reading capabilities. However, it will be understood that features of module <b>10</b> may also find use in other devices requiring image capture including video cameras, digital cameras, and medical viewing instruments.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Module <b>10</b> includes mounting frame <b>12</b> which is adapted to receive both electrical components and optical components of an imaging system. Specifically, mounting frame <b>12</b> receives a circuit board, shown as being provided by a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>14</b>, illumination LEDs <b>16</b>, aiming LEDs <b>18</b>, an aiming lens aperture plate <b>24</b> and diffuser plate <b>26</b>. LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> could be substituted for by such light sources as laser diodes, filament based lamps, other solid state light sources, and fiber optic illumination devices.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to specific attributes of frame <b>12</b>, frame <b>12</b> includes a back plate <b>30</b> and sidewalls including top sidewalls <b>31</b> and side sidewalls <b>31</b>′. Back plate <b>30</b> includes a recess <b>34</b> for receiving a solid state image sensor chip <b>32</b> and, in one embodiment, a plurality of pin holes <b>36</b> for receiving leads <b>38</b> of illumination and/or aiming light sources, normally provided by LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. Back plate <b>30</b> may further include a retainer <b>40</b> for receiving a receive optics lens assembly <b>41</b> shown as being provided by a lens barrel, which may be installed in retainer <b>40</b> prior to or after any step in the assembly process which will be described herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In assembling module <b>10</b>, an assembler may first mount PCB <b>14</b> to back plate <b>30</b> with use of screws <b>56</b> or adhesives and then orients frame <b>12</b> so that opening <b>13</b> is exposed. When PCB <b>14</b> is mounted to back plate <b>30</b>, image sensor <b>32</b> carried by PCB <b>14</b>, is received and aligned by center recess <b>34</b> which is shaped complementarily with the shape of image sensor <b>32</b> as shown. After mounting PCB <b>14</b> to frame <b>12</b>, an assembler mounts illumination LEDs <b>16</b> and aiming LEDs <b>18</b> to PCB <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">To mount LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> to PCB <b>14</b>, an assembler pushes leads <b>38</b> of LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> through aligned pin holes <b>36</b> and <b>54</b> of back plate <b>30</b> and PCB <b>14</b>, then solders the LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> to PCB <b>14</b>. Preferably, an assembler first positions all of the LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> in their respective pin holes before soldering any of them. In soldering LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> rear surface <b>15</b> of PCB <b>14</b> should face in an orientation where it is easily accessed by an assembler. To the end that LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> remain in their desired orientation substantially normal to PCB <b>14</b> during soldering, a fixture (not shown) shaped to receive LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, of the type well known to persons skilled in the optical module assembly art can be temporarily applied over LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> through the soldering process.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While back plate <b>30</b> of frame <b>12</b> is shown as having pin holes <b>36</b> it will be understood that the entire region of back plate <b>30</b> containing pin holes <b>36</b> and recess <b>34</b> could be eliminated leaving back plate <b>30</b> to consist essentially only of receive optical lens assembly retainer <b>40</b>. In such an embodiment, a substantial portion of the front surface <b>15</b> of PCB <b>14</b> would be exposed to an assembler upon mounting of PCB <b>14</b> to frame <b>12</b>. In the case that back plate <b>30</b> does not contain material defining pin holes <b>36</b>, LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> may be front mounted to front surface <b>15</b> of a PCB which in such an embodiment would not require pin holes for receiving LED leads <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An important feature of the invention is that leads <b>38</b> of illumination LEDs <b>16</b> are installed in a nearly abutting relation to sides <b>33</b> of image sensor <b>32</b> so that a portion of rear surfaces <b>19</b> of LEDs <b>16</b> oppose a portion of a front surface <b>33</b> of image sensor <b>32</b> when the LEDs <b>16</b> are completely installed. This arrangement reduces the size of module <b>12</b>, enabling it to be installed in smaller sized optical readers.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">After LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are mounted onto PCB <b>14</b>, an assembler installs aperture plate <b>24</b> in frame <b>12</b> so that domes <b>42</b> of aperture plate <b>24</b> fit over aiming LEDs <b>18</b>. Domes <b>42</b> of aperture plate should be opaque to substantially block all light emanating from aiming LEDs <b>18</b> except for light which exits domes <b>42</b> through slit apertures <b>43</b>. Slit apertures <b>43</b> should be formed so that a desired shaped aiming pattern of illumination is projected onto a target, T. Preferably, aperture slits <b>43</b> are shaped rectangularly so that a horizontal line pattern is projected onto a target.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to further aspects of aperture plate <b>24</b>, aperture plate <b>24</b> includes cutaway sections <b>46</b> which provide clearance to allow plate <b>24</b> to be fit over illumination LEDs <b>16</b>. The sidewalls of domes <b>42</b> and of cutaway sections <b>46</b> may or may not contact the LEDs they fit over. However, it is not necessary that the sidewalls of either domes <b>42</b> or cutaway sections <b>46</b> have any influence on the alignment or LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> since LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are aligned in their desired orientation substantially normal to the surface <b>33</b> of image sensor <b>32</b> and PCB <b>14</b> by virtue of the fact that they are held in a desired orientation while being soldered and, in the embodiment shown, by virtue fact that the flat surfaces of LED bases <b>17</b> are biased against the flat surface of back plate <b>30</b> during the assembly process.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After aperture plate <b>24</b> is placed over LEDs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and moved toward back plate <b>30</b>, diffuser plate <b>26</b> is snap fit into frame opening <b>13</b> of frame <b>12</b>. Diffuser plate <b>26</b> includes diffusers <b>27</b> for diffusing light emanating from illumination LEDs so that a target area, T, is substantially homogenously illuminated by light emanating from illumination LEDs <b>16</b>. Resilient fingers <b>48</b> having hook ends <b>49</b> may be formed in top <b>31</b> or side <b>31</b> sidewalls of frame <b>12</b> to enable snap fitting of plate <b>26</b> onto frame <b>12</b>. In the embodiment shown, an assembler snap fits plate <b>26</b> onto frame <b>12</b> by pulling back resilient fingers <b>48</b> and pushing plate <b>26</b> toward back plate <b>30</b> then releasing fingers <b>48</b> to lock plate <b>26</b> into a position inside module <b>10</b>. Spacers <b>52</b> of aperture plate <b>24</b> (which in the alternative may be formed on plate <b>26</b>) operate to bias aperture plate <b>24</b> toward back plate <b>30</b> when diffuser plate <b>26</b> is snap fit onto frame <b>12</b>. When plate <b>26</b> is snap fit into frame <b>12</b>, spacers <b>52</b> transfer the force imparted by fingers <b>48</b> on plate <b>26</b> to plate <b>24</b> to the end that both aperture plate <b>24</b> and diffuser plate <b>26</b> are firmly secured inside frame <b>12</b> without use of adhesives or outside mechanical securing apparatuses or agents such as screws or pins.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition to having diffusers <b>27</b> for diffusing light emanating from illumination LEDs <b>16</b>, diffuser plate <b>26</b> may also include lenses <b>25</b> for focusing light emanating from aiming LEDs <b>18</b> as shaped by aperture slits <b>43</b> so that a focused narrow line is projected onto a target area T. A representation of a preferred illumination pattern projected by the illumination system of module <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, area <b>72</b> represents the region of a target area T illuminated by illumination LEDs <b>16</b> while area <b>74</b> represents the region of the target area highlighted by aiming LEDs <b>18</b> and their associated optics. It is seen that aiming LEDs <b>18</b> and their associated optics preferably project a solitary horizontal line <b>74</b> onto a target area which is in contrast with the complex geometry aiming patterns of prior art 2D optical readers. The selection of a solitary horizontal aiming pattern reduces the size of module <b>10</b>, as it eliminates the need to provide more than 2 light sources and/or optics for reflecting light generated from the aiming pattern light source or sources.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An important feature of the invention is that essentially all the illumination elements of a reader in which module <b>10</b> is to be incorporated are included on a single circuit board shown as being provided by PCB <b>14</b>. This is in contrast to the design of the prior art reader shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in which illumination elements and image sensing elements are spread out over several circuit boards. In the prior art device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an aiming illumination source <b>53</b> is mounted to a first circuit board <b>54</b>, illumination LEDs are mounted to a second circuit board <b>56</b>, while image sensor <b>32</b> is mounted to a third circuit board <b>58</b>. The assembly of a module of this prior art design is difficult and requires material components not required by the design of the present invention including circuit boards <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and electrical connectors between the circuit boards such as connector <b>57</b>. Providing a single circuit board that carries an image sensor, illumination LEDs, and aiming LEDs significantly simplifies assembly, reduces material consumption and thereby reduces the overall cost of producing the module.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Another important aspect of the invention, in one embodiment, is that essentially all electronic circuitry supporting the data processing operations required of module <b>10</b> are located on single, full function PCB <b>14</b>, including circuitry for processing signals generated from image sensor <b>32</b>, circuitry for capturing image data into a memory device, circuitry for decoding and/or recognizing indicia represented in captured image data. Circuitry for supporting serial transfers of data to peripheral devices may also be carried by PCB <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The all in one PCB arrangement of the present invention is in contrast to the traditional design in the prior art wherein circuitry for processing signals from an image sensor, circuitry for capturing and decoding image data and circuitry supporting serial interfacing with external devices are spread out over more than one circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the design of the prior art reader shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first vertically oriented circuit board <b>56</b> is provided for carrying circuitry for processing signals generated by an image sensor <b>32</b> and a second horizontally oriented circuit board <b>60</b>, known as a “mother board” is provided for carrying circuitry for storing image data and for decoding symbologies.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The one PCB design of the present invention provides numerous advantages over the two PCB design of the prior art. The multiple circuit board arrangement of the prior art requires a complex assembly procedure wherein the first circuit board <b>58</b> is mounted to a first internal structure of the reader in which it is incorporated, the second circuit board is mounted to a second internal structure of the reader, and then the two circuit board are electrically connected. The separate horizontal and vertical orientations of the two circuit boards <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> is inefficient in terms of space consumption and imposes restrictions on the configurations of housings in which the reader optical and electrical components may be incorporated. The one full function PCB design of the present invention does not exhibit these disadvantages.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">To the end that essentially the entirety of the required electronic circuitry of an optical reader can be packaged into a single printed circuit board, the back surface of the frame's back plate <b>30</b> should be configured to accommodate electrical components that will extend forward from the front surface <b>15</b> of PCB <b>14</b>. Accordingly it is seen that the rear surface of back plate <b>30</b> includes a central recess <b>34</b> for aligning and receiving solid state image sensor <b>32</b> and peripheral recesses <b>35</b> for accommodating electrical circuitry such as components and/or conductors which may protrude from the front surface of PCB <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition to the features that have been described herein above, it will be seen that additional benefits are yielded by features relating to the overall shape and configuration of module <b>10</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 1D</figref>, sidewalls <b>31</b> and <b>31</b>′ of frame <b>10</b>, together with PCB <b>14</b> and plate <b>26</b> define a module having a substantially cubic rectangular overall form. The cubic rectangular form is highly space efficient relative to the form of optical reader imaging modules in the prior art. With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> it is seen that the form of prior art imaging module <b>52</b> is highly irregular in that it contains members such as member <b>53</b> and member <b>56</b> that protrude extraneously from the major body of module <b>52</b>. The volume conserving cubic rectangular configuration of the module of the present invention facilities incorporation of the module into optical reader housings of smaller interior volume than was possible with the irregular imaging module designs of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The volume conserving cubic rectangular form of module, in addition to facilitating incorporation of the module into a smaller volume optical reader housings, renders the module easier to package. This is because the cubic rectangular form allows several modules to be stacked neatly on top of one another allowing more modules to be packaged in a certain sized container than was possible with modules of previous designs. The stackability of the modules also allows the modules to be packaged more securely without outside securing agents such as bubble paper and/or foam particles, since several modules can be packed in such a way that several modules impart stabilizing tensioning forces on one another. Packaging of several modules in a box or container containing several modules is an important consideration in the case that several modules <b>10</b> are to be transported from a first location where they are assembled to a second location where they are to be incorporated into several optical reader housings.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Another feature relating to the outer configuration of module <b>10</b>, is that the defined outer walls of module <b>10</b> serve as a containment for protecting and preventing damage to relatively fragile and sensitive internal components of the module. In the prior art, with reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is seen that sensitive and fragile and sensitive components of module such as light source <b>53</b> and LED circuit board <b>56</b> extend extraneously from the major body of the module and as such, are susceptible to being brought in contact with external objects especially during transport and during installation of the module into a reader housing. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A–1D</figref>, substantially all fragile sensitive components, including all light sources of module <b>10</b>, and image sensor <b>32</b>, are disposed inside a substantially rigid containment structure defined by sidewalls <b>31</b>, <b>31</b>′ and PCB <b>12</b> and the combination of sidewalls <b>31</b>, <b>31</b>′ and diffuser plate <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The substantially rigid containment of sensitive internal components of the module provided by the combination of sidewalls <b>31</b>, <b>31</b>′ and PCB <b>14</b> and/or the combination of sidewalls <b>31</b>, <b>31</b>′ and diffuser plate <b>26</b> eliminate the need to package the module with shock absorbing material such as bubble paper or foam particles during transport and allows the module to be safely transported from one location to another without substantial risk of damage to sensitive internal components.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Methods for making, and possible material compositions for various components of imaging modules are discussed in commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 09/312,479 incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A block diagram illustrating one type of optical reading device in which the invention may be incorporated is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Optical reader <b>110</b> includes an illumination assembly <b>120</b> for illuminating a target object T, such as a 1D or 2D bar code symbol, and an imaging assembly <b>130</b> for receiving an image of object T and generating an electrical output signal indicative of the data optically encoded therein. Illumination assembly <b>120</b> may, for example, include an illumination source assembly <b>122</b>, such as one or more LEDs, together with an illuminating optics assembly <b>124</b>, such as one or more reflectors, for directing light from light source <b>122</b> in the direction of target object T in module <b>10</b>. The illumination assembly in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A–1D</figref> is provided entirely by LEDs <b>16</b>. Illumination assembly <b>120</b> may be eliminated if ambient light levels are certain to be high enough to allow high quality images of object T to be taken. Imaging assembly <b>130</b> may include an image sensor <b>132</b>, such as a 1D or 2D CCD, CMOS, NMOS, PMOS, CID OR CMD solid state image sensor, together with an imaging optics assembly <b>134</b> for receiving and focusing an image of object T onto image sensor <b>132</b>. The array-based imaging assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> may be replaced by a laser array based imaging assembly comprising multiple laser sources, a scanning mechanism, emit and receive optics, at least one photodetector and accompanying signal processing circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Optical reader <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> also includes programmable control unit <b>140</b> which preferably comprises an integrated circuit microprocessor <b>142</b> and an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC <b>144</b>). The function of ASIC <b>144</b> could also be provided by field programable gate array (FPGA). Processor <b>142</b> and ASIC <b>144</b> are both programmable control devices which are able to receive, output and process data in accordance with a stored program stored in memory unit <b>145</b> which may comprise such memory elements as a read/write random access memory or RAM <b>146</b> and an erasable read only memory or EROM <b>147</b>. RAM <b>146</b> typically includes at least one volatile memory device but may include one or more long term non-volatile memory devices. Processor <b>142</b> and ASIC <b>144</b> are also both connected to a common bus <b>148</b> through which program data and working data, including address data, may be received and transmitted in either direction to any circuitry that is also connected thereto. Processor <b>142</b> and ASIC <b>144</b> differ from one another, however, in how they are made and how they are used.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">More particularly, processor <b>142</b> is preferably a general purpose, off-the-shelf VLSI integrated circuit microprocessor which has overall control of the circuitry of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, but which devotes most of its time to decoding image data stored in RAM <b>146</b> in accordance with program data stored in EROM <b>147</b>. Processor <b>144</b>, on the other hand, is preferably a special purpose VLSI integrated circuit, such as a programmable logic or gate array, which is programmed to devote its time to functions other than decoding image data, and thereby relieve processor <b>142</b> from the burden of performing these functions.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The actual division of labor between processors <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> will naturally depend on the type of off-the-shelf microprocessors that are available, the type of image sensor which is used, the rate at which image data is output by imaging assembly <b>130</b>, etc. There is nothing in principle, however, that requires that any particular division of labor be made between processors <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>, or even that such a division be made at all. This is because special purpose processor <b>144</b> may be eliminated entirely if general purpose processor <b>142</b> is fast enough and powerful enough to perform all of the functions contemplated by the present invention. It will, therefore, be understood that neither the number of processors used, nor the division of labor therebetween, is of any fundamental significance for purposes of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">With processor architectures of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, a typical division of labor between processors <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> will be as follows. Processor <b>142</b> is preferably devoted primarily to such tasks as decoding image data, once such data has been stored in RAM <b>146</b>, recognizing characters represented in stored image data according to an optical character recognition (OCR) scheme, handling menuing options and reprogramming functions, processing commands and data received from control/data input unit <b>139</b> which may comprise such elements as trigger <b>174</b> and keyboard <b>178</b> and providing overall system level coordination. Processor <b>144</b> is preferably devoted primarily to controlling the image acquisition process, the A/D conversion process and the storage of image data, including the ability to access memories <b>146</b> and <b>147</b> via a DMA channel. Processor <b>144</b> may also perform many timing and communication operations. Processor <b>144</b> may, for example, control the illumination of LEDs <b>122</b>, the timing of image sensor <b>132</b> and an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter <b>136</b>, the transmission and reception of data to and from a processor external to reader <b>110</b>, through an RS-232, a network such as an ethernet, or a serial bus such as USB, (or other) compatible I/O interface <b>137</b> and the outputting of user perceptible data via an output device <b>138</b>, such as a beeper, a good read LED and/or a display monitor which may be provided by a liquid crystal display such as display <b>182</b>. Control of output, display and I/O functions may also be shared between processors <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>, as suggested by bus driver I/O and output/display devices <b>137</b>′ and <b>138</b>′ or may be duplicated, as suggested by microprocessor serial I/O ports <b>142</b>A and <b>142</b>B and I/O and display devices <b>137</b>″ and <b>138</b>′. As explained earlier, the specifics of this division of labor is of no significance to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In accordance with a feature of one embodiment of the invention described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, essentially all of the electrical signal processing components described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> may be carried by a single circuit board, PCB <b>14</b>, as is indicated by dashed-in border <b>14</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>. In order to incorporate essentially all of the electrical signal processing components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> onto a single PCB <b>14</b>, it is normally necessary to integrate several electrical components into a reduced number of electrical components. For example, using known integrated circuit fabrication techniques, components <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, and <b>147</b> and interfaces <b>137</b>, <b>137</b>′, and <b>137</b>″ can be incorporated in a single integrated circuit chip of reduced size. Further, as explained in an article by Eric R.
