<heading id="h-0004" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates generally to apparatus and methods for sealing and isolating pipelines. More particularly, the present invention relates to various embodiments of a pipeline sealing and isolation tool that permits sealing of an annular area within a pipeline using a swellable component, and temporary sealing of a flowbore through the tool using a temporary internal seal. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to methods of sealing and isolating a pipeline to perform maintenance, seal leaks, or install permanent devices within the pipeline.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional pipeline maintenance and repair methods comprise first discontinuing normal pipeline operations, then isolating the section of pipeline to be repaired or maintained by closing a valve or providing some other type of seal in the pipeline, and then draining liquids or blowing down gases within the isolated section of pipeline. Once the product is removed from the isolated section of pipeline, repair and/or maintenance operations may then be performed. These operations may include cutting and replacing a leaking section of pipeline and/or installing permanent devices in the pipeline, such as a valve. When making such permanent installations in the pipeline, a structural integrity test, such as a hydrostatic test, may be performed thereafter, in which case the water used in the test must be drained, and in some cases, the pipeline is also dried depending upon the pipeline service. Finally, the pipeline can be re-commissioned with product and normal operations resumed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These conventional methods are both time-consuming and expensive due to the discontinued pipeline operations, the loss of product that may be incurred due to draining or blowing down, and the time and expense associated with cutting into the pipeline to make the actual repair and/or perform the maintenance operation, such as replacing a leaking section of pipeline or installing a permanent device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To address some of these inefficiencies, a pipeline isolation pig has been developed that may be used to isolate a section of pipeline so that maintenance and repair operations may then be performed. The pipeline isolation pig is a remote-controlled device that may be positioned at any desired location within the pipeline to isolate a section of pipeline so as to minimize the amount of product to drain or blow down before performing the work. It may be launched into a pipeline and pushed along by the product while being tracked to its intended destination. Then the pipeline isolation pig may be locked into position to completely seal across the pipeline. Drawbacks to the pipeline isolation pig is that it does not act as a permanent repair device, and it does not permit product flow therethrough. Instead it seals the pipeline in such a way that the seal is only removable by removing the pipeline isolation pig entirely from the pipeline. Hence, after the repair and/or maintenance operations are complete, the pipeline isolation pig must be removed from the pipeline to permit normal pipeline operations to resume.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, a need exists for a more efficient, less costly, and optionally permanent repair apparatus, and methods of performing pipeline maintenance, leak repair, and installation of permanent devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Disclosed herein is a method of performing a servicing operation within a pipeline comprising positioning a swellable component about at a desired location within a pipeline, exposing the swellable component to a swelling agent within the pipeline, expanding the swellable component into sealing engagement with the pipeline, thereby forming a seal across the pipeline, and opening a fluid pathway through the pipeline without removing the swellable component. In various embodiments, the servicing operation comprises repairing a leak in the pipeline wall, or positioning a permanent device within the pipeline. Opening the fluid pathway may comprise opening the permanent device and disengaging a temporary seal connected to the swellable component. The method may further comprise closing the pathway through the pipeline and performing another service operation and tracking the swellable component as it is propelled to the location. In an embodiment, the positioning comprises inserting he swellable component into the pipeline and propelling the swellable component to about the desired location via a flow of fluid. The fluid may be the swelling agent, and the swelling agent may comprise natural gas, a hydrocarbon fluid, water, brine, or another aqueous solution.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also disclosed herein is a method of performing a servicing operation within a pipeline comprising inserting into the pipeline a pipeline tool comprising an externally mounted swellable component, propelling the pipeline tool through the pipeline to about a desired location via a flow of fluid, expanding the swellable component into sealing engagement with the pipeline at about the desired location, and opening a flow path through the pipeline tool. In various embodiments, the method further comprises tracking the pipeline tool during the propelling, or running a pipeline pig through the pipeline tool. In an embodiment, inserting the pipeline tool comprises launching the pipeline tool from a pig launcher. Expanding the swellable component may comprise absorbing the fluid, and opening a flow path through the pipeline tool may comprise disengaging a temporary seal. Expanding the swellable component may comprise sealing a leak in a wall of the pipeline. In an embodiment, the method further comprises closing the flow path through the pipeline tool, and may also comprise depressurizing a section of the pipeline upstream or downstream of the pipeline tool, and performing the servicing operation on the depressurized pipeline section. The method may further comprise re-pressurizing the depressurized pipeline section, reopening the flow path through the pipeline tool, and resuming fluid flow through the flow path. In another embodiment, the method comprises disposing a permanent device within the pipeline tool, and opening the flow path may comprise actuating the permanent device.</p>

As depicted, the tool <b>100</b> comprises a body <b>140</b> with an optional flared tail <b>150</b> and an internal flow cavity <b>160</b>, a plurality of front guide discs <b>170</b> and a plurality of rear guide discs <b>110</b> disposed about the body <b>140</b>, a temporary seal <b>130</b> positioned within the flow cavity <b>160</b>, a swellable component <b>120</b> surrounding the body <b>140</b> and disposed between the sets of guide discs <b>110</b>, <b>170</b>, and a tracking device <b>125</b> secured to the exterior surface of the body <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The body <b>140</b> of the pipeline tool <b>100</b> is operable to transport the swellable component <b>120</b> and the temporary seal <b>130</b> to a desired position along the pipeline <b>190</b> to form a seal across the pipeline <b>190</b> when the swellable component <b>120</b> expands into engagement with the internal pipe wall <b>180</b>. The body <b>140</b> also functions as a secondary pressure barrier against the pressure of the fluid <b>115</b>, with the primary pressure barrier being the temporary seal <b>130</b>. In order for the body <b>140</b> to have sufficient structural strength to perform these functions, the body <b>140</b>, including the optional flared tail <b>150</b>, may be constructed of a metal alloy, such as a steel or ferrous alloy, for example. Moreover, although the body <b>140</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has a solid, smooth-wall configuration, in another embodiment, the body <b>140</b> may be long, thin, flexible and/or corrugated to manipulate turns and corners along the pipeline <b>190</b>. The flared tail <b>150</b> of the body <b>140</b> is an optional feature of the pipeline tool <b>100</b>. When present, the flared tail <b>150</b> facilitates transit of a pipeline pig <b>720</b> through the internal flow cavity <b>160</b> after the pipeline device <b>100</b> is positioned along the pipeline <b>190</b> and the swellable component <b>120</b> is set against the internal pipe wall <b>180</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6E</figref>). The flared tail <b>150</b> also minimizes the accumulation of debris near the pipeline tool <b>100</b> and reduces the effects of flow restrictions that may result due to the reduction in the flowpath caused by the presence of the pipeline tool <b>100</b>. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the angle of the flared tail <b>150</b> may vary, even be optimized, to maximize its effectiveness in reducing debris accumulation and flow restrictions.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The swellable component <b>120</b> may be a chemically activated material that expands over time into sealing engagement with the inner pipe wall <b>180</b> by absorbing the fluid <b>115</b> in the pipeline <b>190</b>. The expanded swellable component <b>120</b> thus seals across the annulus <b>135</b> formed between the pipeline tool <b>100</b> and the inner pipe wall <b>180</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in one embodiment, the swellable component <b>120</b> comprises a core <b>230</b> surrounded by an external membrane <b>210</b> that is permeable to the fluid <b>115</b> and may include an inner reinforcement layer <b>220</b>. In another embodiment, the swellable component <b>120</b> only comprises the core <b>230</b>. The external membrane <b>210</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is designed to surround and protect the core <b>230</b>, but also allows migration of fluid <b>115</b> to the core <b>230</b>. The membrane <b>210</b> is also permeable to the fluid <b>115</b>, but the fluid <b>115</b> permeates the membrane <b>210</b> more slowly than the core <b>230</b>. Thus, the membrane <b>210</b> may control the rate of swelling of the core <b>230</b> such that the tool <b>100</b> may be positioned in the pipeline <b>190</b> and engaged with the inner pipe wall <b>180</b> in a controlled manner. Upon exposure to the fluid <b>115</b>, the core <b>230</b> swells at a known-rate due to absorption of the fluid <b>115</b> and the swellable component <b>120</b> expands into engagement with the inner pipe wall <b>180</b>, eventually forming a seal that prevents fluid <b>115</b> flow through the annulus <b>135</b> between the pipeline tool <b>100</b> and the pipeline <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The choice of material for the core <b>230</b> may depend upon the type of fluid <b>115</b>. The rate at which the core <b>230</b> swells upon exposure to the fluid <b>115</b> may depend primarily the material composition of the core and the viscosity of the fluid, but may also depend upon the construction of the core and/or process parameters such as fluid <b>115</b> temperature and pressure. For example, the core may have a layered construction, where different layers and/or materials are used in the core having different diffusion or swelling properties. In hydrocarbons, including natural gas and liquid hydrocarbons, the core <b>230</b> may be manufactured from an elastic polymer, such as a rubber or rubber-like material selected from the group comprising EPDM, styrene-butadiene rubber, natural rubber, ethylene-propylene monomer rubber, ethylene-vinyl acetate rubber, hydrogenated acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, isoprene rubber, chloroprene rubber or polynorbornene. Other materials may be dissolved in mechanical mixture such as cellulose fibres. Other options for core <b>230</b> materials comprise rubber in mechanical mixture with polyvinyl chloride, methyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile, ethylacetate or other polymers. Where the fluid <b>115</b> is an aqueous fluid, such as water or brine, the core <b>230</b> may be formed using material manufactured from hydrogen dichromate dissolved in water and mixed into a compound of glycerol, diethylene glycol, and polycrylamide.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Depending upon the fluid <b>115</b>, the core <b>230</b> must be chosen such that the swellable component <b>120</b> will expand sufficiently when exposed to the fluid <b>115</b> to form a seal across the annulus <b>135</b> between the pipeline tool <b>100</b> and the inner pipe wall <b>180</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b>. The degree of swelling required depends upon a number of factors, including the width of the annulus <b>135</b>. Material selection and thickness of the membrane <b>210</b>, on the other hand, depends upon the distance the swellable component <b>120</b> must travel to its intended destination while being exposed to the fluid <b>115</b>. If the pipeline tool <b>100</b> must travel a significant distance, the membrane <b>210</b> material and thickness may be chosen such that the swellable component <b>120</b> will not complete its expansion process until after the pipeline tool <b>100</b> reaches its final destination. In that scenario, the membrane <b>210</b> material selected may have a low rate of fluid <b>115</b> permeability and the membrane <b>210</b> thickness may be significant, thereby slowing exposure of the core <b>230</b> to the fluid <b>115</b> and increasing the amount of time for the core <b>230</b> to fully expand so that the pipeline tool <b>100</b> will reach its final destination before the core <b>230</b> has expanded fully. In hydrocarbons, the membrane <b>210</b> may comprise a rubber, for example acrylonitrile, hydrogenated nitrile, chloroprene, ethylene vinylacetate rubber, silicone, ethylene propylene diene monomer, butyl, chlorosulphonated polyethylene, polyurethane, ACM, BIMS or other types of rubber having less expansion or slower diffusion than the core <b>230</b>. Typically, the swellable component <b>120</b> may require one to four days to fully expand. The presence of a thick membrane <b>210</b> with a low rate of permeability to the fluid <b>115</b> may, when needed, slow the core <b>230</b> expansion such that the swellable component <b>120</b> may require a longer time to fully expand. Such a slow expansion rate may be required when the pipeline tool <b>100</b> has a significant distance to travel before reaching its intended destination.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The front guide discs <b>170</b> and the rear guide discs <b>110</b> permit the pipeline tool <b>100</b> to be pushed along the pipeline <b>190</b> by the fluid <b>115</b>. These discs <b>110</b>, <b>170</b> form a sufficient seal with the inner pipe wall <b>180</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b> to prevent the fluid <b>115</b> from bypassing the pipeline tool <b>100</b>. Instead, the fluid <b>115</b> contacts the guide discs <b>110</b>, <b>170</b> and the temporary seal <b>130</b> and pushes the pipeline tool <b>100</b> along the pipeline <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The temporary seal <b>130</b> performs multiple functions. In its closed position, fluid <b>115</b> contacts the temporary seal <b>130</b>, as well as the guide discs <b>110</b>, <b>170</b>, and pushes the pipeline tool <b>100</b> along the pipeline <b>190</b>, as described above. Once the pipeline tool <b>100</b> is positioned at its intended location and the swellable component <b>120</b> has expanded against the inner pipe wall <b>180</b> to anchor the pipeline tool <b>100</b> in place, the temporary seal <b>130</b> permits isolation of a section of pipeline <b>190</b>, upstream or downstream of the temporary seal <b>130</b> from the remainder of the pipeline <b>190</b>. The isolated section of pipeline <b>190</b> may then be depressurized allowing for maintenance, leak repair, or installation of permanent devices such as a valve. Once such operations are complete, the temporary seal <b>130</b> may be selectively opened to permit the fluid <b>115</b> flow to resume through the pipeline <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the temporary seal <b>130</b> may be any device that when closed allows the pipeline tool <b>100</b> to be pushed along the pipeline <b>190</b> by the fluid <b>115</b>, and when open permits fluid <b>115</b> to flow through the internal flow cavity <b>160</b> of the pipeline tool <b>100</b>. The temporary seal <b>130</b> is capable of selective actuation such that it will open when desired to permit fluid <b>115</b> flow through the internal cavity <b>160</b> of the pipeline tool <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, the temporary seal <b>130</b> is only actuatable to open once and can not be closed. In such an embodiment, the temporary seal <b>130</b> may comprise a rupture disc, which is a pressure-containing disc formed of a frangible material designed to burst open and relieve an overpressure at a predetermined differential pressure. In various embodiments, the disc may be formed of a metal or other materials, such as impervious graphite, which is a high-purity form of carbon impregnated with phenolic resin, for example. Instead of a rupture disc, various other types of removable temporary seals <b>130</b> may also be used. Removal or opening of the temporary seal <b>130</b> may be accomplished by a variety of different methods, including mechanically, hydraulically, chemically, electrically, explosively, combustively, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the temporary seal <b>130</b> comprises a material that degrades over time due to exposure to the fluid <b>115</b>, for example. In another embodiment, one or more components of the isolation tool <b>100</b>, for example body <b>140</b>, is made from an acid dissolvable material such as aluminum.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In other embodiments, the temporary seal <b>130</b> is designed not only to be selectively opened, but also to be selectively closed and re-opened as desired to perform additional maintenance or repair on the pipeline <b>190</b>. In such embodiments, the temporary seal <b>130</b> may comprise an electromechanical valve, for example, or another type of open/close device. Actuation of such a temporary seal <b>130</b> may be achieved by a variety of different methods, including mechanically, hydraulically, electrically, or a combination thereof. In various embodiments, the temporary seal <b>130</b> is actuated using a pressure pulse, a pressure differential, a temperature increase or decrease, a magnetic signal, an electronic signal, an electromagnetic signal, a timer, an acoustic signal, an ultrasonic signal, or other through-wall communication.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The tracking device <b>125</b> permits monitoring of the pipeline tool <b>100</b> as it traverses the pipeline <b>190</b>. In an embodiment, the tracking device <b>125</b> is a mechanical fixture attached to the exterior surface of the body <b>140</b>, which is operable to engage a similar mechanical stop <b>185</b> extending into the pipeline <b>190</b> at or near the final destination of the pipeline tool <b>100</b>. The mechanical stop <b>185</b> may be installed using a hot tap fixture <b>195</b>, for example. In this embodiment, when the tracking device <b>125</b> on the pipeline tool <b>100</b> contacts the mechanical stop <b>185</b> extending into the pipeline <b>190</b>, such contact indicates that the pipeline tool <b>100</b> has reached its intended destination, and the mechanical interaction also stops the pipeline tool <b>100</b> at the location.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another embodiment, the tracking device <b>125</b> may be connected to the exterior of the swellable component <b>120</b> such that as swelling occurs, the tracking device <b>125</b> will engage the inner pipe wall <b>180</b> first, and such engagement may stop the pipeline tool <b>100</b> at or near that location. Then the swellable component <b>120</b> continues swelling around the tracking device <b>125</b> until it forms a seal with the inner pipe wall <b>180</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b>. Alternatively, in other embodiments, the tracking device <b>125</b> may comprise a device that emits a tracking signal, such as a magnet, a radioactive isotope, an electronic transmitter, an acoustic transmitter, and an ultra-sonic device, for example, thus revealing the position of the pipeline tool <b>100</b> inside the pipeline <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The pipeline sealing and isolation tool <b>100</b> may be used operationally for a variety of different purposes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3D</figref> schematically depict one embodiment of a pipeline operation wherein the pipeline sealing and isolation tool <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be used to seal an external leak <b>300</b> in a pipeline <b>190</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, upon discovery and location of a pipeline leak <b>300</b>, the pipeline tool <b>100</b> may be inserted into the pipeline <b>190</b> via a pipeline pig launcher <b>710</b> or another means, including placing the pipeline tool <b>100</b> into an open-ended area of the pipeline <b>190</b>. The pipeline tool <b>100</b> is then propelled along the pipeline <b>190</b> by the fluid <b>115</b> towards the leak <b>300</b> location, while the position of the pipeline tool <b>100</b> is monitored using the tracking device <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In alternative embodiments, the pipeline tool <b>100</b> may be moved through the pipeline <b>190</b> via a force or transport means other than fluid flow. For example, the pipeline tool <b>100</b> may comprise a propulsion system and may thereby be self propelled. The propulsion system may be any suitable means for propulsion such as motorized propulsion, for example a motor coupled to a propeller, wheel, tracks, crawler/creeper arms, and the like. Alternatively, the pipeline tool <b>100</b> may be conveyed to a desired location in pipeline <b>190</b> via another tool such as a pig. For example, the pipeline tool <b>100</b> may be pushed or pulled along the pipeline via a tow unit, and the tow unit may be powered by fluid flow or other conveyance means, including self propulsion.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As the pipeline tool <b>100</b> approaches its intended destination within the pipeline <b>190</b>, in this case the location of the leak <b>300</b>, the flow of fluid <b>115</b> may be slowed or discontinued. Without fluid <b>115</b> to push the pipeline tool <b>100</b> via contact with the guide discs <b>110</b>, <b>170</b> and the closed temporary seal <b>130</b>, the pipeline tool <b>100</b> will cease to traverse the pipeline <b>190</b>. Then the position of the pipeline tool <b>100</b> may be determined relative to its intended destination. If the pipeline tool <b>100</b> has stopped upstream of its intended destination, fluid <b>115</b> flow may be resumed briefly to push the pipeline tool <b>100</b> closer to that position. If, on the other hand, the pipeline tool <b>100</b> has traveled beyond its intended destination, fluid <b>115</b> flow may be injected in the opposite direction to push the pipeline tool <b>100</b> upstream to the desired position. The guide discs <b>110</b>, <b>170</b> are bi-directional such that they are designed to permit the pipeline tool <b>100</b> to traverse the pipeline <b>190</b> in either direction.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">During the time that the pipeline tool <b>100</b> is traveling, and upon arrival at the leak <b>300</b> location, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the swellable component <b>120</b> is absorbing the fluid <b>115</b> and expanding across the annulus <b>135</b>, towards the inner pipe wall <b>180</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b> and the leak <b>300</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, once the swellable component <b>120</b> fully expands, it forms a permanent, fluid-tight seal across the annulus <b>135</b> and against the inner pipe wall <b>180</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b> such that the leak <b>300</b> is also sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Once the swellable component <b>120</b> is set, the temporary internal seal <b>130</b> may be opened as described above using some method of actuation. In an embodiment, the temporary seal <b>130</b> is opened by pressuring up the fluid <b>115</b> within the pipeline <b>190</b>. In such an embodiment, the seal formed by the swellable component <b>120</b> against the inner pipe wall <b>180</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b> is designed to withstand the higher pressure of the fluid <b>115</b> operable to open the temporary internal seal <b>130</b>. When the temporary internal seal <b>130</b> is opened, fluid <b>115</b> flow can resume inside the pipeline <b>190</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. Although fluid <b>115</b> flow is reestablished, the pipeline tool <b>100</b> remains firmly in position and the leak <b>300</b> is sealed due to the expanded swellable component <b>120</b>. The pipeline tool <b>100</b> may comprise a permanent leak repair, or may remain in position for an extended period of time until this section of the pipeline <b>190</b> may be cut out and replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The pipeline sealing and isolation tool <b>100</b> may also be used to seat and isolate one section of pipeline <b>190</b> to perform maintenance operations on the pipeline <b>190</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4D</figref> schematically depict one embodiment of a sequence for isolating an upstream section <b>192</b> of pipeline <b>190</b> from a downstream section <b>194</b> using the pipeline sealing and isolation tool <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> so that maintenance operations may be performed on the isolated section <b>192</b> of pipeline <b>190</b>. In an embodiment, the pipeline tool <b>100</b> used to perform maintenance operations on the pipeline <b>190</b> comprises dual temporary internal seals <b>130</b> to ensure fluid-tight isolation between the upstream section <b>192</b> and the downstream section <b>194</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The pipeline tool <b>100</b> is inserted into the pipeline <b>190</b> and propelled along the pipeline <b>190</b> by the fluid <b>115</b>. The position of the pipeline tool <b>100</b> inside the pipeline <b>190</b> may be monitored using the tracking device <b>125</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, when the pipeline tool <b>100</b> reaches its intended destination, it is stopped by discontinuing fluid <b>115</b> flow through the pipeline <b>190</b>. During the time that the pipeline tool <b>100</b> is traveling, and upon arrival at the intended location, the swellable component <b>120</b> is absorbing the fluid <b>115</b> and expanding across the annulus <b>135</b>, towards the inner pipe wall <b>180</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, once the swellable component <b>120</b> fully expands, it forms a permanent fluid-tight seal across the annulus <b>135</b> and against the inner pipe wall <b>180</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b>. Determining when the swellable component <b>120</b> has fully expanded and is set in the pipeline <b>190</b> may be accomplished in a number of ways. In one embodiment, laboratory testing of the core <b>230</b> material and the membrane <b>210</b> may be performed to estimate the rate of expansion for the given fluid <b>115</b>. Then, the amount of time needed to fully expand or set the swellable component <b>120</b> may be calculated as a function of the rate of expansion of the core <b>230</b> and membrane <b>210</b> materials in the given configuration. In another embodiment, a field test may be performed. In particular, when it is estimated that enough time has elapsed for the swellable component <b>120</b> to set, the flow of fluid <b>115</b> may be resumed to pressure up the pipeline <b>190</b> upstream of the pipeline tool <b>100</b>, and if the pipeline tool <b>100</b> moves in response to that pressure, the swellable component <b>120</b> is not set. In another embodiment, strain gauges may be affixed to the body <b>140</b> of the pipeline tool <b>100</b>, and strain levels in the body <b>140</b> of the pipeline tool <b>100</b> may then be monitored. As the swellable component <b>120</b> sets, strain levels in the body <b>140</b> will increase, and strain measurement behavior will indicate when the swellable component <b>120</b> is set.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Once the swellable component <b>120</b> is set as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the upstream section <b>192</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b> is thereby isolated from the downstream section <b>194</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b> by virtue of the fully-expanded swellable component <b>120</b> sealing with the pipeline <b>190</b> and the closed dual temporary seals <b>130</b>. In one embodiment, the isolated upstream section <b>192</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b> may then be depressurized to allow for maintenance operations to be performed. The downstream section <b>194</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b> may remain pressurized because the swellable component <b>120</b> and the dual temporary seals <b>130</b> ensure isolation between the depressurized and pressurized sections of the pipeline <b>190</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, upon completion of maintenance operations, the isolated section <b>192</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b> may be re-pressurized. Finally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, the temporary internal seals <b>130</b> may be opened, as described above, allowing the flow of fluid <b>115</b> to resume inside the pipeline <b>190</b>. Although the flow of fluid <b>115</b> is reestablished, the pipeline tool <b>100</b> remains firmly in position due to the expanded swellable component <b>120</b>. The pipeline tool <b>100</b> may remain in position indefinitely to allow for similar subsequent maintenance operations wherein the dual seals <b>130</b> may be re-actuated to close, and thereby isolate the upstream section <b>192</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b> from the downstream section <b>194</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an alternative embodiment, two our more pipeline tools <b>100</b> may be used to isolate a section of pipeline <b>190</b> between the tools. For example, first and second pipeline tools <b>100</b> may be positioned on either side of a leak <b>300</b> and set, thereby isolating the section of pipe between the tools <b>100</b>, which thereafter may be depressurized and repaired accordingly. In alternatively embodiments, more than one pipeline tool <b>100</b> may be used one or both sides of a portion of pipeline to be isolated. For example, a first pair of pipeline tools <b>100</b> may be positioned on the downstream side of a leak and a second pair of pipeline tools <b>100</b> may be positioned on the upstream side of the leak, thereby isolating the section of pipeline containing the leak upon setting of the tools. Placement and positioning of a plurality of pipeline tools <b>100</b> can be carried out using the methods described herein. For example, a first pipeline tool <b>100</b> may be placed in the pipeline <b>190</b> followed by a sufficient flow of fluid to space the first pipeline tool <b>100</b> a desired distance in front of a second pipeline tool <b>100</b> that is subsequently placed in the pipeline. Additional fluid may be used to convey both tools to a desired location, which may be located as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The pipeline sealing and isolation tool <b>100</b> may also be used to install permanent devices, such as a valve, for example, at a particular location within the pipeline <b>190</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5C</figref> schematically depict a sequence wherein the pipeline sealing and isolation tool <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be used to install a permanent device <b>500</b> positioned internally of the flow cavity <b>160</b> in the body <b>140</b>. In an embodiment, the permanent device <b>500</b> is a ball valve that may be actuated by through-wall communication. In another embodiment, the permanent device <b>500</b> is a check valve. In another embodiment, the permanent device is a submersible pump, for example an electrical submersible pump (ESP). In an embodiment, an ESP is pumped into a production riser, for example an offshore production riser. The ESP may be placed in the production riser, for example, near the base of a deep water production riser, where the pump may be used to boost production by removing all or a portion of the hydrostatic head back pressure from the well head located on the sea floor.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5C</figref>, the closed permanent device <b>500</b> provides a seal to replace the temporary seal <b>130</b> in previous embodiments.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, once the swellable component <b>120</b> fully expands, it forms a permanent fluid-tight seal across the annulus <b>135</b> and against the inner pipe wall <b>180</b> of the pipeline <b>190</b>. Determining when the swellable component <b>120</b> is fully expanded and set may be accomplished by methods discussed above, including laboratory testing of the core <b>230</b> material and membrane <b>210</b> material, pressuring up the pipeline <b>190</b> to see if the pipeline tool <b>100</b> moves in response to the pressure, or monitoring strain levels in the body <b>140</b> of the pipeline tool <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, once the swellable component <b>120</b> is set, the permanent device <b>500</b> may be opened using an electronic signal, another type of through-wall communication, or another method, such as a pressure pulse, for example. Once the permanent device <b>500</b> is opened, the flow of fluid <b>115</b> may resume inside the pipeline <b>190</b>. Although the flow of fluid <b>115</b> is reestablished, the pipeline tool <b>100</b> remains firmly in position due to the expanded swellable component <b>120</b> and may remain so for an indefinite period of time. As a result, the permanent device <b>500</b> will also remain fixed in this position and may be actuated to control fluid <b>115</b> flow through the pipeline <b>190</b> at this location.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of pipeline scaling and isolation tools and methods of utilizing such tools to perform maintenance, leak repair, and installation operations on pipelines have been presented for purposes of illustration and description and are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Obviously many other modifications and variations of these embodiments are possible. In particular, maintenance, repair and installation operations may vary. For example, these methods disclose stopping the pipeline device at its intended destination by discontinuing fluid flow in the pipeline. Other methods of stopping the pipeline device may be utilized, such as opening the temporary sealing devices <b>130</b> or permanent devices <b>500</b> while maintaining the flow of fluid <b>115</b>. Moreover, design of the pipeline tool body <b>140</b> may vary. Instead of the smooth-walled, solid structure disclosed, the body may comprise a corrugated, flexible housing to permit maneuvering through pipelines with numerous turns and corners. Further, the taper of the flared tail <b>150</b> may be optimized to minimize the effects of debris accumulation near the pipeline tool <b>100</b> and flow restrictions due to the presence of the pipeline tool <b>100</b> in the fluid <b>115</b> flowpath. The material comprising the swellable component <b>120</b> may vary depending on the type of fluid <b>115</b> inside the pipeline <b>190</b>, whether a hydrocarbon, water, brine or other aqueous solution.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While various embodiments of pipeline sealing and isolation tools and methods of utilizing those tools to perform maintenance, leak repair and installation operations on pipelines have been shown and described herein, modifications may be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and the teachings of the invention. The embodiments described are representative only, and are not intended to be limiting. Many variations, combinations, and modifications of the applications disclosed herein are possible and are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the scope of protection is not limited by the description set out above, but is defined by the claims which follow, that scope including all equivalents of the subject matter of the claims.</p>
