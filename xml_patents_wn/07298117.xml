<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a step-up type DC-DC converter and a method for controlling the step-up type DC-DC converter. More specifically, this invention relates to a DC-DC converter that is capable of being started up by a low input voltage and that has high efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A portable electronic device that uses batteries as a power source includes a DC-DC converter by which the voltage of the batteries is raised to a voltage necessary for the electronic device. Especially in a small-size portable electronic device, the number of batteries that can be mounted on the electronic device is small, and hence an extremely low voltage must be raised to a desired voltage of the electronic device. Additionally, since a battery-operated electronic device is required to be operated by a small number of batteries for a longer time, a DC-DC converter of the electronic device is required to have higher efficiency. In order to actuate the DC-DC converter from the state of a low input voltage and allow the DC-DC converter to work with high efficiency, Japanese unexamined patent publication No. H08(1996)-186980 proposes the following method.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to circuits disclosed by the publication '980 shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an oscillation/starting circuit <b>109</b> causes switching of a bipolar transistor <b>105</b><i>b </i>to generate a power of boosted voltage that is fed to a load when the voltage of a power source that is fed to the load is lower than a voltage value by which a MOS transistor can be turned on/off. When the boosted voltage reaches a proper voltage by which an oscillation/driving circuit <b>108</b> of a DC/DC converter of the MOS transistor is operated, the switching operation of the bipolar transistor <b>105</b><i>b </i>is stopped, and the MOS transistor <b>105</b><i>a </i>is actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese unexamined patent publication Nos. H03(1991)-74169, H01(1989)-295665, and 2001-251849 are disclosed as techniques related to the above publication '980.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the method disclosed by the publication '980 described above, at least one bipolar transistor <b>105</b><i>b </i>is needed as a main switching transistor in order to actuate the DC-DC converter in the state of a low input voltage. Additionally, in order to operate the DC-DC converter with high efficiency, another MOS transistor <b>105</b><i>a</i>, which is used as a main switching transistor, is needed. In other words, a plurality of main switching transistors are needed. Therefore, disadvantageously, the circuits are made complex, and are increased in size.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been made to solve at least one of the problems of the conventional techniques. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a DC-DC converter capable of being started up in the state of a low input voltage and capable of being structured without increasing a circuit size, and provide a method for controlling the DC-DC converter.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To achieve the purpose above, there is provided a step-up type DC-DC converter comprising: a main switching transistor that is an N-type conductive element; a comparator that makes a comparison between a reference voltage and an output voltage and makes a discrimination between a first period during which the output voltage is lower than the reference voltage and a second period during which the output voltage is higher than the reference voltage; and a back-gate control unit that, in accordance with a comparison result obtained from the comparator, sets a back-gate voltage of the main switching transistor at a first back-gate voltage during the first period, and sets the back-gate voltage thereof at a second back-gate voltage lower than the first back-gate voltage during the second period.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The main switching transistor is an N-type conductive element in which a back-gate terminal and a source terminal are independent of each other. The comparator makes a comparison between the reference voltage and the output voltage of the DC-DC converter. Accordingly, the comparator makes a discrimination between a first period during which the output voltage is lower than the reference voltage and a second period during which the output voltage is higher than the reference voltage. For example, the first period is a period at the initial start of the DC-DC converter. For example, the second period is a period after the initial-start period elapses and then a steady state is reached. The back-gate control unit performs control operations in accordance with a comparison result obtained from the comparator. The back-gate voltage of the main switching transistor is defined as a first back-gate voltage during the first period, whereas the back-gate voltage thereof is defined as a second back-gate voltage during the second period. Herein, the second back-gate voltage is lower than the first back-gate voltage. For example, when the first back-gate voltage is a grounded voltage, the second back-gate voltage is set to be a negative voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The DC-DC converter according to the present invention is a step-up type DC-DC converter that works while using its own output voltage as a supply voltage. When the DC-DC converter is started up, the output voltage of the DC-DC converter is lower than the reference voltage. At this time, the comparator shows a judgment result to the effect that this is the first period during which the output voltage is lower than the reference voltage. In accordance with the comparison result, the back-gate control unit sets the back-gate voltage of the main switching transistor at the first back-gate voltage value that is higher than the second back-gate voltage value. Therefore, the back-gate voltage value during the first period is made higher than that during the second period, and, accordingly, the threshold voltage of the main switching transistor during the first period is made lower than that during the second period. Herein, the amplitude of a control signal applied onto the gate of the main switching transistor during the first period is smaller than that during the second period. However, the main switching transistor can be operated to be turned on/off by lowering the threshold voltage during the first period.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In response to the operation of the main switching transistor, the output voltage of the DC-DC converter is gradually raised. Accordingly, the output voltage of the DC-DC converter becomes higher than the reference voltage, and the DC-DC converter shifts to a steady state. At this time, the comparator shows a comparison result to the effect that this is the second period during which the output voltage is higher than the second reference voltage. In accordance with the comparison result, the back-gate control unit changes the back-gate voltage of the main switching transistor from the first back-gate voltage value to the second back-gate voltage value. Since the second back-gate voltage is lower than the first back-gate voltage, the threshold voltage of the main switching transistor is raised.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As a result, the threshold voltage of the main switching transistor can be set to be low during the first period (for example, when the DC-DC converter is started up), and can be set to be high during the second period (for example, in the steady state). Therefore, the DC-DC converter can be started up even when the input voltage is low, and the main switching transistor can be brought into a completely electrically non-conductive state during the steady operation. Therefore, one main switching transistor can be used both as a transistor for initial start and as a transistor for steady operation. Hence, high efficiency can be achieved by preventing a leakage current, and the circuit size can be reduced.</p>

It is to be expressly understood, however, that the drawings are for the purpose of illustration only and are not intended as a definition of the limits of the invention.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an input voltage Vin is inputted to an input terminal of the choke coil L<b>1</b>.

The resistance elements R<b>3</b> and R<b>4</b> are connected in series between the output voltage Vout and the back-gate voltage Vsb through the node N<b>2</b>. The node N<b>2</b> is connected to a non-inverting input terminal of the comparator COMP, whereas a reference voltage e<b>2</b> is connected to an inverting input terminal thereof. The voltage of the node N<b>2</b> is obtained by dividing a voltage between the output voltage Vout and the back-gate voltage Vsb by the resistance elements R<b>3</b> and R<b>4</b>. Herein, the reference voltage e<b>2</b> is a target voltage value of the back-gate voltage Vsb during the steady operation of the DC-DC converter <b>1</b>, and is a predetermined value. The threshold voltage Vth of the transistor FET<b>1</b> is determined by the back-gate voltage Vsb, as described later, and the leakage current and the driving ability of the transistor FET<b>1</b> are determined by the threshold voltage Vth. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the value of the reference voltage e<b>2</b> so that the leakage current and the driving ability of the transistor FET<b>1</b> satisfy the specifications of the DC-DC converter <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A control signal SS<b>2</b> outputted from the comparator COMP is inputted to the oscillator OSC<b>2</b>. An oscillation signal OS<b>2</b> outputted from the oscillator OSC<b>2</b> is inputted to the switches SW<b>11</b> and SW<b>12</b>. A negative phase signal of the control signal SS<b>1</b> is inputted to the comparator COMP and an enabling terminal of the oscillator OSC<b>2</b>. The switch SW<b>13</b> is connected in parallel with the output capacitor Cout. The control signal SS<b>1</b> is inputted to the switch SW<b>13</b>. The back-gate voltage Vsb is outputted from the back-gate voltage generating circuit VBGN.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">First, a description will be given of the operation of the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> performed when the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> is started up. In response to actuation of the DC-DC converter <b>1</b>, an input voltage Vin is first applied. The value of the input voltage Vin is set at 0.9(V) or so when a battery is used, for example. An output voltage Vout lowered from the input voltage Vin by the forward-direction voltage drop amount of the diode D<b>1</b> is outputted from the diode D<b>1</b>. The output voltage Vout is inputted to the comparator UVLO and the error amplifier ERA<b>1</b>. Since the output voltage Vout is lower than the reference voltage e<b>0</b> when started up, a high-level control signal SS<b>1</b> is outputted from the comparator UVLO.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The oscillator OSC<b>1</b> is operable even when a supply voltage is in a low-voltage state, and hence the oscillator OSC<b>1</b> can be actuated even by an input voltage Vin of 0.9(V). Therefore, in response to the input of the high-level control signal SS<b>1</b>, the oscillator OSC<b>1</b> starts oscillations in predetermined cycles, and outputs an oscillation signal OS<b>1</b>. In response to the input of the high-level control signal SS<b>1</b>, the switch SW<b>1</b> selects the oscillation signal OS<b>1</b>, and inputs this to the gate of the transistor FET<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A description will be given of the operation of the back-gate voltage generating circuit VBGN with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. An inverted signal of the high-level control signal SS<b>1</b> is inputted to the comparator COMP and the enabling terminal of the oscillator OSC<b>2</b>, and, in response to the input of the signal, these circuits reach an operation-stopped state. Therefore, the switch control portion <b>6</b> and the charge pump portion <b>5</b> are in the operation-stopped state. The switch SW<b>13</b> reaches an electrically conductive state in response to the input of the high-level control signal SS<b>1</b> to the switch SW<b>13</b>. Therefore, the back-gate voltage Vsb is set to be a grounded voltage by the switch SW<b>13</b> during a period during which the output voltage Vout of the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> is lower than the reference voltage e<b>0</b>. In order to prevent the transistor FET<b>1</b> from being damaged by the occurrence of a through-current, the back-gate voltage Vsb is required to be controlled so as not to become higher than the source voltage. In this embodiment, both the source voltage and the back-gate voltage Vsb are set to be the grounded voltage when the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> is started up, and hence there is no risk that the back-gate voltage Vsb will become higher than the source voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An oscillation signal OS<b>1</b> having a small amplitude corresponding to the input voltage Vin is inputted to the gate terminal of the transistor FET<b>1</b>, and a grounded voltage is inputted to the back-gate terminal. Let the value of the threshold voltage Vth of the transistor FET<b>1</b> in a case in which the back-gate voltage Vsb at this time is set as the grounded voltage be a reference threshold voltage Vto. Herein, since the transistor FET<b>1</b> is a transistor produced so that the standard threshold voltage Vto becomes low beforehand, current conducting/non-conducting operations are performed in accordance with the oscillation signal OS<b>1</b> having a small amplitude. Accordingly, the output voltage Vout of the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> is gradually raised by the operation of the transistor FET<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, a description will be given of the operation of the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> that is in a steady state. When the output voltage Vout of the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> is raised so as to become higher than the reference voltage e<b>0</b>, the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> changes from the start-up state to the steady state. The control signal SS<b>1</b> of the comparator UVLO makes a transit from the high level to the low level. In response to the input of a low-level control signal SS<b>1</b>, the oscillator OSC<b>1</b> stops the oscillations. In response to the input of the low-level control signal SS<b>1</b>, the switch SW<b>1</b> performs a switchover so as to connect the output terminal of the PWM comparator PC included in the PWM control circuit <b>3</b> to the gate terminal of the transistor FET<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When shifted to the steady state, the PWM control circuit <b>3</b> starts its operation. The error amplifier ERA<b>1</b> makes a comparison between the reference voltage e<b>1</b> and the voltage obtained by dividing the output voltage Vout by the resistance elements R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>, and outputs a voltage corresponding to a difference therebetween to the PWM comparator PC. The PWM comparator PC is an output voltage pulse width converter, and outputs a pulse when the output voltage of the error amplifier ERA<b>1</b> is higher than the output voltage of the triangular-wave oscillator CHO. Therefore, the PWM comparator PC outputs a pulse signal PS having a pulse width corresponding to the magnitude of the output voltage of the error amplifier ERA<b>1</b>. The pulse signal PS is inputted to the gate of the transistor FET<b>1</b> through the switch SW<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a description will be given of the operation of the back-gate voltage generating circuit VBGN being in a steady state. An inverted signal of a low-level control signal SS<b>1</b> is inputted to the comparator COMP and the enabling terminal of the oscillator OSC<b>2</b>, and, in response thereto, these circuits reach an operation start-upstate. Accordingly, the switch control portion <b>6</b> and the charge pump portion <b>5</b> start their operations. Further, the low-level control signal SS<b>1</b> is inputted to the switch SW<b>13</b>, and, in response thereto, the switch SW<b>13</b> reaches an electrically non-conductive state. Therefore, the back-gate voltage Vsb serves as the output voltage of the charge pump portion <b>5</b> during a period during which the output voltage Vout of the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> is higher than the reference voltage e<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the voltage value of the node N<b>2</b> becomes higher than the reference voltage e<b>2</b>, the comparator COMP of the switch control portion <b>6</b> outputs a high-level control signal SS<b>2</b> to the oscillator OSC<b>2</b>. In response to the input of the high-level control signal SS<b>2</b>, the oscillator OSC<b>2</b> starts oscillations in predetermined cycles, and outputs an oscillation signal OS<b>2</b>. During a period during which the oscillation signal OS<b>2</b> maintains the high level, the switch SW<b>11</b> is connected to the node N<b>11</b><i>a </i>so as to supply the output voltage Vout, whereas the switch SW<b>12</b> is connected to the node N<b>12</b><i>a </i>so as to supply the ground voltage. Accordingly, the input capacitor Cin is charged with the output voltage Vout, so that an electric charge is stored. On the other hand, during a period during which the oscillation signal OS<b>2</b> maintains the low level, the switch SW<b>11</b> is connected to the node N<b>11</b><i>b</i>, whereas the switch SW<b>12</b> is connected to the node N<b>12</b><i>b</i>, so that the connection between the input capacitor Cin and the output capacitor Cout becomes parallel. Therefore, the electric charge of the input capacitor Cin is transferred to the output capacitor Cout. Since the switch SW<b>11</b> disposed on the side of the positive electrode of the input capacitor Cin is connected to the ground at this time, the output capacitor Cout is charged with a negative voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The negative voltage of the output capacitor Cout gradually rises, and the voltage value of the node N<b>2</b> decreases by repeating this operation in response to the oscillation signal OS<b>2</b>. When the voltage value of the node N<b>2</b> becomes lower than the reference voltage e<b>2</b>, the level of the control signal SS<b>2</b> becomes low, so that the oscillation signal OS<b>2</b> cannot be outputted. As a result, the charge pump portion <b>5</b> is stopped, and the voltage of the node N<b>2</b> is controlled to be equal to the reference voltage e<b>2</b>, thus making it possible to regulate the back-gate voltage Vsb so as to be equal to a predetermined negative voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A description will be given of an effect, which is produced by controlling the back-gate voltage Vsb, in the transistor FET<b>1</b>. In order to actuate the transistor FET<b>1</b> in a state of having a low input voltage, for example, when the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> is started up, the transistor FET<b>1</b> is produced so that the threshold voltage Vth becomes low. Therefore, since the operation of the transistor FET<b>1</b> in an electrically non-conductive state is imperfect, a leakage current is generated when a high voltage is applied to the drain. On the other hand, in a steady state, a pulse signal PS having a great amplitude is inputted into the gate of the transistor FET<b>1</b>, and hence the transistor FET<b>1</b> can be actuated without lowering the threshold voltage Vth. Therefore, in order to reduce the leakage current, it is necessary to perform control so that the threshold voltage Vth becomes low at the start-up and becomes high during the steady operation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The value of the threshold voltage Vth of the transistor FET<b>1</b> at this time is expressed by the following equation (1):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Vth=Vto</i>−γ((2<i>Φf+Vsb</i>)<sup>1/2</sup>−(2<i>Φf</i>)<sup>1/2</sup>)  Equation (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this equation, the reference threshold voltage Vto is a threshold value of the transistor FET<b>1</b> obtained when the back-gate voltage is the ground voltage. Parameters γ and Φf are constants fixed by a process.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Therefore, at the start-up, the threshold value can be made equal to the reference threshold voltage Vto by setting the back-gate voltage Vsb at the ground voltage. It is understood from Equation (1) that, during the steady operation, the threshold voltage Vth can be made higher than the reference threshold voltage Vto by setting the back-gate voltage Vsb to be a negative voltage outputted from the charge pump portion <b>5</b>. In the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the back-gate voltage Vsb is regulated to be a predetermined negative voltage by the back-gate voltage generating circuit VBGN during the steady operation, and hence the threshold voltage Vth can be made higher than the reference threshold voltage Vto.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thus, a rise in the threshold voltage Vth of the transistor FET<b>1</b> makes it possible to bring the transistor FET<b>1</b> serving as a power device into a completely electrically non-conductive state, and makes it possible to prevent the occurrence of a leakage current. Therefore, the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> can have high efficiency. Since the threshold voltage Vth of the transistor FET<b>1</b> is made low at the start-up, a leakage current is generated. However, no problem arises, because the start-up state lasts only a short time, so that an influence exerted on power consumption is negligible. Additionally, since the switch SW<b>1</b> is structured to be operable even by a low voltage power source, a leakage current is generated during the steady operation. However, no problem arises, because this leakage current is satisfactorily smaller than the leakage current of the transistor FET<b>1</b> serving as a power device.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As described in detail above, the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> according to this embodiment supplies a raised output voltage Vout generated by the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> so as to be used as a power source for the DC-DC converter, and includes the oscillator OSC<b>1</b> that operates by a low voltage for initial start-up and the transistor FET<b>1</b> that has a low threshold voltage Vth. The DC-DC converter <b>1</b> further includes the back-gate voltage generating circuit VBGN that controls the back-gate voltage of the transistor FET<b>1</b>, whereby variable control can be performed so that the threshold voltage Vth of the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> becomes low at the start-up, and becomes high during the steady operation. As a result, the transistor FET<b>1</b> can be actuated in the low-voltage state at the start-up, and the transistor FET<b>1</b> can be prevented from generating a leakage current in the high-voltage state during the steady operation. Therefore, the transistor FET<b>1</b> can also be used as a transistor for initial start-up and as a transistor for a steady operation, and hence high efficiency can be achieved by preventing the leakage current, and the circuit size can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Obviously, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment, and can be variously improved or modified within the scope not departing from the gist of the present invention. In the above embodiment, the switch SW<b>1</b> is allowed to select and change a circuit that drives the gate of the transistor FET<b>1</b> from between the start-up control circuit <b>2</b> and the PWM control circuit <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, the present invention is not limited to this form. If the gate of the transistor FET<b>1</b> has a multi-gate structure in which a plurality of gates are laid out with respect to a pair of source/drain, a part of the multi-gate of the transistor FET<b>1</b> can be connected to the oscillator OSC<b>1</b>, and the remaining gates can be connected to the PWM comparator PC as in a DC-DC converter <b>1</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. At this time, the number of gates connected to the oscillator OSC<b>1</b> is made smaller than that of gates connected to the PWM comparator PC. In the DC-DC converter <b>1</b><i>a</i>, a control signal SS<b>1</b> is inputted to an enabling terminal (not shown) of the oscillator OSC<b>1</b>. Further, an inverted signal of the control signal SS<b>1</b> is inputted to an enabling terminal (not shown) of the error amplifier ERA<b>1</b>, the triangular-wave oscillator CHO, and the PWM comparator PC. The other structures are the same as in the DC-DC converter <b>1</b>, and a detailed description of these structures is omitted here.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> is started up, the oscillator OSC<b>1</b> reaches an operational state in response to a high-level control signal SS<b>1</b>, so that an oscillation signal OS<b>1</b> is outputted. Further, an inverted signal of the control signal SS<b>1</b> brings the error amplifier ERA<b>1</b>, the triangular-wave oscillator CHO, and the PWM comparator PC into a stopped state, so that a pulse signal PS is not outputted. Therefore, according to the oscillation signal OS<b>1</b>, the transistor FET<b>1</b> performs electrically conductive/non-conductive operations, and the output voltage Vout of the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> is gradually raised.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the other hand, when the DC-DC converter <b>1</b> is in a steady state, the oscillator OSC<b>1</b> reaches a stopped state in response to a low-level control signal SS<b>1</b>, so that an oscillation signal OS<b>1</b> is not outputted. Further, an inverted signal of the control signal SS<b>1</b> brings the error amplifier ERA<b>1</b>, the triangular-wave oscillator CHO, and the PWM comparator PC into an operational state, so that a pulse signal PS is outputted. Therefore, the on-duty of the transistor FET<b>1</b> is controlled according to the pulse signal PS. Therefore, in the DC-DC converter <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the switch SW<b>1</b> can be omitted, and the circuit size of the DC-DC converter can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Additionally, the oscillator OSC<b>1</b> actuated at the start-up is small in the driving ability. However, since gate capacitance that is small in capacitance is driven because of a structure in which a part of the multi-gate is connected to the oscillator OSC<b>1</b>, the load of the oscillator OSC<b>1</b> can be reduced at the start-up, and the oscillator OSC<b>1</b> can be operated even by a low voltage. In this case, the on-resistance of the transistor FET<b>1</b> at the start-up becomes large. However, no problem arises, because the start-up state lasts only a short time, so that an influence exerted on power consumption is negligible. Additionally, since most of the multi-gate is connected to the PWM comparator PC working during the steady operation, the on-resistance of the transistor FET<b>1</b> working during the steady operation can be satisfactorily reduced, and the DC-DC converter can be prevented from lowering its efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is to be noted that the start-up period is an example of the first period, the steady state period is an example of the second period, the reference voltage e<b>0</b> is an example of the reference voltage, the charge pump portion <b>5</b> is an example of the second back-gate voltage generating portion, the start-up control circuit <b>2</b> is an example of the first control unit, the PWM control circuit <b>3</b> is an example of the second control unit, the switch SW<b>13</b> is an example of the first switch portion, and the switch SW<b>1</b> is an example of the second switch portion.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to the DC-DC converter and the method for controlling the DC-DC converter of the present invention, the DC-DC converter can be started up even when an input voltage is low. Additionally, high efficiency can be achieved by preventing a leakage current, and an increase in the circuit size can be prevented.</p>
