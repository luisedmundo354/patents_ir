<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to the field of wireless communication systems and, more particularly, to a system and related methods for clustering multi-point communication targets</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wireless communication systems are not new. Indeed, two-way radio technology dates back to the beginning of the 20<sup>th </sup>century, while its progeny, cellular telephony systems, were first introduced in the early 70's. In traditional wireless communication systems, a wireless communication station facilitates wireless communication with remote communication device(s) (e.g., wireless subscriber units, mobile computing devices, and the like) via a wireless communication link(s). As the technology developed and the cost associated with owning and using such wireless communication devices has decreased, the popularity of the wireless telephony systems has exploded. To accommodate this growth in the subscriber base, digital cellular techniques were developed and standardized to increase user capacity of the cellular system without a commensurate increase in the radio frequency (RF) power generated within the system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Initially, individual communication channels were defined as a carrier frequency, i.e., the so-called Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) wireless systems. More recently, a number of different digital wireless communication technologies have been introduced and provide the basis for a number of wireless communication system architectures. Two primary examples of digital wireless technology are the time-division multiple access (TDMA) and code-division multiple access (CDMA) technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a TDMA system, a carrier frequency is parsed into independent incremental units of time, referred to as a timeslot, wherein each timeslot at a carrier frequency supports an independent communication session between a subscriber unit (or, handset) and a communication station (or, base station). That is, while a communication channel in a conventional analog (FDMA) communication system is commonly defined by its carrier frequency, a communication channel in a TDMA system is defined by a timeslot on a particular carrier frequency. Carving a given carrier frequency into N-independent timeslots results in an N-fold increase in system capacity over traditional FDMA system, with only a nominal increase in radiated power. In practice, an increase in capacity of two- to eight-fold has been achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a CDMA system, a communication channel is defined by a pseudo-noise (PN) code contained in the header of digital communication packets passed between the subscriber unit and the communication station. To further enhance system capacity, the CDMA system is a spread-spectrum system wherein the communication channel (defined by the PN code) hops through any of a number of carrier frequencies over an assigned band of radio frequency (or higher) spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the wireless communication link between any two communicating entities is often the weakest portion of a communication chain, especially when the location of one or more of the entities is uncontrolled and moves. Under such circumstances, the radio link can become weak as the distance between the entities increases, or as obstacles occur in the physical path of the signal propagation. Furthermore, in the multiple access communication systems discussed above (e.g., FDMA, TDMA, CDMA, etc.) carrier frequency reuse is employed to support communication sessions among a number of geographically dispersed users. Such co-channel users are supposed to be separated geographically by sufficient distance so that their respective communication sessions do not interfere with one another. This constraint of geographic separation in frequency reuse limits the capacity of the system, and is often an imperfect guard against interference.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Adaptive array technology offers increased performance in such radio frequency (RF) networks by employing multiple antennae for radio transmission from one or more of the entities, controlling one or more of the relative phase and amplitude of the signal transmitted from each antenna within the array to spatially direct the RF energy towards desired recipients, and away from co-channel users.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This technique is very effective when the communication link is a point-to-point link, i.e., a wireless communication channel dedicated to communication between a single user terminal and a basestation, such as in conventional two-way communication systems. In an increasingly large number of wireless communication implementations, however, there is more than one intended recipient of a communication link, each of which should be able to receive the signal. An example of just such an implementation is the general packet radio service, or GPRS.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that GPRS, as originally conceived, is implemented over a TDMA-based wireless communication system, wherein up to eight different users may selectively share a communication channel. From the end-user perspective, the GPRS service managed by a GPRS-enabled communication station provides a virtual packet-switched network utilizing circuit-switched communication resources of the TDMA system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a packet-based communication systems such as the GPRS facilitate the so-called “always on” connection to services via the communication link. In as much as conventional adaptive array techniques were derived in the context of a point-to-point communication link, it has been thought that two-way, multi-point, or “broadcast”, systems were not amenable to implementations of adaptive array technology.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, a system and related methods enabling adaptive array technology within broadcast wireless communication systems is required, unencumbered by the limitations commonly associated with prior art broadcast systems. Just such a system and related methods are disclosed, below.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention is directed to a system and related methods of beamforming in a multi-point communications environment, i.e., wherein multiple targets dynamically share physical communication resources. In accordance with one example implementation, the teachings of the present invention are developed within the context of a GPRS system implemented over a TDMA wireless communication system. In this regard, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention to be developed more fully below, a multi-point communication agent is introduced comprising one or more of a clustering engine and/or a beamforming engine is presented. According to one example implementation to be developed more fully below, the clustering engine is selectively invoked to analyze spatial signature attributes of one or more target(s) for which a communication link is intended. Given the spatial signature attributes, target(s) are grouped into clusters and a cluster spatial signature is developed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Once a cluster spatial signature is developed, beamforming engine is selectively invoked to generate weighting value(s) applied to a transmitted signal to establish a communication link beam between the transmitting communicating entity and the target(s) of the cluster(s). In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, beamforming engine selectively generates a multi-node wireless communication link beam to targets, of which there is some information regarding their spatial signature, to which simultaneous transmission of the same signal is desirable. According to one example implementation, beamforming engine identifies multiple targets which may benefit from simultaneous reception of the wireless communication link, and develops weighting values (associated with each antenna in an array) to generate a multi-node beam to establish a communication link to each of the identified targets. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the teachings of the present invention facilitate adaptive antenna technology in a wireless data services environment and, in this regard, is well-suited to implementation within a GPRS data services system.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides a block diagram of an example communication system <b>100</b> in which the teachings of the present invention may well be practiced, in accordance with one example implementation of the present invention. In accordance with the illustrated example implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the communication system <b>100</b> includes at least a wireless communication system component <b>102</b> comprising one or more user terminal(s) <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> coupled to a wireless communication station <b>114</b> through one or more wireless communication links <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, respectively. In accordance with one example implementation, the wireless communication system component <b>102</b> is coupled to one or more wireline network(s) <b>104</b> to facilitate communication with wireline subscriber units <b>116</b> and <b>120</b>. In addition, wireless communication system <b>102</b> may well be coupled to one or more data network(s) <b>122</b> to facilitate delivery of enhanced data services from, e.g., data service provider(s) <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with one example implementation, wireless communication system <b>102</b> employs a time division multiple access (TDMA) communication protocol in delivery of wireless communication services wherein a communication channel is defined as a timeslot within a carrier frequency. To facilitate wireless communication between communicating entities <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>114</b>, each of such entities include at least one transmitter and one receiver, perhaps combined within a transceiver. As shown, certain of the communicating entities may well include multiple transceivers to facilitate multiple simultaneous communication links, e.g., communication station <b>114</b> with transceivers <b>116</b>A . . . N. In addition to delivery of wireless voice communication services, wireless communication system <b>102</b> is enabled to delivery enhanced data services such as, general packet radio service (GPRS) in accordance with the TDMA paradigm. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that while the features of the present invention are described within the context of a TDMA-base wireless communication system offering GPRS, the teachings of the present invention are more broadly applicable to the delivery of any information (data, voice, etc.) to multiple target(s) using any of a number of multiple access wireless technologies (e.g., FDMA, CDMA, etc.) without deviating from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As used herein, the user terminals <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> are intended to represent any of a wide variety of electronic appliances configured for wireless communications including, for example, wireless telephony subscriber units, wireless-enabled computing devices, and the like. In accordance with one example implementation, one or more user terminal(s) <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> are endowed with the multi-point communications agent discussed more fully below to establish a two-way wireless communication link with multiple target(s) (i.e., entities with which two-way communications are established).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Similarly, communication station <b>114</b> (also referred to as a basestation) is intended to represent any of a wide variety of communication stations supporting at least TDMA wireless communications. As shown, communication station <b>114</b> is endowed with one or more wireless transceivers (transmitter/receiver combination) to facilitate wireless communication with other communicating entities (e.g., subscriber units, wireless electronic appliances, other basestations, etc.) using a wireless communication link. In accordance with the illustrated example implementation, at least one of such transceivers <b>116</b>A . . . N is a TDMA transceiver. According to one example implementation, at least one of the TDMA transceiver(s) includes GPRS facilities to support the general packet radio service to one or more requesting user terminal(s) <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition to the conventional point-to-point communication links <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, certain of the communicating entities (e.g., communication station(s), user terminals, etc.) of the wireless communication system <b>102</b> include multi-point communication resources to establish communication link beam(s) to one or more cluster(s), each cluster comprising one or more target(s). That is, as will be described and illustrated more fully below, one or more of the transceivers comprising wireless user terminals <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and/or communication station(s) <b>114</b> include a multi-point communication agent to facilitate simultaneous transmission to one or more target(s) in one or more cluster(s) using communication link beam(s) generated in accordance with a spatial signature for each of the cluster(s).

<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Example Wireless Communication System Transceiver</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Having introduced the operating environment above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an example communication system transceiver <b>200</b> incorporating an innovative multi-point communication agent, in accordance with one example implementation of the present invention. In accordance with the illustrated example implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the transceiver is depicted comprising control logic <b>202</b>, memory <b>204</b>, at least one transmitter <b>206</b>, at least one receiver <b>208</b>, a multi-point communications agent <b>210</b> including a clustering engine <b>212</b> and a beamforming engine <b>214</b>, one or more antennae <b>216</b>A . . . N and, optionally, one or more applications <b>209</b>, each coupled as depicted. But for the introduction of the multi-point communication agent <b>210</b> and its constituent elements, transceiver <b>200</b> is intended to represent any of a wide variety of transceiver systems known in the art. In this regard, transceiver <b>200</b> may well be integrated within a user terminal (e.g., <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>) and/or communication station (e.g., <b>114</b>). In accordance with the illustrated example implementation introduced above, transceiver <b>200</b> is a TDMA transceiver and may well include GPRS facilities. In alternate implementations, transceiver <b>200</b> is an FDMA and/or CDMA transceiver.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, control logic <b>202</b> controls the overall operation of the transceiver <b>200</b>. In one implementation, e.g., within a communication station <b>114</b>, control logic <b>202</b> may well be responsive to higher-order application(s) or control logic. In alternate implementations, e.g., within a user terminal, control logic <b>202</b> may respond to higher-order applications, control logic, or directly to user input. In either case, control logic <b>202</b> controls the communication resources of the transceiver to establish wireless communication link(s) with one or more target(s) and/or one or more cluster(s) of target(s). In this regard, control logic <b>202</b> is intended to represent any of a wide variety of control logic known in the art such as, for example, microprocessor(s), microcontroller(s), programmable logic device(s) (PLD), field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), and the like. Alternatively, control logic <b>202</b> may well be content which, when executed by a computing appliance, implement the control features described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Applications <b>209</b> are intended to denote any of a plurality of content which is executable by control logic <b>202</b> to perform some function. In this regard, applications <b>209</b> may well represent a series of executable instructions which, when executed, endow transceiver <b>200</b> with wireless communication features, or define the multiple access schema of the transceiver (e.g., TDMA, CDMA, etc.). In alternate implementations, aspects of the multi-point communication agent <b>210</b>, e.g., the clustering engine <b>212</b>, or the beamforming engine <b>214</b>, are embodied as a series of executable instructions and are, therefore, denoted generally as applications <b>209</b>. It will be apparent that the teachings of the present invention may well be practiced without such applications <b>209</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Memory <b>204</b> is also intended to represent any of a wide variety of memory and/or storage devices known in the art. According to one implementation, memory <b>204</b> is intended to represent a memory system including a memory controller and one or more volatile and non-volatile memory devices (not specifically denoted). According to one implementation, to be developed more fully below, memory <b>204</b> maintains a data structure comprising information enabling the multi-point communication facilities of multi-point communication agent <b>210</b>. Memory <b>204</b> may also be used in support of other communication resources and/or applications <b>209</b> of transceiver <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">But for their interoperation with multi-point communication agent <b>210</b>, each of the transmitter(s) <b>206</b> and receiver(s) <b>208</b> are intended to represent such devices or systems commonly known in the art. In this regard, transmitter(s) <b>206</b> receives information to be transmitted from an input/output device (not particularly denoted) through control logic <b>202</b>, processes the information in accordance with the communication scheme employed, and transmits the information through one or more antennae <b>216</b> to remote targets. Receivers <b>208</b> receive a transmitted signal via antennae <b>216</b> and process the received signal to produce a baseband signal which is provided to an input/output device (not shown) via control logic <b>202</b>. In accordance with the illustrated example implementation introduced above, transmitter(s) <b>206</b> and receivers <b>208</b> are intended to represent TDMA transmitter(s) and receiver(s), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As introduced above, the multi-point communications agent <b>210</b> enables the transceiver to communicate over a single communication channel (e.g., a downlink channel (timeslot/frequency)) with multiple targets (i.e., multi-point communication). In accordance with the illustrated example implementation, multi-point communication agent <b>210</b> is presented comprising one or more of clustering engine <b>212</b> and/or beamforming engine <b>214</b>. To facilitate the multi-point communication introduced above, multi-point communication agent <b>210</b> identifies a set of targets (e.g., user terminals, communication stations, etc.), groups the targets into a cluster and develops a spatial signature for the cluster. Once the spatial signature is determined, multi-point agent <b>210</b> forms wireless communication link beampatterns to transmit the common signal to each of the target(s) within the target cluster(s). In accordance with one aspect of the present invention to be developed more fully below, multi-lobe beampatterns are generated, one (or more) lobes dedicated to the intended recipient of the present signal on the communication channel, and another (one or more) lobes dedicated to a recipient of a signal on the next instance of the communication channel. In accordance with the illustrated example implementation introduced above, multi-point communication agent <b>210</b> facilitates enhanced data services for multiple target(s). Accordingly, for ease of explanation and not limitation, the teachings of the present invention will be developed more fully in the context of the delivery of GPRS services to targets using a wireless communication channel. Under such an example implementation, up to eight (8) targets may share the same timeslot/frequency allocation from among eight (8) timeslots of a large number of carrier frequencies of a TDMA implementation. Those skilled in the art will appreciate, from the description to follow, that the teachings of the present invention are readily portable to other wireless communication schemes such as, for example, FDMA and/or CDMA architectures.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In accordance with one example implementation of the present invention, clustering engine <b>212</b> identifies the intended target(s) of a signal and groups them into one or more cluster(s) based, at least in part, on certain spatial signature attribute(s) of the intended target(s). According to one implementation, the spatial signature attributes include the angle of arrival of a signal from a given target. In other, perhaps more advanced implementations, performance characteristics of the targets are measured at the antennae <b>216</b> and are used by clustering engine <b>212</b> as the spatial signature attributes. Given the spatial signature attributes, clustering engine <b>212</b> determines which targets are closest to one another, and groups such targets into cluster(s) of close spatial signatures. Within each cluster of target(s), clustering engine <b>212</b> develops a spatial signature for the cluster as a whole, and develops signal “weights” which are applied by beamforming engine <b>214</b> to generate a beampattern to the targets within the cluster(s). That is, clustering engine develops a spatial signature for several users/targets. Over time, clustering engine <b>212</b> allocates and reallocates the targets within a cluster to the same physical channel, and allocate the targets in different clusters to different physical channels. According to one implementation, clustering engine <b>212</b> continues to monitor the spatial signature attribute(s) of the target(s) within the various clusters and reallocates them to different physical channels if their spatial signature attributes become significantly closer to the cluster of its occupant targets than to the targets sharing its original physical channel. According to one implementation, clustering engine <b>212</b> may well modify the number of physical channels applied to the delivery of enhanced data services (e.g., GPRS services), and modify cluster groupings accordingly. Having generally introduced the features of clustering engine <b>212</b>, those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are a number of ways in which the general inventive process may well be implemented, a couple of such processes are detailed more fully below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Once the cluster(s) of target(s) are formed, control logic <b>202</b> selectively invokes an instance of beamforming engine <b>214</b> to apply the developed weights to the transmit signal and generate a signal beampattern for the wireless communication link to the target(s) within the cluster(s). According to one example implementation, beamforming engine <b>214</b> includes a linear filter that accepts a weighting value and adjusts an attenuation and phase applied to the signal transmitted from one or more of the antennae <b>216</b> to effect the desired beampattern. In alternate implementations, digital signal processor(s) may well be used to modify the spatial beampattern. In either case, the beamforming engine <b>214</b> selectively modifies the transmitted signature to effectively establish a wireless communication link to multiple targets of the same signal.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Those skilled in the art will appreciate, given the foregoing, that multi-point communication agent <b>210</b> is particularly useful in that it allows a communicating entity to transmit with a single, optimized beampattern towards a group of targets sharing a physical channel. Such an optimized beampattern effectively increases the energy received by the targets while reducing the total transmitted energy, or the energy received by unintended target(s).</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Example Data Structure(s)</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> graphically illustrates a datagram suitable for use in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. As introduced above, one example implementation of the present invention is in the support of a wireless data network such as, e.g., a GPRS system. To identify intended targets of a wireless communication signal, clustering engine <b>212</b> analyzes at least a subset of the signal to be transmitted to identify such targets. In accordance with the GPRS implementation introduced above, clustering engine <b>212</b> analyzes at least a subset of content of packets received for transmission to identify target(s) for the packets in identifying targets and for use in cluster development. An example of packet, or datagram, suitable for use in accordance with the clustering engine <b>212</b> is presented with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In accordance with the illustrated example implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a datagram <b>300</b> includes at least target identification information <b>302</b> and payload data <b>304</b>. In accordance with one example implementation, the target identification information <b>302</b> includes at least a destination identifier <b>306</b>. As used herein, the destination identifier <b>306</b> may well include any of a number of information which uniquely identifies a target and/or a cluster of targets to the clustering engine <b>212</b>. According to one example implementation, for example, the destination identifier includes one or more of a destination address, an electronic serial number, a telephone number, a media access control (MAC) address, and the like.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In block <b>704</b>, clustering engine <b>212</b> identifies an anchor target for a cluster based, at least in part, on the calculated composite spatial signature distance differentials of the targets.

That is, in order to cluster targets with similar spatial signatures, targets that deviate from one another by too large a distance, even if they do represent the next smallest composite distance differential may not be clustered together. In such a case, target(s) that exceed this distance, or cohesion differential threshold (d<sub>min</sub>), may well be assigned to a different cluster of one or more target(s) with similar spatial signatures, as quantified by the total distance figure defined above.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to one example implementation, if N+M targets share substantially similar spatial signature attributes, clustering engine <b>212</b> assigns additional communication channel resource(s), as necessary to service the additional M target(s) in the cluster.
