<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is directed to a control system for controlling and maintaining the position of a piston and a method of using same, and, more specifically, toward a control system for controlling the position of a piston which system includes a fail-fixed valve (FFV) for holding the piston in position during a power interruption and a method of using same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The position of a piston, such as a valve or actuator body, may be affected by controlling the pressures of fluids applied to one or both ends thereof. These pressures may be controlled in turn by a device such as an electrohydraulic servovalve (EHSV) which uses a first stage motor to control the position of a second stage spool. Moving the spool opens and closes various fluid passages to control the pressure sources connected to the valve or actuator body. The present invention will be described herein in terms of a valve or actuator body that is positioned by the pressures of fuel in an aircraft fuel system, it being understood that it is not limited to use in such systems. The general term “piston” is used herein to describe a structure that could be either a valve, such as a fuel metering valve, or an actuator body, such as may be used for positioning variable geometry guide vanes (or moving other parts) on an aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The piston positioned by the control system may be a fuel metering valve, the position of which affects fuel flow to a gas turbine engine. Alternately, the piston may be connected to movable elements, such as variable geometry guide vanes, the position of which is controlled by the position of the piston. In the event of a power interruption to the control system, it may be desirable to maintain the piston in position until power is restored. However, when power is interrupted, system pressures drop and the fluid holding the piston in position may drain and allow the piston to deviate from the position it was in when the power interruption occurred. While it is known to shift an EHSV to a failsafe position in the event of a power interruption, EHSV second stage spools leak and cannot adequately prevent fluid flows or hold a piston in position.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This problem has been addressed by the inclusion of FFV's between the EHSV and the piston, but the control of these valves has heretofore been complicated. Furthermore, known FFV's sometimes allow the position of a piston to shift before finally coming to rest in a fixed position. It would therefore be desirable to provide a fuel system having a piston controlled by the position of a spool, such as a second stage spool of an EHSV, and an FFV for selectively fixing the piston in position which is simple in construction and in which, optionally, the position of the piston may be substantially maintained in the position it occupied at a power loss.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This problem and others are addressed by the present invention which comprises, in a first embodiment, a system that includes a controlled piston slidably mounted in a controlled piston sleeve that has a first end and a spool movably mounted in a spool sleeve. A first fluid passage extends from the spool to the controlled piston first end, and the position of the spool affects the fluid pressure applied to the controlled piston first end and a position of the controlled piston. An FFV in an FFV sleeve in the first fluid passage has a first end section with a first diameter, a second end section with a second diameter and a central section with a third diameter less than the first and second diameters. The FFV is shiftable between a first position blocking the first fluid passage and a second position allowing fluid flow past the central portion to the controlled piston. A second fluid passage extends from the spool to the FFV first end section. Shifting the spool to a failsafe position shifts the FFV to the FFV first position to seal a fixed volume of fluid between the FFV and the controlled piston first end.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another aspect of the invention comprises a system that includes a controlled piston slidably mounted in a controlled piston sleeve and having a first end and a second end, and an EHSV having a second stage spool movably mounted in a spool sleeve. A first fluid passage extends from the spool to the controlled piston first end, and the fluid pressure in the first fluid passage affects a position of the controlled piston. The system also includes an FFV in an FFV sleeve in the first fluid passage, the FFV having a first end section having a first diameter, a second end section having a second diameter and a central section having a third diameter less than the first and second diameters. The FFV is shiftable between a first position blocking the first fluid passage and a second position allowing fluid flow past the central portion to the controlled piston. A second fluid passage extends from the spool to the FFV first end section, a third fluid passage extends from the spool to the controlled piston second end, and a fourth fluid passage from the spool to the FFV second end.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further aspect of the invention comprises a method used in a system that includes a controlled piston slidably mounted in a controlled piston sleeve and having a first end, a spool movably mounted in a spool sleeve, a first fluid passage from the spool to the controlled piston first end, and an FFV in an FFV sleeve in the first fluid passage, the FFV having a first end section having a first diameter, a second end section having a second diameter and a central section having a third diameter less than the first and second diameters. The method includes shifting the spool to control fluid flow in the first fluid passage to control the position of the controlled piston, and, in the event of a power loss when the controlled piston is in a position, shifting the spool to a failsafe position, increasing a fluid flow in the first fluid passage to move the controlled piston from the position, and increasing a volume in the FFV sleeve to compensate for the increased fluid flow and return the controlled piston to the position and blocking the first fluid passage to maintain the controlled piston in the position.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating presently preferred embodiments of the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting same, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a control system <b>10</b> that includes a two-stage EHSV <b>12</b> comprising a first stage motor <b>14</b> and a second stage spool <b>16</b> slidably mounted in a spool sleeve <b>18</b>. The position of the spool is controlled by the first stage motor in a well known manner. Spool sleeve <b>18</b> includes five ports, P<b>1</b>-P<b>5</b>, and spool <b>16</b> includes four lands, L<b>1</b>-L<b>4</b>, the positions of which with respect to the ports P<b>1</b>-P<b>5</b> affect fluid flow though the EHSV <b>12</b> as discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">System <b>10</b> further includes a piston <b>20</b> mounted in a control valve sleeve <b>22</b> and including a first end <b>24</b>, a first end seal <b>26</b>, a second end <b>28</b>, a second end seal <b>30</b> and an annular control surface <b>32</b>. The combined areas of the second end <b>28</b> and the annular control surface <b>32</b> are approximately equal to the area of first end <b>24</b>. A linear variable differential transducer (LVDT) <b>34</b> connected to piston <b>20</b> provides piston position information to a controller (not shown). In the present embodiment, piston <b>20</b> comprises a fuel metering valve, and the position of piston <b>20</b> controls the size of a fuel outlet <b>36</b> in fuel line <b>38</b>. However, piston <b>20</b> in other embodiments may not be part of a valve, but rather may be used to affect the position of an actuator or other device connected thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A first passage <b>40</b> extends from fourth port P<b>4</b> to control valve sleeve <b>22</b> near first end <b>24</b> of control piston <b>20</b> and passes through an FFV <b>42</b> slidably mounted in an FFV sleeve <b>44</b>. FFV <b>42</b> includes a first end section <b>46</b> having a first seal <b>47</b> and a first diameter, a second end section <b>48</b> having a second seal <b>49</b> and a second diameter greater than the first diameter, and a central section <b>50</b> having a third diameter less than the first and second diameters. A spring <b>52</b> biases FFV <b>42</b> in the direction of arrow <b>54</b>, up as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, toward an open position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">System <b>10</b> further comprises a second passage <b>56</b> connecting first port P<b>1</b> to the first end section <b>46</b> of FFV <b>42</b>, a third passage <b>58</b> connecting third port P<b>3</b> to the second end of piston <b>20</b>, a fourth passage <b>60</b> connecting second passage <b>56</b> to annular control surface <b>32</b> and a fifth passage <b>62</b> connecting second port P<b>2</b> to second end section <b>48</b> of FFV <b>42</b>. A first pressure P<b>0</b> is supplied to third passage <b>58</b> and to third port P<b>3</b>. A second pressure PR, in this embodiment about 250 psi greater than P<b>0</b>, is supplied to ports P<b>1</b> and P<b>5</b> via fourth passage <b>60</b> and second passage <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the normal operating mode of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the direction of arrow <b>54</b> being referred to as “up” for convenience, the combined upward pressures on second end <b>28</b> and on annular control surface <b>32</b> is somewhere between P<b>0</b> and PR. Therefore exposing first end <b>24</b> of piston <b>20</b> to pressure PR will move piston <b>20</b> down and exposing first end <b>24</b> of piston <b>20</b> to pressure P<b>0</b> will move piston <b>20</b> up. Third land L<b>3</b> of spool <b>16</b> blocks passage <b>40</b> in steady-state operation. If piston <b>20</b> is to be moved upwardly to increase the size of opening <b>36</b>, a controller causes spool <b>16</b> to move upwardly so that third land L<b>3</b> partially uncovers fourth port P<b>4</b> and allows fluid communication between fluid at pressure PR at fifth port P<b>5</b> and first passage <b>40</b>. Spool <b>16</b> is commanded to block fourth port P<b>4</b> when the desired position of piston <b>20</b> is obtained. To move piston <b>20</b> upwardly as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, spool <b>16</b> is moved downwardly to open first passage <b>40</b> to lower pressure P<b>0</b> from third port P<b>3</b>. Spool <b>16</b> is again returned to a position in which third land L<b>3</b> blocks third port P<b>3</b> when a desired position of piston <b>20</b> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Meanwhile, first end <b>46</b> of FFV <b>42</b> is exposed to second pressure PR and second end <b>48</b> of FFV <b>42</b> is exposed to a third pressure PC<b>2</b> derived from second pressure PR. The upward force generated by third pressure PC<b>2</b> and spring <b>52</b> holds FFV <b>42</b> in the open position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> during normal system operation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the event of a power loss or interruption, EHSV <b>12</b> is adapted to shift spool <b>16</b> to a failsafe position, to and against the upper end of spool sleeve <b>18</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this position, second port P<b>2</b> is opened to first pressure P<b>0</b> which is lower than third pressure PC<b>2</b>, and this lower, first pressure is applied against second end <b>48</b> of FFV <b>42</b>. First pressure PR continues to be applied against first end <b>46</b> of FFV <b>42</b>, and this greater pressure drives FFV <b>42</b> in the direction opposite arrow <b>54</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or downwardly as viewed in this figure. In this closed, or fail fixed position, FFV <b>42</b> seals first passage <b>40</b> between FFV <b>42</b> and piston <b>20</b> with first and second seals <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> and the first end seal <b>26</b> of piston <b>20</b>. Since the fluid in first passage <b>40</b> between the FFV <b>42</b> and the piston <b>20</b> is incompressible, and fluid cannot leak from this portion of first passage <b>40</b>, piston <b>20</b> is fixed in position. This position is substantially the same position as piston <b>20</b> was in when the power interruption occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It will be noted from a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> that when spool <b>16</b> shifts from the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, fourth port P<b>4</b> will briefly be exposed to first pressure PR for the amount of time required for FFV <b>42</b> to shift to a position blocking first passage <b>40</b>. This higher pressure will move piston <b>20</b> downwardly as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, away from the position it occupied when the power interruption occurred. However, it will be appreciated from these figures that, because the second section <b>48</b> of FFV <b>42</b> has a larger diameter that the first section <b>46</b> of the FFV <b>42</b>, the corresponding second portion of FFV sleeve <b>44</b> has a larger volume than the portion of FFV sleeve <b>44</b> surrounding first portion <b>46</b>. Thus, as FFV <b>42</b> shifts to the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the volume surrounding central portion <b>50</b> of FFV <b>42</b> increases. The relative sizes of the first and second FFV diameters and the stroke of FFV <b>42</b> are selected so that this increase in volume is sufficient to compensate for the transient flow increase caused by the shifting of spool <b>16</b> to the failsafe position. In this manner, although briefly displaced, piston <b>20</b> will return to substantially the same position it occupied at the power interruption when FFV <b>42</b> reaches the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. When power to the system <b>10</b> is restored, spool <b>16</b> shifts to expose second end <b>48</b> of FFV <b>42</b> to third pressure PC<b>2</b> derived from first pressure PR, which, together with the biasing force of spring <b>52</b>, is sufficient to return FFV <b>42</b> to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and allow for the normal, resumed operation of system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A second embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> wherein like reference numerals are used to identify elements common to the first embodiment. In addition to EHSV <b>12</b>, system <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, includes a piston <b>62</b> having a first end <b>64</b>, a first end seal <b>63</b>, and an annular surface <b>98</b>. A first passage <b>66</b> connects fourth port P<b>4</b> of EHSV <b>12</b> to first end <b>64</b> of piston <b>62</b> via an FFV <b>68</b> slidably mounted in an FFV sleeve <b>70</b>. An LVDT <b>72</b> provides position information of piston <b>62</b> to a controller (not shown). FFV <b>68</b> includes a first end section <b>74</b> having a first diameter and a first seal <b>76</b>, a second end section <b>78</b> having a second diameter and a second seal <b>80</b>, and a central section <b>82</b> having a third diameter less than the first and second diameters. A spring <b>84</b> biases FFV <b>68</b> in the direction of arrow <b>86</b>, up as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, toward an open position.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">System <b>60</b> further comprises a second passage <b>88</b> connecting first port P<b>1</b> to the first end section <b>74</b> of FFV <b>68</b>, a third passage <b>90</b> connecting second port P<b>2</b> of EHSV <b>12</b> to second end <b>78</b> of FFV <b>68</b>, a fourth passage <b>92</b> connecting third port P<b>3</b> of EHSV <b>12</b> to a source of fluid at first pressure P<b>0</b>, a fifth passage <b>94</b> connecting second passage <b>88</b>, at second pressure PR, to fifth port P<b>5</b> of EHSV <b>12</b> and a sixth passage <b>96</b> connecting a source of pressure PR to annular surface <b>98</b>. Second passage <b>88</b> is maintained at pressure PR.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In operation, a unilateral load is applied to piston <b>62</b>, such as by variable geometry guide vanes, and the position of piston <b>62</b> is controlled by controlling the pressure exerted on first end <b>64</b> of the piston <b>62</b>. Increasing the pressure at first end <b>64</b> causes the piston <b>62</b> to move in the direction opposite arrow <b>86</b>, or down as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. When the pressure at first end <b>64</b> of piston <b>62</b> is decreased, the load attached to piston <b>62</b> and pressure PR in passage <b>96</b> move piston <b>62</b> in the direction of arrow <b>86</b>. Spool <b>16</b> of EHSV <b>12</b> controls the pressure in first line <b>66</b> by connecting either first pressure source P<b>0</b> or second pressure PR, a higher pressure, to first end <b>64</b> of piston <b>62</b> via FFV <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the event of a power interruption, EHSV <b>12</b> is adapted to shift spool <b>16</b> to a failsafe position, to and against the upper end of spool sleeve <b>18</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this position, second port P<b>2</b> is open to first pressure P<b>0</b> allowing higher, second pressure PR in third passage <b>92</b> to drive FFV <b>68</b> in the direction opposite arrow <b>86</b> or downwardly as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, FFV <b>68</b> seals a fixed volume of liquid in first passage <b>66</b> between first seal <b>63</b> of piston <b>62</b> and first and second seals <b>76</b>, <b>80</b> of FFV <b>68</b> to lock piston <b>62</b> in place. In this configuration, only compressive forces, tending to move piston <b>62</b> upwardly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, are applied to piston <b>62</b>. Therefore, it is only necessary to lock piston <b>62</b> against further upward movement in the event of a power interruption. Piston <b>62</b> is hydraulically locked against movement in a direction opposite arrow <b>86</b>, and will resist small forces in that direction, but might move if a significant force is applied to the piston <b>62</b>. A different system configuration, described below in connection with a third embodiment of the present invention, can be used when a piston must resist such bilateral loads.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">During the transition from the position of FFV <b>68</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it will be appreciated that first passage <b>66</b> will briefly be exposed to second pressure PR as FFV <b>68</b> moves to block the first passage <b>66</b>. This will result in a small movement of piston <b>62</b> from the position it occupied when the power interruption occurred. However, in the case of guide vanes such as the guide vanes attached to piston <b>62</b>, this small movement can generally be tolerated. A dual diameter FFV such as the one described in connection with the first embodiment can be used if this small movement must be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A third embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> wherein like reference numerals are used to identify elements comment to the earlier embodiments. In this embodiment, if a power interruption occurs, piston <b>102</b> must resist bilateral loads, that is, loads that may be applied either in the direction of arrow <b>140</b> or in a direction opposite the direction of arrow <b>140</b>. In this configuration, a hydraulic lock as discussed in connection with the second embodiment cannot be relied upon to fix the piston in place. A significant force pulling against such a hydraulic lock could vaporize the fuel behind the piston and allow the piston to move.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Therefore, in the system <b>100</b> of the third embodiment, a piston <b>102</b> includes a first end <b>104</b> having a first diameter and a first end seal <b>105</b>, and a second end <b>107</b> having a second diameter and a second end seal <b>109</b>. In this embodiment, a first passage <b>108</b> connects fourth port P<b>4</b> to first end <b>104</b> of piston <b>102</b> via an FFV <b>110</b> mounted in an FFV sleeve <b>112</b>. An LVDT <b>114</b> provides feedback information concerning the position of piston <b>102</b> to a controller (not shown). FFV <b>110</b> includes a first end <b>116</b> having a first diameter and a first end seal <b>118</b>, a second end <b>120</b> having a second diameter and first and second end seals <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> and a central portion <b>126</b> having a third diameter less than the first and second diameters. A longitudinal passage <b>130</b> runs from first end <b>116</b> of FFV <b>110</b> to an exit opening <b>132</b> on a sidewall of second end portion <b>120</b>. A second passage <b>134</b> connects first port P<b>1</b> to first end <b>116</b> of FFV <b>110</b> and a source of fluid at second pressure PR. A third passage <b>136</b> connects FFV sleeve <b>112</b> to a central portion of piston <b>102</b> and annular surface <b>106</b>. When FFV <b>110</b> is in the normal operating position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, longitudinal passage <b>130</b> connects second passage <b>134</b> to third passage <b>136</b> and thus exposes annular surface <b>106</b> to a pressure PXR derived from second pressure PR. A fourth passage <b>138</b> connects second port P<b>2</b> of EHSV <b>12</b> to second end <b>120</b> of FFV <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the event of a power interruption, spool <b>16</b> of EHSV <b>12</b> is adapted to shift spool <b>16</b> to a failsafe position, to and against the upper end of spool sleeve <b>18</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this position, fourth passage <b>138</b> is opened to first pressure P<b>0</b> which allows the higher pressure PR in second passage <b>134</b> to move FFV <b>110</b> opposite the direction of arrow <b>140</b>, or down as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. This movement blocks first passage <b>108</b> and seals a fixed volume of fluid between first end seal <b>105</b> and the first end seal <b>118</b> and second end seal <b>124</b> of FFV <b>110</b>. At the same time, the shifting of FFV <b>110</b> moves exit opening <b>132</b> out of alignment with third passage <b>136</b> and seals a fixed volume of fluid between first seal <b>105</b> and second seal <b>109</b> of piston <b>102</b> and first and second end seals <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of FFV <b>110</b> to hold piston <b>102</b> in place. Blocking both pressures helps to ensure that the bilateral forces exerted by the variable geometry guide vanes will always react against a trapped volume of incompressible fluid when in fail fixed mode.</p>
