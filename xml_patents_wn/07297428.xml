<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A registration arrangement for a fuel cell stack assembly incorporates registration posts and registration apertures or recesses. Fuel cell assemblies of the stack may include first and second flow field plates and a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) having an active area. Registration apertures are defined in each of the MEA and the first and second flow field plates. The respective registration apertures are situated within non-active areas of the MEA when the first and second flow field plates and the MEA are in axial alignment. Registration posts are configured for reception within the registration apertures. Each of the registration posts has an outer surface differing in shape from a shape of the inner surface of the registration apertures. The inner surface of the registration apertures contact the outer surface of the registration posts at a plurality of discrete press-fit locations.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A typical fuel cell system includes a power section in which one or more fuel cells generate electrical power. A fuel cell is an energy conversion device that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water, producing electricity and heat in the process. Each fuel cell unit may include a proton exchange member at the center with gas diffusion layers on either side of the proton exchange member. Anode and cathode layers are respectively positioned at the outside of the gas diffusion layers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The reaction in a single fuel cell typically produces less than one volt. A plurality of the fuel cells may be stacked and electrically connected in series to achieve a desired voltage. Electrical current is collected from the fuel cell stack and used to drive a load. Fuel cells may be used to supply power for a variety of applications, ranging from automobiles to laptop computers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The efficacy of the fuel cell power system depends largely in part on the integrity of the various contacting and sealing interfaces within individual fuel cells and between adjacent fuel cells of the stack. Such contacting and sealing interfaces include those associated with the transport of fuels, coolants, and effluents within and between fuel cells of the stack. Proper positional alignment of fuel cell components and assemblies within a fuel cell stack is critical to ensure efficient operation of the fuel cell system.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">While the invention is amenable to various modifications and alternative forms, specifics thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail. It is to be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the following description of the illustrated embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration, various embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that the embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention is directed to fuel cell assemblies incorporating a registration arrangement that provides for fuel cell assembly alignment within a fuel cell stack. Embodiments of the invention are directed to a registration approach that provides for intra-cell alignment of components within individual fuel cells and, in addition, inter-cell alignment between fuel cells of a fuel cell stack. The registration may also be applied to cell registration with end plates. Incorporating a registration approach according to the present invention advantageously simplifies fuel cell/fuel cell stack component alignment, such as by obviating the need for separate registration arrangements for intra-cell alignment and inter-cell alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to one embodiment, each fuel cell assembly of a fuel cell stack includes a pair for flow field plates and a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) disposed there between. Registration apertures are provided in the flow field plates and MEAs of each fuel cell assembly of the stack. The registration apertures provided in the MEAs are situated at non-active locations of the MEAs. Registration posts are configured to contact an inner surface of the registration apertures at a number of discrete press-fit locations. An outer surface of the registration posts has a shape that differs from the inner surface of the registration apertures to achieve a press-fit contact interface between the registrations apertures and posts at two or more discrete locations. Installation of the registration posts within the registration apertures of the flow field plates and MEA of an individual fuel cell assembly provides inter-cell alignment of the MEA with respect to the pair of flow field plates.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Cell-to-cell alignment within a fuel stack is also accomplished through employment of a registration arrangement of the present invention. According to one approach, the registration posts that provide for intra-cell alignment of fuel cell components of a first fuel cell assembly also serve as a registration arrangement for an adjacently positioned second fuel cell. In one configuration, the registration posts are configured to protrude from the first fuel cell assembly and engage corresponding registration apertures of the second fuel cell assembly. The registration posts of the second cell assembly that provide intra-cell alignment of fuel cell components of the second fuel cell assembly are configured to engage corresponding registration apertures of a third fuel cell assembly. This registration approach may be employed for any number of fuel cell assemblies that define a fuel cell stack.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another configuration, registration posts may be configured to provide intra-cell and inter-cell registration for two, three, of more fuel cell assemblies of the fuel cell stack. For example, a single set of registration posts may be employed to provide intra-cell and inter-cell registration for all fuel cell assemblies of the fuel cell stack. By way of further example, two, three, or more sets of registration posts may be employed to provide intra-cell and inter-cell registration for corresponding sets of fuel cell assemblies, referred to as multiple cell assemblies (MCAs). A first set of registration posts may be configured to provide intra-cell and inter-cell registration for two or three fuel cell assemblies (MCAs), and a second set of registration posts may be configured to provide intra-cell and inter-cell registration for an additional two or three fuel cell assemblies (MCAs). The two sets of fuel cell assemblies or MCAs in this illustrative example may be assembled to form a fuel cell stack, such that the registration posts of the first MCA register with corresponding registration apertures of the second MCA.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to another configuration, registration posts may be configured to provide registration between fuel cell sub-assemblies. In one configuration, a first fuel cell sub-assembly may be defined to include a first flow field plate and a first MEA, with a first set of registration posts (e.g., two registration posts) positioned within corresponding registration apertures of the first flow field plate and the first MEA. A second fuel cell sub-assembly may be defined to include a second flow field plate, and a second MEA, with a second set of registration posts positioned within corresponding registration apertures of the second flow field plate and the second MEA. The second flow-field plate in this illustrative example may have a bipolar configuration, such that a first surface of the second flow-field plate can be situated adjacent the first MEA of the first fuel cell sub-assembly and a second surface of the second flow-field plate is situated adjacent the second MEA of the second fuel cell sub-assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first set of registration posts provides registration for the first flow field plate and the first MEA, and the second set of registration posts provides registration for the second flow field plate and the second MEA. The first set of registration posts are configured to engage registration apertures of the second fuel cell sub-assembly. The second set of registration posts may be configured to engage registration apertures of a third fuel cell sub-assembly. It can be appreciated that any number of fuel cell sub-assemblies may be constructed and assembled to define fuel cell stacks of any desired number of fuel cell assemblies. It is noted that the flow field plates defining the end of a fuel cell stack are typically configured as monopolar flow field plates.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to another embodiment, registration posts and registration recesses are molded directly into the flow field plates. The registration posts of a first flow field plate align with, and pass through, registration apertures provided in a first MEA of a first fuel cell assembly. The registration posts are received by registration recesses of a second flow field plate. Registration posts of the second flow field plate provide a visually perceivable positioning and polarity (i.e., anode side vs. cathode side) identification feature for adding a second fuel cell assembly to the fuel cell stack. The registration posts of the second flow field plate of the first fuel cell assembly align with, and pass into, registration recesses of a first flow field plate of the second fuel cell assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Registration posts of the first flow field plate align with, and pass through, registration apertures provided in a second MEA of a second fuel cell assembly. The registration posts are received by registration recesses of a second flow field plate of the second fuel cell assembly. The flow field plates may be configured as monopolar or bipolar plates, depending on the desired configuration of the fuel cell stack. The molded registration posts may have a shape the same as, or different from, that of the registration recesses to respectively provide for a continuous or discontinuous press-fit contact interface there between. The molded registration posts and recesses according to this embodiment provide for intra-cell and inter-cell registration of fuel cell assemblies and sub-assemblies of a fuel cell stack.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A fuel cell registration approach according to the present invention provides for readily discernable identification of anode and cathode flow field plates, which facilitates proper assembly of fuel cell assemblies within a fuel cell stack. The presence of protruding registration posts is readily discernable from the presence of registration recesses or apertures. Depending on the particular identification convention adopted, the anode or cathode plate of each fuel cell assembly may be identified by the presence of registration posts. The other of the anode and cathode plate may be identified by the presence of apertures/recesses. Positioning, alignment, and identification of fuel cell components may thus be facilitated by employment of a registration approach consistent with the principles of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A registration methodology of the present invention may be incorporated in fuel cell assemblies and stacks of varying types, configurations, and technologies. A typical fuel cell is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that combines hydrogen fuel and oxygen from the air to produce electricity, heat, and water. Fuel cells do not utilize combustion, and as such, fuel cells produce little if any hazardous effluents. Fuel cells convert hydrogen fuel and oxygen directly into electricity, and can be operated at much higher efficiencies than internal combustion electric generators, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The fuel cell <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>includes a first fluid transport layer (FTL) <b>12</b> adjacent an anode <b>14</b>. Adjacent the anode <b>14</b> is an electrolyte membrane <b>16</b>. A cathode <b>18</b> is situated adjacent the electrolyte membrane <b>16</b>, and a second fluid transport layer <b>19</b> is situated adjacent the cathode <b>18</b>. In operation, hydrogen fuel is introduced into the anode portion of the fuel cell <b>10</b>, passing through the first fluid transport layer <b>12</b> and over the anode <b>14</b>. At the anode <b>14</b>, the hydrogen fuel is separated into hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) and electrons (e<sup>−</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The electrolyte membrane <b>16</b> permits only the hydrogen ions or protons to pass through the electrolyte membrane <b>16</b> to the cathode portion of the fuel cell <b>10</b>. The electrons cannot pass through the electrolyte membrane <b>16</b> and, instead, flow through an external electrical circuit in the form of electric current. This current can power an electric load <b>17</b>, such as an electric motor, or be directed to an energy storage device, such as a rechargeable battery.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Oxygen flows into the cathode side of the fuel cell <b>10</b> via the second fluid transport layer <b>19</b>. As the oxygen passes over the cathode <b>18</b>, oxygen, protons, and electrons combine to produce water and heat.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Individual fuel cells, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, can be packaged as unitized fuel cell assemblies as described below. The unitized fuel cell assemblies, referred to herein as unitized cell assemblies (UCAs), can be combined with a number of other UCAs to form a fuel cell stack. The UCAs may be electrically connected in series with the number of UCAs within the stack determining the total voltage of the stack, and the active surface area of each of the cells determines the total current. The total electrical power generated by a given fuel cell stack can be determined by multiplying the total stack voltage by total current.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A number of different fuel cell technologies can be employed to construct UCAs in accordance with the principles of the present invention. For example, a UCA packaging methodology of the present invention can be employed to construct proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell assemblies. PEM fuel cells operate at relatively low temperatures (about 175° F./80° C.), have high power density, can vary their output quickly to meet shifts in power demand, and are well suited for applications where quick startup is required, such as in automobiles for example.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The proton exchange membrane used in a PEM fuel cell is typically a thin plastic sheet that allows hydrogen ions to pass through it. The membrane is typically coated on both sides with highly dispersed metal or metal alloy particles (e.g., platinum or platinum/ruthenium) that are active catalysts. The electrolyte used is typically a solid perfluorinated sulfonic acid polymer. Use of a solid electrolyte is advantageous because it reduces corrosion and management problems.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Hydrogen is fed to the anode side of the fuel cell where the catalyst promotes the hydrogen atoms to release electrons and become hydrogen ions (protons). The electrons travel in the form of an electric current that can be utilized before it returns to the cathode side of the fuel cell where oxygen has been introduced. At the same time, the protons diffuse through the membrane to the cathode, where the hydrogen ions are recombined and reacted with oxygen to produce water.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is the central element of PEM fuel cells, such as hydrogen fuel cells. As discussed above, typical MEAs comprise a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) (also known as an ion conductive membrane (ICM)), which functions as a solid electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">One face of the PEM is in contact with an anode electrode layer and the opposite face is in contact with a cathode electrode layer. Each electrode layer includes electrochemical catalysts, typically including platinum metal. Fluid transport layers (FTLs) facilitate gas transport to and from the anode and cathode electrode materials and conduct electrical current.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a typical PEM fuel cell, protons are formed at the anode via hydrogen oxidation and transported to the cathode to react with oxygen, allowing electrical current to flow in an external circuit connecting the electrodes. The FTL may also be called a gas diffusion layer (GDL) or a diffuser/current collector (DCC). The anode and cathode electrode layers may be applied to the PEM or to the FTL during manufacture, so long as they are disposed between PEM and FTL in the completed MEA.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Any suitable PEM may be used in the practice of the present invention. The PEM typically has a thickness of less than 50 μm, more typically less than 40 μm, more typically less than 30 μm, and most typically about 25 μm. The PEM is typically comprised of a polymer electrolyte that is an acid-functional fluoropolymer, such as Nafion® (DuPont Chemicals, Wilmington Del.) and Flemion® (Asahi Glass Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The polymer electrolytes useful in the present invention are typically preferably copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and one or more fluorinated, acid-functional comonomers.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Typically, the polymer electrolyte bears sulfonate functional groups. Most typically, the polymer electrolyte is Nafion®. The polymer electrolyte typically has an acid equivalent weight of 1200 or less, more typically 1100, and most typically about 1000.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Any suitable FTL may be used in the practice of the present invention. Typically, the FTL is comprised of sheet material comprising carbon fibers. The FTL is typically a carbon fiber construction selected from woven and non-woven carbon fiber constructions. Carbon fiber constructions which may be useful in the practice of the present invention may include: Toray Carbon Paper, SpectraCarb Carbon Paper, AFN non-woven carbon cloth, Zoltek Carbon Cloth, and the like. The FTL may be coated or impregnated with various materials, including carbon particle coatings, hydrophilizing treatments, and hydrophobizing treatments such as coating with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Any suitable catalyst may be used in the practice of the present invention. Typically, carbon-supported catalyst particles are used. Typical carbon-supported catalyst particles are 50-90% carbon and 10-50% catalyst metal by weight, the catalyst metal typically comprising Pt for the cathode and Pt and Ru in a weight ratio of 2:1 for the anode. The catalyst is typically applied to the PEM or to the FTL in the form of a catalyst ink. The catalyst ink typically comprises polymer electrolyte material, which may or may not be the same polymer electrolyte material which comprises the PEM.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The catalyst ink typically comprises a dispersion of catalyst particles in a dispersion of the polymer electrolyte. The ink typically contains 5-30% solids (i.e. polymer and catalyst) and more typically 10-20% solids. The electrolyte dispersion is typically an aqueous dispersion, which may additionally contain alcohols, polyalcohols, such a glycerin and ethylene glycol, or other solvents such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and dimethylformamide (DMF). The water, alcohol, and polyalcohol content may be adjusted to alter rheological properties of the ink. The ink typically contains 0-50% alcohol and 0-20% polyalcohol. In addition, the ink may contain 0-2% of a suitable dispersant. The ink is typically made by stirring with heat followed by dilution to a coatable consistency.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The catalyst may be applied to the PEM or the FTL by any suitable means, including both hand and machine methods, including hand brushing, notch bar coating, fluid bearing die coating, wire-wound rod coating, fluid bearing coating, slot-fed knife coating, three-roll coating, or decal transfer. Coating may be achieved in one application or in multiple applications.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) are similar to PEM cells in that they both use a polymer membrane as the electrolyte. In a DMFC, however, the anode catalyst itself draws the hydrogen from liquid methanol fuel, eliminating the need for a fuel reformer. DMFCs typically operate at a temperature between 120-190° F./49-88° C. A direct methanol fuel cell can be subject to UCA packaging in accordance with the principles of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, there is illustrated an embodiment of a UCA implemented in accordance with a PEM fuel cell technology. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) <b>25</b> of the UCA <b>20</b> includes five component layers. A PEM layer <b>22</b> is sandwiched between a pair of fluid transport layers <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, such as diffuse current collectors (DCCs) or gas diffusion layers (GDLs) for example. An anode <b>30</b> is situated between a first FTL <b>24</b> and the membrane <b>22</b>, and a cathode <b>32</b> is situated between the membrane <b>22</b> and a second FTL <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one configuration, a PEM layer <b>22</b> is fabricated to include an anode catalyst coating <b>30</b> on one surface and a cathode catalyst coating <b>32</b> on the other surface. This structure is often referred to as a catalyst-coated membrane or CCM. According to another configuration, the first and second FTLs <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are fabricated to include an anode and cathode catalyst coating <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, respectively. In yet another configuration, an anode catalyst coating <b>30</b> can be disposed partially on the first FTL <b>24</b> and partially on one surface of the PEM <b>22</b>, and a cathode catalyst coating <b>32</b> can be disposed partially on the second FTL <b>26</b> and partially on the other surface of the PEM <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The FTLs <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are typically fabricated from a carbon fiber paper or non-woven material or woven cloth. Depending on the product construction, the FTLs <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> can have carbon particle coatings on one side. The FTLs <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, as discussed above, can be fabricated to include or exclude a catalyst coating.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the particular embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, MEA <b>25</b> is shown sandwiched between a first edge seal system <b>34</b> and a second edge seal system <b>36</b>. Adjacent the first and second edge seal systems <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are flow field plates <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, respectively. Each of the flow field plates <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> includes a field of gas flow channels <b>43</b> and ports through which hydrogen and oxygen feed fuels pass. In the configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, flow field plates <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are configured as monopolar flow field plates, in which a single MEA <b>25</b> is sandwiched there between. The flow field in this and other embodiments may be a low lateral flux flow field as disclosed in co-pending application Ser. No. 09/954,601, filed Sep. 17, 2001, and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The edge seal systems <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> provide the necessary sealing within the UCA package to isolate the various fluid (gas/liquid) transport and reaction regions from contaminating one another and from inappropriately exiting the UCA <b>20</b>, and may further provide for electrical isolation and hard stop compression control between the flow field plates <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>. The term “hard stop” as used herein generally refers to a nearly or substantially incompressible material that does not significantly change in thickness under operating pressures and temperatures. More particularly, the term “hard stop” refers to a substantially incompressible member or layer in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) which halts compression of the MEA at a fixed thickness or strain. A “hard stop” as referred to herein is not intended to mean an ion conducting membrane layer, a catalyst layer, or a gas diffusion layer.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one configuration, the edge seal systems <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> include a gasket system formed from an elastomeric material. In other configurations, as will be described below, one, two or more layers of various selected materials can be employed to provide the requisite sealing within UCA <b>20</b>. Other configurations employ an in-situ formed seal system.</p>

It will be appreciated that N number of MEAs <b>25</b> and N-1 bipolar flow field plates <b>56</b> can be incorporated into a single UCA <b>50</b>. It is believed, however, that, in general, a UCA <b>50</b> incorporating one or two MEAs <b>56</b> (N=1, bipolar plates=0 or N=2, bipolar plates=1) is preferred for more efficient thermal management.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The UCA configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>are representative of two particular arrangements that can be implemented for use in the context of the present invention. These two arrangements are provided for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to represent all possible configurations coming within the scope of the present invention. Rather, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>b </i>and <b>1</b><i>c </i>are intended to illustrate various components that can be selectively incorporated into a unitized fuel cell assembly packaged in accordance with the principles of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">By way of further example, a variety of sealing methodologies can be employed to provide the requisite sealing of a UCA comprising a single MEA disposed between a pair of monopolar flow field plates, and can also be employed to seal a UCA comprising multiple MEAs, a pair of monopolar flow field plates and one or more bipolar flow field plates. For example, a UCA having a monopolar or bipolar structure can be constructed to incorporate an in-situ formed solid gasket, such as a flat solid silicone gasket.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In particular embodiments, a UCA, in addition to including a sealing gasket, can incorporate a hard stop arrangement. The hard stop(s) can be built-in, disposed internal to the UCA, or integrated into the monopolar and/or bipolar flow field plates. Other features can be incorporated into a UCA, such as an excess gasket material trap channel and a micro replicated pattern provided on the flow field plates. Incorporating a hard stop into the UCA packaging advantageously limits the amount of compressive force applied to the MEA during fabrication (e.g., press forces) and during use (e.g., external stack pressure system). For example, the height of a UCA hard stop can be calculated to provide a specified amount of MEA compression, such as 30%, during UCA construction, such compression being limited to the specified amount by the hard stop. Incorporating a hard stop into the flow field plates can also act as a registration aid for the two flow field plates. Accordingly, a fuel cell assembly of the present invention is not limited to a specific UCA configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown an embodiment of a registration arrangement in accordance with the present invention. The registration arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> employs registration posts and registration apertures that provide for inter-cell and intra-cell registration within a fuel cell stack. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a first flow field plate <b>202</b>, a second flow field plate <b>206</b>, and an MEA <b>204</b> positioned there between. Provided at peripheral corners of the first and second flow field plates <b>202</b>, <b>206</b> and MEA <b>204</b> are registration apertures <b>210</b>. In general, the registration apertures <b>210</b> are located on the first and second flow field plates <b>202</b>, <b>206</b> and MEA <b>204</b> so that the active areas of the MEA <b>204</b> are not impinged on by the registration arrangement. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, two such registration apertures <b>210</b> are shown. It is understood that more than two registration apertures <b>210</b> may be provided, and that the registration apertures <b>210</b> may be provided at locations along the peripheral edge of the first and second flow field plates <b>202</b>, <b>206</b> and MEA <b>204</b> other than at the peripheral corners.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> further shows registration posts <b>212</b> that are dimensioned to pass through registration apertures <b>210</b> provided in the first and second flow field plates <b>202</b>, <b>206</b> and MEA <b>204</b>. As will be discussed in detail below, the registration posts <b>212</b> are configured to engage the registration apertures <b>210</b> at a number of discrete press-fit locations. Providing a contact interface between registration posts and apertures <b>212</b>, <b>210</b> at two or more discrete press-fit locations provides for increased installation ease (e.g., lower post/aperture insertion force) and reduced manufacturing tolerance requirements, among other advantages over a conventional press-fit arrangement employing pins and holes having conforming geometry (i.e., continuous circumferential/peripheral contact interface).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the registration posts <b>212</b> are inserted into the respective registration apertures <b>210</b>, the first and second flow field plates <b>202</b>, <b>206</b> and MEA <b>204</b> are brought into precision alignment, which is necessary to ensure proper sealing within and between fuel cell assemblies of a fuel cell stack. Proper alignment of fuel cell components within each fuel cell assembly is critical to ensure efficient operation of the fuel cell system.</p>

Each of the UCAs <b>201</b>, <b>203</b> is depicted as having an MEA <b>204</b> disposed between a pair of flow field plates <b>202</b>, <b>206</b>. Intra-cell component alignment within the first UCA <b>201</b> is accomplished by insertion of the registration posts <b>212</b> through the registration apertures <b>210</b> provided in each of the first and second flow field plates <b>202</b>, <b>206</b> and MEA <b>204</b>. When properly inserted, the registration posts <b>212</b> protrude from the surface of the second flow field plate <b>206</b>. The protruding registration posts <b>212</b> provide an easily perceivable feature for facilitating identification of plate polarity (e.g., anode side or cathode side) and positioning of the next UCA or UCA component to be added to the fuel cell stack.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the illustrative example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first flow field plate <b>202</b> of UCA <b>203</b> is positioned over the UCA <b>201</b>, such that the registration posts <b>212</b> protruding from the second flow field plate <b>206</b> of UCA <b>201</b> align with the registration apertures <b>210</b> of the first flow field plate second UCA <b>203</b>. In this configuration, when the second UCA <b>203</b> is brought into engagement with the first UCA <b>201</b>, the registration posts <b>212</b> protrude into, but not through, the registration apertures <b>210</b> of the second UCA <b>203</b>. Projection of the registration posts <b>212</b> of the first UCA <b>201</b> into the registration apertures <b>201</b> of the second UCA <b>203</b> provides for inter-cell registration and alignment between the first and second UCAs <b>201</b>, <b>203</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A registration approach of the present invention may be employed to provide alignment within and between fuel cell sub-assemblies. In the context of this approach, a fuel cell sub-assembly represents a subset of components defining a UCA.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As was discussed previously, the registration posts and corresponding registration apertures are configured to matingly engage at a number of discrete press-fit locations. A contact interface having discrete press-fit engagement locations may be achieved by use of registration apertures having a geometry that differs from that of the registration posts. This non-conforming geometric relationship between registration apertures and posts provides for enhanced flexibility in the design of the contact interface, increased installation ease owing to reduced post/aperture insertion force, and lower manufacturing tolerance requirements over conventional press-fit arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In general terms, a registration arrangement of the present invention is achieved by use of registration posts having a shape that differs from that of registration apertures implemented to received the registration posts. More particularly, each of the registration posts has an outer surface that differs in shape from a shape of the inner surface of the registration apertures. This difference in contact surface profile provides for a contact interface having a number of discrete press-fit locations.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In one configuration, the shape of at least one of the inner surface of the registration apertures and the outer surface of the registration posts may, for example, define a convex curved shape. The shape of at least one of the inner surface of the registration apertures and the outer surface of the registration posts may also define a generally curved shape comprising a two or more concave or protruding portions. In another configuration, the shape of at least one of the inner surface of the registration apertures and the outer surface of the registration posts may define a circular or an elliptical shape. For example, the shape of one of the inner surface of the registration apertures and the outer surface of the registration posts may define a circle, and the shape of the other of the inner surface of the registration apertures and the outer surface of the registration posts may define an ellipse.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The shape of at least one of the inner surface of the registration apertures and the outer surface of the registration posts may define a polygon. For example, the shape of one of the inner surface of the registration apertures and the outer surface of the registration posts may define a first polygon, and the shape of the other of the inner surface of the registration apertures and the outer surface of the registration posts may define a second polygon. By way of further example, the shape of one of the inner surface of the registration apertures and the outer surface of the registration posts may define a polygon, and the shape of the other of the inner surface of the registration apertures and the outer surface of the registration posts may define a circle or an ellipse. The shape of the inner surface of the registration apertures may also define a triangle, and the outer surface of the registration posts may define a circle. Other illustrative registration post configurations include those having a tapered shape or a wedge shape.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one particular configuration, the shape of the inner surface of the registration apertures may define a circle, and the registration posts may define a core member with several protrusions outwardly projecting from the core member. The registration posts can comprise a solid core member or a hollow core member. For example, the registration posts may comprise a hollow outer member and a solid core member, wherein the hollow outer member is configured to receive the solid core member.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In another approach, the registration posts comprise a compressible hollow outer member and a solid core member. The solid core member has an outer diameter greater than an inner diameter of the hollow outer member. The solid core member compressibly deforms the hollow outer member when the solid core member is positioned within the hollow outer member.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the registration post <b>212</b> is hollow, which provides for greater compression of the registration post <b>212</b> within the registration aperture <b>210</b>.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-26</figref> illustrate various fuel cell systems for power generation that may incorporate fuel cell assemblies having registration arrangements as described herein. The fuel cell system <b>1000</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> depicts one of many possible systems in which a fuel cell assembly as illustrated by the embodiments herein may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The fuel cell system <b>1000</b> includes a fuel processor <b>1004</b>, a power section <b>1006</b>, and a power conditioner <b>1008</b>. The fuel processor <b>1004</b>, which includes a fuel reformer, receives a source fuel, such as natural gas, and processes the source fuel to produce a hydrogen rich fuel. The hydrogen rich fuel is supplied to the power section <b>1006</b>. Within the power section <b>1006</b>, the hydrogen rich fuel is introduced into the stack of UCAs of the fuel cell stack(s) contained in the power section <b>906</b>. A supply of air is also provided to the power section <b>1006</b>, which provides a source of oxygen for the stack(s) of fuel cells.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The fuel cell stack(s) of the power section <b>1006</b> produce DC power, useable heat, and clean water. In a regenerative system, some or all of the byproduct heat can be used to produce steam which, in turn, can be used by the fuel processor <b>1004</b> to perform its various processing functions. The DC power produced by the power section <b>1006</b> is transmitted to the power conditioner <b>1008</b>, which converts DC power to AC power for subsequent use. It is understood that AC power conversion need not be included in a system that provides DC output power.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The power section <b>1106</b> of the fuel cell power supply system <b>1100</b> produces DC power, useable heat, and clean water. The DC power produced by the power section <b>1106</b> may be transmitted to the power conditioner <b>1108</b>, for conversion to AC power, if desired. The fuel cell power supply system <b>1100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> may be implemented as a stationary or portable AC or DC power generator, for example.</p>
