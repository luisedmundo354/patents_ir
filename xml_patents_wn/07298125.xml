<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a switching regulator and in particular to a switching regulator that eliminates the right half-plane zero phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Switching regulators typically include a pulse-width modulation (PWM) circuit running at a fixed frequency. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a conventional switching regulator <b>100</b> including a comparator <b>111</b> that drives a switch <b>119</b>, e.g. a large NMOS or NPN device, wherein comparator <b>111</b> and switch <b>119</b> implement the PWM circuit. When switch <b>119</b> is “on” (called a charge time), an inductor <b>109</b> is charged, thereby causing the current in inductor <b>109</b> to increase. In contrast, when switch <b>119</b> is “off” (called a discharge time), inductor <b>109</b> supplies current/voltage to an output node <b>115</b> via a diode <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Notably, adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM circuit, i.e. the ratio of the “on” time of switch <b>119</b> divided by its period (“on” i+“off” time), can control the voltage/current supplied to output node <b>115</b>. To adjust the duty cycle, switching regulator <b>100</b> can provide a feedback signal VFBK from output node <b>115</b> to a negative input terminal of an error amplifier <b>102</b> (e.g. a gm stage). Error amplifier <b>102</b> compares feedback signal VFBK to a known feedback reference <b>101</b> (voltage/current), which is provided on its positive input terminal. If feedback signal VFBK is less than feedback reference <b>101</b>, thereby indicating that more output voltage/current is required, then error amplifier <b>102</b> drives an error signal VERROR higher using a parasitic element <b>103</b> (which represents the output impedance of error amplifier <b>102</b>), a compensation zero resistor <b>104</b>, and a compensation capacitor <b>105</b> (wherein parasitic element <b>103</b>, compensation zero resistor <b>104</b>, and compensation capacitor <b>105</b> result in a compensation time constant that can provide circuit stability).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Comparator <b>111</b> receives error signal VERROR on its negative input terminal and a ramping signal VRAMP on its positive input terminal. A higher error signal VERROR relative to ramping signal VRAMP causes comparator <b>111</b> to turn on transistor <b>119</b> longer, thereby increasing the duty cycle of the PWM circuit. The increased duty cycle, in turn causes the charge time of inductor <b>109</b> to be increased, thereby ultimately resulting in a higher output voltage/current during discharge time.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this embodiment, ramp generator <b>120</b> includes a comparator <b>112</b>, a transistor <b>114</b>, and a capacitor <b>113</b>. Comparator <b>112</b> drives a transistor <b>114</b>, which is connected between ground and a positive input terminal of comparator <b>112</b>. Capacitor <b>113</b> is connected between ground VSS and the positive input terminal of comparator <b>112</b>. Current source <b>110</b> is connected between a voltage source VDD and the positive input terminal of comparator <b>112</b>. Inductor <b>109</b> is connected between diode <b>116</b> and a node between voltage VDD and current source <b>110</b>. Comparator <b>112</b> compares the current/voltage on its positive input terminal to a ramp reference (current/voltage) <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this configuration, comparator <b>112</b> operates by allowing capacitor <b>113</b> to charge via current source <b>110</b> until a ramp signal VRAMP reaches a reference voltage VRREF, which is generated by ramp reference <b>107</b>. At this point, the output of comparator <b>112</b> switches high, thereby turning on transistor <b>114</b> and discharging capacitor <b>113</b> to start the next cycle. Note that comparator <b>112</b> typically has sufficient hysteresis to guarantee that capacitor <b>113</b> is fully discharged on each cycle. Thus, ramp generator <b>120</b> operates as an oscillator that generates a ramp waveform <b>121</b> (corresponding to ramp signal VRAMP), shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Ramp waveform <b>121</b> has an associated charge time <b>122</b> (i.e. associated with turning on switch <b>119</b> and charging inductor <b>109</b>) and an associated discharge portion <b>123</b> (i.e. associated with turning off switch <b>119</b> and discharging inductor <b>109</b>). In a first cycle of ramp waveform <b>121</b>, the duty cycle of the PWM circuit is 50% (i.e. the on/off times of switch <b>119</b> are equal).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In actual operation, an external load <b>118</b> connected to output node <b>115</b> can vary. For example, a load <b>118</b> including 2 “on” LEDs could change to have 4 “on” LEDs. In this case, the feedback loop should respond by increasing the duty cycle to generate more output to compensate for the additional load. To increase the duty cycle, the charge time is increased (i.e. switch <b>119</b> is turned on longer). However, a necessary side effect of increasing the charge time is a decrease in the corresponding discharge time in the cycle. That is, in waveform <b>121</b>, a charge time <b>124</b> would be increased relative to a discharge time <b>125</b>, but the period remains the same. Because current is supplied to output node <b>115</b> only during the discharge time, there is an instantaneous drop in output current/voltage whenever the feedback loop asks for more output. Within one or more cycles, the increase in the charge time (e.g. charge time <b>124</b>) ramps up the current in inductor <b>109</b> enough to overcome that instantaneous drop, thereby allowing the output voltage/current to rise.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A signal processing system that exhibits this initial negative response (i.e. wanting more output, but actually getting less) resolving to a final positive output (i.e. wanting more output, and actually getting more) has what is known as a right half-plane zero (RHPZ) (this means that in the Laplace Domain, an (s-a) term exists in the numerator). The RHPZ is a well-known effect in many switching regulators that causes difficulties in stabilizing the feedback loop. Because the RHPZ problem stems from the initial inversion of the error signal as the switching regulator is correcting for a disturbance, i.e. a load increase. Typically, the solution is to slow switching regulator <b>100</b> sufficiently by incorporating a larger compensation capacitor <b>105</b> so that the inversion does not cause stability problems. Unfortunately, a larger compensation capacitor results in slower response time, thereby degrading performance of switching regulator <b>100</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A typical signal processing system, e.g. a switching regulator, can exhibit an initial negative response (i.e. wanting more output, but actually getting less) resolving to a final positive output (i.e. wanting more output, and actually getting more). This response cycle has what is known as a right half-plane zero (RHPZ). Unfortunately, a RHPZ can destabilize signal processing. Conventional techniques to cancel the RHPZ include slowing the response time of the switching regulator, thereby degrading its performance.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An improved method of canceling a RHPZ of a switching regulator can include detecting a predetermined error signal provided to a pulse width modulation (PWM) circuit, wherein the predetermined error signal is associated with the RHPZ. Once a RHPZ is detected, a ramp waveform provided to the PWM circuit can be temporarily lengthened, thereby canceling the RHPZ. Notably, temporarily lengthening the ramp waveform can be based on adjusting an RZ*CZ time constant. In one embodiment, the ramp waveform can be lengthened to create a left half-plane zero (LHPZ), which improves stability.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A switching regulator capable of canceling the RHPZ can include a pulse-width modulation (PWM) circuit, a feedback path, a ramp generator, and a compensation circuit. The PWM circuit can include a ramp input terminal and an error input terminal. The feedback path can be coupled between an output of the PWM circuit and the error input terminal. The ramp generator can be coupled to the ramp input terminal of the PWM circuit. The compensation circuit can be coupled between the ramp generator and the error input terminal of the PWM circuit, thereby allowing variations of the error signal provided to the PWM circuit to be coupled directly to a reference signal provided to the ramp generator.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Notably, the compensation circuit can dynamically modify this reference signal to cancel an initial effect of a right half plane zero (RHPZ). In one embodiment, the compensation circuit can include a resistor and a capacitor connected in series between the reference signal and the error input terminal of the PWM circuit. In another embodiment, the compensation circuit further includes a buffer having an input terminal connected to the resistor and capacitor and an output providing the modified reference signal to the ramp generator. In yet another embodiment, the compensation circuit includes a low pass filter. In yet another embodiment, the compensation circuit can include a variable resistor and a capacitor connected in series between the reference signal and the error input terminal of the PWM circuit.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary switching regulator <b>200</b> that can advantageously convert a right half-plane zero (RHPZ) to a left half-plane zero (LHPZ), thereby significantly improving loop stability. Switching regulator <b>200</b> includes components that are similar to those in switching regulator <b>100</b>. Similar components have identical reference numerals and similar functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Notably, switching regulator <b>200</b> includes a set of additional compensation components compared to switching regulator <b>100</b>. These compensation components, e.g. resistor (RZ) <b>201</b> and capacitor (CZ) <b>202</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, can be configured to dynamically modify the reference signal VRREF supplied to ramp generator <b>120</b>. Specifically, resistor <b>201</b> and capacitor <b>202</b> are connected in series between ramp reference <b>107</b> and the line providing error signal VERROR. The line providing reference signal VRREF is connected to a node between resistor <b>201</b> dad capacitor <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">If capacitor <b>202</b> is sufficiently large such that the time constant (product) of capacitor <b>202</b> and resistor <b>201</b> is greater than or equal to the effective time constant of the RHPZ, then variations of the error signal VERROR can be coupled directly to the reference signal VRREF. That is, when error signal VERROR swings more positive, the reference signal VRREF will also swing more positive. As a result, although the charge time increases relative to its last cycle, the discharge time can temporarily stay the same (as opposed to decreasing in switching regulator <b>100</b>). In other words, ramp generator <b>120</b> with the help of the compensating components, i.e. capacitor <b>202</b> and resistor <b>201</b>, can effectively modulate the frequency, i.e. increase the period of the ramp waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, because the ramp signal VRAMP can be lengthened for short positive excursions of the error signal VERROR, the initial effect of the RHPZ can be advantageously cancelled. Specifically, the adjustment (i.e. increase) of the RZ*CZ time constant causes the RHPZ to move to progressively higher frequencies (that advantageously have less effect on stability) until, when the RZ*CZ time constant is equal to the RHPZ time constant, the RHPZ goes to infinite frequency and is effectively cancelled. The resulting system now has a left half plane pole (LHPP) at the same frequency and time constant as the original RHPZ. This LHPP is considerably more stable than a RHPZ system.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, if the RZ*CZ time constant is lengthened beyond this predetermined value, then the zero moves to the left half-plane, thereby effectively becoming a left half-plane zero (LHPZ). At large values of RZ*CZ, this LHPZ comes close to and effectively cancels the LHPP, which can advantageously improve the stability of switching regulator <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although illustrative embodiments of the invention have been described in detail herein with reference to the accompanying figures, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. As such, many modifications and variations will be apparent.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, although a boost switching regulator is discussed above, duty cycle adjustment by coupling the error signal and the reference signal can also be used in fly-back regulators.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Notably, other configurations of capacitor <b>202</b> and resistor <b>201</b> as well as other compensation elements (e.g. buffers and variable elements) can be used to modify the compensation for differing load conditions. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a switching regulator <b>300</b> that includes a capacitor <b>301</b>, a buffer <b>302</b>, and a resistor <b>303</b> as compensation elements. In this embodiment, capacitor <b>301</b> is connected between the line providing VERROR and a node between resistor <b>303</b> and buffer <b>302</b>. Buffer <b>302</b> outputs the reference signal VRREF.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a switching regulator <b>400</b> that includes a low pass filter connected between the error signal VERROR and the reference signal VRREF. Specifically, the low pass filter includes an amplifier <b>401</b>, a resistor <b>402</b>, and a capacitor <b>403</b>. Both resistor <b>402</b> and capacitor <b>403</b> are connected between the positive input terminal and the output terminal of amplifier <b>401</b>. The positive input terminal is further connected to the line providing the error signal VERROR whereas the output terminal is further connected to the line providing the reference signal VRREF.
