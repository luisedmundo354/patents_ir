<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an imaging capture method and apparatus, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for image capturing that is capable of capturing an image with a reduced current consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, imaging capture apparatuses such as digital cameras, for example, have been developed and become popular. The digital camera converts an optical image to electric image data and digitally records the image data on a storage medium. When the image is reproduced, the recorded digital data is retrieved from the storage medium and displayed on a display device or printed out as a hard copy image.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a background digital camera <b>25</b> generally includes an optical lens <b>1</b>, a mechanical shutter <b>2</b>, an image optical pick-up element <b>3</b>, a sample/hold circuit <b>5</b>, an A/D (analog-to-digital) converter <b>6</b>, a shutter drive circuit <b>7</b>, a timing generating device <b>8</b>, an image data controller <b>10</b>, a system controller <b>11</b>, a DRAM (dynamic random access memory) <b>12</b>, an image display device <b>13</b>, an image compression circuit <b>14</b>, an image recording media <b>15</b>, an EEPROM <b>16</b>, and a manipulation switch <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The optical lens <b>1</b> focuses light rays onto a light receiving surface. The optical lens <b>1</b> is shown on the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The mechanical shutter <b>2</b> controls incident rays of a light image. The optical pick-up element <b>3</b> includes photo-optic cells capable of converting the light rays received from the optical lens <b>1</b> into representative analog signals. Most commonly, the photo-optic cells take the form of Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The sample/hold circuit <b>5</b> extracts data corresponding to pixels of the image signals that are input from the image optical pick-up elements <b>3</b>. The A/D converter <b>6</b> converts the representative analog signals into the digital signals representative of the image. The shutter drive circuit <b>7</b> provides shutter drive signals to the mechanical shutter <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The time generating device <b>8</b> supplies a synchronous signal to each of the optical pick-up elements <b>3</b>, the sample/hold circuit <b>5</b>, the A/L) converter <b>6</b>, and the image data controller <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The image data controller <b>10</b> performs various operations such as an image processing including pixel interpolation, gamma compensation, gradation compensation image display signal conversion, and storage signal conversion. The system controller <b>11</b> controls the entire system associated with an operation of the digital camera. The DRAM <b>12</b> allows various image data to be temporary written and read when necessary. The image display device <b>13</b> displays a monitoring image during an operation associated with image processing and also displays captured images.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The image compression circuit <b>14</b> receives the appropriately formatted digital signals. The image compression circuit <b>14</b> operates to digitally compress the received digital images to reduce the amount of resources required to further process the digital signals. One such formatting scheme referred to as JPEG is commonly used, although there are a wide variety of suitable picture formats. The image recording media <b>15</b> includes a memory card for storing the image data of a captured image. The manipulation switch <b>17</b> provides manual input according to an order from an operator.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the image optical pick-up elements <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> take the form of interlines. Photodiodes <b>23</b> are arranged in a matrix with eight rows and four columns. Color filters R, G, and B are attached to the respective photodiodes <b>23</b> that respectively form pixel components, in accordance with a Bayer arrangement. Each of four vertical registers <b>20</b> is arranged to receive electric charges from the corresponding photodiodes aligned in a horizontal line and to transfer the received charges downwards. A horizontal register <b>21</b> is arranged to transfer the charges received from the four vertical registers <b>20</b>. An output amplifier <b>22</b> that amplifies output signals is connected to an output side of the horizontal register <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an exemplary relationship is shown of various signals produced in the background digital camera <b>25</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a vertical synchronous signal VD sets a unit time to obtain one page of image data. Based on the photometric data of an object, an output duration in which a sub-pulse SUB is output is set and is controlled by the system controller <b>11</b>. The mechanical shutter <b>2</b> is made to be opened by the shutter drive circuit <b>7</b>, which operates upon an instruction of the system controller <b>11</b>. An electric shutter operation for the image optical pick-up element <b>3</b> is performed during the time in which the sub-pulse SUB suspends outputting by a control signal supplied by the timing generating device <b>8</b>. An exposure time of the image optical pick-up elements <b>3</b> that perform a shutter operation to the photodiode <b>23</b> is controlled by a discrete value of the sub-pulse SUB. During the exposure time, the electric charges are stored in the photodiodes <b>23</b>. The electric charges stored in the above-described process are sequentially read by the vertical register <b>20</b> by placing a predetermined plus voltage to a vertical transfer electrode (not shown). The electric charges are transferred in the vertical direction by electric charges aligned in a unit of one horizontal line to the horizontal register <b>21</b>. The electric charges are transferred along the horizontal register <b>21</b> and are output from the amplifier <b>32</b> (i.e., a CCD OUT in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a recording trigger Tr for an image recording is produced upon a depressing of a release switch (not shown) in the monitoring mode. When the recording trigger Tr is produced, a shutter pulse is output by the shutter driving circuit <b>7</b> after the time the sub-pulse SUB is output under a control of the system controller <b>11</b> during a unit time corresponding to the vertical synchronous signal VD immediately following the recording trigger Tr. The shutter pulse is output before a time the mechanical shutter <b>2</b> is closed by a response time tm. After the lapse of the time point tm, the mechanical shutter <b>2</b> is closed and the exposure ends.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When the image optical pick-up elements <b>3</b> are interline-type CCDs, the electric charges are read from the photodiode <b>23</b> to the vertical register <b>20</b> in two or more fields. However, before the electric charges are transferred to the vertical register <b>20</b>, unnecessary charges such as dark currents or smear components, in the vertical register <b>20</b>, for example, are swept rapidly.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, image data are read twice, that is, from an odd number field and an even number field. There is a time Tp in which the above-described unnecessary charges are swept rapidly before transferring the electric charges to the vertical register <b>20</b>. In a unit of time after the electric charges of the even number field are transferred, the shutter pulse begins to be output, the mechanical shutter <b>2</b> is opened, and monitoring begins.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As described above, imaging signals output from the image optical pick-up elements <b>3</b> are subject to a noise control by a correlation duplex sampling in the sample/hold circuit <b>5</b> and R, G, and B signals output from each of pixels are sampled and held, then undergo an A/D conversion by an integral multiple of the sub-carrier frequency of the NTSC signal, for example, by the A/D conversion circuit <b>6</b>, and are then input to the image data controller <b>10</b>. The R, G, and B signals to be input to the image data controller <b>10</b> are stored in the DRAM <b>12</b>. Then, signal processing such as a white-balance calibration and a gamma processing, for example, are performed for the R, G, and B signals read from the DRAM <b>12</b> and luminance signals Y and color-difference signals Cr and Cb are created and stored in the DRAM <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">To display an image of the object by the image display device <b>13</b>, the image of the object is displayed in the image display device <b>13</b> based on the luminance signal Y and the color-difference signal that are read under control of the image data controller <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">When the image of the object is stored in the image recording media <b>15</b> such as a memory card, for example, under the control of the image data controller <b>10</b>, the luminance signals Y and the color-difference signals Cr and Cb are compressed in a predetermined format by the image compression circuit <b>14</b> and the compressed data are stored in the image media <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, when image data stored in the image media <b>15</b> are reproduced, under the control of the image data controller <b>10</b>, the image data read from the image media <b>15</b> are decompressed by the image compression circuit <b>14</b> and are displayed as an image of the object in the image display device <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The structure and function of the background digital camera is explained so far. However, unfortunately, the above-described background digital camera has a limitation in which because electric charges are sequentially transferred in the vertical register more rapidly than a normal electric charge reading in the rapid sweep of unnecessary electric charges such as dark current components or smear components, that thereby increases the current consumption. When the mechanical shutter is in operation, a shutter pulse needs to be kept being output for a predetermined period to maintain a shutter operation, resulting in more current consumption.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel imaging apparatus that is capable of reducing a current consumption during an imaging process and being downsized into a compact and light-weight imaging apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel imaging method for an imaging apparatus that is capable of reducing a current consumption during an imaging process and being downsized into a compact and light-weight imaging apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">To achieve the above-mentioned and other objects, in one example, an imaging apparatus includes an image optical pick-up device, a first driving mechanism, a shutter, a second driving mechanism, and a driving current controlling mechanism. The image optical pick-up device includes vertical charge transfer paths and is configured to photoelectrically convert an incident light image of a subject of a photograph and to output a conversion result as image signals. The first driving mechanism is configured to drive the image optical pick-up device and has a rapid sweep function for rapidly draining unnecessary electric charges remaining in the image optical pick-up device through the vertical charge transfer paths. The shutter is configured to open and close a light passage for passing the incident light image of the subject of the photograph into the image optical pick-up device. The second driving mechanism is configured to generate pulses to drive the shutter. The driving current controlling mechanism is configured to control the image optical pick-up device and the shutter such that a first duration in which the first driving mechanism operates the rapid sweep function and a second duration in which the second driving mechanism generates a pulse for closing the shutter do not overlap under predetermined imaging environmental conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The above-mentioned novel imaging apparatus may further include a determining mechanism configured to determine whether the imaging apparatus is under the predetermined imaging environmental conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The determining mechanism may check an environmental temperature relative to the imaging apparatus and determine that the imaging apparatus is under the predetermined environmental conditions when the imaging environmental temperature is below a predetermined standard temperature.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The determining mechanism may check a current consumption of the imaging apparatus and determine that the imaging apparatus is under the predetermined environmental conditions when the current consumption is below a predetermined standard current consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To achieve the above-mentioned and other objects, in one example, a novel imaging method for an imaging apparatus includes operations of performing, driving, converting, and outputting. The performing performs a rapid sweep function for rapidly draining unnecessary electric charges remaining in an image optical pick-up device through vertical charge transfer paths of the image optical pick-up device.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In describing preferred embodiments illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology is employed for the sake of clarity. However, the disclosure of this patent specification is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected and it is to be understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a description is made for a digital camera <b>100</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the digital camera <b>100</b> includes an optical lens <b>101</b>, a mechanical shutter <b>102</b>, an image optical pick-up element <b>103</b>, a sample/hold circuit <b>105</b>, an A/D conversion circuit <b>106</b>, a shutter drive circuit <b>107</b>, a timing generating device <b>108</b>, an image data controller <b>110</b>, a system controller <b>111</b>, a DRAM <b>112</b>, an image display device <b>113</b>, an image compression circuit <b>114</b>, an image recording media <b>115</b>, an EEPROM <b>116</b>, a manipulation switch <b>117</b>, and a selection switch <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The system controller <b>111</b> includes a phase change controller <b>118</b> and an image environmental condition detector <b>119</b>. The selection switch <b>120</b> includes a switch for selecting modes from among a temperature detection mode, a power voltage detection mode, and a current consumption detection mode.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the image optical pick-up elements <b>103</b> include, for example, a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) to convert a still image of an object into an electric signal when a picture shoot instruction is initiated. The image is formed on a light receiving surface and is output. The lens <b>101</b> is shown on the left side of the digital camera <b>100</b> and is capable of directing light from any object to the light receiving surface (not shown) and to form an electric optical image of the object onto the light receiving surface (not shown) of the image optical pick-up elements <b>103</b>. The optics may include such optical systems as fiber optic transducers and fiber optic cables, refractive mirror assemblies, or any system or device capable of being optically coupled to the light receiving surface (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The mechanical shutter <b>102</b> is shown between the lens <b>101</b> and the image optical pick-up elements <b>103</b> to control incident rays of the light image of the object into the image optical pick-up elements <b>103</b>. An output terminal (not shown) of the image optical pick-up pixels of the image signals that are input from the image optical pick-up elements <b>103</b>. The sample/hold circuit <b>105</b> is also connected to the A/D conversion circuit <b>106</b>, which performs an A/D conversion by an integral multiple of sub-carrier frequency of an NTSC signal, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The light receiving surface (not shown) typically includes a grid, or array, of photo-elements. The photo-elements are any device capable of converting incident light in the form of photons into electrical signals. These photo-elements are generally formed of a semiconductor material, including the CCD. Generally, each of the photo-elements is associated with what is referred to as a pixel (short for picture element). A terminal of the A/D conversion circuit <b>106</b> is connected to the image data controller <b>110</b>. The image data controller <b>110</b> performs various kinds of operations for the digital image signals transferred from the A/D conversion circuit <b>106</b> such as image processing including pixel interpolation, gamma compensation, gradation compensation, image display signal conversion, and image storage signal conversion. The image data controller <b>110</b> is connected to the DRAM <b>112</b> and the image display device <b>113</b>. The DRAM <b>112</b> allows various data to be temporary written and read when necessary. The image display device <b>113</b> displays a monitoring image or an image during an image forming operation. The image data controller <b>110</b> is also connected to the image compression circuit <b>114</b>. In the image compression circuit <b>114</b>, e.g. based on the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), a part of the International Telegraph and Telephone Committee (CCITT), an image compression algorithm is performed to compress the size of the image. The image compression circuit <b>114</b> is connected to memory cards such as the image recording media <b>115</b>, for example. The image recording media <b>115</b> stores image data.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The system controller <b>111</b> includes a phase change controller <b>118</b> and an image environmental condition detector <b>119</b>. The system controller <b>111</b> is connected to the EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable) <b>116</b>, which stores a control program, and the above-described image data controller <b>110</b>. The phase change controller <b>118</b> shifts the duration in which a shutter pulse is output to the front by a unit of time designated by the vertical scanning signal VD. The environmental condition detector <b>119</b> determines whether the system controller <b>111</b> instructs to operate the phase change controller <b>118</b> in accordance with image environmental conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The system controller <b>111</b> is also connected to the manipulation switch <b>117</b>. The manipulation switch <b>117</b> inputs various instruction signals given by operators. In the selection switch <b>120</b>, the temperature detection mode switch performs detection utilizing an environmental temperature as an image environmental condition. The power voltage detection mode switch performs detection utilizing the power voltage as an image environmental condition and a current consumption detection mode performs detection utilizing the current consumption as an image environmental condition.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Likewise, the system controller <b>111</b> is connected to the timing generating device <b>108</b> and the shutter drive circuit <b>107</b>. The timing generating device <b>108</b> supplies timing signals respectively to the image optical pick-up elements <b>103</b>, the sample/hold circuit <b>105</b>, the A/D conversion circuit <b>106</b>, and the image data controller <b>110</b>. The shutter drive circuit <b>107</b> supplies driving signals to the mechanical shutter <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An exemplary procedure of an imaging operation performed by the digital camera <b>100</b> will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart of the procedure of the imaging operation performed by the digital camera <b>100</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a timing chart showing an exemplary relationship among various signals produced by the digital camera <b>100</b> during its imaging operation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Users can manipulate the digital camera <b>100</b> with the manipulation switch <b>117</b>. In Step S<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a user selects one of a temperature detection mode, a power voltage detection mode, a voltage detection mode, and a current consumption detection mode with the manipulation switch <b>117</b>. In Step S<b>2</b>, the user determines whether the imaging apparatus <b>100</b> is in the temperature detection mode with the manipulation of the manipulation switch <b>117</b> under control of the system controller <b>111</b>. When the system controller <b>111</b> determines that the temperature detection mode is selected (YES in step S<b>2</b>), the system controller <b>111</b> determines in Step S<b>3</b> whether a temperature Ta of an imaging environment is below a predetermined standard temperature Tso.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Generally, batteries used in digital camera are subject to an environmental temperature change, and more specifically, internal resistance value of alkaline batteries becomes high in a low temperature. There is less power supply to an imaging apparatus and when a current consumption increases rapidly in a low temperature, it is possible that the imaging apparatus does not work.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, data including information associated with the standard temperature Tso that serves as a standard of detection in the temperature detection mode are prestored in the EEPROM <b>116</b>. In Step S<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the system controller <b>111</b> determines whether the imaging environment temperature Ta detected when the recording trigger Tr is output at a predetermined interval of time operated by a sensor equipped in the digital camera <b>100</b> or a push of the release switch is equal to or smaller than the standard temperature Tso. When the system controller <b>111</b> determines that Ta is greater than Tso whose condition does not satisfy the above-described recommended condition that the imaging environmental temperature Ta is equal to or smaller than the standard temperature Tso (No in Step S<b>3</b>), the system controller <b>111</b> proceeds the process to Step S<b>9</b> in which an imaging operation is performed in a sequence that the duration of a rapid sweep of unnecessary electric charges and the duration of outputting the pulse indicating closure of the mechanical shutter are overlapped.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Meanwhile, when the system controller <b>111</b> determines that the imaging environmental temperature Ta satisfies the condition that Ta is equal to or smaller than Tso in Step S<b>3</b> (Yes in Step S<b>3</b>), the system controller <b>111</b> instructs the process to go to Step S<b>4</b>. In Step S<b>4</b>, a phase change is performed in which the duration of outputting a shutter pulse is shifted to the front by a unit of time designated by the vertical scanning signals VD, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the above-described case, the duration of the rapid sweep of unnecessary electric charges and the duration of outputting the pulse indicating closure of the mechanical shutter do not overlap so that a shutter pulse current consumption Is is not superimposed on a sweep current consumption Ic consumed in the duration of the rapid charge sweep. The sweep current consumption Ic remains as it is in the same way as applied in the background digital camera <b>25</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The sweep current consumption Ic for sweeping unnecessary electric charges is subjected to no changes as shown in a dotted line square of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and ΔIc is not superimposed, thereby preventing a maximum current consumption Imax to flow.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When the system controller <b>111</b> determines that a selected mode is not the temperature detection mode in Step S<b>2</b> (No in Step S<b>2</b>), the system controller <b>111</b> proceeds the process to Step S<b>5</b>. In Step S<b>5</b>, the system controller <b>111</b> determines whether the power voltage detection mode is selected and when the system controller <b>111</b> determines that the selection result is YES, the system controller instructs the process to go to Step S<b>6</b> in which the system controller <b>111</b> determines whether the power voltage Va is below a pre-assigned standard voltage Vso.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Generally, the voltage of batteries used as a power source for digital cameras is decreased with the passage of time. With the current consumption being constant in an imaging apparatus on one hand, the power voltage is increased when the power voltage is decreased. However, there is a limitation on how much current the battery is capable of supplying, and when the current consumption increases rapidly in a low voltage status, an imaging apparatus turns out to be out of work abruptly.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, data on standard voltage Vs, which serves as a standard of detection in the power voltage detection mode, are pre-stored in the EEPROM <b>116</b>. In Step S<b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the power voltage of digital cameras is detected and obtained in a predetermined time interval by a voltage detection circuit equipped in digital cameras or in each point designated by the sequence of each of the operations. It is noted that when the power voltage is obtained by every sequence, in due consideration of the power voltage Va with varying sequence according to the sequence of an imaging apparatus, regarding the standard voltage Vso, two or more of the voltage values are required to be set according to differing sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Accordingly, in Step S<b>6</b>, the power voltage Va that is detected by the power voltage detection circuit is compared with the standard voltage Vso, and when it is determined that the comparison result is that Va is greater than Vso which does not satisfy the condition that Va is equal to or smaller than Vso (No in Step S<b>6</b>), then the system controller <b>111</b> proceeds the process to Step S<b>9</b> and an imaging operation is performed in a sequence in which the duration of rapidly outputting unnecessary electric charges and the duration of outputting pulse indicating the closure of the mechanical shutter are overlapped.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In Step S<b>6</b>, when the system controller <b>111</b> determines that the power voltage satisfies the condition that Va is equal to or smaller than Vso (Yes in Step S<b>6</b>), the system controller <b>111</b> proceeds the process to Step S<b>4</b> and a phase change is performed in which the duration of outputting a shutter pulse is shifted to the front by a unit of time designated by the vertical scanning signals VD, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this case, the duration of a rapid sweep of unnecessary electric charges and the duration of outputting the pulse indicating closure of the mechanical shutter do not overlap so that a shutter pulse current consumption Is is not superimposed on the sweep current consumption Ic consumed in the duration of rapid sweep of unnecessary charges. The sweep current consumption Ic remains as it is in the same way as applied in background digital camera <b>25</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The sweep current consumption Ic for sweeping unnecessary electric charges is subjected to no changes as shown in a dotted line square of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and ΔIc is not superimposed, thereby preventing a maximum current consumption Imax to flow.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In Step S<b>5</b>, when the system controller <b>111</b> determines that the power voltage mode is not selected (No in Step S<b>5</b>), the system controller <b>111</b> proceeds the process to Step S<b>7</b> in which it is determined whether the current consumption detection mode is selected. If the detection result is NO, the system controller <b>111</b> instructs the process to be finished, and if the detection result is YES, the system controller <b>111</b> instructs the process to go to Step S<b>8</b> in which it is determined whether the current consumption Ia is below a pre-assigned standard current Iso.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In digital cameras of this kind, an increase in the current consumption causes batteries to have more burden. When the increasing current consumption goes beyond the limitation of current supply by the batteries, an imaging apparatus does not work because of lack of power supply to the imaging apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, data on standard current Iso, which serves as a standard of detection in the current consumption detection mode, are pre-stored in the EEPROM <b>116</b>. In Step S<b>8</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the current consumption Ia of digital cameras is detected and obtained in a predetermined time interval by a current consumption detection circuit equipped in the digital camera or in each point designated by the sequence of each of the operations. It is noted that when the current consumption Ia is obtained by every sequence, in due consideration of the current consumption Ia with varying sequence according to the sequence of an imaging apparatus, regarding the standard current consumption Iso, two or more of the current consumption values are required to be set according to differing sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In Step S<b>8</b>, when the system controller <b>111</b> determines that the current consumption Ia satisfies the condition that Ia is equal to or bigger than Iso (Yes in Step S<b>8</b>), the system controller <b>111</b> instructs the process to proceed to Step S<b>4</b> and a phase change is performed in which the duration of outputting a shutter pulse is shifted to the front by a unit of time designated by the vertical scanning signals VD, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this case, the duration of a rapid sweep of unnecessary electric charges and the duration of outputting the pulse indicating closure of the mechanical shutter do not overlap so that a shutter pulse current consumption Is is not superimposed on the sweep current consumption Ic consumed in the duration of rapid outputting of unnecessary charges. The sweep current consumption Ic remains as it is in the same way as applied in conventional digital camera <b>25</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The current consumption Ic for sweeping unnecessary electric charges is subjected to no changes as shown in a dotted line square of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and ΔIc is not superimposed, thereby preventing a maximum current consumption Imax to flow.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As described so far, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, users select any of the environmental temperature detection mode, the power voltage detection mode, and the current consumption detection mode. In the environmental temperature mode, with Ta as the temperature of the imaging environment, Tso as a standard temperature for detection, the system controller <b>111</b> determines whether Ta is equal to or smaller than Tso. In the power voltage mode, with Va as the power voltage of an imaging apparatus, Vso as a standard voltage for detection, the system controller <b>111</b> determines whether Va is equal to or smaller than Vso. In the current consumption mode, with Ia as the current consumption, Iso as a standard voltage for detection, the system controller <b>111</b> determines whether Ia is equal to or smaller than Iso. After the above-described inequalities are satisfied, the phase change controller <b>118</b> shifts the duration in which a shutter pulse is output to the front by a unit of time designated by the vertical scanning signal VD. A phase change is performed in which the duration of outputting a shutter pulse is shifted to the front by a unit of time designated by the vertical scanning signal VD. In the above-described case, the duration of a rapid sweep of unnecessary electric charges and the duration of outputting the pulse indicating closure of the mechanical shutter do not overlap so that a shutter pulse current consumption Is is not superimposed on the sweep current consumption Ic consumed in the duration of rapid outputting of unnecessary charges. The sweep current consumption Ic remains as it is in the same way as applied in conventional digital camera <b>25</b>. The current consumption Ic for outputting unnecessary electric charges is subjected to no changes as shown in a dotted line square of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and ΔIc is not superimposed, thereby preventing a maximum current consumption Imax to flow.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, another exemplary operation performed by the digital camera <b>100</b> is explained. In this operation, the system controller <b>11</b> controls the imaging process such that the shutter pulse is sent by the shutter drive circuit <b>117</b> so that the shutter is released and closed immediately before the duration Tp in which unnecessary electric charges are output. Immediately before a start of the sweep of unnecessary electric charges, the mechanical shutter is completely closed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Therefore, the duration of the rapid sweep of unnecessary electric charges and the duration of output of pulse indicating the closure of the mechanical shutter do not overlap. The shutter pulse current consumption Is is not superimposed on output current consumption of outputting unnecessary electric charges. The current consumption Ic remains as it is. The current consumption Ic for outputting unnecessary electric charges is subjected to no changes as shown in a dotted line square of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and ΔIc is not superimposed, thereby preventing a maximum current Imax consumption Imax to flow.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described above, in the digital camera <b>100</b>, users select any of the environmental temperature detection mode, the power voltage detection mode, and the current consumption detection mode.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, another exemplary operation performed by the digital camera <b>100</b> is explained. In this operation, control of the system controller <b>111</b> controls the imaging operation such that the shutter pulse is sent by the shutter drive circuit <b>7</b> so that the shutter is released and closed immediately before the duration Tp in which unnecessary electric charges are output. Immediately before a start of the sweep of unnecessary electric charges, the mechanical shutter is completely closed. An exposure time may be adjusted arbitrarily in two units of time corresponding to the vertical synchronous signal VD under control of the system controller <b>11</b>. Hence, an exposure time may be adjusted by outputting the sub-pulse SUB from the vertical scanning signal VD twice durations of the rapid duration of unnecessary electric charges Tp before the vertical synchronous signal. In this case, when taking a picture in a bright place, it is enough to take a short exposure time and the exposure time is set as one unit of time corresponding to one unit of the vertical synchronous signal VD. In a dark place, an exposure time is needed to be a long time. Two units of time are assigned according to two units of vertical synchronous signal VD.</p>
