<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a video display on a television receiver embedded with a video recording apparatus and a television receiver embedded with a video recording apparatus that have been powered on.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, when a television receiver embedded with a video recording apparatus is powered on, initialization of the video recording apparatus (DVD recording apparatus) is performed, so that images from a DVD can be reproduced and displayed immediately when a key on a remote controller is manipulated. During the initialization process, the following example procedures are performed. The optical pickup of the DVD recording apparatus is moved to a reference position, and data consisting, for example, of about several hundreds of K bytes are stored, unchanged or processed, by a microcomputer functioning as a controller, in another memory and in the internal register of an integrated circuit for the recording and reproduction of data. Therefore, about five seconds are required to complete the initialization process. When a DVD has already been loaded into the DVD recording apparatus when it is powered on, the DVD is played, and the data required for the display of a menu are stored in a memory, so that immediately after the menu key of a remote controller is manipulated, a title menu stored in the DVD can be displayed on the television receiver. Thus, the time required to complete the initialization process is even further extended. During the initialization process, a predetermined opening screen is displayed on the television receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Disclosed in JP-A-2003-069955 is a technique whereby the picture of a preferred portion reproduced from a DVD is stored in a memory in advance, so that instead of an ordinary opening screen, this picture is employed as a preferred opening screen for a viewer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, for a conventional television receiver that incorporates a DVD recording apparatus, since the opening screen is displayed during a period extending from the time the power is switched on until the initialization process has been completed, a viewer can not immediately watch a program that is being broadcast. The technique disclosed in JP-A-2003-069955 does not resolve this problem.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To resolve this shortcoming, it is one of objects of the present invention to provide a television receiver embedded with a video recording apparatus and a television receiver embedded with a video recording apparatus that permit a viewer to watch a broadcast program immediately after the power is switched on.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a television receiver embedded with a video recording apparatus including: a broadcast receiver that performs channel-tuning for a broadcast signal and outputs a composite signal; a first video converter that converts the composite signal into a Y/C signal, and then converts the Y/C signal into a digital signal; a recording/reproducing unit that records the digital signals onto a DVD, and for reproducing data from the DVD; a second video converter that converts the reproduced data into a Y/C signal; a signal selector for selecting one of the composite signal or the Y/C signal; a video display unit that displays the signal selected by the signal selector; a signal path along which the digital signal obtained by the first video converter is to be transmitted to the second video converter; a first controller that controls the broadcast receiver and the signal selector; and a second controller that controls the recording/reproducing unit, the first video converter and the second video converter, wherein the first controller, after being powered on, controls the signal selector to select the composite signal, and, upon receiving an initialization end notification from the second controller, controls the signal selector to select the Y/C signal, and wherein the second controller, after being powered on, initializes the recording/reproducing unit, the first video converter and the second video converter, and then, following the completion of the initialization process, controls the second video converter to convert and then to output, as a Y/C signal, a signal received along the signal path, and sends the initialization end notice to the first controller and during the reproduction of data stored on the DVD, controls the second video converter to convert and then to output, as a Y/C signal, the reproduced data.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a television receiver embedded with a video recording apparatus including: a broadcast receiver that performs channel-tuning for a broadcast signal and outputs a composite signal; a first video converter that converts the composite signal into a Y/C signal and then converts the Y/C signal into a digital signal; a recording/reproducing unit that records the digital signal onto a recording medium and reproduces data recorded on the recording medium; a second video converter that converts the data reproduced by the recording/reproducing unit into the Y/C signal; a signal selector for selecting one of the composite signal and the Y/C signal; a video display unit that displays the signal selected by the signal selector; and a controller that, after being powered on, initializes the recording/reproducing unit, the first video converter and the second video converter, and controls the signal selector to select the composite signal.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring now to the accompanying drawings, a description will be given in detail of preferred embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram, showing a television receiver <b>1</b> that includes a DVD recording/reproducing section <b>2</b> (hereinafter referred to as a DVD section <b>2</b>) as a DVD recording apparatus and a television receiver section <b>4</b> (hereinafter referred to as a television section <b>4</b>). To the left, along the vertical broken center line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is the DVD section <b>2</b>, while to the right is the television section <b>4</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, broken lines terminating in arrow heads indicate the transmission of control signals.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A broadcast signal received at an antenna <b>53</b> is tuned in by a tuner <b>45</b>, and the resultant broadcast signal is transmitted to an amplifier/detector <b>46</b>. The amplifier/detector <b>46</b> amplifies the broadcast signal, and detects a video signal and an audio signal. A composite signal a, which is the detected video signal, is transmitted to a first video converter <b>28</b> and a video signal selector <b>47</b>, and a detected audio signal b is transmitted to an A/D converter <b>29</b> and an audio signal selector <b>50</b>. The composite signal a is separated into one Y signal and two C signals by a Y/C separation circuit included in the video converter <b>28</b>, i.e., is converted into a Y/C signal, and the Y/C signal is thereafter converted into a digital signal. The detected audio signal b is converted into a digital signal by the A/D converter <b>29</b>, and the digital video signal and the digital audio signal are encoded by an MPEG2 encoder <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The thus encoded video signal and audio signal are recorded, by a Recording/reproducing unit <b>26</b>, on a writable DVD <b>25</b>, such as a DVD-R or DVD-RW. The Recording/reproducing unit <b>26</b> includes: an optical pickup, for writing data to the DVD <b>25</b> or for reading data from the DVD <b>25</b>; a modulation circuit, for modulating the encoded video signal and the encoded audio signal to obtain write signals for the DVD <b>25</b>; a demodulation circuit, for demodulating a signal read from the DVD <b>25</b>; a tray, which is inserted or discharged with the DVD <b>25</b> mounted; and a rotation mechanism, for rotating the DVD <b>25</b>. The data stored on the DVD <b>25</b> and reproduced by the Recording/reproducing unit <b>26</b> are decoded by an MPEG2 decoder <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A decoded video signal c (a reproduced video signal obtained from the DVD <b>25</b>) is transmitted to a second video converter <b>31</b>, and a digital broadcast video signal d, obtained by the first video converter <b>28</b>, is also transmitted to the second video converter <b>31</b> along a signal path <b>33</b>. In accordance with a signal received from a CPU <b>21</b> of the DVD section <b>2</b>, which will be described later, the second video converter <b>31</b> encodes either the video signal c reproduced from the DVD <b>25</b> or the digital broadcast video signal d obtained by the first video converter <b>28</b>, and outputs the encoded signal as a Y/C signal f to a video signal selector <b>47</b>. A decoded video signal e is converted into an analog signal by a D/A converter <b>32</b>, and the analog signal is transmitted to an audio signal selector <b>50</b>. The Y/C signal f is composed of one Y signal and two C signals; however, the Y/C signal is shown as a single line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The Recording/reproducing unit <b>26</b>, the MPEG2 encoder <b>27</b> and the MPEG2 decoder <b>30</b> correspond to the recording/reproduction section for the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The CPU <b>21</b>, a ROM <b>22</b>, a RAM <b>23</b> and a flash memory <b>24</b> are provided for the DVD section <b>2</b>. The CPU <b>21</b> executes a program stored in the ROM <b>22</b>, and controls the operations of the individual units (e.g., the Recording/reproducing unit <b>26</b>) of the DVD section <b>2</b>. The RAM <b>23</b> is used as a memory area for various control data and a work area for the CPU <b>21</b>. The setup data for the Recording/reproducing unit <b>26</b>, the MPEG2 encoder <b>27</b>, the MPEG2 decoder <b>30</b>, the second video converter <b>31</b> and the first video converter <b>28</b> are stored in the flash memory <b>24</b>, and when power is switched on, the CPU <b>21</b> reads these setup data to setup the individual units. Thereafter, in accordance with this setup, the units perform desired operations.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A CPU <b>41</b>, a ROM <b>42</b>, a RAM <b>43</b> and an operating unit <b>44</b> are provided for the television section <b>4</b>. The CPU <b>41</b> executes a program stored in the ROM <b>42</b>, and controls the operations of the individual units (e.g., the tuner <b>45</b>) of the television section <b>4</b>. The RAM <b>43</b> is used as a memory area for various control data and as a work area for the CPU <b>41</b>. The operating unit <b>44</b> is, for example, a remote controller (not shown) having multiple operating keys. The remote controller has a power switch, a key (e.g., a play key) for operating the DVD section <b>2</b>, and another key (e.g., a channel selection key) for operating the television section <b>4</b>. When one of these operating keys is depressed, the CPU <b>41</b> performs a corresponding process. Further, when the operating key for the DVD section <b>2</b> is depressed, the CPU <b>41</b> transmits information for the operating key to the CPU <b>31</b> of the DVD section <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The audio signal selector <b>50</b> receives the broadcast audio signal b and a reproduced audio signal g obtained from the DVD <b>25</b>, and outputs either one of these audio signals in accordance with a signal received from the CPU <b>41</b>. The audio signal output by the audio signal selector <b>50</b> is amplified by an audio signal amplifier <b>51</b>, and the resultant signal is output through loudspeakers <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The video signal selector <b>47</b> receives the composite signal a and the Y/C signal f, and outputs either one of these signals in accordance with a signal received from the CPU <b>41</b>. The video signal output by the video signal selector <b>47</b> is processed and amplified by a video signal processor/amplifier <b>48</b>, and the resultant signal is displayed on a CRT <b>49</b>, a video display unit. It should be noted that the audio signal selector <b>50</b> and the video signal selector <b>47</b> are constituted by analog switches, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The video signal processor/amplifier <b>48</b> is operated as follows. First, the operation performed upon receiving the composite signal a will be explained. A luminance signal is extracted by removing a signal having a frequency band near 3.58 MHz from the composite signal a. The luminance signal is amplified, and the resultant signal is output as a luminance drive signal YD. Further, a vertical sync signal and a horizontal sync signal are extracted from the composite signal a, and based on these two sync signals, a vertical scan signal and a horizontal scan signal are generated. Then, the two scan signals are amplified, and the resultant signals are output as a vertical scan drive signal VD and a horizontal scan drive signal HD. Furthermore, by using a band-pass filter having a center frequency of 3.58 MHz, a color signal is extracted from the composite signal a and demodulated. Then, using a matrix circuit, R, G and B signals are obtained and are amplified, and the obtained signals are output as R, G and B drive signals RD, GD and BD.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The operation of the video signal processor/amplifier <b>48</b> upon the reception of the Y/C signal f will now be described. First, a Y signal is amplified and the obtained signal is output as a luminance drive signal YD, while a vertical sync signal and a horizontal sync signal included in the Y signal are employed to generate and output a vertical scan drive signal VD and a horizontal scan drive signal HD. Following this, based on the Y signal and two C signals, R, G and B signals are obtained by the matrix circuit and are amplified, and the resultant signals are output as R, G and B drive signals RD, GD and BD.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In either case, the CRT <b>49</b> is driven in accordance with the luminance drive signal YD, the vertical scan drive signal VD, the horizontal scan drive signal HD and the R, G and B drive signals RD, GD and BD, and pictures are displayed on the CRT <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The operation of the television receiver <b>1</b> incorporating the DVD recording apparatus will now be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart showing the operation of the television section <b>4</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart showing the operation of the DVD section <b>2</b>. First, the operation of the television section <b>4</b> will be explained while referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. When the television receiver <b>1</b> is powered on, CPU <b>41</b> of the television section <b>4</b> sets up the video signal selector <b>47</b> to select the composite signal a, which is a broadcast video signal (S<b>1</b>), and also sets up the audio signal selector <b>50</b> to select the broadcast audio signal b (S<b>2</b>). At this time, the tuner <b>45</b> selects a broadcast signal in accordance with the station number stored in the memory of the tuner <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Next, the CPU <b>41</b> determines whether an initialization end notification has been received from the CPU <b>21</b> of the DVD section <b>2</b> (S<b>3</b>). When the CPU <b>41</b> has received this notification, the CPU <b>41</b> sets up the video signal selector <b>47</b> to select the Y/C signal f (S<b>4</b>), and program control returns to S<b>3</b>. It should be noted that the television section <b>4</b> is controlled by a control flag (not shown), so that when the process at S<b>3</b> is performed the next time, a decision of NO is obtained at S<b>3</b>. When the CPU <b>41</b> has not received the initialization end notification, the CPU <b>41</b> determines whether it has received a DVD play notification (S<b>5</b>). When the CPU <b>41</b> has received this notification, the CPU <b>41</b> sets up the audio signal selector <b>50</b> to select the reproduced audio signal g obtained from the DVD <b>25</b> (S<b>6</b>), and program control returns to S<b>3</b>. Since the DVD play notification is received after the initialization end notification, at this time the video signal selector <b>47</b> is already set to select the Y/C signal f. When the CPU <b>41</b> has not received the DVD play notification, the CPU <b>41</b> determines whether an operating key of the operating unit <b>44</b> has been depressed (S<b>7</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When no operating key has been depressed, program control returns to S<b>3</b>. When one of the operating keys has been depressed, the CPU <b>41</b> determines whether the pertinent key is for the DVD section <b>2</b> (S<b>8</b>). When the operating key for the DVD section <b>2</b> has been depressed, the CPU <b>41</b> transmits information concerning the depressed operating key to the CPU <b>21</b> of the DVD section <b>2</b> (S<b>9</b>) and program control returns to S<b>3</b>. It should be noted, however, that when the CPU <b>41</b> has not yet received the initialization end notification, the CPU <b>41</b> does not transmit information for the operating key. And when the depressed operating key is not for the DVD section <b>2</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> performs another process that is not directly related to the present invention (S<b>10</b>). For example, when an operating key for a volume increase/decrease has been depressed, the CPU <b>41</b> changes the amplification rate of the audio signal amplifier <b>51</b> to change the volume of the loudspeakers <b>52</b>. When an operating key for channel selection has been depressed, the CPU <b>41</b> sets up station number information that it transmits to the tuner <b>45</b>. And when an operating key for channel selection is depressed during the reproduction for the DVD <b>25</b>, the CPU <b>41</b> sets up the audio signal selector <b>50</b> to select the audio signal b that is output by the amplifier/detector <b>46</b>. Program control thereafter returns to S<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The operation of the DVD section <b>2</b> will now be described while referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When powered on, the CPU <b>21</b> initializes the individual units (e.g., the Recording/reproducing unit <b>26</b>) of the DVD section <b>2</b> (S<b>21</b>). During the initialization process, the CPU <b>21</b> reads data from the flash memory <b>24</b> and stores these data in the setup units, such as registers (not shown) for the Recording/reproducing unit <b>26</b>, the MPEG2 encoder <b>27</b>, the MPEG2 decoder <b>30</b>, the second video converter <b>31</b> and the first video converter <b>28</b>, and in the RAM <b>23</b>, so that the DVD section <b>2</b> can perform desired operations. At this time, the CPU <b>21</b> processes, as needed, the data read from the flash memory <b>24</b> and stores the obtained data in the units described above. Then, the CPU <b>21</b> sets up the second video converter <b>31</b> to encode the broadcast video signal d (the signal output by the first video converter <b>28</b>) (S<b>22</b>), and transmits an initialization end notification to the CPU <b>41</b> of the television section <b>4</b> (S<b>23</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Sequentially, the CPU <b>21</b> determines whether information concerning the operating key has been received from the CPU <b>41</b> of the television section <b>4</b> (S<b>24</b>). When the CPU <b>21</b> has not received such information, the CPU <b>21</b> repeats the process at S<b>24</b>. When the CPU <b>21</b> has received the information for the operating key, the CPU <b>21</b> determines whether the operating key controls the playing of the DVD <b>25</b> (S<b>25</b>). When the operating key controls the playing of the DVD <b>25</b>, the CPU <b>21</b> drives the rotation mechanism of the Recording/reproducing unit <b>26</b> to begin the reproduction of data on the DVD <b>25</b> (S<b>26</b>). Then, the CPU <b>21</b> sets up the second video converter <b>31</b> to encode the reproduced video signal c (the signal output by the MPEG2 decoder <b>30</b>) obtained from the DVD <b>25</b> (S<b>27</b>), and transmits a DVD play notification to the CPU <b>41</b> of the television section <b>4</b> (S<b>28</b>). Program control thereafter returns to S<b>24</b>. When the CPU <b>21</b> determines at S<b>25</b> that the operating key does not control the playing of the DVD <b>25</b>, the CPU <b>21</b> performs another process that is not directly related to the present invention (S<b>29</b>). For example, when a record key is depressed, the CPU <b>21</b> records, on the DVD <b>25</b>, a program broadcast across the channel tuned to by the tuner <b>45</b>. Program control thereafter returns to S<b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">To conclude this explanation, during a period in which the television receiver <b>1</b> incorporating the DVD recording apparatus is powered on and the individual units of the DVD section <b>2</b> are initialized, broadcast pictures are displayed on the CRT <b>49</b> in accordance with the composite signals a, so that a broadcast program can be viewed without waiting for the completion of the initialization. Furthermore, when the initialization process is terminated, broadcast pictures are displayed on the CRT <b>49</b> in accordance with the Y/C signals f output by the second video converter <b>31</b>, so that broadcast pictures can be viewed that are clearer than those provided by the composite signals a. During the reproduction performed for the DVD <b>25</b>, reproduced data are encoded by the second video converter <b>31</b> to obtain Y/C signals f, and based on the Y/C signals f, pictures for the reproduced data obtained from the DVD <b>25</b> are displayed on the CRT <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this embodiment, the second video converter <b>31</b> encodes either a digital broadcast video signal d or a reproduced video signal c from the DVD <b>25</b> to obtain a Y/C signal, and the video signal selector <b>47</b> selects either the composite signal a or the Y/C signal f. However, the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> or <b>4</b>B may be employed instead.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the video signal selector <b>47</b> also receives the Y/C signal f that is generated by the video encoder <b>28</b>, based on the composite signal a, and selects either the composite signal a, the Y/C signal f obtained by encoding the reproduced video signal obtained from the DVD <b>25</b>, or a Y/C signal h generated based on the composite signal a. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, an additional, second video signal selector <b>34</b> is provided that selects the Y/C signal f obtained by encoding the reproduced video signal obtained from the DVD <b>25</b> or the Y/C signal h generated based on the composite signal a. Then, the video signal selector <b>47</b> selects either the composite signal a or the Y/C signal f or h output by the second video signal selector <b>34</b>. In this case, the video signal selector <b>47</b> and the second video signal selector <b>34</b> correspond to the video signal selector of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further, in this embodiment, a broadcast signal is recorded on the DVD <b>25</b>. However, a recording medium other than the DVD <b>25</b> may be used, e.g., a hard disk. In addition, while in this embodiment only one tuner <b>45</b> is provided, the present invention can also be applied for a case wherein a tuner is also provided for the DVD section <b>2</b> to record a program in the same time slot on a different channel. Furthermore, in this embodiment, the CPU <b>41</b> (first controller) controls the television section <b>4</b>, and the CPU <b>21</b> (second controller) controls the DVD section <b>2</b>. However, only one controller may be employed to control the television section <b>4</b> and the DVD section <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As described above, according to the embodiment, when the Recording/reproducing unit is powered on and initialized, processing by the video decoder and the video encoder is performed, the signal selector selects a composite signal, and in accordance with the composite signal, a broadcast picture is displayed on the video display unit. Thus, immediately after the power is switched on, a broadcast program can be viewed without waiting for the initialization of the Recording/reproducing unit, the video decoder and the video encoder to be completed. Furthermore, following the completion of the initialization process, a broadcast picture is displayed on the video display unit in accordance with a Y/C signal, so that a problem that occurs when a broadcast picture is displayed in accordance with a composite signal, e.g., the dot jamming that occurs because a small color signal residual is retained in a luminance signal or the cross-color effect that occurs when a color signal is mixed in with a luminance signal, can be prevented, and clear broadcast pictures can be viewed. Further, since an expensive Y/C separation circuit, used for the generation of a Y/C signal is employed, in both cases, for the recording of a broadcast signal and for the viewing of a picture provided by a broadcast signal, the cost of a television receiver embedded with a video recording apparatus is not increased, and in either case, clear broadcast pictures can be viewed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to the embodiment, after being powered on, a broadcast program can be immediately viewed without waiting until the initialization process for the Recording/reproducing unit and the other units is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although the present invention has been shown and described with reference to a specific preferred embodiment, various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings herein. Such changes and modifications as are obvious are deemed to come within the spirit, scope and contemplation of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
