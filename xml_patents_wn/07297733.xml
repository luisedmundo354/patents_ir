<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/830,566, filed on May 7, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,034,068, which is a national stage application of PCT/EP99/08284, filed on Oct. 30, 1999, and claims priority to German patent application No. 19851024.1, filed on Nov. 5, 1998.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to aqueous dispersions of water-soluble polymers of N-vinylcarboxamides, processes for their preparation and their use in papermaking.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">EP-A-01 83 466 discloses a process for the preparation of aqueous dispersions of water-soluble polymers, cationic monomers, for example dialkylaminoacrylamides quaternized with benzyl chloride, being polymerized in an aqueous salt solution in the presence of a polymeric dispersant. Dispersants used are, for example, polyols, polyalkylene ethers, alkali metal salts of polyacrylic acid and alkali metal salts of poly-2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane-sulfonic acid. Salt concentration in the polymerization medium is preferably from 15% by weight to the saturation limit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">DE-A-44 30 069 discloses aqueous, solvent-free dispersions of cationic polymers, which are used as sizes for paper. The polymers are prepared by free radical polymerization of cationic monomers, if desired as a mixture with other monomers in solution or dispersion or by mass polymerization.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">DE-A 195 32 229 discloses a process for the preparation of low-viscosity, water-soluble polymer dispersions. In this process, water-soluble monomers, as a mixture with a crosslinkable N-methylol compound, or polymerized in aqueous solution in the presence of at least one polymeric dispersant, the resulting polymer being incompatible with the dispersant. The dispersions thus obtained are used as flocculants.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">WO-A-97/30094 discloses a process for the preparation of dispersions of water-soluble cationic vinyl polymers, water-soluble, cationic hydrophobically modified vinyl monomers or water-soluble, nonionic, hydrophobic vinyl monomers being polymerized with water-soluble, cationic and/or water-soluble neutral vinyl monomers in aqueous salt solutions using a water-soluble initiator in the presence of stabilizers which consist of a graft copolymer which contains polyethylene oxide as the grafting base and grafted-on cationic vinyl monomers as side chains. WO-A 97/34933 relates to aqueous dispersions of high molecular weight, nonionic or anionic polymers which were prepared by polymerization of the monomers in a saturated salt solution with addition of an anionic, water-soluble polymer stabilizer. Preferably used monomers are acrylamide and acrylic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide aqueous dispersions of water-soluble polymers, which dispersions are virtually free of stabilizing inorganic salts.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">We have found that this object is achieved, according to the invention, by aqueous dispersions of water-soluble polymers of N-vinylformamide and/or of N-vinylacetamide if the dispersions contain, based on 100 parts by weight of water,

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">Particularly preferred dispersions are those which contain, as component (A), homopolymers of N-vinylformamide. N-vinylformamide units and N-vinylacetamide units can be characterized with the aid of the following formula:</p>

where R is H or CH<sub>3</sub>.
</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016">The water-soluble polymers containing N-vinylformamide units and/or N-vinylacetamide units can, if required, contain from 1 to 80, preferably from 5 to 30, % by weight of further monomers as copolymerized units. Such monomers are, for example, monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids of 3 to 8 carbon atoms, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, dimethacrylic acid, ethacrylic acid, maleic acid, citraconic acid, methylenemalonic acid, allylacetic acid, vinylacetic acid, crotonic acid, fumaric acid, mesaconic acid and itaconic acid. From this group of monomers, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid or mixtures of said carboxylic acids are preferably used. The monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids are used either in the form of the free acids or in the form of their free alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or ammonium salts in the copolymerization.

<p id="p-0014" num="0017">Further suitable monomers are, for example, the esters, amides and nitriles of the abovementioned carboxylic acids, e.g. methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxybutyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxyisobutyl acrylate, hydroxyisobutyl methacrylate, monomethyl maleate, dimethyl maleate, monoethyl maleate, diethyl maleate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-dimethylacrylamide, N-tert-butylacrylamide, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, diethylaminoethyl acrylate, diethylaminoethyl methacrylate and the salts of the last-mentioned basic monomers with carboxylic acids or mineral acids and the quaternized products of the basic (meth)acrylates.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0018">Other suitable copolymerizable monomers are furthermore acrylamidoglycolic acid, vinylsulfonic acid, allylsulfonic acid, methallylsulfonic acid, styrenesulfonic acid, 3-sulfopropyl acrylate, 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate and acrylamidomethylpropanesulfonic acid and monomers containing phosphoric acid groups, such as vinylphosphonic acid, allylphosphonic acid and acrylamidomethylpropanephosphonic acid. The monomers containing acid groups can be used in the polymerization in the form of free acid groups and in a form partially or completely neutralized with bases.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0019">Further suitable copolymerizable compounds are N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinylcaprolactam, N-vinylimidazole, N-vinyl-2-methylimidazole, N-vinyl-4-methylimidazole, diallylammonium chloride, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate and styrene. It is of course also possible to use mixtures of said monomers. The said monomers when polymerized alone do not give water-soluble polymers, the polymers containing N-vinylformamide units and/or N-vinylacetamide units contain these comonomers as polymerized units only in amounts such that the copolymers are still water-soluble. In contrast to water-in-oil polymer emulsions, no organic solvents are required for the novel aqueous dispersions. As is evident from the prior art stated at the outset, concentrated solutions of inorganic salts are a conventional medium for the preparation of aqueous dispersions of water-soluble polymers. As a result, the known dispersions have a very high salt load. Novel aqueous dispersions of water-soluble polymers are in comparison virtually salt-free. The aqueous dispersions of water-soluble polymers of N-vinylformamide and/or N-vinylacetamide preferably have a high polymer content and preferably contain polymers having high molar masses in combination with low viscosity. The molar masses of the polymers containing N-vinylformamide units and/or N-vinylacetamide units are, for example, from 5·10<sup>4 </sup>to 1·10<sup>7</sup>, preferably from 2·10<sup>5 </sup>to 1·10<sup>6</sup>.</p>

The polymeric dispersant (B) is incompatible with the water-soluble polymer (A). The average molar masses of the polymeric dispersants are preferably from 1000 to 500,000, in particular from 1500 to 50,000.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0022">If the aqueous dispersions of water-soluble polymers of N-vinylcarboxamides are used in papermaking, polymeric dispersants which have further process- or product-improving properties are preferably used for the preparation of these dispersions. In this way, it is possible to offer combination solutions to the papermaker. For example, the dispersants (B) of the aqueous dispersions of water-soluble polymers of N-vinylcarboxamides can be selected from compounds which are employed in papermaking as fixing compositions, wet or dry strength agents, dispersants for inorganic solids, antiadhesion compositions for better release from rollers or detackifiers, with the result that the soft, tacky impurities of the paper stock are converted into brittle deposits. In papermaking, it is of course possible to use further process assistants together with the novel aqueous dispersions. For example, a polyacrylamide or polyethylene oxide having retention activity may additionally be used with a novel aqueous dispersion of poly-N-vinylformamide.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0030">The monomers are subjected to free radical polymerization according to the invention, i.e. polymerization inhibitors which form free radicals under the polymerization conditions are used. Suitable compounds of this type are, for example, hydrogen peroxide, peroxides, hydroperoxides, redox catalysts and nonoxidizing initiators, such as azocompounds which decompose into free radicals under the polymerization conditions.

<br/>
are polymerized at from 40 to 55° C. with water-soluble azoinitiators.

</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0033">If polymer dispersions and polymers having low molecular weights are desired, it is possible, for example, to increase the amounts of initiator which are usually used in the polymerization so that it is also possible to use amounts of initiator which are outside the abovementioned range for the amounts of initiator. Aqueous dispersions of low molecular weight homo- and copolymers of the suitable vinylcarboxamides can also be obtained by carrying out the polymerization in the presence of polymerization regulators and, if required, simultaneously using a larger amount of initiator than that usually required. Suitable polymerization regulators are, for example, compounds containing sulfur in bound form, such as dodecyl mercaptan, thioglycolic acid, thioacetic acid and mercaptoalcohols, such as mercaptoethanol, mercaptopropanols and mercaptobutanols. In addition, formic acid, isopropanol and hydrazine in the form of salts with strong acid may also be used as polymerization regulators.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0034">The molecular weights of the polymers present in dispersed form can also be characterized with the aid of the K values according to Fikentscher. The K values are up to 300 and preferably in the range from 130 to 180. From light scattering experiments, it follows that a K value of 250 corresponds to an average molecular weight of the polymers of about 7,000,000 dalton.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0035">By eliminating formyl groups from polymers containing N-vinylformamide units and by eliminating the group CH<sub>3</sub>—CO— from polymers containing N-vinylacetamide units, polymers containing vinylamine units are formed in each case. Elimination may be effected partially or completely. If the hydrolysis is carried out in the presence of acids, the vinyamine units of the polymers are present as ammonium salts. The hydrolysis can also be carried out with the aid of bases, for example of metal hydroxides, in particular of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides. Preferably, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide is used. In particular cases, hydrolysis can also be carried out with the aid of ammonia or amines. In the case of the hydrolysis in the presence of bases, the vinylamine units are present in the form of free bases.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0036">Suitable hydrolysis agents are preferably mineral acids, such as halogen halides, which may be used in gaseous form or as an aqueous solution. Concentrated hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid or phosphoric acid and organic acids, such as C<sub>1</sub>- to C<sub>5</sub>-carboxylic acids, and aliphatic or aromatic sulfonic acid are preferably used. For example, from 0.05 to 2, in particular from 1 to 1.5, molar equivalents of acid are required per equivalent of formyl groups in the polymers containing polymerized N-vinylformamide units. Hydrolysis of the N-vinylformamide units takes place significantly more rapidly than that of the polymers having N-vinylacetamide units. If copolymers of the suitable vinylcarboxamides with other comonomers are subjected to the hydrolysis, the comonomer units contained in the copolymer can also be chemically modified. For example, vinyl alcohol units are formed from vinyl acetate units. In hydrolysis, acrylic acid units are formed from methyl acrylate units, and acrylamide or acrylic acid units are formed from acrylonitrile units. The hydrolysis of the N-vinylformamide units and/or vinylacetamide units of the polymers (A) can be carried out to an extent of from 5 to 100%, preferably from 10 to 40%. Although aqueous dispersions of water-soluble N-vinylcarboxamides dissolve on dilution with water, the dispersion is surprisingly not destroyed during hydrolysis. The particle diameter of the hydrolyzed particles before and after the hydrolysis is from 50 nm to 2 μm or preferably from 50 nm to 2 μm and in most cases from 100 to 700 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0037">The dispersions described above, i.e. the unhydrolyzed as well as the hydrolyzed aqueous dispersions of water-soluble N-vinylcarboxamides, are used as drainage aids, flocculants and retention aids and as wet and dry strength agents and as fixing compositions in papermaking. The cationic polymers can moreover be used as flocculants for wastewaters in the dewatering of sewage sludge, as flocculants in ore dressing and in tertiary oil production or as dispersants, for example, for inorganic and organic pigments, dyes, cement or crop protection agents. The unhydrolyzed as well as the hydrolyzed aqueous dispersions can moreover be used as strength agents for paper, as fixing compositions for soluble and insoluble interfering substances in papermaking and as compositions for paper coating. They can furthermore be used as coating material for fertilizers and crop protection agents and as floorcare compositions. Said aqueous hydrolyzed and unhydrolyzed polymer dispersions can also be used in cosmetics, for example for hair formulations, for example conditioners, hairsetting compositions or conditioners for skincare compositions and as thickeners for cosmetic formulations and furthermore as a component of cosmetic formulations for oral hygiene.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0038">The K values were determined according to H. Fikentscher, Cellulose-Chemie, 13 (1932), 58-64 and 71-74, in aqueous solution at 25° C. and at a concentration which, depending on the K value range, of from 0.1 to 5% by weight. The viscosity of the dispersion was measured in each case in a Brookfield viscometer using a no. 4 spindle at 20 rpm and at 20° C. The data in % are percentages by weight.</p>
