<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation-in-part and claims priority benefit, with regard to all common subject matter, of an earlier-filed U.S. patent application titled “IMPROVED MOUNT ASSEMBLY FOR ELECTRONIC DEVICES,” Ser. No. 11/181,261, filed Jul. 14, 2005, which issued May 22, 2007 as U.S. Pat. No. 7,219,867 and which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to the field of mounting assemblies for electronic devices. More particularly, the invention relates to a mounting assembly with a ball and socket joint, wherein the ball and socket are easily separable for quick installation and removal of an electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of electronic devices in vehicles has increased in recent years. For example, it is increasingly more common to see electronic devices such as global positioning satellite (GPS) devices, portable telephones, radios and personal digital assistants (PDAs) mounted within vehicles either permanently or, in the case of portable electronics, removably. Many of these devices have displays which visibly communicate information to one or more users. Thus, it is advantageous to be able to adjust a position and angle of such devices to provide maximum viewing capability to the user or users. Portable devices are further advantageous in that they can be taken from the vehicle and used outside of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Due to the wide variety of electronic devices that can be mounted within a vehicle, many different types of mounting apparatuses exist that can secure an electronic device to the dashboard, windshield, floor, or other support surface in a vehicle such that a user may adjust a position of the device. One type of mounting apparatus used with portable electronic devices includes a base connected to a cradle via a ball and socket joint. The base is fixedly or permanently secured to a surface of the vehicle, and the ball and socket joint allows the cradle to be selectively positioned in any of a broad range of positions relative to the base. The cradle receives an electronic device and retains the electronic device with screws or similar fastening devices, allowing a user to selectively adjust a position or orientation of the electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While this type of prior art mounting apparatus is operable to mount a portable electronic device to a vehicle so that the device can be repositioned, it suffers from certain limitations. The cradles of prior mount apparatuses increase the size, weight, and cost of the apparatus, for example, and require a user to loosen or tighten the screws or other fasteners each time the electronic devices are mounted to or removed from the cradles, and loosen and subsequently tighten the screws each time it is desired to re-position the electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there is a need for an improved vehicle mounting apparatus for a portable electronic device that does not suffer from the problems and limitations of the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention solves the above-described problems and provides a distinct advance in the art of vehicle mounting assemblies for electronic devices. More particularly, the present invention involves a mounting assembly with a separable ball and socket joint that eliminates the need for a cradle interposed between a mount and an electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a first embodiment, the invention comprises a mount that may be secured to a surface of a vehicle, a mounting ball projecting from the mount, and a housing for encasing an electronic device. The housing includes a socket assembly for receiving and frictionally engaging the ball to retain the housing in a fixed position relative to the mount.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a second embodiment of the invention, the socket assembly comprises an orifice formed in the back of the housing, a seat positioned in the orifice for matingly receiving the ball, and a spring element partially surrounding the seat. The seat includes a concave portion and flexible, interconnected arms extending from the concave portion for contacting an outer surface of the ball and frictionally resisting rotation of the ball relative to the orifice. The spring element substantially encircles the flexible arms to allow the flexible arms to flex outward when receiving the ball and to then contract inwardly to firmly hold the ball when the ball is seated fully in the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A third embodiment of the invention involves an assembly for removably mounting an electronic device to a vehicle. The assembly comprises a suction-cup mount removably attachable to a surface of the vehicle, a mounting ball projecting from the mount, an electronic device with a housing for encasing the electronic device, and a socket assembly integrally formed in the housing. The socket assembly includes an orifice formed in the back of the housing, a seat positioned in the orifice for matingly receiving the ball, and a spring element partially surrounding the seat. The seat further includes a concave center portion and a plurality of flexible, interconnected arms extending from the concave portion. The arms form a cage smaller in diameter than the ball when the arms are in a relaxed state and are curved to substantially conform to the outer surface of the ball and to engage a hemisphere of the ball distal the concave center portion to retain the ball in the seat. The spring element includes a metal spring ring substantially encircling the arms, wherein the spring ring allows the arms to flex outward when receiving and releasing the ball, and to contract inwardly to contact the ball when the ball is seated fully in the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, the present invention provides a mounting assembly for mounting an electronic device to a surface. The mounting assembly generally includes a base including a mounting ball and a socket assembly operable to frictionally engage the ball to removably couple the socket assembly to the base. The base may be removably coupled with the surface and the socket assembly may be removably coupled with the electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, the mounting assembly includes a base and a socket assembly operable to removably couple with the base and an electronic device. The base includes a circular platform to removably couple with the surface, an arm extending from the platform, and a mounting ball positioned on a distal end of the arm. The socket assembly includes a seat having a plurality of curved arms that are operable to receive and frictionally engage the ball to removably and rotatably couple the socket assembly to the base.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another embodiment, the mounting assembly includes a base and a socket assembly operable to removably couple with the base and an electronic device. The base includes a circular platform to removably mount to the surface utilizing suction, a lever coupled with the platform, an arm extending from the platform and operable to rotate with respect to the platform, and a mounting ball positioned on a distal end of the arm. The socket assembly includes an arcuate clip operable to removably couple with the electronic device and a seat coupled with the clip. The seat has a plurality of curved and interconnected arms that substantially conform to an outer surface of the ball. The arms are operable to contact the outer surface of the ball to receive the ball to removably and rotatably couple the socket assembly to the base and to frictionally resist rotation of the ball relative to the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">These and other features of the present invention are described more fully in the detailed description below.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an exemplary mounting assembly for electronic devices employing the principles of the present invention is shown and designated generally by the reference numeral <b>10</b>. The mounting assembly <b>10</b> comprises a mount <b>12</b> including a base <b>14</b> and a mounting ball <b>16</b>; and a housing <b>18</b> for a portable electronic device <b>20</b>, wherein the housing <b>18</b> presents a socket assembly <b>22</b> for receiving the ball <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The mount <b>12</b> removably secures to a surface of a vehicle (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), such as a windshield of the vehicle, and supports the electronic device <b>20</b> in view of a user, such as a vehicle driver or passenger. The mount <b>12</b> includes a rigid circular base <b>14</b> that is generally convex so as to curve away from the vehicle surface. A flexible sheet <b>24</b> is positioned between the base <b>14</b> and the vehicle surface for engaging the vehicle surface with a vacuum grip, wherein an air-tight seal is created between the flexible sheet <b>24</b> and the vehicle surface. The mount <b>12</b> can also be replaced with a mount that is more permanently applied to the windshield or other surface with adhesives, a mount with a weighted base that rests on a vehicle dashboard, or any other type of mounting device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A lever <b>26</b> is positioned generally in a center of the base <b>14</b> and connects to a center of the flexible sheet <b>24</b> through the base <b>14</b> and enables the user to actuate the flexible sheet <b>24</b> to create the vacuum gripping function. A tab <b>28</b> of the flexible sheet <b>24</b> extends beyond a rim of the base <b>14</b> and enables a user to release the mount <b>12</b> by breaking the air-tight seal between the flexible sheet <b>24</b> and the vehicle surface. The vacuum grip or “suction cup” function of the mount <b>12</b> is substantially conventional in nature and therefore will not be described in greater detail here.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the ball <b>16</b> is connected to the base <b>14</b> via a neck <b>30</b> projecting from the base <b>14</b>. The neck <b>30</b> is eccentrically located on the base <b>14</b> and projects substantially normally therefrom, but projects slightly away from a center of the base <b>14</b>. The ball <b>16</b> is connected to the neck <b>30</b> such that a center of the ball <b>16</b> is proximate a line extending normally from an edge of the base <b>14</b> and is spaced approximately one and one-quarter inches from the base <b>14</b>. The ball <b>16</b> is substantially rigid to prevent deformation thereof and presents an outer surface that introduces sufficient friction between the ball <b>16</b> and the socket assembly <b>22</b> to resist movement of the electronic device <b>20</b> relative to the mount <b>12</b>. The ball <b>16</b> is thus constructed of plastic or another sturdy material that presents a rough surface, or is coated to present a rough or soft surface with the friction characteristics described above.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The electronic device <b>20</b> may be any portable electronic device to be removably mounted in a vehicle. The illustrated device <b>20</b> is a model i3 STREETPILOT™ GPS-based navigational device manufactured by GARMIN™. The housing <b>18</b> of the electronic device <b>20</b> encases the electronic device <b>20</b> and is substantially conventional, except that the housing <b>18</b> presents a socket assembly <b>22</b> for removably connecting directly to the ball <b>16</b> of the mount <b>12</b>, wherein the socket assembly <b>22</b> frictionally engages the ball <b>16</b> to retain the housing <b>18</b> in a fixed position relative to the mount <b>12</b>. The socket assembly <b>22</b> generally comprises an orifice <b>32</b> formed in the back of the housing <b>18</b>, a seat <b>34</b> positioned in the orifice <b>32</b> for matingly receiving the ball <b>16</b>, and a spring element <b>36</b> partially surrounding the seat <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The seat includes a concave center portion <b>38</b> and a plurality of flexible, interconnected arms. In one embodiment, four arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> (only three of which are visible in the drawing figures) are spaced at 90° intervals and extend from the concave center portion. However, any number of arms may be provided without departing from the scope of the present invention. The concave center portion <b>38</b> presents a continuous, bowl-shaped surface concave to the orifice <b>32</b> such that the center portion <b>38</b> matingly receives the ball <b>16</b>. The center portion <b>38</b> is constructed of plastic or other material presenting a surface that introduces friction between the center portion <b>38</b> and the ball <b>16</b> to resist movement of the ball <b>16</b> relative to the orifice <b>32</b>. Furthermore, the center portion <b>38</b> is in a fixed position relative to the housing <b>18</b> and is substantially rigid so as not to yield to pressure exerted by the ball <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> are connected to and extend from a periphery of the center portion <b>38</b> and are curved to form a circular cage, wherein the center portion <b>38</b> and the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> together define a generally spherical cavity for receiving and retaining the ball <b>16</b>. The ball <b>16</b> and seat <b>34</b> are constructed such that the ball <b>16</b> snaps into and out of the spherical cavity defined by the seat <b>34</b>. When the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> are in a relaxed or unflexed state, the inside of the cage formed by the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> is slightly smaller in diameter than an external surface of the ball <b>16</b>, such that when the ball <b>16</b> is inserted into the cage the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> engage and press against the ball <b>16</b>. In this manner, the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> frictionally resist rotation of the ball <b>16</b> within the socket assembly <b>22</b> and require a user to manually push the electronic device <b>20</b> from a first position to a second position relative to the mount <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref> illustrated the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> engaging the ball <b>16</b> when the ball <b>16</b> is seated in the socket assembly <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> curve around the ball <b>16</b> from the periphery of the center portion <b>38</b> to a point that is on a hemisphere of the ball <b>16</b> opposite the center portion <b>38</b> to retain the ball <b>16</b> in the seat <b>32</b>. In other words, the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> “reach around” the ball <b>16</b> from the center portion <b>38</b> such that the opening of the cage is smaller than the diameter of the ball <b>16</b>. This allows the ball <b>16</b> to be snapped into the socket assembly <b>22</b> by forcing the ball <b>16</b> into the socket assembly <b>22</b> and toward the center portion <b>38</b> of the seat <b>32</b>, wherein the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> flex outwardly to allow a girth of the ball <b>16</b> to pass through the opening of the cage and then contract inward when the ball <b>16</b> is fully seated in the socket assembly <b>22</b>. Likewise, the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> release the ball <b>16</b> by flexing outward when the ball <b>16</b> is forced away from the center portion <b>38</b> of the seat <b>34</b> and out of the socket assembly <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> flexing outward to accommodate passage of the ball <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The spring element <b>36</b> partially encircles the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> and is operable to bias the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> inwardly to contact the ball <b>16</b> when the ball <b>16</b> is in the socket assembly <b>22</b>, while allowing the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> to flex outwardly to receive and release the ball <b>16</b>. The illustrated spring element <b>36</b> is a metal spring ring that substantially encircles the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b>, and is approximately one-quarter to one-half of an inch wide, approximately three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and presents a gap <b>46</b> of approximately one-eighth to one-quarter inch between ends thereof. The gap <b>46</b> allows the spring ring to flex. When the ball <b>16</b> is not in the socket assembly <b>22</b>, the spring element <b>36</b> is relaxed and applies little or no biasing pressure on the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b>. When the ball <b>16</b> is forced into the socket assembly <b>22</b>, the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> flex outwardly, as discussed above, and engage the spring element <b>36</b>, causing the spring element <b>36</b> to also flex outwardly wherein the gap <b>46</b> widens. When the ball <b>16</b> is snapped into the seated position the spring element <b>36</b> biases the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> inwardly against the ball <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Thus, the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> and the spring element <b>36</b> cooperate to frictionally resist rotation of the ball <b>16</b> within the socket assembly <b>22</b> and to retain the ball <b>16</b> in the socket assembly <b>22</b>. The cooperation between the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> and spring element <b>36</b> presents a distinct advance in the art because, among other things, the combination is more effective in retaining the ball <b>16</b> within the socket assembly <b>22</b> than either component would be individually. The arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> alone, for example, typically would not provide as strong a spring force as the combination of the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> and the spring element <b>36</b>, and may permanently bend outward or even break after repeated use. Furthermore, the spring element <b>36</b> acting alone would provide less contact area with the ball <b>16</b>, and metal would provide less friction against the ball <b>16</b> to resist rotation of the ball <b>16</b> within the socket assembly <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In use, the mount <b>12</b> is installed in a vehicle by selecting a suitably smooth and flat surface. Such a surface may be on a windshield, other window, or dashboard. Alternatively, a specially made material may be attached to a surface of the vehicle to provide a superior mounting surface for the suction cup mount. The mount <b>12</b> is pressed onto the surface and the lever <b>26</b> is flipped downward to secure the mount <b>12</b> to the surface via the vacuum grip function. Once the mount <b>12</b> is secured to the surface, the electronic device <b>20</b> may be easily snapped onto and off of the mount <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To secure the electronic device <b>20</b> to the mount <b>12</b>, the user simply places the orifice <b>32</b> of the socket assembly <b>22</b> over the ball <b>16</b> and pushes the socket assembly <b>22</b> onto the ball <b>16</b>. The electronic device <b>20</b> may then be repositioned as the user desires and the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> will cause the electronic device <b>20</b> to remain in its current position. To remove the electronic device <b>20</b> from the mount <b>12</b>, the electronic device <b>20</b> is rotated to an extreme angle relative to the mount <b>12</b>, such as to the user's left or right, and then pushed beyond the angle to cause the socket assembly <b>22</b> to snap off of the ball <b>16</b>. Alternatively, the electronic device <b>20</b> can be pulled straight out to cause the socket assembly to snap off the ball, but this requires more pulling force. The mount <b>12</b> is removed from the vehicle's surface by lifting the lever <b>26</b> away from the base <b>14</b> of the mount <b>12</b> to release the suction cup and the tab is pulled away from the vehicle surface.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-11</figref>, the present invention provides a mounting assembly <b>100</b> operable to couple an electronic device D to a surface S, such as a windshield. The mounting assembly <b>100</b> broadly includes a base <b>102</b> operable to removably couple with the surface S and a socket assembly <b>104</b> operable to removably couple with both the electronic device D and the base <b>102</b>. Such a configuration enables the electronic device D to be easily positioned in confined environments by first attaching the base <b>102</b> to the surface S, then attaching the socket assembly <b>104</b> to the base <b>102</b> and positioning the socket assembly <b>104</b> in a desired orientation, and finally attaching the electronic device D to the socket assembly <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The base <b>102</b> preferably includes a circular platform <b>106</b> operable to removably mount to the surface S, an arm <b>108</b> extending from the platform <b>106</b>, and a mounting ball <b>110</b> positioned on a distal end of the arm <b>108</b>. The circular platform <b>106</b> may removably mount to the surface S utilizing various methods and devices, such as by utilizing mating components, adhesive elements, hook and loop fasteners such as VELCRO, latches, etc. Preferably, the circular platform <b>106</b> removably mounts to the surface S utilizing suction. For instance, the circular platform <b>106</b> may include a flexible sheet <b>112</b> for creating a vacuum-seal with the surface S in a substantially similar manner to that discussed above regarding the flexible sheet <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The circular platform <b>106</b> may additionally include a lever <b>114</b> coupled with the flexible sheet <b>112</b> to engage the sheet to facilitate suction mounting of the base <b>102</b> to the surface S. The flexible sheet <b>112</b> may also include a tab to facilitate removal of the base <b>102</b> from the surface S by breaking the vacuum seal between the flexible sheet <b>112</b> and the surface S. The lever <b>114</b> and the tab are substantially similar to the lever <b>26</b> and tab <b>28</b> discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The arm <b>108</b> extends from the platform <b>106</b> to facilitate coupling with the socket assembly <b>104</b>. Preferably, the arm <b>108</b> is rotatably coupled with the platform <b>106</b> to enable the arm <b>108</b> to rotate with respect to the base <b>102</b>. The arm <b>108</b> may be rotatably coupled with the circular platform <b>106</b>, or other portions of the base <b>102</b>, utilizing various devices and methods, such as hinges, pivoting elements, flexible elements, etc. For instance, the circular platform <b>106</b> may include a raised axle <b>116</b> around which the arm <b>108</b> is operable to pivot.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The rotatable coupling of the arm <b>108</b> and the platform <b>106</b> preferably enables the arm <b>108</b> to be rotated by a user when force is applied but resists rotation of the arm <b>108</b> relative to the base <b>102</b> in the absence of user applied force. Thus, friction is preferably provided between the arm <b>108</b> and the circular platform <b>106</b>, such as by having the axle <b>116</b> fit snugly through the arm <b>108</b> or by utilizing a hinge having resistive properties, to prevent inadvertent movement of the arm <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The ball <b>110</b> is positioned at the distal end of the arm <b>108</b> opposite the circular platform <b>106</b>. The ball <b>110</b> may be integral with the arm <b>108</b> to facilitate formation of the arm <b>108</b> or the ball <b>110</b> may be removable from the arm <b>108</b>, such as where a plurality of balls are provided to conform to various socket assemblies. The ball <b>110</b> is substantially similar to the ball <b>16</b> discussed above. Thus, the ball <b>110</b> is substantially rigid to prevent deformation thereof and presents an outer surface that introduces sufficient friction between the ball <b>110</b> and the socket assembly <b>104</b> to resist movement of the electronic device D relative to the base <b>102</b>. The ball <b>110</b> may be constructed of plastic or another sturdy material that presents a rough surface, or may be coated to present a rough or soft surface with the friction characteristics described above.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The socket assembly <b>104</b> removably couples with both the base <b>102</b> and the electronic device D. Preferably, the socket assembly <b>104</b> removably couples with the base <b>102</b> by receiving and frictionally engaging at least a portion of the ball <b>110</b>. In various embodiments the socket assembly <b>104</b> includes a seat <b>118</b> positioned at least partially within an orifice <b>120</b> operable to receive at least a portion of the ball <b>110</b>. The seat <b>118</b> and the orifice <b>120</b> are substantially similar to the seat <b>34</b> and the orifice <b>32</b> discussed above, with an exception being the seat <b>118</b> and orifice <b>120</b> are positioned on an assembly removable from an electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a similar manner to the seat <b>34</b>, the seat <b>118</b> may include a plurality of interconnected arms <b>122</b> substantially similar to the arms <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, discussed above. The arms <b>122</b> preferably substantially conform to the outer surface of the ball <b>110</b> to enable receipt of the ball <b>110</b>, to removably and rotatably couple the socket assembly <b>104</b> to the base <b>102</b>, and to frictionally resist rotation of the ball <b>110</b> relative to the seat <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The socket assembly <b>104</b> may additionally include a spring element <b>124</b> operable to facilitate coupling of the ball <b>110</b> and the seat <b>118</b>. The spring element <b>124</b> is substantially similar to the spring element <b>36</b> discussed above and functions in a substantially similar manner. Thus, the arms <b>122</b> and the spring element <b>124</b> cooperate to frictionally resist rotation of the ball <b>110</b> within the socket assembly <b>104</b> and to retain the ball <b>110</b> in the socket assembly <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The socket assembly <b>104</b> may removably couple with the electronic device D utilizing any coupling element, fastener, or other removable securing element. Preferably, the socket assembly <b>104</b> includes an arcuate clip <b>126</b> operable to removably couple with the electronic device D. The arcuate clip <b>126</b> includes a generally rounded portion to enable the electronic device D to receive or otherwise couple with a portion of the arcuate clip <b>126</b> and rest against a front <b>128</b> of the socket assembly <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Thus, the electronic device may be secured to the mounting assembly <b>100</b> by receiving a portion of the arcuate clip <b>126</b> and/or by resting on a portion of the arcuate clip <b>126</b>. Utilization of the arcuate clip <b>126</b> additionally facilitates coupling of the electronic device D and the socket assembly <b>104</b> as the electronic device D may be quickly and easily positioned on the arcuate clip <b>126</b> due to its generally rounded profile.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The socket assembly <b>104</b> may additionally or alternatively include other coupling elements, such as a protrusion <b>130</b> that extends from the front <b>128</b> of the assembly <b>104</b> to removably couple or support the electronic device D. For example, the protrusion <b>130</b> may removably and securely attach the electronic device D to the assembly <b>104</b>. In various embodiments, the combination of the arcuate clip <b>126</b> and the protrusion <b>130</b> more securely couples the electronic device D to the assembly <b>104</b> than utilization of either element by itself.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In various embodiments, the socket assembly <b>104</b> may also include a spring-biased retaining member <b>132</b>. The retaining member <b>132</b> is preferably positioned between the front <b>128</b> of the assembly <b>104</b> and a rear <b>134</b> of the assembly <b>104</b>. The retaining member <b>132</b> facilitates coupling of both the electronic device D and the base <b>102</b> to the assembly <b>104</b> by providing a biasing force. The retaining member <b>132</b> may include a locking element <b>136</b> operable to lock the retaining member <b>132</b> in a positioned when a predetermined amount of force is applied. The retaining member <b>132</b> preferably enables the electronic device D to be forcefully coupled with the socket assembly <b>104</b> without imparting undesirable force to the arm <b>108</b> or base <b>102</b> to inadvertently position the mounting assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In operation, the mounting assembly <b>100</b> is operable to be utilized in a generally similar manner to the mount <b>12</b> described above. However, the removable configuration of the socket assembly <b>104</b> additionally facilitates mounting of the assembly <b>100</b>. Specifically, a user may individually couple the base <b>102</b> with the surface S, individually couple the socket assembly <b>104</b> to the base <b>102</b>, and then couple the electronic device D to the socket assembly <b>104</b>. Similarly, the socket assembly <b>104</b> may be detached from the electronic device D to quickly remove the electronic device D from the mounting assembly <b>100</b> without requiring removal of the ball <b>110</b> from the seat <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although the invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment illustrated in the attached drawings, it is noted that equivalents may be employed and substitutions made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as recited in the claims. It will be appreciated, for example, that the metal spring ring <b>40</b> may be replaced with a similar element capable of biasing the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> against the ball <b>16</b> including, for example, a plastic spring ring or a rubber or elastomer ring that entirely encircles the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b>. Furthermore, the arms <b>40</b>,<b>42</b>,<b>44</b> need not be plastic buy may be constructed of any flexible, friction-producing material and may be connected to an element of the housing <b>18</b> other than the center portion <b>38</b>. Further yet, it will be appreciated that use of the ball and socket assembly disclosed herein is not restricted to portable electronic devices, but may also be used to removably retain other devices, such as, for example, mirrors.</p>
