<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to apparatus and methods for treating heart disease, particularly congestive heart disease and related heart disfunctions. More particularly, this disclosure relates to apparatus and methods for securing a cardiac support device to a heart.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Congestive heart disease is a progressive and debilitating illness. The disease is characterized by a progressive enlargement of heart. As the heart enlarges, the heart is performing an increasing amount of work in order to pump blood for each heart beat. In time, the heart becomes so enlarged that the heart cannot adequately supply blood. An afflicted patient is fatigued, unable to perform even simple exerting tasks and experiences pain and discomfort. Further, as the heart enlarges, the internal heart valves cannot adequately close. This impairs the function of the valves and further reduces the heart's ability to supply blood.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The assignee of this disclosure has developed a device that can be placed on an enlarged heart and fit snugly. One implementation of the assignee's device is characterized as a knit jacket device that is fit around a heart and then secured thereto through a variety of means. The jacket helps to constrain cardiac expansion beyond a predetermined limit. Examples of useable jackets are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,702,343; 6,123,662; 6,241,654; 6,085,754; 6,230,714; 6,169,922; 6,155,972; 6,193,648; 6,293,906; 6,482,146; 6,425,856; 6,572,533; 6,564,094; and 6,416,459. Each of the foregoing patents is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Improvements in securing cardiac support devices to hearts are desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with principles of this disclosure, a method is provided for operably securing a cardiac support device to a mammalian heart. In general, the method includes gathering excess material in a cardiac support device that is loosely positioned around the heart. The cardiac support device includes a jacket having flexible material. The method includes gathering excess material to form an aligned region; simultaneously forming a plurality of offsets in the aligned region; and inserting a fastener through the offsets.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with principles of this disclosure, a device is provided for closing a slot in a cardiac support device operably positioned around a heart. The device includes a jaw arrangement with cooperating pleat forming members. The pleat forming members are sized to form pleats in excess jacket material.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">One embodiment of a cardiac support device useable with techniques described herein is shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> at <b>20</b>. The cardiac support device <b>20</b>, when operably secure onto the heart of a mammal, will limit the outward expansion of the heart wall during diastolic chamber filling beyond a predetermined size. By “operably secured”, it is meant that the device <b>20</b> is oriented to enclose portions of the heart and is tightened so there is no excess material or loose slack in the device <b>20</b>. By “tightened”, it is meant that the device <b>20</b> will not be worked loose from the heart under normal conditions. The expansion constraint applied to the heart by the cardiac support device <b>20</b> is determined by the physician based upon, for example, cardiac output performance or cardiac volume. The cardiac support device <b>20</b> provides cardiac reinforcement during diastole.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For purposes of the method of this disclosure and the apparatus or device used for the method, many types of cardiac support devices <b>20</b> are useable. The particular cardiac support device <b>20</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a jacket <b>22</b>. Preferred jackets <b>22</b> will be constructed of a biologically compatible material. In preferred implementations, the jacket <b>22</b> is a knitted construction <b>24</b>. In the specific example shown, the knitted construction <b>24</b> includes a continuous, flexible mesh net <b>26</b> having a base edge <b>28</b> and an opposite apex <b>30</b>. It should be noted that the jacket <b>22</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown after placement onto a heart and secured thereto. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically shows the jacket <b>22</b> as it would appear loosely positioned around a heart <b>32</b> before being operably secured thereto (for example, with a seam in place and with excess material gathered). The base edge <b>28</b> can be seen forming a peripheral edge opposite from the apex <b>30</b>, which is located in snugging engagement with the heart apex <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Still in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the particular jacket <b>22</b> depicted in the drawings also includes a first lateral edge <b>36</b> and a second lateral edge <b>38</b> extending from the base edge <b>28</b>. When wrapped around the heart <b>32</b>, the jacket <b>22</b> is shaped such that the first lateral edge <b>36</b> and second lateral edge <b>38</b> are adjacent and opposing each other to define an open slot <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In the cardiac support device <b>20</b> shown, the slot <b>40</b> generally extends from the base edge <b>28</b> and terminates at the apex <b>30</b>. In other embodiments, jacket <b>22</b> is not slotted, but instead, forms a continuous surrounding enclosure for the heart <b>32</b>. These other embodiments have the jacket <b>22</b> sized with excess material so that it can be loosely positioned over the heart <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with principles of this disclosure, a method is provided for operably securing the jacket <b>22</b> to the heart <b>32</b> after the cardiac support device <b>20</b> has been positioned around the heart <b>32</b>. Various ways of positioning the cardiac support device <b>20</b> onto the heart <b>32</b> can be used. For example, the cardiac support device <b>20</b> can be placed around the heart <b>32</b> by the methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,293,906, incorporated herein by reference. In addition, methods can be used in accordance with the co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/663,623 filed Sep. 16, 2003 , entitled “APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR APPLYING CARDIAC SUPPORT DEVICE”, incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Once the cardiac support device <b>20</b> is positioned around the heart <b>32</b>, methods and apparatus in accordance with principles of this disclosure can be utilized to secure the cardiac support device <b>20</b> to the heart <b>32</b>. In general, excess material in the jacket <b>22</b> is gathered and secured to other portions of the jacket <b>22</b> to prevent the jacket <b>22</b> from working loose from the heart <b>32</b>. In one example, and in reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, once the cardiac support device <b>20</b> has been positioned over the heart <b>32</b>, it will be resting on the heart <b>32</b> such that the slot <b>40</b> is open and, in the arrangement depicted, is on an anterior portion of the heart <b>32</b>. To secure the jacket <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to the heart <b>32</b>, the slot <b>40</b> is closed. In one implementation, the slot <b>40</b> is closed by placing a closure <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the jacket <b>22</b> between the first lateral edge <b>36</b> and second lateral edge <b>38</b> to close the jacket <b>22</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, closure <b>42</b> is depicted securing together the first lateral edge <b>36</b> and second lateral edge <b>38</b>. In the particular arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the closure <b>42</b> is a seam <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In general, for the slotted cardiac support device <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, preferred methods include aligning at least a portion of the first lateral edge <b>36</b> and the second lateral edge <b>38</b> to form an aligned region <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). At this aligned region <b>52</b>, a plurality of offsets <b>54</b> is simultaneously formed so that a fastener can be inserted through the offsets <b>54</b> to secure the first lateral edge <b>36</b> to the second lateral edge <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Attention is directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, which show example steps for carrying out methods in accordance with the disclosure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the jacket <b>22</b> is shown with the slot <b>40</b> exposed. A device <b>50</b> is depicted approaching the jacket <b>22</b> in order to carry out subsequent steps to the method.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a step of aligning at least a portion of the first lateral edge <b>36</b> with a portion of the second lateral edge <b>38</b> to form aligned region <b>52</b>. By “aligned region”, it is meant a region of overlap of the jacket <b>22</b>, and in the example shown, the overlap is between the first lateral edge <b>36</b> and the second lateral edge <b>38</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also depicts the steps of simultaneously forming pleats or a plurality of offsets <b>54</b> in the aligned region <b>52</b>. By “offsets”, it is meant portions of the jacket <b>22</b> along the aligned region that do not form a straight line. If the jacket <b>22</b> is a non-slotted version, the pleats or offsets are formed by gathering excess material (slack) in the jacket <b>22</b> along an aligned region (an overlapped region of material).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one example method, the step of simultaneously forming a plurality of offsets <b>54</b> includes forming a plurality of undulations <b>56</b> in the aligned region <b>52</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. By “undulations”, it is meant a wavy appearance, such that the aligned region <b>52</b> resembles a wave pattern <b>58</b>. The particular wave pattern <b>58</b> depicted includes regular, continuous folds <b>60</b> in the aligned region <b>52</b>. By “regular, continuous folds”, it is meant that the wave pattern <b>58</b> includes alternating ridges <b>62</b> and troughs <b>64</b> repeating, without substantial modification in size and shape.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows another step to the method. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a fastener <b>70</b> is inserted through the offsets <b>54</b> to secure the excess material to a remaining portion of the jacket <b>22</b>. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> embodiment, it secures the first lateral edge <b>36</b> to the second lateral edge <b>38</b>. In the particular example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the fastener <b>70</b> includes a thread or suture <b>72</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the suture <b>72</b> is lead through the offsets <b>54</b> by a needle <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In general, the step of inserting the fastener <b>70</b> through the offsets <b>54</b> completes the closure <b>42</b>, leaving seam <b>44</b> in place. The suture <b>72</b> can be knotted, tied, or secured in some fashion to the jacket <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As will be appreciated in connection with the example device <b>50</b> described below, in preferred methods, the step of forming an aligned region <b>52</b> and the step of simultaneously forming a plurality of offsets <b>54</b> are conducted concurrently (that is, at the same time, or simultaneously).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>, one embodiment of the device <b>50</b> that can be used in implementing the example methods described herein is depicted. The example device <b>50</b> illustrated includes a jaw arrangement <b>78</b> having a first clamp member <b>80</b> and a second clamp member <b>82</b>. The first clamp member <b>80</b> and the second clamp member <b>82</b> are constructed and arranged to be moveable into and out of mateable engagement. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> and <b>9</b> illustrate the first clamp <b>80</b> and the second clamp member <b>82</b> in mateable engagement. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref> show the first clamp <b>80</b> and second clamp member <b>82</b> out of mateable engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first clamp member <b>80</b> is shown in perspective view. The first clamp member <b>80</b> depicted is generally a block <b>84</b> having a first engagement surface <b>86</b>. The first engagement surface <b>86</b> is the surface that interacts with the second clamp member <b>82</b> when the clamp members <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> are in mateable engagement. The block <b>84</b> depicted is a straight block, in that the points of the engagement surface <b>86</b> are co-planar. In other embodiments, the block <b>84</b> is curved, to match the outer contour of the heart <b>32</b>. An example of a curved embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, described below.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The first engagement surface <b>86</b> includes at least two, spaced rows <b>88</b> of offset-forming structure <b>90</b>. In the particular example, there is a first row <b>94</b> and laterally spaced from it, a second row <b>96</b>. Each of the first row <b>94</b> and the second row <b>96</b> includes the offset-forming structure <b>90</b>. The space between the first row <b>94</b> and second row <b>96</b> defines a first clamp member groove <b>98</b>. The purpose of the clamp member groove <b>98</b> will become apparent below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the particular embodiment illustrated, the offset-forming structure <b>90</b> in the first row <b>94</b> includes pleat-forming members <b>100</b>. The pleat forming members <b>100</b> have a height sufficient to gather excess material of the jacket <b>22</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the pleat forming members <b>100</b> are embodied as a row of alternating peaks <b>102</b> and valleys <b>103</b>. Similarly, the offset-forming structure <b>90</b> in the second row <b>96</b> includes alternating peaks <b>106</b> and valleys <b>107</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the peaks <b>102</b> in the first row <b>94</b> are identical to and spaced directly across from the peaks <b>106</b> in the second row <b>96</b>. Similarly, in the specific embodiment illustrated, the valleys <b>103</b> in the first row <b>94</b> are sized equally to and spaced directly across from the valleys <b>107</b> in the second row <b>96</b>. As can also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in the example first clamp member <b>80</b> shown, the block <b>84</b> defines a first aperture <b>110</b> extending lengthwise through the block <b>84</b> between opposite ends <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>. In the embodiment shown, the aperture <b>110</b> runs generally parallel to the engagement surface <b>86</b>. The aperture <b>110</b> can be used to accommodate holding structure <b>116</b>. For example, in the embodiment shown, a rod or extension <b>118</b> of a medical tool <b>120</b> such as a clamp or tongs <b>122</b> is secured within the aperture <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a perspective view of an example embodiment of the second clamp member <b>82</b>. In general, in the particular embodiment illustrated, the first clamp member <b>80</b> and the second clamp member <b>82</b> are identical structures, and if made by molding, are made from the same mold. As such, the second clamp member <b>82</b> includes a block <b>124</b> having a second engagement surface <b>126</b>. Again, although illustrated as straight in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in other embodiments, the clamp member <b>82</b> can be curved (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, described below). The second engagement surface <b>126</b> includes at least two rows <b>128</b> of offset-forming structure <b>130</b>. The row <b>128</b> includes third row <b>134</b> and fourth row <b>136</b>. A second clamp member groove <b>138</b> is defined by the space between the third row <b>134</b> and fourth row <b>136</b>. The third row <b>134</b> includes pleat forming members <b>100</b> embodied as alternating peaks <b>142</b> and valleys <b>143</b>. The fourth row <b>136</b> includes alternating peaks <b>146</b> and valleys <b>147</b>. There is also shown an aperture <b>150</b> extending between ends <b>152</b>, <b>153</b> that can be used to accommodate holding structure <b>156</b> such as an extension <b>158</b> of the tool <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b> show the first clamp member <b>80</b> and second clamp member <b>82</b> in mateable engagement. The pleat forming members <b>100</b> cooperate with the pleat forming members <b>101</b> to form pleats with the excess material. In the example shown, mateable engagement includes the first row of peaks <b>102</b> projecting into the third row of valleys <b>143</b>. The third row of peaks <b>142</b> is projecting into the first row of valleys <b>103</b>. Similarly, the second row of peaks <b>106</b> is projecting into the fourth row of valleys <b>147</b>, and the fourth row of peaks <b>146</b> is projecting into the second row of valleys <b>107</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows how the aligned region <b>52</b> of the jacket <b>22</b> is squeezed or compressed between the first clamp member <b>80</b> and the second clamp member <b>82</b> to form the offsets <b>54</b>. In particular, the offset-forming structure <b>90</b>, <b>130</b> is shaped to result in the particular resulting offsets <b>54</b>. Each of the peaks <b>102</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> results in a corresponding trough <b>64</b> in the aligned region <b>52</b>. Analogously, each of the valleys <b>103</b>, <b>107</b>, <b>143</b>, <b>147</b> results in one of the ridges <b>62</b> in the aligned region <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Also, when the first clamp member <b>80</b> and the second clamp member <b>82</b> are in mateable engagement, the first clamp member groove <b>98</b> and the second clamp member groove <b>138</b> together form an open channel <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). By the term “open”, it is meant that there is no portion of the first clamp member <b>80</b> and second clamp member <b>82</b> interfering or blocking the passage. However, in the preferred embodiment, the aligned region <b>52</b> extends through the open channel <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the example shown, the needle <b>74</b> is passed through the open channel <b>160</b> with the attached suture <b>72</b>. Because the aligned region <b>52</b> extends through the open channel <b>160</b>, the suture <b>72</b> will be pulled through the offsets <b>84</b> in the aligned region <b>52</b>. This results in seam <b>44</b>. In other words, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (the slotted jacket <b>22</b>), the suture <b>72</b> passes through the jacket <b>22</b> along the first lateral edge <b>36</b> and then through the second lateral edge <b>38</b>, then through the first lateral edge <b>36</b>, then through the second lateral edge <b>38</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the clamp or tongs <b>122</b> can be manipulated (open and closed) in order to move the first clamp member <b>80</b> and second clamp member <b>82</b> toward each other into mateable engagement and way from each other out of mateable engagement. Of course, in other embodiments, the first and second clamp members <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> can be secured to other mechanisms or merely operated by hand.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">While only two rows <b>88</b>, <b>128</b> are shown in each of the clamp members <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, if more than one seam <b>44</b> is desired, additional spaced rows can be added to the clamp members <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>. For example, if another row were added to each of the clamp members <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>, there would be an additional channel formed to accommodate another suture.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a second embodiment of a jaw arrangement <b>78</b>′ having a first clamp member <b>80</b>′ and a second clamp member <b>82</b>′. The first clamp member <b>80</b>′ and the second clamp member <b>82</b>′ are constructed analogously to the first clamp member <b>80</b> and second clamp member <b>82</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref> above. The main difference between the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref> is that the first clamp member <b>80</b>′ and second clamp member <b>82</b>′ are curved to match the outer contour of the heart <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first clamp member <b>80</b>′ depicted is generally a block <b>84</b>′ having a first engagement surface <b>86</b>′. The first engagement surface <b>86</b>′ is the surface that interacts with the second clamp member <b>82</b>′ when the clamp members <b>80</b>′, <b>82</b>′ are in mateable engagement. The block <b>84</b>′ depicted is curved, in that the points of the engagement surface <b>86</b>′ are not contained in a single plane, but instead, follow a smooth curve. Preferably, the curve will follow the contour of the heart <b>32</b>. In general, this curve will define a radius of at least 4 in., typically 6 in.-8 in., and generally not greater than 12 in.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first engagement surface <b>86</b>′ includes at least two spaced rows of offset-forming structure <b>90</b>. Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a first row <b>94</b>′ and a second row <b>96</b>′ laterally spaced from it. The space between the first row <b>94</b>′ and second row <b>96</b>′ defines a first clamp member groove <b>98</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>, the offset-forming structure <b>90</b> in the first row <b>94</b>′ includes pleat forming members <b>100</b>′ embodied as a row of alternating peaks <b>102</b>′ and valleys <b>103</b>′. Similarly, the offset-forming structure <b>90</b> in the second row <b>96</b>′ includes alternating peaks <b>106</b>′ and valleys <b>107</b>′. The peaks <b>102</b>′ are identical to and spaced directly across from the peaks <b>106</b>′, with respect to the wave properties. However, the overall length of the peak <b>102</b>′ defined as between end <b>170</b> and end <b>171</b> is greater than the length of the peak <b>106</b>′ between end <b>172</b> and end <b>173</b>. End <b>171</b> is the portion of the peak <b>102</b>′ that faces the groove <b>98</b>′. End <b>172</b> is the portion of the peak <b>106</b>′ that faces the groove <b>98</b>′. End <b>170</b> is depicted as an outer edge of the block <b>84</b>′, while end <b>173</b> forms the opposite edge of the block <b>84</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Similarly, in the embodiment illustrated, the valleys <b>103</b>′ are sized equally and spaced directly across from the valleys <b>107</b>′ in the second row <b>96</b>′. The length of the valleys <b>103</b>′ is greater than the length of the valleys <b>107</b>′. The respective lengths are defined as between end <b>170</b> and end <b>171</b> for the valleys <b>103</b>′, and end <b>172</b> and end <b>173</b> for the valleys <b>107</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As can also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the block <b>84</b>′ defines an aperture <b>110</b>′. The aperture <b>110</b>′ has a curved contour. The aperture <b>110</b>′ can be used to accommodate holding structure, such as the holding structure <b>116</b>, including rod <b>118</b> of medical tool <b>120</b>, described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The second clamp member <b>82</b>′ is also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The second clamp member <b>82</b>′, in the embodiment shown, is identical to the first clamp member <b>80</b>′. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the second clamp member <b>82</b>′ shows it made from a block <b>124</b>′ that has an outer, curved contour. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the second clamp member <b>82</b>′ defines a groove <b>138</b>′ and an aperture <b>150</b>′. The second clamp member <b>82</b>′ includes two rows of offset-forming structure, identical to the structure described with respect to first clamp member <b>80</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With respect to mateable engagement, forming offsets <b>54</b>, accommodation of needle <b>74</b>, manipulation of the clamp <b>80</b>′ and clamp <b>82</b>′, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> embodiment is the same as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In reference again now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the example methods described above are shown implemented with the example device <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>. The methods described are also applicable to the embodiment of the clamp members <b>80</b>′, <b>82</b>′ of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the step of simultaneously forming a plurality of offsets <b>54</b> is illustrated as clamping excess material. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, this includes clamping the first lateral edge <b>36</b> and the second lateral edge <b>38</b>. In particular, the step of clamping includes squeezing the excess material, for example the first lateral edge <b>36</b> and the second lateral edge <b>38</b>, between opposing clamp members <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>. In the specific method illustrated, the step of squeezing includes squeezing the first lateral edge <b>36</b> and the second lateral edge <b>38</b> between opposing clamp members, each clamp member having a plurality of peaks and valleys.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the step of inserting the needle <b>4</b> having suture <b>72</b> attached thereto through a passage or open channel <b>160</b> defined by the first clamp member <b>80</b> and the second clamp member <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one example method, the step of inserting the needle <b>74</b> having the suture <b>72</b> attached thereto includes pulling the suture <b>72</b> through the offsets <b>54</b> until a T-bar <b>164</b> secured to the suture <b>72</b> engages or abuts one of the first clamp member <b>80</b> and the second clamp member <b>82</b>. The first and second clamp members <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> would then be released and moved out of mateable engagement. The end with the T-bar <b>164</b> would not need further attachment or securing to the jacket <b>22</b>. The opposite end of the seam <b>44</b> could be further secured to the jacket by knotting, tying, or other methods. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the resulting seam <b>44</b>, in the particular example shown, includes securing an entire length of the excess material to other portions of the jacket <b>22</b>. For the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> embodiment of the jacket <b>22</b>, this includes securing the first lateral edge <b>36</b> to the second lateral edge <b>38</b> from the apex <b>30</b> to the base edge <b>28</b>.</p>
