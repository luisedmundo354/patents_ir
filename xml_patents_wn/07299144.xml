<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to the data processing field, and more particularly, relates to a method and apparatus for automatically implementing calibration of a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) probing apparatus used for testing a printed circuit board.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As used in the present specification and claims, the term printed circuit board or PCB means a substrate or multiple layers (multi-layer) of substrates used to electrically attach electrical components and should be understood to generally include circuit cards, printed circuit cards, printed wiring cards, and printed wiring boards.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Characteristic impedance is most commonly measured using time-domain techniques, typically time-domain reflectometry (TDR). Currently problems result from some manufacturers using uncalibrated TDR test equipment for screening raw card impedance. TDR test equipment that fails calibration tests may be identified weeks or months after an initial calibration failure. Either calibration procedures are not performed or are not performed often enough to appropriately screen parts. This failure can result in significant expense to a manufacturer and its customers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Significant problems are introduced by lack of adequate equipment calibration when performing impedance measurements and posting the resulting data. For example, rigid card and flexible printed circuit vendors are required to deliver product that meets predefined characteristic impedance within a given tolerance. However, the data is only valid when proper calibration schedules are maintained for the TDR test equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A need exists for an effective mechanism for improving the reliability of impedance data captured for printed circuit boards.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Principal aspect of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for automatically implementing calibration of a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) probing apparatus. Other important aspects of the present invention are to provide such method and apparatus for automatically implementing calibration of a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) probing apparatus substantially without negative effect and that overcome many of the disadvantages of prior art arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In brief, a method and apparatus are provided for implementing automatic-calibration of a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) probing apparatus. A calibration procedure is performed automatically each time a TDR probe is moved from a device under test (DUT). A current calibration TDR waveform is obtained and compared with a reference calibration TDR waveform, checking for deviations between the current and reference measurements. If a deviation is detected, then the user is notified and calibration is failed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with features of the invention, both the current calibration TDR waveform and the reference calibration TDR waveform are obtained using a known impedance standard contained within the TDR probe.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with features of the invention, an enhanced TDR probe is provided and used to implement an automatic-calibration method of the invention. The enhanced TDR probe is used with a computer test system for implementing automatic-calibration of a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) probing apparatus. The enhanced TDR probe can be sold to a customer as an upgrade and marketed as a productivity and yield/data quality enhancement tool.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with features of the invention, the method of the invention automatically checks the calibration of the probe and test equipment each time the user completes a normal measurement. This guarantees that the test setup is always calibrated and resulting measurement data is not subject to calibration error. The automatically-calibrated TDR probing apparatus is used to screen PCBs and printed flexible circuits for required characteristic impedance prior to shipping product, and advantageously can ensure that only product within an acceptable characteristic impedance Zo specification is shipped. Shipment errors due to calibration error are reduced since the operator is flagged the instant the probe is detected to be out of calibration, rather than the next morning or next week or whenever the calibration procedure is performed again. Even when normal procedures may require daily calibration, these procedures are sometimes not performed. Moreover, if a test setup drifts out of calibration within the specified timeframe, such as daily and the like, hundreds of individual product could be shipped out of specification within this timeframe.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring now to the drawings, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> there is shown a computer test system generally designated by the reference character <b>100</b> for carrying out methods for implementing automatic-calibration of a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) probing apparatus in accordance with the preferred embodiment. Computer test system <b>100</b> includes a computer <b>102</b> coupled to a data acquisition unit (DAU) <b>104</b>. A Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) probe <b>106</b> in accordance with the preferred embodiment, a wrist strap <b>108</b> worn by a user of test system <b>100</b>, and a foot petal <b>110</b> are coupled to the DAU <b>104</b>. A normal measurement process is initiated via the small foot-pedal <b>110</b> actuated by the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with features of the invention, user intervention is not required in order to perform a calibration procedure. Rather, a calibration procedure is handled automatically each time the user lifts the TDR probe <b>106</b> from a device under test (DUT) <b>112</b>. A normal or conventional calibration technique, such as a calibration procedure using airlines or other known impedance comparisons, is handled automatically to ensure that the recorded test data is accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Computer test system <b>100</b> includes a mouse <b>114</b> and a printer <b>116</b> coupled to the computer <b>102</b>. Data acquisition unit (DAU) <b>104</b> can be implemented, for example with CITS800 TDR test system manufactured and sold by Polar Instruments Inc., San Mateo, Calif. The TDR probe <b>106</b> can be implemented with an upgraded and enhanced version of a TDR probe manufactured and sold by Polar Instruments Inc. TDR probe <b>106</b> of the preferred embodiment is illustrated and further described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">While many printed circuit vendors utilize test equipment manufactured by Polar Instruments Inc., and the automatic-calibration methods of the present invention improves the reliability of impedance data captured using Polar TDR equipment; it should be understood that the present invention can be applied to various other hand held TDR probes and TDR probing systems.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, computer system <b>100</b> includes a main processor <b>128</b> or central processor unit (CPU) <b>128</b> and an operating system <b>130</b>, a calibration control program <b>132</b> of the preferred embodiment, calibration test data <b>134</b>, and a user interface <b>136</b> resident in a memory <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Various commercially available computers can be used for computer system <b>100</b>, for example, with computer <b>102</b> implemented by an IBM personal computer. CPU <b>128</b> is suitably programmed by the calibration control program <b>132</b> for implementing automatic-calibration of a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) probing apparatus in accordance with the preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Computer system <b>100</b> is shown in simplified form sufficient for understanding the present invention. The illustrated computer system <b>100</b> is not intended to imply architectural or functional limitations. The present invention can be used with various hardware implementations and systems and various other internal hardware devices.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the TDR probe <b>106</b> receiving a TDR signal from the DAU <b>104</b>, for example, via a SubMiniature version A (SMA) connector <b>140</b>. TDR probe <b>106</b> includes a reference calibration impedance trace <b>142</b> carried by a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>143</b> enclosed within a cosmetic plastic case or housing <b>144</b> with a signal and ground pair probe tip generally designated by <b>146</b>. Signal and ground pair probe tip <b>146</b> includes a pair of spring-load members <b>148</b> providing spring-loaded DUT contact points. TDR probe <b>106</b> includes a known calibration standard that is customizable per customer requirements and provided by the PCB trace <b>142</b> that is used to calibrate the system.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">While the known calibration standard is shown as a tightly controlled PCB reference calibration impedance trace <b>142</b> having a specific characteristic impedance, it should be understood that the known calibration standard could also be implemented by, for example, an air line, in accordance with the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">TDR probe <b>106</b> optionally includes an optical sensor <b>150</b>, a light emitting diode (LED) <b>151</b>, and a single-pole double-throw (SPDT) relay <b>152</b> that are used in conjunction with control logic circuit <b>154</b> to switch the probe connection between a normal measurement trace path including the probe tips <b>146</b> and a known-impedance calibration path including the reference calibration impedance trace <b>142</b>. An electronic petal <b>156</b> is coupled between computer <b>102</b> and a signal combining function <b>158</b> that is also coupled to the manually operated foot petal <b>110</b>. A USB port <b>160</b> of computer <b>102</b> and a USB port <b>162</b> of the electronic petal <b>156</b> are used to couple a petal control signal applied by computer <b>102</b> to the electronic petal <b>156</b> indicated at a line labeled PETAL CTL SIGNAL. A petal pressed signal indicated at a line labeled PETAL PRESSED SIGNAL is applied by the signal combining function <b>158</b> to the DAU <b>104</b> that provides the TDR signal to TDR probe <b>106</b>. A data acquisition signal indicated at a line labeled DA SIGNAL is applied by the DAU <b>104</b> to computer <b>102</b> via a respective serial port <b>164</b> of computer <b>102</b> and a serial port <b>166</b> of the DAU <b>104</b>. A calibration signal indicated at a line labeled CAL SIGNAL is applied by the TDR probe <b>106</b> to computer <b>102</b> via a respective USB port <b>170</b> of computer <b>102</b> and a USB port <b>172</b> of the TDR probe <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there are shown exemplary steps of methods for implementing automatic calibration in accordance with the preferred embodiment staring at a block <b>300</b>. A current calibration TDR waveform is obtained as indicated in a block <b>302</b>. A stored reference calibration TDR waveform, such as an immediately previous calibration TDR waveform is compared with the current calibration TDR waveform checking for deviations between the measurements as indicated in a block <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with features of the invention, computer <b>102</b> implements the automatic calibration method to confirm that a current calibration TDR waveform compares with the previous calibration TDR waveform, both using the known impedance standard <b>142</b> and specifically looks for deviations between measurements. If a deviation is detected as indicated in a decision block <b>306</b>, then the user is notified and calibration is failed as indicated in a block <b>308</b>. The user then can subsequently perform a complete diagnostic and calibration procedure per the manufacturers guidelines. Otherwise, if a deviation is not detected as indicated in a decision block <b>306</b>, then the current calibration TDR waveform is stored as indicated in a block <b>310</b>. The automatic calibration process ends as indicated in a block <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The calibration method of the invention ensures that the impedance measurement test system <b>100</b> maintains expected impedance and launch values from one measurement cycle/DUT to the next. This calibration process is repeated automatically, between user measurements, without requiring user intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Computer <b>102</b> controlling the calibration process receives a calibration signal that indicates when the operator has lifted the probe <b>106</b> off of the DUT <b>112</b> to initiate the auto-calibration procedure. A preferred implementation to provide the calibration signal is to use a probe-mounted sensor, such as defined by optical sensor <b>150</b> and LED <b>151</b>, to detect when the spring-loaded pins <b>148</b> are fully extended when removed from the DUT <b>112</b>. The spring-loaded pins <b>148</b> are retracted when the probe tip <b>146</b> is pressed onto the DUT <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Simple control logic <b>154</b> on the PCB <b>143</b> inside the probe housing <b>144</b> communicates to the computer <b>102</b> controlling the TDR test system <b>100</b> via the USB or other standard port connections <b>170</b>, <b>172</b>. Test system <b>100</b> then initiates the auto-calibration procedure using probe-mounted control logic and the impedance controlled relay <b>152</b> to redirect the TDR signal from the DUT, to the internal calibration standard <b>142</b>. Once calibration has completed, for example, typically less than 1-2 seconds, the relay <b>152</b> resumes continuity of the transmission line to the DUT <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, and <b>4</b>B, there is shown an exemplary mechanical control switch generally designated by the reference character <b>400</b>. Mechanical control switch <b>400</b> is implemented with the spring loaded probe tips such that the switch between normal and calibration measurement paths is made when the probe tip <b>146</b> is lifted from the DUT <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Mechanical control switch <b>400</b> includes an actuator member <b>402</b> positioned for sliding movement within a slot <b>404</b> of a switch housing <b>406</b>. Actuator member <b>402</b> is positioned within the TDR probe <b>106</b> for cooperative engagement with the pair of spring-load members <b>148</b> for providing controlled switch movement.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the actuator member <b>402</b> includes an electrically conductive member <b>410</b> illustrated in dotted line for providing controlled switch movement between respective pairs of a plurality of electrical contacts <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>416</b>. A respective electrically insulative material <b>418</b> is provided between the electrical contacts <b>412</b> and <b>414</b> and electrical contacts <b>414</b> and <b>416</b>. The actuator member portion <b>410</b> is moved corresponding to movement of the spring-load members <b>148</b> to switch the probe connection between the normal measurement trace path including the probe tips <b>146</b> and the known-impedance calibration path including the reference calibration impedance trace <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an article of manufacture or a computer program product <b>500</b> of the invention is illustrated. The computer program product <b>500</b> includes a recording medium <b>502</b>, such as, a floppy disk, a high capacity read only memory in the form of an optically read compact disk or CD-ROM, a tape, a transmission type media such as a digital or analog communications link, or a similar computer program product.
