<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A frequency divider circuit is disclosed with at least one push-pull divider with adjustable division ratio and a connected converter device. The circuit converts a clock signal delivered by a push-pull divider into a single-ended signal. A first and a second single-ended divider are connected to the output of the converter device, and a feedback path is provided, which is connected to the output of the push-pull divider and to the outputs of the first and of the at least one second single-ended divider, and which includes an evaluation circuit. This circuit has first and second inputs which are connected to the first and second single-ended dividers in such a way that a future state of the clock signal delivered by the single-ended divider in question can be supplied to the inputs of the evaluation circuit. The evaluation circuit evaluates states of the clock signals delivered by the first and second single-ended dividers, i.e., states which will not exist until after future switching functions have been performed. As a result, additional time is gained for converting the signal to be divided from a push-pull signal to a single-ended signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention pertains to a frequency divider circuit with a controllable frequency division ratio and to a method for the operation of a frequency divider circuit with a controllable frequency division ratio.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Frequency divider circuits are used, for example, in phase-locked loops of modem communications systems. Phase-locked loops are used to generate a stable signal with a precise frequency. One of the components of a phase-locked loop is a frequency divider circuit, which steps down the frequency of the clock signal generated by the high-frequency oscillator of the phase-locked loop. The stepped-down signal is sent to a phase comparator of the phase-locked loop; the comparator then compares the stepped-down signal with a reference signal and generates an adjusting signal for the oscillator. The phase-locked loop continues to adjust the output frequency of the oscillator until the frequency-divided signal from the frequency divider circuit and the reference signal have the same frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">So that a phase-locked loop of this type can generate stable signals at various frequencies, it is necessary for the division ratio in the frequency divider circuit to be adjustable. The frequency divider can thus be switched between various division values. An appropriate control signal is used to set the division ratio to the desired value. A frequency divider circuit with adjustable division ratio is sometimes called a “multimodulus” divider.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows part of a known multimodulus divider. The divider shown here comprises essentially a cascade of switchable divider stages, three of which T<b>1</b>-T<b>3</b> are illustrated. The individual divider stages are connected in series. Each divider stage is designed as a synchronous divider, which divides an input signal by a factor of 2 or by a factor of 3 as a function of the control signal C<b>0</b>, C<b>1</b>, or C<b>2</b> at its control input <b>212</b>. This can be explained most clearly on the basis of the synchronous divider stage T<b>2</b> as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The synchronous divider stage T<b>2</b> comprises two flip-flop circuits F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b>, the clock inputs of which are connected to the input <b>13</b> of the synchronous divider stage T<b>2</b>. The data input D of the first flip-flop F<b>1</b> is connected to the control input <b>212</b>. The data output Q of the second flip-flop F<b>2</b> leads to the output <b>14</b> of the synchronous divider T<b>2</b> and is simultaneously connected to a first input A of a logical NAND gate N<b>1</b>. A second input B of the logical NAND gate N<b>1</b> is connected to the data output Q of the first flip-flop F<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A high level of a signal is called “logical 1” in the following, whereas a low level is called “logical 0”. When the control signal at the input <b>212</b> is at logical 1, a logical 1 is sent from the data output of the first flip-flop to the input B of the NAND gate N<b>1</b> each time a rising edge of a clock signal arrives at the input <b>13</b>. The gate N<b>1</b> in front of the data input D of the second flip-flop F<b>2</b> then behaves like an inverter, which returns the output signal at the data output Q of F<b>2</b> via the gate N<b>1</b> to the data input D. Because, with each rising edge of a clock signal at the input <b>13</b>, the data output Q of the second flip-flop inverts its state, a signal of half the frequency is present there. The divider T<b>2</b> therefore divides the frequency of the clock signal present on the input side by 2.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the control signal present at the control input <b>212</b> is at logical 0 at the time that the overall output <b>14</b> is at logical 0, and when, in addition, a rising edge arrives at the clock inputs of the flip-flops F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b>, the data output Q of the first flip-flop F<b>1</b> changes to logical 0 and thus forces a logical 1 at the output of the NAND gate N<b>1</b>. At the same time, the overall signal at the output <b>14</b> changes to logical 1. The control signal at the input <b>12</b> remains at logical 0 even during the second rising edge, so that the overall output continues to send a clock signal at logical 1. This corresponds to the insertion of an extra pulse with half the cycle duration.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">After the second rising edge of the clock signal has arrived at the input <b>13</b>, the control signal at the input <b>212</b> is set back to the original state, and another frequency division of the input-side clock signal by the factor of 2 is carried out in the divider stage T<b>2</b>. The suppression of the switching operation thus brings about a division by the factor of 3. This means that an additional positive half-wave is inserted, whereas the negative half-wave retains its original duration.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The divider stages T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, and T<b>3</b> shown here are based on this concept of suppressing the switching operation. These dividers are therefore also called ⅔-dividers. The lowest division ratio of a cascade consisting of ⅔-dividers is, when these are dividing only by 2. Sending a control signal designed to suppress precisely one clock cycle of the input clock signal corresponds to a division ratio equal to the minimum division ratio n<sub>min</sub>+1. To achieve this, the very first divider of the chain must divide by 3 exactly once per complete cycle and otherwise by 2. For a division ratio which corresponds to the minimum division ratio plus 2, the first divider operates with a constant division ratio of 2, whereas the second divider of the chain suppresses one switching operation per complete cycle and thus divides by the factor of 3. For the next division ratio of the overall cascade, the first two divider stages must each divide once per complete cycle by the factor of 3. This binary-weighted scheme can be continued to generate all of the division ratios from the series-connected dividers, ranging from the minimum ratio n<sub>min</sub>, when all are dividing only by 2, to the ratio 2*n<sub>min</sub>−1.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the partial view of prior art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the individual control signals for the dividers T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, and T<b>3</b> are supplied by the control signals C<b>0</b>, C<b>1</b>, and C<b>2</b>, each of which is sent to a logical NAND gate <b>21</b> or <b>21</b>A. This ensures that the corresponding control signal C<b>0</b>, C<b>1</b>, or C<b>2</b> is always present at the data input D of the first flip-flop F<b>1</b> of each divider circuit at the beginning of a complete cycle of the divided clock signal available at the output.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For this purpose, a feedback branch is provided. For each divider stage T<b>1</b>-T<b>3</b>, the feedback branch comprises an inverter <b>22</b>, which is connected to the associated output <b>14</b> of the divider stage T<b>1</b>-T<b>3</b>. The outputs of the inverters <b>22</b> of the divider circuits T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b>, neither of which is the last divider circuit of the overall chain, are each connected to an input B of a logical NAND gate U<b>1</b>, U<b>2</b>. The output of the inverter <b>22</b>A in the feedback path, this inverter being assigned to the last divider stage T<b>3</b>, is connected both to the input A of the logical NAND gate <b>21</b> A and to the input A of the logical NAND gate U<b>2</b> of the feedback path, this gate being assigned to the divider T<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The NAND gates <b>21</b> and <b>21</b>A in front of the control inputs <b>212</b> of the divider stages T<b>1</b>-T<b>3</b> are never released by the signals at the input A until all of the following divider stages have a logical 0 at their output. A low logical level of the output signals of all the divider stages T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, T<b>3</b> in the divider chain, however, means the end of a complete cycle. As a result, a logical 1 is now present at the inputs A, and the control input <b>212</b> of the divider stage T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, T<b>3</b> in question is released. When a rising edge then arrives at the clock input of each divider stage, the corresponding control signal C<b>0</b>, C<b>1</b>, or C<b>2</b> is sent to the data input of the first flip-flop of the divider stage. Depending on the control signal, the frequency is divided by a factor of 2 or 3. As soon as the signal at the overall output of the divider stage T<b>1</b> has a value of logical 1, the fact that the NAND <b>21</b> is now in the blocking state means that the feedback generates a logical 1 again at the control input <b>212</b> of the corresponding divider stage.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The travel time of the feedback signal through the individual logical gates U, however, can be problematic. To guarantee error-free operation when the division ratio is selected, the feedback signal generated by the AND gates U<b>1</b> and U<b>2</b> must have released the NAND gate <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>A of each divider stage by the time a rising edge of the clock signal CLK arrives at the input of the first divider stage T<b>1</b>. This determines the maximum input frequency of the clock signal CLK on the input side. Delays in the feedback path should therefore be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For systems with high and very high-frequency input CLK signals, furthermore, the first divider stages should be based on the push-pull technique. The concept of the push-pull technique refers here to difference-signal processing. A push-pull signal is the difference between two signals. The advantages of processing push-pull signals are the greater insensitivity to interference signals and the simplicity of implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the known exemplary embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the divider stage T<b>1</b> is designed for push-pull signal processing. It is also possible to speak here of a “push-pull divider” T<b>1</b>. For the processing of signals with lower frequencies, divider stages based on the single-ended technique are typically employed. Single-ended dividers are usually designed on the basis of CMOS logic and are slower but, in contrast to the push-pull dividers, they have no static power consumption. In the exemplary embodiment of prior art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the divider stages T<b>2</b> and T<b>3</b> are designed as single-ended divider stages. Two converter stages <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> are required for this heterogeneous structure of a multimodulus divider. The converter stage <b>24</b> is connected between the output of the divider T<b>1</b> and the input of the divider T<b>2</b> and converts the push-pull signal sent from the push-pull divider stage T<b>1</b> to a single-ended signal. For the feedback path, a corresponding converter stage <b>25</b> is provided, which converts the fed-back single-ended signal to a corresponding push-pull signal.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The conversions performed by the converters, especially by the converter <b>25</b>, however, cause delays, which in particular reduce the maximum frequency of the input signal. In the known designs, therefore, the single-ended dividers T<b>2</b> and T<b>3</b>, which are advantageous because of their low power consumption, can be used only in the rear area of a divider cascade, where low frequencies are already present and thus there is sufficient time available for the conversion.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of one or more aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention, and is neither intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention, nor to delineate the scope thereof. Rather, the primary purpose of the summary is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention is directed to a frequency divider circuit with an adjustable frequency division ratio, in which the delays caused by the conversion stage in the feedback path are minimized. The invention is also directed to a method for operating a frequency divider circuit of this type.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the inventive frequency divider circuit comprises a push-pull divider with a division ratio which can be adjusted at a control input. The push-pull divider is configured for suppressing switching. A first clock signal at a first frequency is supplied to an input of the push-pull divider, and the push-pull divider is configured to deliver a second clock signal at a second frequency. The second frequency can be adjusted by a control signal at the control input. The push-pull divider thus divides the frequency of a signal sent to the input side by the division ratio set at the control input and thus makes a clock signal with the divided frequency available at the output. The frequency divider circuit also comprises a first converter device, which is connected to the output of the push-pull divider and which is configured to convert a push-pull signal to a single-ended signal. A first single-ended divider is connected to the output of the first converter device, and a second single-ended divider is connected downline from the first single-ended divider. The first and second single-ended dividers are configured to deliver third and fourth clock signals, respectively, where the frequencies of the third and fourth clock signals are derived from the frequency of a clock signal present at the associated input. The first and second single-ended dividers thus divide the frequency of a signal present at the input by certain division ratio and make available at the output a clock signal with the divided frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, the frequency divider circuit also contains a feedback path, which is connected to the output of the push-pull divider and to the outputs of the first and second single-ended dividers. The feedback path comprises an evaluation circuit with a first and a second input. The first input of the evaluation circuit is connected to the first single-ended divider in such a way that it is possible to send a state of the clock signal which can be tapped at the output of the first single-ended divider to this first input before the clock signal which can be tapped at the output has assumed a predefined state. The second input is connected to the second single-ended divider in such a way that it is possible to send a state of the clock signal which can be tapped at the output of the second single-ended divider to this second input before the clock signal which can be tapped at the output has assumed a predefined state. In other words, it is possible to send signals which represent certain states of the clock signals transmitted from the first and second single-ended dividers, namely, signals representing states which the transmitted clock signals assume before they reach a predefined state, to the first and second inputs of the evaluation circuit. The evaluation circuit is configured to transmit a push-pull signal upon the occurrence of the predefined state of the first and second single-ended dividers in order to release the control signal of the push-pull divider.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The invention therefore takes into account not the respective output signals of the individual divider stages but rather the so-called “intermediate” signals in the feedback path present at the transition between the single-ended section and the push-pull section of a frequency divider circuit. These intermediate signals make it possible to infer states which will not actually exist until after the switching functions of the individual divider stages have occurred. What is evaluated is therefore a state of the clock signal transmitted by the divider stage in question before that state actually exists. A predefined state expected to occur in the future is therefore anticipated.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">If the evaluation shows that the state which will occur in the future is the predefined state, the single-ended feedback signal is converted to a push-pull feedback signal. When this predefined state then actually does occur, the previously prepared push-pull signal is transmitted to release the control input of the push-pull divider. This offers the advantage of reducing the amount of time required to convert a single-ended feedback signal to a push-pull feedback signal. Because the time losses caused by conversion in the feedback path are avoided, it is therefore possible to use the single-ended divider technique to process clock signals of higher frequencies as well. The time required to detect the converted signal during the push-pull/single-ended conversion is also saved. Finally, the power consumption of the inventive frequency divider circuit is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment, the predefined state of the clock signals is the state in which at least the clock signals which can be tapped at the outputs of all the single-ended dividers are at a low logical level. The low logical level is referred to in the following as “logical 0”. The state in which all the clock signals which can be tapped at the outputs of the divider stages are at logical 0 means the end of a clock cycle of the divided output clock signal of the last divider of the frequency divider circuit. When this state is reached, the push-pull signal for releasing the control input of the push-pull divider is released by the inventive evaluation circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As a result, the division ratio of the push-pull divider is changed in the desired manner, and a new clock cycle begins. In a similar manner, the predefined state of all the signals which can be tapped at the outputs can be defined in one embodiment as the state in which the clock signals which can be tapped at the outputs of the push-pull divider and of all the single-ended dividers are at a high logical level, which is referred to in the following as “logical 1”.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another embodiment, the first single-ended divider and/or the second single-ended divider has a control input, by means of which the division ratio of the first and/or of the second single-ended divider can be adjusted. The first and/or the second single-ended divider is thus configured to divide the frequency of the clock signal by an adjustable division ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The feedback path, furthermore, is configured to release the control input of the first and/or of the second single-ended divider upon the occurrence of the predefined state of the clock signals of the first and second single-ended dividers which can be tapped at the outputs. The feedback path therefore releases the control inputs of the first and second single-ended dividers when the clock signals of the first and second single-ended dividers which can be tapped at the outputs both have a value of logical 0 or logical 1.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The feedback path is therefore configured to release the control signal of the single-ended divider in question when the clock signal which can be tapped at the its output and the clock signal which can be tapped at the outputs of all the single-ended dividers connected downline have reached the predefined state.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another embodiment of the invention, at least one third single-ended divider with an adjustable frequency division ratio is connected downline from the output of the second single-ended divider. The evaluation circuit or means, furthermore, is provided with a third input, which is connected to the output of the at least one third single-ended divider. The evaluation circuit or means thus evaluates the clock signal present at the output of the third single-ended divider and the states of the clock signals in the first and second single-ended dividers before the predefined state in question is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">By the downline connection of additional single-ended dividers with adjustable frequency division ratios and by the connection of the outputs in question to the inputs of the evaluation circuit, it is possible to design a frequency divider circuit which can be adjusted to any desired division ratio. In the most suitable embodiment, only the first divider circuit is designed as a push-pull divider. Power consumption is significantly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another embodiment of the invention, the evaluation circuit comprises a logical gate, which is connected to the inputs of the evaluation circuit. The intermediate states of the clock signals of the first and second single-ended dividers and the state of the clock signal of the at least one third single-ended divider can be easily linked by way of the logical gate. As a result, a signal is obtained, the state of which can be used to release the control input of the push-pull divider. In one example, the logical gate is a NOR gate. In an alternative embodiment, the logical gate is a NAND gate, the inputs of which are connected by way of an inverter to the inputs of the evaluation circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another embodiment, the evaluation circuit comprises a second converter device for single-ended/push-pull conversion, the input of which is connected to the output of the logical gate. The second converter device is connected in one example to the output of the logical gate by way of a flip-flop circuit, where a clock input of the flip-flop circuit is connected to the output of the first converter device. Each time the edge of a clock signal arrives from the push-pull divider, the flip-flop circuit transmits the state of its data input to its data output and thus to the second converter device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The time therefore available to the second converter device to convert the single-ended feedback signal generated by the logical gate and sent on by the flip-flop into a push-pull feedback signal is equal to one cycle of the clock signal transmitted by the push-pull converter. It is advantageous in this context for the output of the second converter device to be connected to the data input of a second flip-flop circuit, the clock input of which is connected to the output of the push-pull divider. The second flip-flop circuit is configured for push-pull signal processing. The push-pull feedback signal converted by the converter device is used by the second flip-flop circuit to release the control input of the push-pull divider during the following clock cycle of the push-pull divider.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In yet another embodiment of the invention, the push-pull divider with an adjustable division ratio is designed as a ⅔-divider with switching suppression. In another embodiment of the invention, the first and the second single-ended dividers each comprise a first flip-flop circuit and a second flip-flop circuit. The clock inputs of the first and second flip-flop circuits are connected to the inputs of the associated single-ended dividers. A data output of the first flip-flop circuit is connected to a first input of a logical gate. A second input of the logical gate is connected to the data output of the second flip-flop circuit. An output of the logical gate is also connected to the data input of the second flip-flop circuit and to the first and/or second input of the evaluation circuit. The logical gate in one example is a NAND gate.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another embodiment, the frequency divider circuit is configured as a positive edge-triggered frequency divider circuit. Thus all of the individual divider circuits are triggered by the rising edges of the clock signal. Alternatively, the inventive frequency divider circuit can also be configured with inverted logic. In this case, the push-pull dividers and the single-ended dividers of the inventive frequency divider circuit and the circuit elements present in them are negative or falling edge-triggered.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the inventive method for frequency division in a frequency divider circuit with a controllable frequency division ratio is based on the availability of a frequency divider circuit. After the signal to be divided is sent to an input of the push-pull divider of the frequency divider circuit, the frequency of this signal is divided by the ratio set by the push-pull divider. The push-pull divider delivers a clock signal at the corresponding divided frequency. This clock signal is converted by the converter device into a single-ended signal, sent to the first single-ended divider, and subjected to further processing there. The method also includes the step by which a feedback signal is generated by tapping a certain state of the clock signal delivered by the first and second single-ended dividers, namely, a state which exists before the occurrence of a certain predefined state. The predefined state is derived from the states of the clock signals delivered by the push-pull divider and by the first and second single-ended dividers. Ultimately, the feedback signal is fed back to release the control input of the push-pull divider upon the occurrence of the predefined state.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to one embodiment of the inventive method, therefore, a feedback signal is made available, which is generated by an evaluation of the states of the clock signals delivered by the first and second single-ended dividers. These states are present before a predefined state of the two clock signals exists. The predefined state is characterized in one example by a low logical level of all these clock signals. Alternatively, the predefined state is formed by a high logical level formed by the clock signals transmitted by the two single-ended dividers. The inventive method therefore implements a “look-ahead” technique in a frequency divider circuit with controllable division ratio. This technique makes it possible to anticipate an expected state and to make available signals which are activated as soon as the expected state actually occurs. As a result, the amount of time required in a feedback path to convert singled-ended feedback signals to push-pull feed back signals is reduced. Time is also saved in the forward path, that is, during the push-pull/single-ended conversion, because the occurrence of the state is anticipated even before the actual push-pull/single-ended conversion and the additional downline signal processing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another embodiment of the method, the feedback signal is fed back after the clock signal delivered by the push-pull divider is inverted. The control input of the push-pull divider is released when the feedback signal is present there together with the inverted clock signal. This guarantees that the control signal will not be present at the control input of the push-pull divider until the end of a complete cycle of the overall divided signal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another embodiment of the invention, the feedback signal is generated in that, when an edge of the divided clock signal delivered by the push-pull divider arrives, a single-ended feedback signal is generated before the clock signals of the first and second single-ended dividers are in the predefined state. The single-edged feedback signal thus generated is then converted to a push-pull feedback signal The feedback signal is generated again when the same type of edge arrives in the clock signal transmitted by the push-pull divider.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a phase-locked loop, in the return path of which frequency divider circuits with adjustable division ratios are provided. The phase-locked loop comprises a forward path, which includes a phase detector <b>101</b>, to which a low-pass filter <b>102</b> is connected. The low-pass filter <b>102</b> comprises a charge pump and is connected by an output to a control input of a voltage-controlled oscillator <b>103</b>. The output of the voltage-controlled oscillator <b>103</b> is connected to an input of the inventive frequency divider circuit <b>1</b> and forms simultaneously an output of the phase-locked loop. The frequency divider circuit divides the clock signal CLK coming from the oscillator <b>103</b> by its division ratio, which is set via the control inputs <b>12</b>, and sends the divided clock signal to a feedback input <b>104</b> of the phase detector <b>101</b>. The phase detector <b>101</b> compares the frequency of the returned clock signal with a frequency of a reference signal and generates from that a control signal, which is sent via the low-pass filter <b>102</b> to the control input of the voltage-controlled oscillator <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The frequency of the output signal CLK of the voltage-controlled oscillator <b>103</b> is readjusted until the frequency of the fed-back signal which has been divided by the frequency divider circuit <b>1</b> matches the frequency of the reference signal at the input <b>105</b> of the phase detector <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In phase-locked loops which generate signals CLK with very high output frequencies, the frequency divider circuits must therefore also process clock signals with high input frequencies. So that the greatest possible flexibility can be guaranteed at the same time, the frequency divider circuits are often designed as multimodulus dividers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows part of a divider circuit with an adjustable division ratio according to one embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The inventive frequency divider circuit can be divided in terms of its logical structure into a forward path and a reverse path. In the forward path, the frequency of the input-side push-pull signal CLK is divided according to the set frequency division ratio. The frequency division ratio is set by the control signal CO at the control input <b>12</b>. The frequency of the input-side push-pull signal CLK is divided by several divider stages T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, and T<b>3</b> connected in series. In the exemplary embodiment, the divider stage T<b>1</b> is designed as a synchronous push-pull divider with an adjustable division ratio. Depending on the control signal at the input <b>212</b>, the synchronous push-pull divider T<b>1</b> will divide the push-pull signal present at its input <b>211</b> either by a factor of 2 or, by the use of switching suppression, by a factor of 3.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The push-pull signal TS<b>1</b>′ thus divided can be tapped at the output <b>213</b>. The push-pull divider T<b>1</b> shown here represents the last synchronous push-pull divider in the inventive frequency divider circuit <b>1</b>. The input <b>211</b> of the synchronous push-pull divider T<b>1</b> can therefore be connected to the outputs of additional synchronous push-pull dividers. Designing the input stages of the inventive frequency divider circuit as push-pull dividers is especially advantageous, in one embodiment, because push-pull dividers can process very high input frequencies and are relatively insensitive to interference signals on the clock line.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The output of the synchronous push-pull divider T<b>1</b> is connected to an input of a converter stage <b>24</b>. The converter stage converts the push-pull signal TS<b>1</b>′ into a single-ended signal TS<b>1</b>. An input of a first single-ended divider T<b>2</b> is connected to the output of the converter stage <b>24</b>. A second single-ended divider T<b>3</b> is connected by its input to the output <b>14</b> of the first single-ended divider T<b>2</b>. The inventive frequency divider circuit <b>1</b> can also comprise additional single-ended dividers connected in series.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The frequency of the clock signal present at the input side is divided in two stages in each of the single-ended dividers T<b>2</b> and T<b>3</b>. In the case of the single-ended divider T<b>2</b>, this is indicated by the two circuit blocks <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B. The single-ended divider T<b>3</b> comprises the same type of circuit blocks. For the sake of clarity, they have not been illustrated. The two circuit blocks <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B of the single-ended divider T<b>2</b> process the input-side clock signal TS<b>1</b> by dividing its frequency. Signals which contain information on a future state of the divided clock signal available at the output and thus on a future state of the entire single-ended divider are also exchanged between the circuit blocks <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B. The generation of these signals and the information concerning a future state of a tappable clock signal will be explained more fully below on the basis of additional exemplary embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The inventive frequency divider circuit also comprises a reverse or feedback path, which, in the embodiment shown here, comprises the elements <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, which are connected to each other. The feedback path is also connected by its output <b>331</b> to a switch <b>40</b>, which is connected between the control input <b>212</b> of the synchronous push-pull divider T<b>1</b> and the control input <b>12</b> of the frequency divider circuit. The feedback path is configured so that it closes the switch <b>40</b> only after the entire frequency division cycle has been completed. The feedback path thus releases the control input <b>212</b> of the push-pull divider T<b>1</b> only at the end of a clock cycle of the divided clock signal. This guarantees that the synchronous push-pull divider divides by the factor of 3 only once per complete cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">So that the time at which the switch <b>40</b> is to be released can be determined, each of the individual elements <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> of the feedback path has an input, which is connected to an output of one of the divider stages of the frequency divider circuit. The element <b>32</b> of the feedback path is connected by its inputs <b>321</b> and <b>322</b> to the intermediate signal outputs <b>225</b> and <b>226</b> of the single-ended dividers <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>. At these outputs, intermediate signals which contain information on the future state of a clock signal available at the outputs <b>14</b> and <b>34</b> can be tapped. The element <b>32</b> is configured as an evaluation circuit, which evaluates these intermediate signals and passes along a push-pull feedback signal to the element <b>33</b> of the feedback path as soon as a complete clock cycle of the overall signal has run its course.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The signals which are tapped at the intermediate signal outputs <b>225</b>, <b>226</b> are in one example signals with a level that is reached only when the next edge of the clock signal which can be tapped at the outputs <b>14</b> and <b>34</b> arrives. For example, the intermediate signal at the output <b>225</b> of the first single-ended divider T<b>2</b> has a value of logical 0 when the clock signal at the output <b>14</b> is at a high logical level and vice versa. The intermediate signals therefore represent future level states of the clock signals available at the outputs. The evaluation circuit <b>32</b> evaluates these states and generates from them a push-pull signal, which is sent on to the next element <b>33</b> of the feedback path. The element <b>33</b> in the feedback path is designed to process push-pull signals.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">By using the intermediate signals to evaluate future states of the individual clock signals delivered by the divider stages <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>, it is therefore possible to prepare and generate in advance the feedback signal which releases the switching means <b>40</b>. As soon as the individual clock signals actually reach the state in question, the feedback signal can be used without any delay to release the control input <b>212</b>. Because converting a push-pull signal into a single-ended signal in particular is very time-consuming, the evaluation of the future states of clock signals makes it possible to save time precisely in the case of high input frequencies. The push-pull/single-ended conversion and/or the single-ended/push-pull conversion can therefore be carried out even at high frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows one concrete exemplary embodiment of the inventive frequency divider circuit. The same components carry the same reference numbers. The inventive frequency divider circuit comprises a first divider stage T<b>1</b> and second divider stages T<b>2</b> and T<b>3</b>, connected to the first stage. The first divider stage T<b>1</b> is configured as a synchronous push-pull divider with switching suppression. The vertical broken lines indicate the boundary between push-pull signal processing and single-ended signal processing. An exemplary embodiment of the evaluation circuit is shown above the horizontal broken line.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The input T<b>13</b> of the synchronous push-pull divider T<b>1</b> is connected to the clock input of a first flip-flop TF<b>1</b> and to the clock input of a second flip-flop TF<b>2</b>. The first flip-flop TF<b>1</b> serves to set the frequency division ratio of the first push-pull divider T<b>1</b>. For this purpose, its data input D is connected to the control input <b>212</b> of the synchronous push-pull divider T<b>1</b>. The data output Q of the first flip-flop TF<b>1</b> is connected to the input B of a logical NAND gate N<b>1</b>, which forms a part of a feedback loop for the second flip-flop TF<b>2</b>. The data output Q of the second flip-flop TF<b>2</b> forms the output <b>213</b> of the push-pull divider T<b>1</b> and is also connected to the input A of the logical NAND gate N<b>1</b>. The two flip-flops TF<b>1</b> and TF<b>2</b> are designed as positive or rising edge-triggered flip-flops.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The divider circuit T<b>1</b> divides the push-pull signal CLK present on the input side by a factor of 2 or 3, depending on the control signal at the control input <b>212</b>. A division of the frequency of the input-side push-pull clock signal CLK by a factor of 3 is accomplished by suppressing switching for the duration of one cycle of the clock signal CLK. Switching is suppressed whenever the control signal at the input <b>212</b> is at a logically low level. When a rising edge of the input-side clock signal CLK arrives, the first flip-flop TF<b>1</b> produces a logical 0 at its data output Q and thus forces the output signal of the NAND gate to assume a high logical level or “logical 1”. If the control signal at the input <b>212</b> remains at logical 0 for the duration of one clock cycle of the clock signal CLK, switching will be suppressed in the output signal of the first push-pull divider T<b>1</b> for half a clock cycle of the output push-pull clock signal TS<b>1</b>′. This is equivalent to dividing the frequency by a factor of 3.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The other dividers T<b>2</b> and T<b>3</b> are built in a similar manner. The dividers T<b>2</b> and T<b>3</b> differ from the push-pull divider T<b>1</b>, however, in that they are designed as single-ended dividers. In contrast to divider T<b>1</b>, they do not process push-pull signals but process instead the single-ended signals TS<b>1</b>, TS<b>2</b>. For this purpose, the flip-flop circuits F<b>1</b>, F<b>2</b> and F<b>3</b>, F<b>4</b> as well as the NAND gates N<b>2</b> and N<b>3</b> are configured to process single-ended signals. The structural design of the individual divider stages T<b>2</b> and T<b>3</b>, however, is the same as that of the push-pull divider T<b>1</b>. So that the push-pull clock signal TS<b>1</b>′ available at the output of the push-pull divider T<b>1</b> can be converted, the inventive frequency divider circuit has a push-pull/single-ended converter <b>24</b>, which is inserted between the output <b>213</b> of the push-pull divider T<b>1</b> and the input <b>13</b> of the first single-ended divider T<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The two single-ended dividers T<b>2</b> and T<b>3</b> have control inputs <b>212</b>A and <b>212</b>B, respectively, to which a control signal can be sent to adjust the division ratio to either a factor of 2 or a factor of 3. To send the control signals to the control inputs at the right time, it is necessary for the NAND gates <b>40</b>, <b>40</b>A, and <b>40</b>B, which act as switches, to be released only at the end of a clock cycle of the clock signal available at the output of the inventive frequency divider circuit. In the exemplary embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, this is the end of a clock cycle of the signal TS<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">For this purpose, an inverter <b>22</b>B is provided in the feedback path. The inverter is connected to the output <b>34</b> of the divider T<b>3</b>, and its output is connected to the input A of the switch <b>40</b>B and to the input A of a logical AND gate U<b>2</b>. The switch <b>40</b>B is configured as a logical NAND gate. The output of the switch <b>40</b>B is connected to the control input <b>212</b>B. Simultaneously, the output <b>14</b> of the first single-ended divider T<b>2</b> is connected via an inverter <b>22</b>A to the input B of the logical AND gate U<b>2</b>. The output of the logical AND gate U<b>2</b> is connected to an input of an additional switching means <b>40</b>A, which is configured as a NAND gate. The output of this gate leads to the control input <b>212</b>A. The inverters <b>22</b>B, <b>22</b>A and the gate U<b>2</b> form the element <b>31</b> of the feedback path.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The second single-ended divider T<b>3</b> also contains a tap <b>95</b> between the output of the NAND feedback gate N<b>3</b> and the second flip-flop F<b>4</b>. This tap <b>95</b> carries an intermediate signal, which represents a future state of the clock signal TS<b>3</b> at the output <b>34</b>. As a result of the feedback in the single-ended divider T<b>3</b>, the level of the signal at the tap T<b>3</b> is that of the signal which is sent along as the clock signal TS<b>3</b> to the output <b>34</b> when the next rising edge of the signal TS<b>2</b> arrives. In the same way, a tap <b>96</b> is provided in the first single-ended divider T<b>2</b>. The signal at the tap <b>96</b> represents the clock signal TS<b>2</b>, which, when the next rising edge of the input-side clock signal TS<b>1</b> arrives, is received by the flip-flop F<b>2</b> and can be tapped at the output <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">These intermediate signals at the taps <b>95</b> and <b>96</b> are sent to an evaluation unit <b>32</b> in the feedback path. The evaluation unit contains a NOR gate <b>321</b>, the first input A of which is connected to the tap <b>95</b>. The second input B is connected via a NAND element <b>322</b> to the tap <b>96</b> of the first single-ended divider T<b>2</b> and to a tap <b>97</b>. The tap <b>97</b> carries the data output signal Q of the first flip-flop F<b>1</b> of the first single-ended divider T<b>2</b>. It is necessary to take into account the signal at the tap <b>97</b> in this embodiment, because a state with a logically high level at the intermediate tap <b>96</b> can arise twice during a complete clock cycle when the frequency is being divided by a factor of 3. On division by 3, the signal at the tap <b>97</b>, however, has a value of logical 0 once and then a value of logical 1 once. The state which is important is that in which high levels can be tapped at both taps <b>96</b> and <b>97</b>. The output of the NOR gate <b>321</b> of the evaluation means <b>32</b> is connected to the data input of a flip-flop <b>323</b>, which is activated by the single-ended clock signal TS<b>1</b> transmitted from the converter device <b>24</b>. The data output Q of the flip-flop <b>323</b> is connected to a single-ended/push-pull converter <b>25</b>. This converts a single-ended signal into the corresponding push-pull signal.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The output of the single-ended/push-pull converter <b>25</b> is connected to the data input of another flip-flop <b>324</b>, which is configured to process the push-pull signals. The clock input of the flip-flop <b>324</b> is connected to the output <b>213</b> of the push-pull divider T<b>1</b>. The push-pull signal output Q of the flip-flop circuit <b>324</b> leads to the feedback element <b>33</b> of the feedback path. The feedback element <b>33</b> comprises a logical AND gate U<b>1</b>, the input B of which is connected by way of an inverter <b>22</b> to the output <b>213</b> of the push-pull divider T<b>1</b>. The input A of the logical AND gate U<b>1</b> forms the input of the feedback element <b>33</b> for the feedback signal and is connected to the data output Q of the flip-flop <b>324</b> of the evaluation means <b>32</b>. The output of the logical AND gate is connected to a first input A of a switching means <b>40</b>, the output of which is connected to the control input <b>212</b> of the push-pull divider T<b>1</b>. A second input B of the switching means <b>40</b> forms the control input <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The part of the inventive frequency divider circuit shown here can be expanded by the addition of further feedback elements and by the connection of the clock signal input for the clock signal CLK to the output of other push-pull frequency divider circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The way in which the evaluation circuit in the inventive frequency divider circuit according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> works will now be explained on the basis of the time diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. This shows several clock signals as a function of time. In the exemplary embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is assumed that the control signals C<b>0</b>, C<b>1</b>, and C<b>2</b> at the control inputs <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>A, and <b>12</b>B are such that the divider circuits T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, and T<b>3</b> suppress switching. As a result, each of the divider circuits divides by the factor of 3. The signals CLK, TS<b>1</b>, and TS<b>3</b> shown in the diagram are important for the explanation of the way in which the frequency divider circuit according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> works.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The clock signal CLK is sent to the input side of the first divider circuit T<b>1</b> at time Z<b>0</b>. A signal at a logically high level continues to be present at the input A and also at the input B of the NAND gate <b>40</b>. This results in a logically low level at the data input D of the first flip-flop TF<b>1</b> of the push-pull divider T<b>1</b>; this logically low level leads to the suppression of switching for the subsequent cycle. As a result, the signal TS<b>1</b> at the output remains at logical 1. As a result of the feedback through the inverter <b>22</b>, a logical 0 is obtained at the output of the logical AND gate U<b>1</b>, as a result of which a logical 1 is present again at the input <b>212</b> of the push-pull divider T<b>1</b>. The first and second single-ended dividers, each of which suppresses switching for one clock cycle of its input signal, work in the same way.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">At time Z<b>1</b>, the clock signal TS<b>2</b> with a logical 0 is present at the output <b>14</b> of the first single-ended divider T<b>2</b>. As a result, an intermediate signal at logical 1 is present at the tap <b>96</b>. At the same time, the data output Q of the first flip-flop F<b>1</b> of the first single-ended divider T<b>2</b> and thus the tap <b>97</b> are also at logical 1. The NAND gate <b>322</b> sends a logical 0 to the NOR gate <b>321</b>. At the same time Z<b>1</b>, the clock signal TS<b>3</b> at the output <b>34</b> of the second single-ended divider T<b>3</b> is at a logically high level. The resulting intermediate signal at the tap <b>95</b> is at logical 0. This is also sent to an input of the NOR gate <b>321</b>. The NOR gate sends a logically high level to the data input of the flip-flop <b>323</b>, and this logically high level is received at time Z<b>2</b>, when the next rising edge of the clock signal TS<b>1</b> arrives.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">During the clock cycle of the clock signal TS<b>1</b> which now follows, the single-ended/push-pull converter can convert the fed-back single-ended signal with a logically high level to a corresponding push-pull signal and make it available at the data input D of the flip-flop <b>324</b>. This signal is received at the output of the flip-flop <b>324</b> when the next rising edge of the clock signal TS<b>1</b> arrives at time Z<b>3</b> and is sent to the input A of the AND gate U<b>1</b>. At time Z<b>3</b>, the signal TS<b>1</b> switches to a logical 1. Simultaneously, the signal TS<b>2</b> and also the signal TS<b>3</b>, however, are already at a logically low level. As a result, the switching means <b>40</b>B and <b>40</b>A have already been released, so that the corresponding control signals C<b>2</b> and C<b>1</b> at the control inputs <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B can be sent along to the associated data inputs of the flip-flops F<b>1</b> and F<b>3</b>. The intermediate signals at the taps <b>95</b> and <b>96</b> change back again to logical 1 at time Z<b>3</b>. The NOR gate <b>321</b> of the evaluation circuit <b>32</b> generates a logical 0 again at its output on the basis of the intermediate signals.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the next falling edge of the first clock signal TS<b>1</b> arrives, the feedback element <b>33</b> changes the input A of the gate <b>40</b> to logical 1, so that the corresponding control signals C<b>0</b>, C<b>1</b>, and C<b>2</b> are now present at the control inputs <b>212</b> of each of the dividers. The time Z<b>4</b> determines the start of a new clock cycle of the clock signal TS<b>3</b>. The single-ended/push-pull conversion of the feedback signal for releasing the switching means <b>40</b> is accomplished during the period from Z<b>2</b> to Z<b>3</b>, so that this signal can be sent to the feedback element when the rising edge arrives at time Z<b>3</b>. Because the feedback signal is generated in a preceding cycle and then made available at the proper time, the converter element <b>25</b> can be of an especially simple design. The conversion of the single-ended signal to a push-pull signal is thus no longer critical with respect to time.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows another embodiment of an inventive frequency divider circuit with a push-pull divider T<b>1</b> and three series-connected single-ended dividers T<b>2</b>, T<b>3</b>, and T<b>4</b>. In this embodiment as well, additional push-pull dividers can be inserted in front of the input of the push-pull divider T<b>1</b>, and the output of the single-ended divider T<b>4</b> can also be connected to additional single-ended dividers T<b>5</b>. The third single-ended divider T<b>4</b> is built in the same way as the first and second single-ended dividers T<b>2</b>, T<b>3</b>. It, too, comprises two flip-flop circuits, where the first flip-flop circuit is configured to set the division ratio. A switch <b>40</b>C connects the data input D of the first flip-flop to the control input <b>12</b>C. This switch, too, is configured as a NAND gate.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The evaluation circuit here has a slightly modified design. Instead of the NOR gate <b>321</b> used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an AND gate <b>321</b>A is implemented. This gate has three inputs. If the input signals at the inputs of an AND gate are inverted, the AND gate has the same truth table as a NOR gate. For this reason, the intermediate signal at the tap <b>95</b> of the second single-ended divider T<b>3</b> is inverted by an inverter <b>99</b> and sent to an input of the logical AND gate <b>321</b>A. The taps <b>96</b> and <b>97</b> of the first single-ended divider T<b>2</b> are connected to the inputs of a logical AND gate <b>322</b>A, the output of which is connected to an input of the logical AND gate <b>321</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">It is also necessary to take into account the output clock signal TS<b>4</b> of the third single-ended divider T<b>4</b>. For this purpose, the logical AND gate <b>321</b>A has an additional input, which is connected via an inverter <b>22</b>C to the output <b>44</b> of the third single-ended divider T<b>4</b>. The inverter <b>22</b>C simultaneously forms a part of the feedback path. The clock signal TS<b>4</b> can be tapped at the output <b>44</b>. The inventive frequency divider circuit can be expanded to any desired extent by connecting additional single-ended dividers to the output <b>44</b>, each of the outputs of these additional dividers being connected by way of an inverter to an additional input of the logical AND gate <b>321</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The output of the inverter <b>22</b>C also leads to an input of a switch <b>40</b>C and to an input A of an AND gate <b>44</b>B, which is part of the feedback element <b>33</b> of the feedback path. The feedback path releases the NAND gate <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B, or <b>40</b>C in question only when the output signal of the associated single-ended divider and the output signals of all the downline single-ended divider are at logical 0.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows the change in the delivered clock signals over time. It is assumed again that all of the control signals are of such a kind that switching is suppressed, so that each divider of the circuit divides by a factor of 3. Shortly before time Z<b>5</b>, the clock signal TS<b>4</b> is at a logically low level. This is inverted and sent to the switching means <b>40</b>C, which then releases the data input of the first flip-flop for the control signal at the control input <b>12</b>C. Simultaneously, the signal travels along the feedback chain to the AND gate <b>44</b>B. This gate generates a signal at a logically high level if at the same time the signal TS<b>3</b> from the single-ended divider T<b>3</b> is at logical 0. This is the case starting at time Z<b>6</b>. As a result, the switch <b>40</b>B is released, and the feedback signal propagates to the logical gate <b>44</b>A. Shortly after time Z<b>7</b>, the switches <b>40</b>A, <b>40</b>B and <b>40</b>C are released, and the single-ended dividers T<b>2</b>, T<b>3</b>, and T<b>4</b> can suppress switching as a function of the control signals present at the control inputs <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B, and <b>12</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">At time Z<b>5</b>, the inverted clock signal TS<b>4</b> is also sent to the logical gate <b>321</b>A. Simultaneously, it releases the control input of the single-ended divider T<b>4</b>. At this point, however, the output signal TS<b>3</b> continues to be at a logically high level, i.e., at logical 1, as a result of which the gate <b>44</b>B is still blocking the feedback signal. The intermediate signal at the tap <b>95</b>, however, has a value of logical 0. This future state of the clock signal TS<b>3</b> is inverted by the inverter <b>99</b> and sent to a second input of the logical AND gate <b>321</b>A. The switch <b>40</b>B and the logical AND gate <b>44</b>A, however, have not yet been released.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">At this time Z<b>5</b>, furthermore, the signal TS<b>2</b> becomes logical 0. The intermediate signal at the tap <b>96</b>, which indicates the future state of the clock signal TS<b>2</b>, as well as the intermediate signal at the tap <b>97</b> are both at logical 1. As a result, a logical 1 is also obtained at the output of the logical AND gate <b>322</b>A, and this logical 1 is sent to the third input of the logical AND gate <b>321</b>A. The output of the AND gate <b>321</b>A of the evaluation circuit therefore switches the data input of the flip-flop-<b>323</b> to a logical 1 during this period. When the next rising edge of the clock signal TS<b>1</b> arrives at time Z<b>6</b>, the signal with the logically high level is received at the data input D of the flip-flop <b>323</b> and sent to the converter device <b>25</b>. This converter now has the time until the next rising edge of the signal TS<b>1</b> arrives to convert the single-ended feedback signal at logical 1 to a corresponding push-pull feedback signal.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the rising edge of the clock signal TS<b>1</b> arrives at time Z<b>6</b>, the clock signal TS<b>2</b> also changes to logical 1, and the clock signal TS<b>3</b> changes to logical 0. As a result, the AND gate <b>44</b>B releases the switch <b>40</b>B, and the feedback signal travels to the input of the logical AND gate <b>44</b>A in the feedback path.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the next rising edge of the clock signal TS<b>1</b> arrives at time Z<b>7</b>, the clock signal TS<b>2</b> changes to a logically low level, as a result of which the switch <b>40</b>A is also released. The corresponding control signal for setting the frequency division ratio of the single-ended divider in question is now present at the corresponding control inputs of the dividers T<b>2</b>, T<b>3</b>, and T<b>4</b>. Simultaneously, when the rising edge of the clock signal TS<b>1</b> arrives, the push-pull feedback signal converted by the converter device <b>25</b> is accepted by the data output Q of the flip-flop <b>324</b>. When the next falling edge of the clock signal TS<b>1</b> arrives, the inverter <b>22</b> and the AND gate <b>44</b> have the effect of releasing the control input <b>212</b> of the push-pull divider T<b>1</b> as well. Thus the division ratio of the inventive frequency divider circuit is set, and the clock signal CLK present on the input side is divided in correspondence with the set frequency division ratio when the next rising edge arrives at time Z<b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The invention presented here is not limited to the exemplary embodiments shown. Thus, for example, the individual divider circuits can also be negative or falling edge-triggered. It is also possible for the individual logical elements to be replaced by corresponding equivalents. For example, it is possible for the various release switches for the input <b>212</b> to be logical AND gates with a downline inverter instead of NAND gates. The inverting output QN of each of the first flip-flop circuits can be used without the downline inverter. In principle, the entire circuit can be easily realized with OR-gate logic instead of with the AND gates used. In the case of push-pull signal processing, for example, it is sufficient merely to exchange the two lines of the inverter. It is also possible to use dividers completely different from the ⅔-dividers presented here.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">For the interface between the push-pull feedback path and the single-ended feedback path, however, an evaluation circuit is provided which does not use the output signals of the individual dividers for the feedback; instead, it uses intermediate signals. These intermediate signals allow conclusions to be drawn concerning states which will not exist until after switching functions have occurred in the first and second single-ended dividers. An expected state is therefore anticipated in the feedback branch and activated by the same edge which in effect actually produces the anticipated state. In this way, time is saved in the feedback logic circuit, i.e., the time which is necessary to convert the expected state in the feedback path from single-ended feedback signals to push-pull feedback signals. In addition, the state of the single-ended signal in the forward path of the divider is also anticipated. The very time-consuming conversion of the push-pull signal into a single-ended signal and thus the switching of the divider flip-flop are therefore no longer relevant to the feedback signal, because the expected state has already been anticipated.</p>
