<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is directed to monitoring operation of an electrical device, and more particularly to a method and system that checks the health of a permanent magnet device, such as a motor or generator.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Large-scale power generators often use gas turbine engines to supply power to a geographic region. Reliable start up of these engines is critical to ensure that power outages do not occur.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electric starters are known for starting small engines, but the special requirements of large engines have generally made them inappropriate for use with large engines. Many gas turbines in the 20 to 50 MW range are derivatives of aircraft engines (known as “aeroderivatives” and, as such, they initially retained the lightweight, high-performance pneumatic starters from the initial design. As applications evolved, the pneumatic starters were replaced with hydraulic starters because weight is less of a concern in ground-based gas turbine engines. The next logical step is to apply electric motors to replace the hydraulic starter units.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the challenges in designing electric starters is to create a high-performance unit with minimal (packaging) size and total weight. Out of the currently available electric starter technology (i.e., induction, switched reluctance, permanent magnet), permanent magnet motors offer the highest performance density.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More particularly, electric starters rely on electric motors to convert electrical input power into mechanical power in the form of torque and rotation, which in turn is used to start an engine. All electric motors are prone to common failure modes, such as broken or shorted wires. However, despite their high performance density, permanent magnet motors are also prone to performance degradation resulting from demagnetization of the magnets due to, for example, excessive environmental temperatures. In any case, the power delivered by the permanent magnet motor may drop to zero or to a very low level, depending on the severity of the damage. Depending on the degree of failure, many of these degradations are not detectable and may result in operational failures or, in extreme cases, generation of excessive heat that may ignite or melt the starter components.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a desire for a system and method that can detect performance degradation in a permanent magnet-based electric starter.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to a method and system for monitoring the performance of a permanent magnet motor and providing early detection of motor performance deterioration. In one embodiment, the back electromotive force (EMF) of the motor is measured at selected conditions, such as speed and temperature, to obtain a reference signature response. A measured signature is then obtained periodically during the life of the motor at the same conditions as the reference signature to check the current back EMF characteristic of the motor. If the measured signature deviates from the reference signature by a predetermined threshold, it indicates that the motor performance has degraded to a condition requiring attention.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">By providing periodic monitoring of motor performance, the invention detects differences in the implied output torque capability of the motor before it reaches an unacceptable level. Thus, it is possible to notify users of a pending motor fault before an actual fault occurs, allowing the user to response pro-actively without waiting for the motor to actually fail before addressing motor problems. As a result, the invention makes it possible to use high-torque permanent magnet motors in applications, such as electric starting, where reliability is one of the critical parameters.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Generally, the invention makes electric devices, and magnetic motors or generators in particular, more suitable for critical applications by incorporating a monitoring system that checks the health of the motor based on its output characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of a magnetic motor <b>100</b> whose operation can be monitored according to the invention. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are simplified for illustrative purposes and show only one pole of a multiple-pole device. The motor <b>100</b> includes a magnetic rotor <b>102</b>, which is a permanent magnet, that rotates within a stator <b>104</b> having three phases A, B and C with corresponding coil windings <b>106</b>. As is known in the art, drive power electronics <b>107</b> control the current moving through the windings <b>106</b> to control the magnetic field surrounding the windings <b>106</b>, causing the magnetic rotor <b>102</b> to rotate as it repels and attracts the poles in the generated magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a wye-connected motor. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a monitoring module <b>108</b> monitors the voltage at each phase and uses this information to determine the overall health of the motor <b>100</b>. As the magnetic rotor <b>102</b> rotates, it creates an alternating magnetic field that links the coils in the stator to induce a back EMF across each phase A, B and C. The typical measurements of the back EMF in this type of motor connection are made between two phase leads <b>103</b> (e.g., A-C, B-C, and A-B). The specific characteristics of the back EMF will vary depending on the overall health of the magnetic rotor <b>102</b>, the windings <b>106</b>, and any insulation (not shown) failure in the motor <b>100</b> as well as environmental conditions and motor speed. The back EMF across phase pairs can be measured by a voltmeter <b>112</b>, which can measure either the RMS voltage or the peak-to-peak voltage. The monitoring module <b>108</b> also includes an optional speed sensor <b>114</b> to measure the frequency of the motor, if desired. Alternatively, the speed can be determined by the frequency and period of the back EMF trace itself, eliminating the need for a separate speed sensor. With the back EMF and motor speed information, it is possible to obtain a given back EMF response “signature” at a given condition (e.g., motor speed and temperature).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The signature generated by the motor <b>100</b> will vary depending on the health of the motor components. For example, if the magnetic rotor <b>102</b> has been demagnetized due to, for example, environmental conditions, the resulting back EMF signature will have a lower magnitude than the back EMF of a magnet in a healthy condition. Other motor component deterioration, such as wire shorts or breakages, will also cause the signature to deviate by, for example, exhibiting a voltage imbalance between two leads.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An analog-to-digital (A/D) converter <b>116</b> converts the analog voltage and frequency data from the voltmeter <b>112</b> and speed sensor <b>114</b> to digital data. The converted data is sent to a controller <b>118</b>, which compares the converted data with data stored in a memory <b>120</b> to determine the health of the motor <b>100</b>. The controller <b>118</b> can be any appropriate control device, such as a microprocessor-based device.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example of how the data is analyzed. A reference signature <b>150</b> of the motor <b>100</b> obtained at a given speed and temperature when the motor is in a normal healthy condition is stored in the memory <b>120</b>. The motor <b>100</b> may then be periodically induced to spin freely, ideally at the same speed and temperature as when the reference signature <b>150</b> was obtained. The resulting measured signature <b>152</b> is then compared with the reference signature <b>150</b> to determine whether the measured signature <b>152</b> deviates from the reference by a predetermined threshold. If the measured signature <b>152</b> indicates that the electro-magnetic performance of the motor has deteriorated beyond the predetermined threshold, the controller <b>118</b> activates an alert mechanism <b>154</b> that notifies the user of a pending motor fault. The alert mechanism <b>154</b> can be any device that conveys information to the user about the fault, such as a visual or audible warning. The alert mechanism <b>154</b> may also be a device that generates a digital signal to a master system to alert the system of the pending motor fault.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, magnetic rotor <b>102</b> demagnetization and other conditions will cause the back EMF of the motor <b>100</b> to have a smaller magnitude. The predetermined threshold may be obtained experimentally by obtaining the measured back EMF signature <b>152</b> of the motor <b>100</b> when its performance is at an unacceptable level and then setting the threshold to be a selected percentage (e.g., ten percent) higher than the signature at failure. In this way, it is possible to catch motor performance deterioration before an actual performance failure occurs, allowing a user to pro-actively address motor maintenance issues before they cause problems. This ensures that motor performance can remain consistently reliable.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The comparison itself may be conducted by converting the raw voltage signal to an RMS voltage value and then comparing the RMS voltage value of the motor in its current operating state with the reference RMS voltage value of a healthy motor. The RMS voltage value corresponds to the amount of energy generated by the permanent magnet motor because the RMS voltage effectively represents the area under the curve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The comparison may also be conducted by digitizing the voltage trace and storing specific voltage levels vs. time points to capture and characterize the voltage waveform. The waveform, peak value, RMS value, or any other characteristic reflecting the current operating state of the motor can them be compared with a corresponding characteristic in a healthy motor.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> illustrate another embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the connection between the phases is conducted in the drive power electronics <b>107</b> rather than at the windings <b>106</b>. By keeping the phases separate at the windings, the phases can be tapped by the voltmeter <b>112</b> and the speed sensor <b>114</b> either as pairs or independently as individual phases. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is possible to measure the voltage and frequency of each phase individually, without reference to other phases, rather than across phase pairs as in the previous embodiment. To do this, the voltmeter <b>112</b> and/or the speed sensor <b>114</b> measures across a lead <b>103</b> pair associated with one of the individual phases. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows one example of the traces of all three phases in relation to each other, illustrating the difference between the back EMF signature <b>150</b> of a healthy device and the back EMF signature <b>152</b> of a device with reduced capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Note that implementation of the invention uses information that is already available to the controller <b>118</b> (i.e., voltage, speed, temperature) and therefore does not require any new sensors or other hardware dedicated to the invention. Moreover, the logic needed to carry out the inventive method can be easily programmed into the controller <b>118</b>. By monitoring the inherent electromechanical and magnetic properties of the motor components and incorporating intelligence in the controller <b>118</b> to interpret these properties with respect to a reference, the overall health condition of the motor <b>100</b> can be monitored to detect when service or scheduled maintenance is needed well before the system is not operationally acceptable. This periodic monitoring makes it possible to prolong the life of the motor <b>100</b> and ensure motor reliability through early problem detection and solving. The invention also eliminates the need to implement premature proactive maintenance or replacements in an attempt to ensure high reliability. As a result, the inventive monitoring system optimizes maintenance scheduling and minimizes overall long-term operational costs.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A similar health monitoring scheme may be applied if the device is running as a generator as well. The difference between the generator and the motor is that in case of a generator, the mechanical energy is converted into an electrical energy in the form of output voltage and current. Thus, the back EMF can be made as a reference as a function of speed. The terminal voltage, which is the difference of the back EMF and the impedance drop, is a function of load current. Therefore, for the generator application, the health monitoring can be done by using a method and system similar to the method and system described above, except that in this case, the back EMF, the terminal voltage, and load current are measured at a given load to establish a signature response. A measured signature is then obtained periodically during the life of the generator at the same conditions as the reference signature to check the current terminal voltage characteristics of the generator.</p>

It is intended that the following claims define the scope of the invention and that the method and apparatus within the scope of these claims and their equivalents be covered thereby.</p>
