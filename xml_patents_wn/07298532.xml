<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of writing a spatially heterodyne hologram having spatially heterodyne fringes includes: passing a single write beam through a spatial light modulator that digitally modulates said single write beam; and focusing the single write beam at a focal plane of a lens to impose a holographic diffraction grating pattern on the photorefractive crystal, the holographic diffraction grating pattern including the spatially heterodyne hologram having spatially heterodyne fringes, wherein only said single write beam is incident on said photorefractive crystal without a reference beam. A method of replaying a spatially heterodyne hologram having spatially heterodyne fringes at a replay angle includes: illuminating a photorefractive crystal having a holographic diffraction grating with a beam from a laser at an illumination angle, the holographic diffraction grating pattern including the spatially heterodyne hologram having spatially heterodyne fringes, wherein a difference between said illumination angle and said replay angle defines a diffraction angle α that is a function of a plane wave mathematically added to original object wave phase and amplitude data of said spatially heterodyne hologram having spatially heterodyne fringes.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates generally to the field of holography. More particularly, the present invention relates to a direct-to-digital hologram acquisition and replay system (i.e., no film, no plates). In a preferred implementation of the present invention, the hologram acquisition is based on a charge coupled device (CCD) camera. The present invention thus relates to a holographic system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Traditional methods of holography have used film or holographic plates (glass plates with a photographic emulsion optimized for holography) to record the hologram.<sup>(1) </sup>Replay has only been possible using lasers (or in some cases white light) and the original recorded hologram or a duplicate of it, in an analog method. These analog methods are slow, cumbersome, and expensive.<sup>(4) </sup>There is also no way to reduce them to electronic signals that can be transmitted and replayed at another location. It is always necessary to send hard copy. Worse still, the time delay involved in processing the film prevents the use of holography and its variants in many situations. Even if the expense of the classical holographic system itself was tolerable, the time delay and low throughput caused by the necessity of processing the film, introduces expenses associated with the delay that are absolutely intolerable (e.g., a tire manufacturer cannot wait 45 minutes, or even two minutes, to know that a particular tire has a flaw in it).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a classical side-band holography system recordation geometry is shown.<sup>(2-3) </sup>Light from a laser <b>110</b> is expended by a beam expander <b>120</b>. After passing through a lens <b>130</b>, the light is split into two components by a beamsplitter <b>140</b>. The beamsplitter <b>140</b> can be, for example, 90% reflective. The reflected beam constituting an object beam <b>150</b> travels toward and is reflected by a mirror <b>160</b>. The object beam <b>150</b> then travels toward an object <b>170</b>. The object beam <b>150</b> is then incident upon a holographic plate <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Meanwhile, that portion of the light from lens <b>130</b> that is transmitted through the beamsplitter <b>140</b> constitutes a reference beam <b>180</b> that travels toward and is reflected by a mirror <b>200</b>. The reflected reference beam is then incident upon the holographic plate <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">More recently, holographic interferometry has been developed, albeit also as an analog method.<sup>(5) </sup>This has included the development of focused holography.<sup>(6-7) </sup></p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Within this application several publications are referenced by superscripts composed of arabic numerals within parentheses. Full citations for these, and other, publications may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of all these publications in their entireties are hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the present application for the purposes of indicating the background of the present invention and illustrating the state of the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, there is a particular need for a method for 1) recording holograms directly to a CCD (charged coupled device) camera or any other suitable video camera with a digital computer interface and then 2) storing the holograms to a digital storage medium (e.g., RAM, hard drive, tape, recordable CD, etc.). Significant features of an apparatus for implementing this method include the use of a very small angle between the reference beam and object beam and focusing the hologram on the image plane to simplify the image. Additionally, the invention includes 1) a method of displaying the hologram phase or amplitude on a two-dimensional display and 2) a method of replaying the holograms completely using an optically active crystal and lasers. In contrast, the prior art does not include a description of how to electronically (digitally) record an optical hologram, much less replay, or broadcast an optical hologram.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The improvements disclosed herein allow for higher quality, lower-noise digital hologram acquisition and replay. The improvements make use of variations in the geometry and optical components to allow the acquisition and analysis of high resolution holograms. In addition, improvements to the replay system have been made that allow writing of a digital grating (hologram) to a photorefractive crystal, and then the replay of that grating or hologram with a single laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One embodiment of the invention is based on an apparatus to record an off-axis hologram, comprising: a laser; an illumination beamsplitter optically coupled to said laser; an objective lens optically coupled to said illumination beamsplitter; an object optically coupled to said objective lens; a reference beamsplitter coupled to said laser; a reference mirror optically coupled to said reference beamsplitter; a beam combiner optically coupled to both said reference beamsplitter and said illumination beamsplitter; and a digital recorder optically coupled to said beam combiner, wherein a reference beam and an object beam are combined at a focal plane of said digital recorder to form an off-axis hologram, and said object beam and said reference beam constitute a plurality of substantially simultaneous reference and object waves. Another embodiment of the invention is based on a method of recording an off-axis hologram, comprising: splitting a laser beam into an object beam and a reference beam; reflecting said reference beam from a reference beam mirror; reflecting said object beam from an illumination beamsplitter; passing said object beam through an objective lens; reflecting said object beam from an object; focusing said reference beam and said object beam at a focal plane of a digital recorder to form an off-axis hologram; digitally recording said off-axis hologram; and transforming said off-axis hologram in accordance with a Fourier transform to obtain a set of results.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another embodiment of the invention is based on an apparatus to write an off-axis hologram, comprising: a laser; a spatial light modulator optically coupled to said laser; a lens optically coupled to said spatial light modulator; and a photorefractive crystal optically coupled to said lens, wherein a write beam is focused at a focal plane of said photorefractive crystal by said lens to impose a holographic diffraction grating pattern on said photorefractive crystal. Another embodiment of the invention is based on a method of writing an off-axis hologram, comprising: passing a laser beam through a spatial light modulator; and focusing said laser beam at a focal plane of a photorefractive crystal to impose a holographic diffraction grating pattern on said photorefractive crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another embodiment of the invention is based on an apparatus to replay an off-axis hologram, comprising: a laser; and a photorefractive crystal optically coupled to said laser.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The present invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the nonlimiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">1. System Overview</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The reason that digital holography has not been developed until now is that the resolution of digital video cameras or cameras adaptable to digital media has, heretofore, not been good enough to record the very high spatial frequencies inherent in classical holograms. The invention combines several techniques that overcome this difficulty, and allow recording of holograms and all of their spatial frequencies up to the inherent holographic resolution of the recording camera for Fourier transform hologram analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It was necessary to realize how to digitally record an optical hologram (and that it is a hologram). It was also necessary to realize that the Fourier transform techniques used in interferometry and electron holography could be used to analyze the hologram. It was also necessary to realize that mathematical addition of a plane wave to the digital hologram, and writing the resulting intensity function to an optically sensitive crystal would allow actual replay of the hologram at a different (and much larger) diffraction angle α, than the angle used to create the original sideband hologram.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">2. Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a simple direct-to-digital holography system is shown to illustrate the hardware concepts that have been combined to allow digital recording and replay of holograms. Light from a laser <b>210</b> is expanded by a beam expander/spatial filter <b>220</b>. The expanded/filtered light then travels through a lens <b>230</b>. Then, the light travels to a beamsplitter <b>240</b>. Beamsplitter <b>240</b> can be, for example, 50% reflective. Light that is reflected by the beamsplitter constitutes an object beam <b>250</b> which travels toward and object <b>260</b>. A portion of the light reflected from the object <b>260</b> then passes through the beamsplitter <b>240</b> and travels toward a focusing lens <b>270</b>. This light then travels to a charged coupled device (CCD) camera (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Meanwhile, that portion of the light from lens <b>230</b> that passes through beamsplitter <b>240</b> constitutes a reference beam <b>280</b>. The reference beam <b>280</b> is reflected from a mirror <b>290</b> at a small angle. The reflected reference beam from mirror <b>290</b> then travels toward the beamsplitter <b>240</b>. That portion of the reflected reference beam that is reflected by the beamsplitter <b>240</b> then travels toward the focusing lens <b>270</b>. The reference beam from focusing lens <b>270</b> then travels toward the CCD camera. Together, the object beam from the focusing lens <b>270</b> and the reference beam from the focusing lens <b>270</b> constitute a plurality of simultaneous reference and object waves <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it can be seen that at least the following differences allow a CCD camera to record the hologram, rather than using film or a photographic plate. 1) The invention uses a high resolution CCD (e.g., 1.4 million pixels), (CCD's with over 60 million pixels are already available). 2) The invention uses a “Michelson” geometry (the geometrical relationship of the beamsplitter, reference beam and the object beam to be combined at a very small angle (the reference beam mirror, and CCD resembles a Michelson interferometer geometry). This geometry allows the reference beam mirror to be tilted to create the small angle that makes the spatially heterodyne or sideband fringes for Fourier analysis of the hologram. 3) The invention uses a focusing lens to focus the object onto the focal plane of the CCD. This lens also provides magnification or demagnification, as desired, by using lenses of different focal length and adjusting the corresponding spatial geometry (e.g., ratio of object distance to image distance). The foregoing three factors allow direct to digital recording and replay of holograms when combined with Fourier transform software analysis methods known in the literature.<sup>(10-12) </sup></p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The system is suitable for recording and replaying holographic images in real time or storing them for replay later. Since the holograms are digitally stored, a series of holograms can be made to create a holographic motion picture or the holograms can be broadcast electronically for replay at a remote site to provide holographic television (HoloVision). Since a hologram stores amplitude and phase, with phase being directly proportional to wavelength and optical path length, this direct to digital holography can also serve as an extremely precise measurement tool for verifying shapes and dimensions of precision components, assemblies, etc. Similarly, the ability to store the holograms digitally immediately provides a method for digital holographic interferometry. Holograms of the same object, after some physical change (stress, temperature, micromachining, etc.), can be subtracted from one another (direct subtraction of phase) to calculate a physical measurement of the change (phase change being directly proportional to wavelength). Similarly one object can be compared to a like object to measure the deviations of the second object from the first or master object, by subtracting their respective holograms. To unambiguously measure phase changes greater than 2π in the z-plane over two pixels in the x-y plane, holograms must be recorded at more than one wavelength (discussions of two-frequency interferometry are well-known in the literature and will not be repeated here).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The invention combines the use of high resolution video cameras, very small angle mixing of the holographic object and reference waves (mixing at an angle that results in at least two pixels per fringe and at least two fringes per spatial feature to be resolved), imaging of the object at the recording (camera) plane, and Fourier transform analysis of the spatially low-frequency heterodyne (side-band) hologram to make it possible to record holographic images (images with both the phase and amplitude recorded for every pixel). Additionally, an aperture stop can be used in the back focal plane of one or more lenses involved in focusing the object, to prevent aliasing of any frequencies higher than can be resolved by the imaging system (aliasing is thoroughly described in the literature and placing aperture stops in the back focal plane of a lens to limit the spatial frequencies present is also well described and well understood). No aperture is necessary if all spatial frequencies in the object are resolvable by the imaging system. Once recorded, it is possible to either replay the holographic images as 3-D phase or amplitude plots on a two-dimensional display or to replay the complete original recorded wave using a phase change crystal and white light or laser light to replay the original image. The original image is replayed by writing it in the phase-change medium with lasers, and either white light or another laser is used to replay it. By recording an image with three different colors of laser and combining the replayed images, it is possible to make a true-color hologram. By continuously writing and relaying a series of images, it is possible to form holographic motion pictures. Since these images are digitally recorded, they can also be broadcast with radio frequency (RF) waves (e.g., microwave) or over a digital network of fibers or cables using suitable digital encoding technology, and replayed at a remote site. This effectively allows holographic television and motion pictures or “HoloVision.”</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With regard to the use of a lens to focus the object onto the focal plane of the CCD, the diffraction pattern of a point can be described by a spherical function which has increasingly close fringe as the distance from the center of the pattern increases. As these fringes get closer and closer together, they are unresolvable by a video camera. Worse yet, the interaction of these point diffraction patterns from a complex object creates an impossibly dense and complicated pattern, which cannot be anywhere resolved by a video camera. Focusing the object on the recording plane eliminates these diffraction patterns, so that modern high-resolution video cameras can record holograms with reasonable fidelity.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">If the recording media resolves 100 lines/mm, the holographic resolution will be approximately 16 lines/mm, or on the order of 50 microns, at unity magnification. This limit can be increased by the use of a magnification lens. For a camera resolution of 100 lines/mm, the hologram resolution will be approximately 160 lines/mm if a magnification of 10 is used. Similarly, the spatial resolution will be decreased by any de-magnification of the original image onto the recording camera.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The invention can also be embodied in a number of alternative approaches. For instance, the invention can use phase shifting rather than heterodyne acquisition of the hologram phase and amplitude for each pixel. Phase shifting interferometry is well documented in the literature. As another example, the invention can use numerous different methods of writing the intensity pattern to an optically sensitive crystal. These include using a sharply focused scanning laser beam (rather than using a spatial light modulator), writing with an spatial light modulator (SLM) but without the biasing laser beam, and many possible geometric variations of the writing scheme. As another example, the invention can use optically sensitive crystals employing optical effects other than phase change to create the diffraction grating to replay the hologram. As yet another example, the invention can actually use a very fine-pixeled spatial light modulator to create the intensity pattern, thereby obviating any need to write the intensity pattern to an optically active crystal for replaying the hologram.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a heterodyne (sideband) hologram of a scratch in a mirror (the object in this case). The hologram was made with the direct to digital holography system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref> and described above. The fringes observable in the hologram are due to the interference between the reference and object beams. The reference beam mirror was tilted slightly to create these fringes. It is the presence of these fringes which allows Fourier transform analysis of the hologram to calculate the phase and amplitude for the pixels of the hologram. The Fourier transform analysis will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graphical plot of the two-dimensional Fourier transform of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The x axis is the spatial frequency axis along the x dimension and the y axis is the spatial frequency axis along the y dimension. The actual data itself is a matrix of numbers corresponding to the strength of a particular spatial frequency in (f<sub>x</sub>, f<sub>y</sub>) frequency space. The number and brightness of the white dots shows the strength and position in frequency space of the spatial frequencies present in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. It can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> that the reference beam fringes act as a heterodyne local oscillator shifting the real and virtual hologram images off-axis and allowing their separation in frequency space. It is known from Shannon's Theorem (or Nyquist's limit) that at least two pixels per fringe are required to resolve a fringe, and from electron holography that at least 3 fringes per resolvable feature are required to resolve the object in the hologram (nominally it would require three to four fringes per feature to allow resolution of the carrier spatial frequency plus the object frequencies, but work on the extended Fourier transform by Voelkl, et al.,<sup>(10-12) </sup>allows the use of 2 fringes per feature). Thus, these two limits determine the required magnification of an object and the tilt angle between the reference and object beams in order to resolve a feature (spatial frequency) in a hologram.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The data shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is analyzed by transforming (shifting) the axes in Fourier space to sit on top of the heterodyne carrier frequency (the spatial frequency caused by the small angle tilt between the object and reference beams), then applying a digital filter (e.g., a Hanning or Butterworth filter) to cut off the signals around the original origin (these are actually the signals resulting from the reference beam interacting with itself and the object beam interacting with itself, and are just noise from the hologram point of view), and then performing the inverse Fourier transform. All of this analysis can be carried out on a digital computer and can be done in real time. Real time analysis may require as many as 30 to 100 high performance parallel processors (e.g., Pentium Pro or DEC Alpha) to achieve a frame rate of 30 frames per second. Computer systems of this size are presently commonly used as large database servers and stock market calculational engines. They are also suitable for short-term low resolution weather forecasting, and image manipulation and creation for the film industry. It can be expected that such systems will be desktop systems within 6 to 10 years.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a replay of the phase data created by performing the described analysis on the data (hologram) from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Replaying the data as an actual hologram will require the creation of a diffraction grating in an optical crystal and illumination of the diffraction grating with laser light (or appropriately treated white light) at the correct angle. The data to be actually written to the optically sensitive crystal is calculated from the hologram data by adding a function f(x,y,z<sup>o</sup>) to each pixel h(x,y,z<sup>o</sup>) of the hologram data, where both functions are complex and:

<br/>
and r is the square root of x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>+z<sup>2</sup><sup><sup2>0 </sup2></sup>
</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The exponential function added above corresponds physically to adding a plane wave intersecting at angle α with the original object wave of the hologram. The function created by the sum is multiplied by its complex conjugate to form the absolute value intensity function, which is written to the light-sensitive crystal with the laser (it may also be possible to write only the intensity cross-term of the reference beam with the object, and drop the autocorrelation terms). The diffraction grating thus created in the light sensitive crystal can then be illuminated with laser light at angle α to replay the original hologram. If a crystal is used which has a temporary phase change or refractive index change when written with laser light, then by continuously writing new images from either instantaneously acquired or stored holograms, and illuminating each image with laser light from another laser (or appropriately treated white light) at the angle α, a 3-D motion picture or 3-D television image can be created. This is just one possible method and not the only possible method for writing the holographic image to an optically sensitive crystal and then replaying it.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a method for generating a motion picture or television using the invention.

</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Besides the possible improvements of the point resolution of a microscope, another important feature of lightwave holography is the direct accessibility of the image phase. In contrast to the conventional contrast transfer function which is a sin-function (Reimer, 1989) and displaced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, the transfer function of the object phase into the image phase is described by the cos-function. This transfer function is displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. The advantage of the cos-type transfer function is that the large area contrast (details of size &gt;1 nm) is not decreased and, apart from a slightly degraded point resolution, the total amount of information is higher in the image phase than in the image intensity at Gabor focus (Weierstall, 1989; Lichte, 1991). This is one of the reasons why a direct display of the image phase is preferable over the image intensity in some cases.</p>

with m, n=1, . . . ,N. I<sub>m,n </sub>is slightly different from the values of the function I(x,y) at the center of the pixel ((m−½)d), (n,−½)d)) due to the integration over the area of the pixel. This effect together with others contributes to the MTF of the CCD camera. For this discussion, we will assume that the MTF has been corrected for and therefore I((m−½)d), (n,−½)d))=I<sub>n,m</sub>. We also assume, for the moment, that I(x,y) has the form:

It is not required that this number of pixels be an integer. The sampling theorem states that if the image function I(x,y) is sampled such that no spatial frequency of the image is sampled below the Nyquist limit<sup>(12)</sup>, then the image function is uniquely defined within the area of the CCD camera. In other words, if all the spatial frequencies of the image function I(x,y) are sampled with s≧2, then the information I<sub>m,n </sub>on I(x,y) within the area of the CCD camera is complete. Therefore, it should be a question of display only, if I(x,y) is displayed with, for example, 124×124 or 13789×13789 sampling points (i.e., display points), both in real space and in Fourier space. The discrete Fourier transform FT<sup>d </sup>{. . . }is defined as:

The modulus of FT<sup>a</sup>{I(x)} is displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, it is clear that none of the details visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> are found in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Also, the FT<sup>a </sup>extends to infinity in Fourier space, whereas the FT<sup>d </sup>does not extend beyond the well known Nyquist limit at 1/(2d).

The new variables Δk, lΔ and τ permit a change in the display in Fourier space as well as the number of display points. Note that for Δk, Δl=0 and τ=1, EFT=FT<sup>d</sup>.
</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The Effect of τ</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The effect of τ can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Using τ=16 and Δk, Δl=0, there are now NΔ=512 points to display in Fourier space instead of N=32 points as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Obviously, the details visible in the analytic Fourier transform (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) appear in the discrete EFT too. But again, both the EFT (for τ≧1) and the FT<sup>d </sup>contain the same information. There are still two differences in the display of the modulus of the analytic and the modulus of the extended Fourier transform. First the Nyquist limit still holds for the extended Fourier transform and no spatial frequencies show up beyond the Nyquist limit. Second, the limited image area causes higher frequencies in Fourier space, which are reflected back at the Nyquist limit and cause differences such as the disappearance of the very fine details visible in the FT<sup>a</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The Effect of Δk</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The effect of Δk in EFT{Im} is displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> for the special case Δk=0.133 and τ=1. In comparison to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the right of the two peaks now coincides exactly with a pixel (or display point) in Fourier space. This causes the sidelobes, as visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, to disappear.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">This shifting of the display points in Fourier space is very important for off-axis lightwave holography, especially for the reconstruction of the image amplitude (under most circumstances, the wedge in the reconstructed phase, caused by the center of the sideband being off a display point, can be compensated easily). The effect of the center of the sideband being off a display point is to cause noise in the reconstructed amplitude.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">We can demonstrate the effect of the center of the sideband being actually off center of a display point in Fourier space on the reconstruction. To do this, we generate an empty hologram in the computer (image size 512×512) such that the sideband falls exactly on the display point (k,l) in Fourier space. In this case, the reconstructed amplitude is flat and shows a mean standard deviation of effectively 0%. A slight change in the generation, i.e. decreasing the sampling rate s, causes the center of the sideband to fall between the display points (k,l) and (k+1, l+1). Again, the mean standard deviation is computed, and we continue to decrease the sampling rate until the center of the sideband falls on the display point (k+1, l+1). The result of this simulation is displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. In the worst case, when the center of the sideband is found at (k+½, l+½), the mean standard deviation in the reconstructed amplitude reaches 10%.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Based on the above observations, the following reconstruction procedure can be advantageous:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0088">(1) Select area hologram that does not show object contributions (if possible).</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0089">(2) Apply Hanning window to this area (or all of hologram).</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0090">(3) Perform FT<sup>d </sup>and extract information about exact position of sideband.
<br/>
This defines Δk and Δl for the extended Fourier algorithm.
</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0091">(4) Apply EFT using the information on Δk and Δl. Use τ=1.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0092">(5) Isolate sideband, which is now perfectly centered.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0093">(6) Perform inverse FT<sup>d</sup>.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0094">(7) Extract amplitude and phase.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0095">Example. Apply Hanning window and perform FT<sup>d</sup>. Position of sideband is, lets say, (134.62, 172.31), using W. J. de Ruigter et al. in Proc. 10<sup>th </sup>Pfefferkorn Conf. Scanning Microsc. Suppl. 6 (1992) 347; →Δk=0.62 and Δl=0.31. Use these data together with τ=1 and perform EFT of hologram. The sideband is now centered on a display point and artifacts are reduced in the reconstructed amplitude.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a schematic of a Mach-Zender geometry. Comparing the Mach-Zender geometry of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> (called Mach-Zender because of its similarity to the geometry of a Mach-Zender interferometer) with the Michelson geometry, it can be appreciated that the focusing lens (objective lens <b>1635</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) can be much closer to the object <b>1640</b> because through-the-lens illumination allows the beamsplitter <b>1630</b> used for illumination to be behind the objective lens <b>1635</b> rather than between the objective lens <b>1635</b> and the object <b>1640</b>. This allows large numerical aperture, high magnification objectives to be used to look at (and record holograms of) small objects. For large objects the original Michelson geometry may be preferable, depending on the situation.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0100">It can also be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> that the final beam-combiner <b>1650</b> is located just before the CCD camera <b>1655</b>. The final beam combiner <b>1650</b> combines the reference and object beams <b>1685</b>, <b>1620</b> to illuminate the digital CCD camera <b>1655</b>. The angle of the beam combiner may be varied so that the reference and object beams are exactly co-linear, or in general strike the charged coupled device camera at an angle to one another so that the heterodyne carrier fringes are produced. This allows the carrier fringe frequency to be varied from 0 to the Nyquist limit of the CCD camera. The final beam combiner <b>1650</b> is much closer to the digital camera <b>1655</b> than with the Michelson geometry, at least for magnifying geometries (geometries where the object hologram is being magnified for acquisition by the digital camera). This allows the combining angle between the object and reference beams to be relatively large without causing the spots from the reference and object beams to no longer overlap at the CCD camera. This allows much finer control over the carrier frequency fringes. It is possible to vary the angle between the two beams from zero up to the maximum angle allowed by the constraints of the system without the spatial carrier frequency of the heterodyne hologram exceeding the Nyquist frequency allowed by the CCD (i.e., the angle can be increased until there are only two CCD pixels per fringe of the spatial carrier frequency—beyond this angle the spatial carrier frequency is no longer correctly recorded by the CCD). With the Michelson geometry, the maximum spatial carrier frequency of the hologram may not be reachable because the angle required may be large enough that the reference and object beams would no longer overlap at the CCD camera for some geometries.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Front Face Illumination of Beamsplitter/Beam-combiner for Object Beam Eliminates Astigmatism</heading>
<p id="p-0095" num="0101">The invention can include front face reflection from beamsplitters for the object beam, thereby helping to prevent astigmatism in the image. A limitation with the layout of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is that the object beam passes through the illumination beamsplitter material as it travels to the CCD camera Modifying the illumination geometry so that the laser beam passes through the beamsplitter only for illumination, but the beam returning from the object is reflected from the front face of the beamsplitter can eliminate this. This geometry prevents astigmatism in the image associated with passing through the beamsplitter, and simplifies lens design for the system, which would otherwise have to account for the beamsplitter material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates such a geometry, with 50× objectives installed (the system is also used in this configuration with Nikon 10× and Nikon 100× objectives).</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Quarter-wave Plate and Polarizer Beam Isolation Suppresses Unwanted Reflections</heading>
<p id="p-0097" num="0103">The invention can include the use of quarter-wave plate and polarizer beam isolation to suppress unwanted reflections. Experiments have shown that spurious reflections from the lens surfaces of the objective (or any other source) can be suppressed by more than an order of magnitude with a quarter-wave plate isolator design. To use this technique, the illumination beamsplitter is replaced with a polarizing beamsplitter, which passes p-polarization and reflects s-polarization and a quarter-wave plate is placed between the objective and the object. The quarter-wave plate is adjusted so that the incoming p-polarization is converted to circular polarization when it strikes the object. The return from the object passes through the quarter-wave plate once more and is converted to s-polarization. The s-polarization is now reflected from the polarizing beamsplitter and passes down the optical path to the CCD camera. Spurious reflections from the objective are now suppressed because they are still p-polarization and are not reflected by the polarizing beamsplitter. Alternative versions of this could involve just placing a polarizer in front of the tube lens and not having a polarizing beamsplitter at all. Also, the polarizing beamsplitter could pass s-polarization and reflect p-polarization. To prevent astigmatism due to the quarter-wave plate, the objective must be custom designed for the materials, position, and thickness of the quarter-wave plate. Otherwise the quarter-wave plate will cause some astigmatism or other aberrations in the object image. This technique has been tested on the system at ORNL with the quarter-wave plate and polarizer in front of the tube lens configuration, and found to suppress the unwanted objective lens reflections and other noise by more than an order of magnitude.</p>

<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Identical Object and Reference Beam Paths</heading>
<p id="p-0099" num="0105">The invention can include the use of identical object and reference beam paths to the maximum extent possible, thereby keeping the carrier fringe frequency constant and allowing Fourier Transform analysis. A varying carrier fringe frequency creates artifacts in the replay.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0106">It can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> that the object and reference beam paths in this design are essentially identical. The point of this is to make the object and reference beam wave fronts as nearly identical at the digital camera (CCD sensor) as possible. The semi-identical wavefronts will interfere and produce linear carrier fringes with a constant spatial frequency. As discussed in the original invention disclosure, Fourier Transform analysis is used to eliminate the holographic spatial carrier frequency, and a digital filter is applied to leave only the object beam phase and amplitude after the inverse FFT. If the holographic carrier frequency is not constant, then this technique does not work because spurious artifacts are created in the inverse transform by the presence of the additional frequency components of the carrier frequency. Semi-identical object and reference beam paths results in a very constant spatial carrier frequency for the heterodyne hologram. An alternative method would be to exactly calculate the object beam wavefront characteristics at the digital camera and use simpler optics designed to reproduce the wavefront in the reference beam. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows a photograph of the prototype system in the holography lab at ORNL, with semi-identical object and reference beam paths implemented.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Replace Mechanical Attenuator and Infinitely Variable Ratio Beamsplitters with Acousto-optic Modulators</heading>
<p id="p-0101" num="0107">The invention can include replacing mechanical attenuator and infinitely variable ratio beamsplitters with acousto-optic modulators. For high-speed operation, and to avoid the wear and tear associated with mechanical shutters (at the digital camera for instance), the mechanical attenuator and variable ratio beamsplitter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> can both be replaced with acousto-optic modulators. A single acousto-optic modulator could be used to replace the attenuator, and an acousto-optic modulator in each of the reference and object beam paths could be used to adjust the power in that particular path and act as a high-speed shutter. Acousto-optic modulators are usually driven with radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves and have an on/off time typically on the order of one microsecond. This is particularly useful for situations where images are being continuously acquired at multiple frames per second (e.g., holovision), where mechanical components cannot adjust rapidly enough and are subject to failure because of the number of cycles of operation achieved daily.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Use Fiber Optics to Couple the Laser to the Matching Lenses for Each Leg</heading>
<p id="p-0102" num="0108">The invention can use fiber optics to couple the laser to the matching lenses for each leg (object beam, replay beam) of the acquisition system. For example, the spatial filters could be replaced with single-mode polarization preserving fibers. A fiber optic <b>2435</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>. The use of fiber optics allows the laser system and acousto-optic modulators and other beam conditioning components to be far from the acquisition system if desired, and eliminates time-consuming and finicky alignment of the micron size pinholes of the spatial filter. The single-mode optical fibers rapidly attenuate any laser light not in the allowed mode, thereby “cleaning up” the beam profile.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0109">It can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> that if mirrors and lenses are used to couple the laser to the object and reference legs of the “holocamera” that it would be inconvenient to have the laser located far from the camera system. Remote location would require unobstructed beam paths that might have to be enclosed for reasons of safety or to keep debris and artifacts out of the path and off of the optics. On the other hand if single-mode polarization-preserving optical fibers are used to couple the laser to the matching lenses for each leg, remote location of the laser is quite convenient, and the single-mode fibers also suppress all modes except the allowed propagation mode, so that the two spatial filters in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> can both be eliminated. Remote location of the laser and acousto-optic modulators or mechanical attenuator and beamsplitter can have considerable advantages in many situations. Lasers can often be bulky and have considerable environmental requirements (cooling, electrical power, . . . ) so that remote location with a flexible connection allows the holocamera head to be light and mobile for applications where weight is important or where mobility is important.</p>

From the spatial light modulator <b>1975</b>, the write beam <b>1950</b> passes through a linear polarizer <b>1977</b>, through a tube lens <b>1980</b>, through an aperture <b>1985</b>, and through an objective lens <b>1990</b> to the beam combiner <b>1945</b>, and then to a focal plane of a photorefractive crystal <b>1995</b>. A replay beam <b>1915</b> passes from the variable beamsplitter <b>1910</b> through a ½ waveplate <b>1920</b>, through a shutter <b>1925</b>, through a spatial filter <b>1930</b>, and through a collimating lens <b>1935</b> to a mirror <b>1940</b>, to a beam combiner <b>1945</b> (e.g., beamsplitter), and then to a focal plane of a photorefractive crystal <b>1995</b>. A set of viewing optics <b>1999</b> are optically coupled to the crystal <b>1995</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0111">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, after being filtered and collimated to appropriate size, the write beam <b>1950</b> passes through the SLM <b>1975</b> (spatial light modulator) where it is digitally modulated (e.g., by an SLM driven by a computer) to impose the desired holographic diffraction grating pattern. The tube lens <b>1980</b> and objective <b>1990</b> then focus the holographic grating down to the appropriate size in the photorefractive crystal <b>1995</b> (lithium niobate in this case, although barium titanate and other photorefractive crystals are available). The demagnification is such that the holographic diffraction grating in the crystal <b>1995</b> will separate the zero order beam used for replay and the replayed hologram. The entire replay beam train is superfluous to the writing process. Once the holographic grating is written to the photorefractive crystal <b>1995</b> it can be replayed by closing the write beam shutter <b>1955</b> and opening the replay beam shutter <b>1925</b> so that the holographic grating written to the photorefractive crystal is illuminated by the replay beam <b>1915</b> at the correct angle to replay the hologram. Alternatively the hologram can be replayed by turning off the digital modulation to the SLM <b>1975</b> so that the write beam is now an unmodulated approximately plane wave illuminating the hologram previously written into the photorefractive crystal <b>1995</b>. Tn this configuration the replayed hologram emerges from the crystal <b>1995</b> at the angle that the replay beam would have struck it to replay it in the write beam original direction. This is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> by the downward pointing arrow in the low right-hand corner of the drawing. In this case both the entire replay beam optics and the beamsplitter between the objective lens and the photorefractive crystal becomes extraneous and unnecessary. Thus, the holographic grating written in the photorefractive crystal <b>1995</b> can be replayed with the replay beam, or alternatively, replayed by the write beam alone with the spatial light modulator turned off, thereby obviating the need for any replay beam or associated apparatus. For reasons of display timing one configuration or the other may be more desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a photograph of prototype replay system optics that was implemented in the holography lab at ORNL. There are several varieties of suitable readily commercially available SLM's, both reflective LCD (liquid crystal display), transmissive LCD, and micro-mirrors (e.g., Texas Instruments DLP—digital light processor—implementation). Typically the LCD SLM's require a polarizer.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref> show two SLM geometries suitable for implementation in a holographic replay system. Note that a micro-mirror implementation would not require a polarizer and would not rotate the polarization as the LCD implementations depicted do. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows a photograph of the 800 pixels by 600 pixels transmissive SLM employed for the holographic replay write beam set-up shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Eliminating the SLM Pixel Edge Diffraction Grating</heading>
<p id="p-0108" num="0114">The invention can include writing the hologram diffraction grating to photorefractive crystal and replaying with the same beam by turning the SLM (spatial light modulator) signal on to write and off to replay. With no signal to the SLM, the write beam becomes a plane wave suitable for replay and no separate replay beam is required.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0115">Because the SLM pixels have finite edges (as opposed to infinitely thin), the edges form a fairly strong diffraction grating. If these edges/diffraction grating are not eliminated from the image, then they form artifacts at a higher frequency in the hologram grating written to the photorefractive crystal. These artifacts are undesirable since they produce confusing diffracted orders of light and interact with the desired hologram grating to be written to the photorefractive crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0116">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, these pixel edges/diffraction grating can be eliminated by placing the aperture <b>1985</b> at the Fourier plane of the tube lens, which occurs between the tube lens and the focusing objective. The aperture is sized to pass only the zero diffracted order, which eliminates the pixel edges but does not eliminate the image written to the SLM, because the pixel edges are the highest frequency associated with the SLM (the pixels themselves can at most display a frequency half the pixel edge frequency, by Nyquist's Limit). The Fourier plane is easily found by turning the SLM off and observing where the diffracted orders caused by the pixel edges come to focused spots. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows a photograph of the laser beam after passing through the SLM and tube lens and focusing at the tube lens Fourier plane.</p>
<heading id="h-0020" level="1">Replace Attenuator, Shutters, and Spatial Filters with Acousto-optic  Modulators and Single-mode Polarization Preserving Fibers</heading>
<p id="p-0111" num="0117">The invention can include replacing a mechanical beam attenuator with an acousto-optic modulator for speed and convenience. More specifically, mechanical shutters can be replaced with acousto-optic modulators for speed and convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0118">As discussed above in connection with the hologram acquisition system, and for the same reasons, the attenuator, and variable beamsplitter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> can be replaced with acousto-optic modulators (AOM's). Similarly the laser and AOM's can be remotely situated from the hologram replay head (“Holovision” head) by connecting them to the replay optics with single-mode polarization preserving optical fibers. Once more this serves the purpose of eliminating mass and environmental effects (heat, vibration, . . . ) due to the laser and AOM's from the holovision head and makes it lightweight and mobile. The fibers also serve the purpose once more of eliminating the spatial filters shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0119">Many similar geometries are possible. Angles can be modified; reference and object beam geometries can be modified. Write and replay beam geometries can be modified Specific components can be replaced with other kinds of components. Laser wavelengths used for recording and replay can be different. The system could also be implemented with coherent x-radiation, V, DUV, VUV, or infrared coherent radiation. The replay system could be modified to use white light to replay after the photorefractive crystal is written. A phase shifting rather than amplitude modulating SLM could be used for the replay system. Ferroelectric SLM's could be used and micro mirrors (e.g., Texas Instruments DLP system) could also be used in place of an SLM.</p>
