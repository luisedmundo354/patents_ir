<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a captivated clamp for use in mounting surgical retractors with respect to an operating table. More particularly, the present invention relates to a clamp that is positioned into a clamping position with a wedge.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Prior to performing a surgical procedure requiring retraction, a retractor support apparatus is typically disposed about the surgical site. Retractor clamps are commonly used to mount the retractor support apparatus with respect to an operating table. Retractor clamps are also used to attach surgical retractors to the retractor support apparatus. Some retractor clamps are manufactured in a captivated configuration so that users cannot disassemble the retractor clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A retractor clamp typically includes a first clamping member, a second clamping member and a handle. A typical configuration for a clamping member is to have the clamping member fabricated from a unitary structure that is generally in the shape of the letter “U”. In each of the retractor clamps, the object to be clamped is placed between the legs of the U-shaped structure so that the object is proximate the base of the U-shaped structure. Movement of the legs of the U-shaped structure towards each other causes the object to be clamped with respect to the clamping member.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The use of clamping members having U-shaped structures has some disadvantages in particular surgical procedures. First, the U-shaped structure must be disposed over an end of a retractor support apparatus and slid into a desired position. When previously placed retractor clamps are disposed between the end of the support arm and the desired location, the interfering clamps must be removed to allow the additional surgical clamp to be disposed in the desired location. Having to disassemble at least a portion of the surgical support apparatus about a surgical site to add additional retractors adds unnecessary additional time and expense to the surgical procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, the second U-shaped structure and the handle are typically disposed above the first U-shaped structure and the retractor support arm. Because the second U-shaped structure and the handle are located above the surgical support arm, the second U-shaped structure and the handle may obstruct access to the surgical site during some surgical procedures.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention includes a surgical joint having a first clamping member comprising a first clamping surface for engaging a first surgical rod and an attachment end. A second clamping member is mounted with respect to the first clamping member where the second clamping member comprises a second clamping surface for engaging a second surgical rod. A shaft is disposed through and positioned within the attachment end of the first clamping member where the shaft is in communication with the second clamping member. A force providing mechanism is disposed between the first and second clamping members and disposed about the shaft where the force providing mechanism and the shaft are movable with respect to each other and place the first and second clamping members in either a non-clamping position or a clamping position.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention includes a low profile surgical clamp generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at <b>10</b>. The clamp <b>10</b> is particularly suited for mounting a retractor (not shown) with respect to an operating table (not shown). The clamp <b>10</b> includes a first clamping member <b>12</b> having a first clamping surface <b>14</b> and a second clamping member <b>16</b> having a second clamping surface <b>18</b>. Other components may be substituted for the second clamping member <b>16</b> such as, but not limited to, permanently attached retractors, or retractors that are attached using other types of clamps or fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To position the clamp <b>10</b> within the surgical site, a clamping end <b>24</b> of the first clamping member <b>12</b> is positioned proximate a retractor support arm <b>11</b>. The first clamping surface <b>14</b> proximate the clamping end <b>24</b> is disposed about the portion of the retractor support arm <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first clamping member <b>12</b> also includes an attachment end <b>26</b> and a fulcrum portion <b>28</b> between the clamping end <b>24</b> and the attachment end <b>26</b>. The first clamping member <b>12</b> has a recess <b>30</b> defined by an upper leg portion <b>32</b> and a lower leg portion <b>34</b> proximate the attachment end <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The fulcrum portion <b>28</b> extends between the upper leg portion <b>32</b> and the lower leg portion <b>34</b> as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The fulcrum portion <b>28</b> allows the upper leg portion <b>32</b> to move with respect to the lower leg portion <b>34</b> so that the retractor support arm <b>11</b> may be clamped within the first clamping surface <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An actuating mechanism <b>80</b> is disposed within the recess <b>30</b> between the upper leg portion <b>32</b> and the lower leg portion <b>34</b> of the first clamping member <b>12</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The actuating mechanism <b>80</b> preferably is a wedge. By the term wedge is meant a component that progressively increases in cross-sectional thickness such that when the wedge is moved or rotated in a restricted space, the movement or rotation of the wedge causes progressive increase in thickness to cause a force to be applied, such as a leverage action, to spread apart leg portions of the clamp. The wedge may take on forms other than those specifically described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The wedge <b>80</b> is movable within the recess <b>30</b> and forces the upper and lower leg portions <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> apart and causes the fulcrum portion <b>28</b> to flex. As the fulcrum portion <b>18</b> flexes, the first clamping member <b>12</b> constricts. When constricted, the first clamping surface <b>14</b> frictionally engages the retractor support arm <b>11</b> in a clamped relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first clamping surface <b>14</b> is configured to generally conform to the cross-sectional configuration of the retractor support arm <b>11</b>, but may be configured to conform to other shaped cross-sections. In a preferred embodiment, the first clamping surface <b>14</b> conforms to a substantially circular cross-sectional configuration of the retractor support arm <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first clamping surface <b>14</b> defines a clamping slot <b>38</b> that permits the first clamping member <b>12</b> to be placed on the retractor support arm <b>11</b> without moving any other surgical equipment that has been previously disposed upon the retractor support arm <b>11</b>. When the clamp <b>10</b> is in a non-clamping position, the first clamping member <b>12</b> is retained upon the retractor support arm <b>11</b> by a constricted entrance <b>39</b> to the clamping slot <b>38</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, a bead or raised surface <b>40</b> is disposed along a length of resilient portions <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> that move as the retractor support arm <b>11</b> is positioned within the clamping slot <b>38</b> where the bead <b>40</b> constricts the entrance <b>39</b>. However other devices that constrict the entrance <b>39</b> to the clamping slot <b>38</b> are within the scope of the present invention including, but not limited to, a clip, a roller or a spring loaded device.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The constricted entrance <b>39</b> provides a preliminary clamping force around the portion of the retractor support arm <b>11</b> such that the constricted entrance <b>39</b> to the clamping slot <b>38</b> prevents the clamp <b>10</b> from slipping off the retractor support arm <b>11</b> when the clamp <b>10</b> is in non-clamping position. The entrance <b>39</b> of the clamping slot <b>38</b> should not be so constricted to prevent use of manual force to position the first clamping member <b>12</b> about the portion of the retractor support arm <b>11</b>. However, the entrance <b>39</b> of the clamping slot <b>38</b> should be sufficiently constricted to prevent the first clamping member <b>12</b> from accidentally slipping off of the retractor support arm <b>11</b>.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To position the wedge <b>80</b> into the second or clamping position, a handle <b>22</b> fixedly attached to the wedge <b>80</b> is moved in the direction of arrows <b>23</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which rotates the wedge <b>80</b> about the shaft <b>100</b> and axis <b>73</b>. Although the preferred embodiment includes a rotatable wedge, one skilled in the art will recognize that moving a wedge in other manners such as sliding is also within the scope of the invention. The purpose of the wedge <b>80</b> is to increase the wedge's thickness within the recess <b>30</b> to force the upper and lower leg portions <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, respectively, apart.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As the wedge <b>80</b> is rotated about the shaft <b>100</b>, the pin <b>108</b> moves along the first and second ramped surfaces <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> toward the apexes of the first and second ramped surfaces <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>, respectively. As the pin <b>108</b> rises on the first and second ramped surfaces, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>, respectively, an increasing force is placed upon the pin <b>108</b>.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, as the wedge <b>80</b> is rotated from the first position to the second position, the wedge <b>80</b> compresses the compression spring <b>109</b>, and the distance between the pin <b>108</b> and the washer <b>72</b> becomes less than the height of the wedge <b>80</b>. With the wedge <b>80</b> in the second position, the height of the wedge <b>80</b> is greater than the distance between the pin <b>108</b> and the washer <b>72</b>, such that the wedge <b>80</b> forces the first and second leg portions <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> apart by forcing the shoulder <b>113</b> of the shaft into the proximal end <b>52</b> of the second clamping member <b>16</b> and transferring the force to the first leg portion <b>32</b>. With the first and second leg portions <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> forced apart, the fulcrum portion <b>28</b> flexes which causes the first clamping slot <b>38</b> to constrict such that the first clamping surface <b>14</b> frictionally engages the retractor support arm <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">With the wedge <b>80</b> in the second position, the shoulder <b>113</b> is forced upward and into the proximal end <b>52</b> of the second clamping member <b>16</b> and creates a frictional engagement between the cooperating frusto-conical surface <b>49</b> of the through bore <b>48</b> in the upper leg portion <b>32</b> and the frusto-conical surface <b>50</b> of the second clamping member <b>16</b>. The frictional engagement of the frusto-conical surfaces <b>49</b>, <b>50</b> prevents rotational movement of the second clamping member <b>16</b> with respect to the first clamping member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With the wedge <b>80</b> in the second position, the end <b>102</b> of the shaft <b>100</b> is raised into the opening <b>17</b> through the through bore <b>72</b>. The raised end <b>102</b> of the shaft <b>100</b> contacts the retractor handle <b>20</b> and creates a frictional engagement between the arcuate upper portion <b>62</b> of the second clamping surface <b>18</b>, the retractor handle <b>20</b> and the end <b>102</b> of the shaft <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">One skilled in the art will recognize that a plane of movement of the handle <b>22</b> approximately intersects an axis of the retractor support arm <b>11</b> as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Therefore, the operator can conveniently manipulate the wedge <b>80</b> from the first position to the second position by gripping the handle <b>22</b> and the retractor support arm <b>11</b> with one hand and forcing the handle <b>22</b> toward the retractor support arm <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The surgical clamp <b>10</b> of the present invention also provides a low profile clamping device for conducting the surgical procedure.

By disposing the second clamping member <b>16</b> and the handle <b>22</b> proximate the retractor support arm <b>11</b>, the surgical site remains relatively open and free of obstruction thereby providing better access to the surgical site.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">An advantage of the clamp <b>10</b> of the present invention is that the clamp <b>10</b> does not have to be slid along the retractor support arm <b>11</b> to a new selected position. The retractor clamp <b>10</b> can be repositioned on the support arm <b>11</b> by first positioning the wedge <b>80</b> into the first position such that the first clamping slot <b>38</b> is not constricted and detaching the first clamping member <b>12</b> from the retractor support arm <b>11</b>. The first clamping member <b>12</b> is detachable from the retractor support arm <b>11</b> by applying manual force in an opposite direction as used to position the first clamping member <b>12</b> on the support arm <b>11</b>. After the clamp <b>10</b> has been removed from the retractor support arm <b>11</b>, the clamp <b>10</b> is repositionable on the retractor support arm <b>11</b> by positioning an entrance <b>39</b> to the clamping slot <b>38</b> against the retractor support arm <b>11</b> and applying manual force substantially perpendicular to the axis of that portion of the retractor support arm <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The retractor handle <b>20</b> can also be repositioned within the second clamping member <b>16</b> without having to slide the retractor handle <b>20</b> with respect to the second clamping surface <b>18</b>. The retractor handle <b>20</b> is removed from the second clamping member <b>16</b> by providing manual force in the opposite direction of the force used to position the retractor handle <b>20</b> within the opening <b>17</b> of the second clamping member <b>16</b>. The retractor handle <b>20</b> can be reinserted into the opening <b>17</b> by reapplying manual force generally perpendicular to the axis of the retractor handle <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The surgical clamp <b>10</b> of the present invention, having the first and second clamping surfaces <b>14</b>, <b>18</b>, respectively, enables the clamp <b>10</b> to be positioned upon the retractor support arm <b>11</b> in a selected position. Further, an additional retractor can be easily and conveniently positioned within a surgical site without having to dispose the end of the retractor through the opening <b>17</b> defined by the second clamping surface <b>18</b>. The convenience of the surgical clamp <b>10</b> of the present invention allows the surgical site to be quickly assembled, modified during a surgical procedure, and disassembled, which enables a surgical team to conduct a more efficient surgical procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An alternative embodiment of the surgical clamp of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> at <b>210</b>.

A shaft <b>222</b> is disposed through the first and second clamping members <b>212</b>, <b>216</b>, respectively. The shaft <b>222</b> includes an externally threaded portion <b>224</b> proximate a first end <b>226</b>, a head <b>228</b> proximate a second end <b>227</b> and an intermediate portion (not shown) between the head <b>228</b> and the threaded portion <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The threaded portion <b>224</b> of the shaft <b>222</b> is disposed through an elongated bore <b>240</b> within the first clamping member <b>212</b> and through a bore <b>241</b> within the second clamping member <b>216</b>. A nut <b>225</b> threadably engages the threaded portion <b>224</b> and retains the first and second clamping members <b>212</b>, <b>216</b>, respectively, about the shaft <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The first clamping member <b>212</b> is preferably made of a unitary structure having a surface <b>214</b> defining a first clamping slot <b>221</b> proximate a first end <b>215</b> and a first pivot surface <b>234</b> proximate a second end <b>236</b> which contacts an upper surface of the washer <b>220</b>. The first clamping member <b>212</b> includes the elongated bore <b>240</b> for accepting the head <b>228</b> of the shaft <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The first clamping member <b>212</b> includes an integral collar <b>260</b> that cooperates with a camming pin <b>242</b>.

The end portions <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> and the intermediate portion <b>254</b> are generally cylindrical in shape and are located adjacent one to another. The end portions <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> are centered about a rotational axis and are captivated within first and second through bores <b>262</b>, <b>264</b>, respectively. The captivated end portions <b>250</b>, <b>252</b> rotatably support the intermediate portion <b>254</b> within the collar <b>260</b> and a through bore (not shown) within the head <b>228</b> of the shaft <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The shaft <b>222</b> is positioned through the elongated bore <b>240</b> within the first clamping member <b>212</b> including the integral collar <b>260</b> and the through bore <b>241</b> within the second clamping member <b>216</b>, respectively, such that the head <b>228</b> is disposed within the elongated bore <b>240</b>. The elongated bore <b>240</b> is elongated to allow the required movement of a head <b>228</b> of the shaft <b>222</b> when the clamp <b>210</b> is positioned from the first position to the second position and also in the reverse direction. The head <b>228</b> includes the through bore (not shown) that is aligned with the first and second through bores <b>262</b>, <b>264</b>, respectively, within the collar <b>260</b> and engages the intermediate portion <b>254</b> of the camming pin <b>242</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The intermediate portion <b>254</b> is eccentrically coupled between the end portions <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, respectively. The intermediate portion <b>254</b> includes an outer circumferential surface <b>256</b> having an axis that is spaced from the rotational axis the camming pin <b>242</b> by a selected distance. The distance separating the axis of the camming pin <b>242</b> and the axis of the intermediate portion <b>256</b> generally determines the maximum distance that the camming pin <b>242</b> moves the shaft <b>222</b> relative to the first and second clamping members <b>212</b>, <b>216</b>, respectively. Preferably, the distance separating the axis of the camming pin <b>242</b> and the axis of the intermediate portion <b>254</b> is sufficient to frictionally secure first and second surgical rods <b>246</b>, <b>248</b> within the first and second clamping members <b>212</b>, <b>216</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The second clamping member <b>216</b> is also preferably a unitary structure having a surface <b>218</b> defining a second clamping slot <b>217</b> proximate a first end <b>219</b> and a second pivot surface <b>230</b> proximate a second end <b>232</b>. The second pivot surface <b>230</b> contacts a bottom surface of the washer <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In operation, a handle <b>244</b>, fixedly attached to the camming pin <b>242</b>, is in a first position such that the first and second clamping slots <b>221</b>, <b>217</b> of the first and second clamping members <b>212</b>, <b>216</b> accept first and second support members <b>246</b>, <b>248</b>, all respectively. The movement of the handle <b>244</b> from the first position to a second position causes the intermediate portion <b>254</b> to engage the shaft <b>222</b>. As the shaft <b>222</b> is engaged, a force is applied to the first clamping member <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The force causes the first clamping member <b>212</b> to pivot about the first pivot surface <b>234</b> such that the first support member <b>246</b> is frictionally engaged between the first clamping member <b>212</b> and the upper surface of the washer <b>220</b>. The force is also applied to the second clamping member <b>216</b> and causes the second clamping member <b>216</b> to pivot about the second pivot surface <b>230</b> and causes the second support member <b>248</b> to be frictionally engaged between the bottom surface of the washer <b>220</b> and the second clamping member <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Thus, a simple actuation of the handle <b>244</b> and the camming pin <b>242</b> frictionally clamps the first and second support members <b>246</b>, <b>248</b> within the first and second clamping members <b>212</b>, <b>216</b>, respectively, in selected rotational and axial positions. Conversely, the opposite movement of the handle <b>244</b> and rotation of the camming member <b>242</b> moves the head portion <b>228</b> of the shaft <b>222</b> relative to the first and second clamping members <b>212</b>, <b>216</b> to reduce the forces that frictionally bind the first and second support members <b>246</b>, <b>268</b> and thereby allow the first and second support members <b>246</b>, <b>248</b> to be removed from the first and second clamping surfaces <b>214</b>, <b>218</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The surgical clamp <b>210</b> enables a physician to quickly and easily adjust and re-adjust the rotational positions of the first and second clamping members <b>212</b>, <b>216</b> as well as the position of the first and second support members <b>246</b>, <b>248</b>, respectively, within the first and second clamping members <b>212</b>, <b>216</b> by providing a force perpendicular to an axis of the first and second surgical rods <b>246</b>, <b>248</b>. As a result, the surgeon can easily add an additional retractor where needed by disposing the clamp <b>210</b> about the second surgical rod <b>248</b> and providing a force perpendicular to an axis of the second support member <b>248</b> thereby disposing the second support member within the second clamping slot <b>217</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, the first support member <b>246</b>, in this instance a retractor handle, is easily disposed within the first clamping slot <b>221</b> without having to dispose an end of the first support member <b>246</b> through the first clamping slot <b>221</b>. By rotating the handle <b>244</b> and camming pin <b>242</b> between the first non-clamping position and the second clamping position, the clamp <b>210</b> frictionally engages the first surgical rod <b>246</b> and the second surgical rod <b>248</b>. As a result, adding an additional retractor within a surgical site is simple, quick and does not require the surgical team to break down any of the apparatus surrounding the surgical site.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A second alternative embodiment of the surgical clamp of the present invention is generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> at <b>310</b>. The clamp <b>310</b> includes a first clamping member <b>312</b> having a first clamping surface <b>314</b> and a second clamping member <b>316</b> having a second clamping surface <b>318</b>. Other components may be substituted for the second clamping member <b>316</b> such as, but not limited to, permanently attached retractors, or retractors that are attached using other types of clamps or fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">To position the clamp <b>310</b> within the surgical site, a clamping end <b>324</b> of the first clamping member <b>312</b> is positioned proximate a retractor support arm <b>311</b>. The first clamping surface <b>314</b> proximate the clamping end <b>324</b> is disposed about the portion of the retractor support arm <b>311</b> by applying manual force substantially perpendicular to an axis of the retractor support arm <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The first clamping member <b>312</b> also includes a fulcrum portion <b>328</b> proximate the clamping surface <b>314</b> and located between an upper leg portion <b>332</b> and a lower leg portion <b>334</b> as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. The fulcrum portion <b>328</b> allows the upper leg portion <b>332</b> to move with respect to the lower leg portion <b>334</b> so that the retractor support arm <b>311</b> may be clamped within the first clamping surface <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">An actuating mechanism <b>380</b> is disposed within a recess <b>330</b> defined by the upper leg portion <b>332</b> and the lower leg portion <b>334</b> of the first clamping member <b>312</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The actuating mechanism <b>380</b> preferably is a camming pin.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The camming pin <b>380</b> is movable within the recess <b>330</b> and forces the upper and lower leg portions <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> apart and causes the fulcrum portion <b>328</b> to flex. As the fulcrum portion <b>318</b> flexes, a clamping slot <b>338</b> defined by the first clamping surface <b>314</b> constricts such that the first clamping surface <b>314</b> frictionally engages the retractor support arm <b>311</b>. The first clamping surface <b>314</b> is configured to generally conform to the cross-sectional configuration of the retractor support arm <b>311</b>, but may be configured to conform to other shaped cross-sections.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the clamping slot <b>338</b> permits the first clamping member <b>312</b> to be placed on the retractor support arm <b>311</b> without moving any other surgical equipment that has been previously disposed upon the retractor support arm <b>311</b>. When the clamp <b>310</b> is in a non-clamping position, the first clamping member <b>312</b> is retained upon the retractor support arm <b>311</b> by a constricted entrance <b>339</b> to the clamping slot <b>338</b>. A bead or raised surface <b>340</b> is disposed substantially along a length of the clamping slot <b>338</b> to constrict the entrance <b>339</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The constricted entrance <b>339</b> provides a preliminary clamping force around the portion of the retractor support arm <b>311</b> such that the constricted entrance <b>339</b> to the clamping slot <b>338</b> prevents the clamp <b>310</b> from slipping off the retractor support arm <b>311</b> when the clamp <b>310</b> is in non-clamping position. The entrance <b>339</b> of the clamping slot <b>338</b> should not be so constricted to prevent use of manual force to position the first clamping member <b>312</b> about the portion of the retractor support arm <b>311</b>. However, the entrance <b>339</b> of the clamping slot <b>338</b> should be sufficiently constricted to prevent the first clamping member <b>312</b> from accidentally slipping off of the retractor support arm <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The second clamping member <b>316</b> extends through a through bore <b>348</b> defined by a frusto-conical surface <b>349</b> within the upper leg portion <b>332</b> of the first clamping member <b>312</b>. The second clamping member <b>316</b> includes a frusto-conical surface <b>350</b> at a proximal end <b>352</b> that cooperates with the frusto-conical surface <b>349</b> of the upper leg portion <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">With the second clamping member <b>316</b> being positioned within the upper leg portion <b>332</b>, an annular groove <b>356</b> on the second clamping member <b>316</b> is positioned above an upper surface <b>333</b> of the upper leg portion <b>332</b>. A snap ring <b>358</b> is disposed within the annular groove <b>356</b> that rotatably captivates the second clamping member <b>316</b> within the upper leg portion <b>332</b> of the first clamping member <b>312</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the second clamping surface <b>318</b> is positioned on a distal end portion <b>354</b>. A retractor handle <b>320</b> is disposed proximate an entrance <b>319</b> to an opening <b>317</b> defined by the second clamping surface <b>318</b>. Manual force is applied to the retractor handle <b>320</b> substantially perpendicularly to an axis to position the retractor handle <b>320</b> within the opening <b>317</b> by displacing an end <b>402</b> of a shaft <b>400</b> from the opening <b>317</b>. The end <b>402</b> is positioned into the opening <b>317</b> through a through bore <b>372</b> extending through the second clamping member <b>316</b> along an axis <b>373</b> and intersects a bottom portion <b>361</b> of the clamping surface <b>318</b>. With the end <b>402</b> displaced from the opening <b>317</b>, the entrance <b>319</b> to the opening <b>317</b> is not constricted thereby allowing the retractor handle <b>320</b> to be disposed within the opening <b>317</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">With the retractor handle <b>320</b> positioned within the opening <b>317</b>, a compression spring <b>409</b>, disposed between the shaft <b>400</b> and a spacer <b>30</b> that contacts the camming pin <b>380</b>, biases the end <b>402</b> of the shaft <b>400</b> back into the opening <b>317</b>. The end <b>402</b> and the arcuate upper portion <b>362</b> retain the retractor handle within the opening <b>317</b> such that the retractor handle is slidably positionable with respect to the second clamping surface <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The second clamping member <b>316</b> is positioned into a clamping position at approximately the same time that the camming pin <b>380</b> forces the first and second leg portions <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> apart. When the second clamping member <b>316</b> is in the clamping position, the second clamping member <b>316</b> is non-rotatably fixed with respect to the first clamping member <b>312</b> and the retractor handle <b>320</b> is frictionally engaged within the second clamping surface <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The camming pin <b>380</b> is positionable between a first non-clamping position and a second clamping position. In the first non-clamping position the first and second clamping members <b>312</b>, <b>316</b>, respectively, are in a non-clamping position and the second clamping member <b>316</b> is rotatable within the first clamping member <b>312</b>. In the second clamping position, the retractor support apparatus <b>311</b> is frictionally engaged with the first clamping surface <b>314</b> and a retractor support handle <b>320</b> is frictionally engaged between the arcuate upper portion <b>362</b> of the second clamping surface <b>318</b> and the end <b>402</b> of the shaft <b>400</b>. Additionally, the second clamping member <b>316</b> is rotatably fixed with respect to the first clamping member <b>312</b> by a frictional engagement of the cooperating frusto-conical surfaces <b>349</b>, <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The camming pin <b>380</b> is positioned within the recess <b>330</b> where the camming pin <b>380</b> includes a first cylindrical portion <b>388</b> and a second cylindrical portion <b>390</b> that are separated by the canning surface <b>382</b> which has an axis offset from the axis of rotation of the camming pin <b>380</b>. Although a specific cam is described and illustrated in the drawings, other cam configurations are included within the present invention. By cam is meant an element having a raised surface or projecting part that when moved or rotated imparts an intermittent, alternate or variable motion.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The first and second cylindrical portions <b>388</b>, <b>390</b>, respectively, are rotatably positioned within first and second arcuate recesses <b>436</b>, <b>438</b>, respectively, within the lower leg portion <b>334</b> and first and second arcuate recesses <b>440</b>, <b>442</b>, respectively, within a lower portion <b>404</b> of the shaft <b>400</b>. The first arcuate recesses <b>436</b>, <b>440</b>, respectively, cooperate to rotatably retain the first cylindrical portion <b>388</b> and the second arcuate recesses <b>438</b>, <b>442</b>, respectively, cooperate to rotatably retain the second cylindrical portion <b>390</b> such that the camming pin <b>380</b> is rotatable between the first and second positions.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">With the camming pin <b>380</b> in the first position, the spacer <b>430</b> is positioned on a flat surface <b>384</b> of the camming pin <b>380</b>. With the spacer <b>430</b> positioned on the flat surface <b>384</b>, the compression spring <b>409</b> biases a shoulder <b>413</b> towards the proximal end <b>350</b> of the second clamping member <b>316</b> and biases the end <b>402</b> of the shaft <b>400</b> into the opening <b>317</b>. A first end of the compression spring <b>409</b> is disposed within a cavity <b>420</b> of the shaft <b>400</b>. A second end of the compression spring <b>409</b> is disposed within the cavity <b>432</b> within a spacer <b>430</b> where the spacer <b>430</b> is slidably positionable within the cavity <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As the camming pin <b>380</b> is rotated into the second position, the spacer <b>430</b> is positioned on and raised by the camming surface <b>382</b>. As the spacer <b>430</b> is raised, the compression spring <b>409</b> compresses until an end <b>431</b> of the spacer <b>430</b> contacts a surface <b>421</b> within the cavity <b>420</b>. With the surfaces <b>421</b>, <b>431</b> contacting and the camming pin <b>380</b> in the second clamping position, the shoulder <b>413</b> is forced into the proximal end <b>352</b> of the second clamping member <b>316</b> creating a frictional engagement with the frusto-conical surfaces <b>349</b>, <b>350</b>. Additionally, the end <b>402</b> of the shaft <b>400</b> is forced into the opening <b>317</b> such that the retractor handle <b>320</b> is secured within the opening <b>317</b> by a frictional engagement between the end <b>402</b> of the shaft <b>400</b>, the retractor handle <b>320</b> and the arcuate upper surface <b>362</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In operation, the camming pin <b>380</b> is positioned in the first position when the spacer <b>430</b> is positioned on the flat surface <b>384</b>. With the camming pin <b>380</b> in the first position, the first clamping member <b>312</b> and the second clamping member <b>316</b> can accept the retractor support arm <b>311</b> and the retractor handle <b>320</b>, respectively, and the second clamping member <b>316</b> is rotatable with respect to the first clamping member <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The first clamping member <b>312</b> is disposed in a selected position on the retractor support arm <b>311</b> by positioning the constricted entrance <b>339</b> of the clamping slot <b>338</b> proximate the retractor support arm <b>311</b>. Manual force is applied to the first clamping member <b>312</b> substantially perpendicular to an axis of the retractor support arm <b>311</b> to overcome the constricted entrance <b>339</b> of the clamping slot <b>338</b>, thereby disposing the first clamping member <b>312</b> about the retractor support arm <b>311</b>. With the canning pin <b>380</b> in the first position, the first clamping member <b>312</b> is slidably positionable on the retractor support arm <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">With the first clamping member <b>312</b> positioned on the retractor support arm <b>311</b>, the retractor handle <b>320</b> is positioned proximate the constricted entrance <b>319</b> of the opening <b>317</b> within the second clamping member <b>316</b>. Manual force is applied substantially perpendicular to an axis of the retractor handle <b>320</b> to force the end <b>402</b> of the shaft <b>400</b> from the opening <b>317</b> and position the retractor handle <b>320</b> within the opening <b>317</b>. With the retractor handle <b>320</b> positioned within the opening <b>317</b>, the compression spring <b>409</b> biases the end <b>402</b> of the shaft <b>400</b> into the opening <b>317</b> such that the retractor handle <b>320</b> is slidably retained within the second clamping surface <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">To position the camming pin <b>380</b> into the second or clamping position, a handle <b>322</b> fixedly attached to the camming pin <b>380</b> is moved in the direction of arrows <b>323</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which rotates the camming pin <b>380</b> about the first and second cylindrical portions <b>388</b>, <b>390</b>, respectively. As the camming pin <b>380</b> is rotated about the first and second cylindrical portions <b>388</b>, <b>390</b>, the spacer <b>430</b> is raised into the cavity <b>420</b> and compresses the compression spring <b>409</b>. A maximum force is placed upon the spacer <b>430</b> and shaft <b>400</b> when the camming pin <b>380</b> is positioned into the second position when the end <b>431</b> of the spacer <b>430</b> contacts the surface <b>421</b> within the cavity <b>420</b> and applies the force to the shaft <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, with the camming pin <b>380</b> in the second clamping position, a distance between the spacer <b>430</b> and the lower leg portion <b>334</b> is less than the distance between portions of the cylindrical portions <b>388</b>, <b>390</b> within the arcuate recesses <b>436</b>, <b>438</b>, respectively, and an upper edge of the camming surface <b>382</b> thereby forcing the first and second leg portions <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> apart. With the first and second leg portions <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> forced apart, the fulcrum portion <b>328</b> flexes which causes the first clamping slot <b>338</b> to constrict such that the first clamping surface <b>314</b> frictionally engages the retractor support arm <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">With the camming pin <b>380</b> in the second position, the shoulder <b>413</b> is forced into the proximal end <b>352</b> of the second clamping member <b>316</b> and creates a frictional engagement between the cooperating frusto-conical surface <b>349</b> of the through bore <b>348</b> in the upper leg portion <b>332</b> and the frusto-conical surface <b>350</b> of the second clamping member <b>316</b>. The frictional engagement of the frusto-conical surfaces <b>349</b>, <b>350</b> prevents rotational movement of the second clamping member <b>316</b> with respect to the first clamping member <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">With the camming pin <b>380</b> in the second position, the first end <b>402</b> of the shaft <b>400</b> is raised into the opening <b>417</b> through the through bore <b>372</b>.

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The retractor clamp <b>310</b> can be repositioned on the support arm <b>311</b> by first positioning the camming pin <b>380</b> into the first position such that the first clamping slot <b>338</b> is not constricted and detaching the first clamping member <b>312</b> from the retractor support arm <b>311</b>. The first clamping member <b>312</b> is detachable from the retractor support arm <b>311</b> by applying manual force in an opposite direction as used to position the first clamping member <b>312</b> on the support arm <b>311</b>. After the clamp <b>310</b> has been removed from the retractor support arm <b>311</b>, the clamp <b>310</b> is repositionable on the retractor support arm <b>311</b> by positioning an entrance <b>339</b> to the clamping slot <b>338</b> against the retractor support arm <b>311</b> and applying manual force substantially perpendicular to the axis of that portion of the retractor support arm <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The retractor handle <b>320</b> can also be repositioned within the second clamping member <b>316</b> without having to slide the retractor handle <b>320</b> with respect to the second clamping surface <b>318</b>.
