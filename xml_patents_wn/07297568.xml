In particular, the present invention relates to a three-dimensional structure using wires on the order of nanometers (referred to as nano) to micrometers formed by etching utilizing the crystallinity of silicon etc. as elements, a method for producing the same, and a device including the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, a plate or block structure composed of silicon or a structure formed by bending a metal conducting wire provides elements such as oscillators and coils.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, a tip magnetized with cobalt or iron etc. is used as a tip of an atomic force microscope to detect a magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, the present inventors have already proposed elements such as a cantilever composed of a fine three-dimensional structure in the following Patent Document 1 etc.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">[Patent Document 1]</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, with the known fine tip described above, in-process control of the magnetic force is impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a scanning temperature microscope, a loop used as the temperature sensing element is produced by hand or by nanofabrication piece by piece. Therefore, confirmation tests and multipoint measurements are difficult to achieve.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, a plate-shaped cantilever used in a known scanning force microscope within a scanning electron microscope causes the following problems: When scanning electron microscopy observation is performed perpendicularly to the sample, the cantilever blocks the observation point, so that it is difficult to observe the sample, and to identify the observation point.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is expected that miniaturization of the cantilever using a three-dimensional structure composed of silicon fine wires will improve the sensitivity in mass spectrometry and force detection. However, in this technology, damage such as crystal defects in the vicinity of the surface significantly affects the Q factor as a mechanical oscillator. Such damage in the vicinity of the surface must be reduced. In particular, when the three-dimensional structure composed of silicon fine wires is formed by reactive ion etching (anisotropic etching), the damage such as crystal defects is increased. Therefore, it is important to study etching techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In view of the above situation, it is an object of the present invention to provide a highly-reliable three-dimensional structure composed of silicon ultrafine wires, a method for producing the same, and a device including the same.</p>

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">According to a method for producing the above devices shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 6</figref>, for example, single-crystal silicon is etched with potassium hydroxide (KOH) to provide a fine wire composed of a plurality of crystal faces. An example of such a fine wire is composed of two silicon {111} surfaces and a silicon {100} surface.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Silicon single-crystals have the {111} surface and its equivalent surfaces disposed in two or more directions. Therefore, depending on the combination of the crystal faces, a fine wire having different axial directions can be produced by etching the single-crystal silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Furthermore, depending on the combination of fine wires having different orientations and fine wires parallel to each other, a one-dimensional line and various two or three-dimensional structures, such as a coil structure, a grid structure, a network structure, and an oscillator structure, can be achieved. Such a three-dimensional structure is produced using a multilayered structure composed of, for example, silicon and silicon oxide by masking appropriate areas according to whether the areas are to be etched or not.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The structures produced by the present invention can be used as a beam, a V-shaped coil, a V-shaped resistor, a grid structure, and a three-dimensionally linked structure. In any case, in known methods, these structures are made by hand or by combining plate-shaped components. In contrast, the present invention provides the following advantages: The structure can be miniaturized, a plurality of the structures can be produced at the same time, the structure can be produced with high uniformity, the structure can be produced three-dimensionally, the frequency of the structure can be increased, and oscillation loss of the structure can be decreased.</p>

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The grid structure can be used as a physical filter or a physical and chemical filter by modifying the surface thereof. In addition, the grid structure, which is a kind of sponge structure, can achieve a predetermined elasticity, and functions as a filter that selects light depending on the direction or the wavelength. Furthermore, when the structure is vibrated, the structure functions as an optical modulation element. The absorption of a specific substance can be detected as a change in vibration characteristics of the structure by combining the filter function of the specific substance with the oscillator function.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In the structure composed of fine wires, the inside of the fine wires is used as a waveguide for light or a waveguide for oscillation, thereby controlling the propagation of the light or the oscillation.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As described above, fine wires on the order of nano to micrometers can be achieved by wet etching utilizing the crystallinity of silicon etc., and a three-dimensional structure using the fine wires as elements can be achieved.

<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The present invention is not limited to the above embodiments. Various modifications can be made based on the purpose of the present invention, and those modifications are not excluded from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">As described above in detail, the present invention provides the following advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">(A) An oscillator composed of fine wires can be achieved. As a result, the oscillation direction can be limited depending on the combination of the fine wires. In addition, since the fine wires have a smooth crystal face, the oscillation loss due to the surface can be reduced. As a result, an oscillator having a high Q factor can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">(B) An oscillator composed of fine wires can be achieved. As a result, an oscillator wherein the decrease in characteristic frequency and the decrease in the Q factor are low even in a liquid can be achieved. Accordingly, an oscillator suitable for higher sensitivity and high-speed detection can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">(C) An oscillator composed of fine wires can be achieved. The oscillator can be used as a coil that can generate a magnetic field or detect a magnetic field as Lorentz force in response to a current flow.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">(D) A coil composed of fine fires can be achieved. As a result, the coil can detect the temperature-dependent resistance variation in the area where the coil is in contact with a sample. Thus, the temperature in a minute area of the sample can be measured. As a result, mapping of the temperature distribution of electronic devices and mapping of the distribution of the temperature and metabolism of biological materials can be achieved. Furthermore, since a large number of fine coils can be produced with high uniformity, confirmation tests and multipoint measurements can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">(E) A network structure can be formed using a plurality of fine wires, thereby trapping samples having a specific particle size.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">(F) A network structure can be formed using a plurality of fine wires. As a result, the network structure can achieve a filter to adsorb a specific substance by modifying the surface thereof. This filter has chemical and physical selectivity.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">(G) A network structure can be formed using a plurality of fine wires to function as an elastic body as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">(H) A network structure can be formed using a plurality of fine wires, thereby achieving a three-dimensional optical filter, a grating, and a shielding window. A three-dimensional structure having a regular shape can be achieved, and therefore, selectivity depending on the direction and the wavelength can be obtained. An optical modulation element can be achieved by vibrating the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">(I) A network structure can be formed using a plurality of fine wires. This network structure forms a resistor having a grid shape to achieve an electrical circuit network. The electrical circuit network having the network structure can be achieved, thereby realizing a fine three-dimensional body that can perform three-dimensional sensing.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">(J) A structure of up to three-dimensions can be formed using a plurality of fine wires. A tip or a block can be formed at an intersection of the fine wires by wet etching. The tip or the block can be used as a probe or a mass, thereby providing a structure having predetermined vibration characteristics. As a result, this structure can control the vibration characteristics, which can normally be controlled only with a macroscopic structure or a handmade three-dimensional structure. Furthermore, this structure provides a high Q factor and high design flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">(K) A cantilever composed of fine wires and a tip used in a scanning probe microscope can be formed. In optical microscopy or scanning electron microscopy performed perpendicularly with respect to a sample, even the close vicinity of the tip can be directly observed using this cantilever. As a result, the relationship between the relative positions of microscope images can be obtained and each microscopy can be performed more readily.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">In other words, the following can be achieved: (1) the generation of a magnetic field and the detection of a magnetic field by realizing a fine coil, and the improvement in detection sensitivity by modulating the current flowing in the coil; (2) temperature measurement and mapping by realizing a fine resistor; (3) the detection of mass and force on the atomic level by the achievement of a fine oscillator; (4) the achievement of an oscillator having a low oscillation loss and a low decease in frequency in liquid by realizing a fine oscillator, and the improvement of the sensitivity and increase in the frequency thereby; (5) physical and chemical filtering functions by a fine three-dimensional structure; (6) the achievement of an optical element composed of a fine three-dimensional structure; (7) a scanning probe microscope within an optical microscope or a scanning electron microscope wherein the field of view is not easily blocked; and (8) the improvement of confirmation test reliability and the achievement of multipoint measurements as a result of the production, with high uniformity, of a large number of the various structures or sensing elements mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">(L) In the present invention, singly-supported beams composed of silicon fine wires that suffer no damage such as crystal defects can be formed by utilizing the crystallinity of silicon, in contrast to a known method in which singly-supported beams are formed by anisotropic etching (such as RIE) regardless of the crystallinity of silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">(M) Singly-supported beams in which proximal ends of the fine wires functioning as probes have different shapes on the two lateral sides of each fine wire are provided. Such singly-supported beams can be produced inexpensively by a simple process that omits a step of forming a silicon oxide film. These singly-supported beams have a durable structure because the proximal ends of the singly-supported beams have an asymmetrical shape. Accordingly, singly-supported beams having durability against aging, not being easily broken, and utilizing the crystallinity of silicon can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">(N) Singly-supported beams having excellent probe characteristics and the same length can be readily formed.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">(O) Singly-supported beams having excellent probe characteristics and different length can be readily formed.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">(P) Doubly-supported beams composed of silicon fine wires that suffer no damage such as crystal defects can be formed by utilizing the crystallinity of silicon, in contrast to a known method in which doubly-supported beams are formed by anisotropic etching (such as RIE) regardless of the crystallinity of silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">(Q) Doubly-supported beams in which the proximal ends of the fine wires functioning as probes have different shapes on the two lateral sides of each fine wire are provided. These doubly-supported beams have a durable structure because the proximal ends of each doubly-supported beam have an asymmetrical shape. Accordingly, doubly-supported beams having durability against aging, not being easily broken, and utilizing the crystallinity of silicon can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">(R) Doubly-supported beams having excellent probe characteristics and the same length can be readily formed.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">(S) Doubly-supported beams having excellent probe characteristics and different length can be readily formed.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">(T) A three-dimensional structure including singly-supported beams or doubly-supported beams composed of silicon fine wires, and having excellent probe characteristics can be produced.</p>
