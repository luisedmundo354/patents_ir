<p id="p-0003" num="0001">This application is the national phase under 35 U.S.C. § 371 of PCT International Application No. PCT/JP02/02845 which has an International filing date of Mar. 25, 2002, which designated the United States of America.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to ionic liquids, electrolyte salts for electrical storage devices, liquid electrolytes for electrical storage devices, electrical double-layer capacitors, and secondary batteries.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">An ionic compound generally forms crystals in which positively charged cations and negatively charged anions pull electrostatically against each other. When this ionic compound is dissolved in various other liquids, including water, it provides a liquid that carries electricity; that is, an electrolyte solution. Electrolyte solutions obtained by dissolving an ionic compound in an organic solvent are commonly used in, for example, nonaqueous electrolyte batteries and capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Some ionic compounds, when the temperature is raised, undergo activation of thermal motion to such an extent as to overcome the ionic interactions, causing the compound itself to become liquid and capable of carrying electricity. A salt in such a state is generally referred to as a “molten salt.”</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">The chemical species present in the molten salt are all charged cations or anions; no neutral atoms or molecules are present. Therefore, elements which cannot be obtained from an aqueous electrolyte solution because they have too large a reducing or oxidizing power with respect to water, including metals such as alkali metals, aluminum and rare-earth elements, and non-metals such as fluorine, can be electrolyzed in a molten salt and obtained in elemental form. This has become a main industrial application of molten salts.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Some such molten salts maintain a liquid state at room temperature and do not solidify even at very low temperatures. Such molten salts which maintain a liquid state at room temperature or lower are referred to in particular as “room-temperature molten salts” or “ionic liquids.” To minimize electrostatic interactions between the cations and anions which make up the ionic liquid, either or both are molecular ions of a substantial size, and are moreover monovalent to minimize the charge and electrostatic interactions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">Research is actively being pursued on applications for such ionic liquids in electrolytic deposition and in electrolytes for batteries and other purposes. However, because ionic liquids generally have a high moisture absorption and are difficult to handle in air, such applications has yet to be fully realized.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">In light of the above, the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate reported by Wilkes et al. in 1992 is a remarkable ionic liquid that can be handled even in air. This new ionic liquid led to the synthesis of many ionic liquids which are combinations of numerous alkylimidazolium cations having different side chains with various anions. Although the properties and applications for these ionic liquids are being actively investigated, there exists a desire for the development of various ionic liquids that can be more conveniently produced and are easy to handle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">Nonaqueous liquid electrolyte-type electrical double-layer capacitors can be charged and discharged at a high current, and thus hold considerable promise as energy storage devices for such applications as electrical cars and auxiliary power supplies.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">Prior-art nonaqueous liquid electrolyte-type electrical double-layer capacitors are constructed of positive and negative polarizable electrodes made primarily of a carbonaceous material such as activated carbon and a nonaqueous electrolyte solution. The composition of the nonaqueous electrolyte solution is known to have a large influence on the withstand voltage and electrostatic capacitance of the capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">The nonaqueous electrolyte solution is composed of an electrolyte salt and a nonaqueous organic solvent. Studies have been conducted on various combinations of such electrolyte salts and nonaqueous organic solvents.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">For example, quaternary ammonium salts (e.g., JP-A 61-32509, JP-A 63-173312, JP-A 10-55717) and quaternary phosphonium salts (e.g., JP-A 62-252927) are commonly used as the electrolyte salt because of their solubility and degree of dissociation in organic solvents, as well as their broad electrochemical stability range. Organic solvents that are commonly used on account of their high dielectric constant, broad electrochemical stability range and high boiling point include ethylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate, propylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, γ-butyrolactone, acetonitrile and sulfolane.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">However, in nonaqueous electrolyte-type electrical double-layer capacitors currently in use, the inadequate solubility of electrolyte salts (e.g., quaternary ammonium salts, quaternary phosphonium salts) in organic solvents commonly used for this purpose limits the amount of salt that can be added, resulting in nonaqueous electrolyte solutions of lower ionic conductivity and electrical double-layer capacitors of lower electrostatic capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">Moreover, because the electrolyte salts have a low solubility, they tend to crystallize at low temperatures, compromising the low-temperature characteristics of the electrical double-layer capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">In light of these circumstances, the objects of the invention are to provide ionic liquids which can be easily and efficiently produced, electrolyte salts for electrical storage devices which have excellent solubility in organic solvents for nonaqueous electrolyte solutions and have a low melting point, liquid electrolytes for electrical storage devices which include these electrolyte salts, and also electrical double-layer capacitors and secondary batteries of excellent low-temperature properties which are constructed using such liquid electrolytes.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">We have conducted extensive investigations aimed at achieving the above objects, as a result of which we have discovered that some quaternary ammonium salts and quaternary phosphonium salts bearing at least one alkoxyalkyl substituent have low melting points and excellent characteristics as ionic liquids.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">Moreover, we have found that, because quaternary ammonium salts and quaternary phosphonium salts bearing at least one alkoxyalkyl substituent have excellent solubility in nonaqueous organic solvents used in electrical storage devices and also have a low melting point, liquid electrolytes prepared using such quaternary salts can be obtained to a higher concentration than previously possible and are less likely to result in deposition of the electrolyte salt at low temperatures. We have also found that electrical double-layer capacitors manufactured using such liquid electrolytes have a high electrostatic capacitance and excellent low-temperature characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">Accordingly, the present invention provides the following.

<p id="p-0051" num="0079">A common method for synthesizing the above quaternary ammonium salts is described. First, a tertiary amine is mixed with a compound such as an alkyl halide or a dialkyl sulfate. If necessary, the mixture is heated, giving a quaternary ammonium halide. Reaction under applied pressure, such as in an autoclave, is preferred when using a compound having low reactivity, such as an alkoxyethyl halide or an alkoxymethyl halide.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0080">The resulting quaternary ammonium halide is dissolved in an aqueous solvent such as water and reacted with a reagent that generates the required anionic species, such as tetrafluoroboric acid or tetrafluorophosphoric acid, to effect an anion exchange reaction, thereby yielding the quaternary ammonium salt of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0081">In one illustrative method for synthesizing quaternary ammonium tetrafluoroborates, a quaternary ammonium halide is dissolved in water, silver oxide is added and a salt exchange reaction is carried out to form the corresponding quaternary ammonium hydroxide. The product is then reacted with tetrafluoroboric acid, yielding the target compound. This method is effective for synthesizing high-purity quaternary ammonium tetrafluoroborates because the silver halide that forms as a result of salt exchange during formation of the quaternary ammonium hydroxide can easily be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0082">Quaternary phosphonium salts can generally be synthesized in much the same way as quaternary ammonium salts. Typically, a tertiary phosphine is mixed with a suitable compound such as an alkyl halide or a dialkyl sulfate. If necessary, the reaction is carried out under the application of heat.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0083">As in the case of quaternary ammonium salts, quaternary phosphonium salts containing various different anions may be prepared by dissolving a quaternary phosphonium halide (a chloride, bromide or iodide) in an aqueous solvent and reacting the dissolved halide with a reagent that generates the required anionic species so as to effect an anion exchange reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0084">To discourage deposition of the electrolyte salt when an electrolyte solution of the salt dissolved in a nonaqueous organic solvent is placed under low-temperature conditions, it is preferable for the electrolyte salt to have a melting point not higher than 25° C., and preferably not higher than 15° C. An electrolyte salt having a melting point higher than 25° C. deposits out of the solvent at low temperatures, and is thus more likely to lower the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte solution and in turn reduce the amount of electricity that can be drawn from the electrical storage device. The melting point is not subject to any lower limit, although a lower melting point is better.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0091">The monovalent anion Y in the ionic liquid of above general formulas (1) and (2) is exemplified by the same monovalent anions as mentioned above for electrolyte salts.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0092">Specific examples of ionic liquids include compounds of above formulas (3) to (11). The ionic liquids of formulas (3) and (8) are especially preferred because they are easy to handle and they enable electrical storage devices having excellent low-temperature characteristics to be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0093">The ionic liquid may be prepared in the same way as described above for the electrolyte salt.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0094">The ionic liquids of the invention have numerous desirable features. That is, they (1) have a vapor pressure that is either non-existent or very low, (2) are non-flammable or flame-retarding, (3) have ionic conductivity, (4) have a higher decomposition voltage than water, (5) have a broader liquid temperature range than water, (6) can be handled in air, and (7) have a broader potential window than organic ionic liquids known to the prior art. In particular, when an ionic liquid is used in an electrical storage device, if the potential window is narrow, the electrolyte or electrolyte solution may undergo oxidative decomposition or reductive decomposition. Imidazolium-type ionic liquids have a narrow potential window, and so cannot be used in lithium ion secondary battery systems. However, as noted above, the ionic liquids of this invention have a broad potential window, enabling them to be used in lithium ion secondary batteries as well.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0095">Accordingly, the inventive ionic liquids can be advantageously used as novel electrolytes capable of functioning at temperatures below room temperature in the electrodeposition of metals and alloys, in electroplating baths, and in electrochemical devices for storing energy, such as various types of batteries and capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0096">Most reaction solvents that are widely used in organic synthesis, such as benzene, methylene chloride and ether, are volatile substances having carcinogenicity. Yet, the ionic liquids of this invention have very low volatilities and also lend themselves well to use as repeatedly reusable reaction solvents for organic synthesis. Hence, they are capable of contributing also to the field of “green chemistry” which is developing new synthetic processes that are less burdensome on the environment.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Liquid Electrolyte for Electrical Storage Devices</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0097">The inventive liquid electrolytes for electrical storage devices may be used in any of the following forms: (1) liquid electrolytes consisting solely of the above-described ionic liquids or low-melting electrolyte salts for electrical storage devices (i.e., liquid electrolytes in which a nonaqueous organic solvent is not used), (2) electrolyte solutions obtained by adding an ion-conductive salt to above liquid electrolyte (1) (here too, a nonaqueous organic solvent is not used in the liquid electrolyte), (3) electrolyte solutions obtained by adding also a nonaqueous organic solvent to above electrolyte solution (2), and (4) electrolyte solutions containing at least one of the above-described ionic liquids or electrolytes for electrical storage devices in combination with a nonaqueous organic solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0098">Any nonaqueous organic solvent which is capable of dissolving the above-described ionic liquid or electrolyte salt and is stable within the working voltage range for electrical storage devices such as secondary batteries and electrical double-layer capacitors may be used without particular limitation. However, it is preferable for the nonaqueous organic solvent to be one having a large dielectric constant, a broad electrochemical stability range, a broad service temperature range and excellent safety.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0099">Illustrative examples of suitable solvents include acyclic ethers such as dibutyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-ethoxymethoxyethane, methyl diglyme, methyl triglyme, methyl tetraglyme, ethyl glyme, ethyl diglyme, butyl diglyme, and glycol ethers (e.g., ethyl cellosolve, ethyl carbitol, butyl cellosolve, butyl carbitol); cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, 1,3-dioxolane and 4,4-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane; butyrolactones such as γ-butyrolactone, γ-valerolactone, δ-valerolactone, 3-methyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one and 3-ethyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one; and solvents commonly used in electrochemical devices, such as amide solvents (e.g., N-methylformamide, N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone), carbonate solvents (e.g., diethyl carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate, propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, styrene carbonate), and imidazolidinone solvents (e.g., 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone). Any one or mixtures of two or more of these solvents may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0100">The use of a mixed solvent which includes as a main component ethylene carbonate or propylene carbonate, or of one or a mixture of two or more solvents selected from among ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, vinylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate and diethyl carbonate, is preferred.</p>

At a concentration of less than 0.1 mol/L, energy loss may rise due to increased internal resistance. On the other hand, at a concentration higher than 5.0 mol/L, if the electrolyte salt has a low solubility and a relatively high melting point, undesirable effects may arise at low temperatures, such as deposition of the salt and a decline in stability.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0102">Because the electrolyte salts for electrical storage devices of the invention have a better solubility in nonaqueous organic solvents than conventional electrolyte salts and have a melting point no higher than 25° C., the electrolyte salt does not readily deposit out of solution at low temperatures even when used at a higher electrolyte salt concentration than is normally the practice.</p>

<p id="p-0159" num="0203">Preferred examples of fluoropolymer materials that may be used as the above-mentioned type (IV) binder polymer include polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene copolymers (P(VDF-HFP)) and vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymers (P(VDF-CTFE)). Of these, fluoropolymers having a vinylidene fluoride content of preferably at least 50 wt %, and most preferably at least 70 wt %, are especially desirable. The upper limit in the vinylidene fluoride content of the fluoropolymer is preferably about 97 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0204">No particular limitation is imposed on the weight-average molecular weight of the fluoropolymer, although the weight-average molecular weight is preferably from 500,000 to 2,000,000, and most preferably from 500,000 to 1,500,000. Too low a weight-average molecular weight may result in an excessive decline in physical strength.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0205">The polarizable electrode composition can be produced by charging a mixer with a binder solution prepared from the above-described carbonaceous material (which includes, if necessary, a conductive material), a binder polymer and, optionally, a solvent, then wet mixing.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0206">The amount of binder polymer added is preferably 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, and most preferably 1 to 10 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the carbonaceous material.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0207">The polarizable electrode composition prepared as described above is coated onto a current conductor, thereby forming a polarizable electrode. Any positive and negative electrode current collectors commonly used in electrical double-layer capacitors may be selected and used, although the positive electrode current collector is preferably aluminum foil or aluminum oxide and the negative electrode current collector is preferably copper foil, nickel foil, or a metal foil whose surface is formed of a film of plated copper or nickel.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0208">The foils making up the respective current collectors may be in any of various shapes, including thin foils, flat sheets, and perforated, stampable sheets. The foil has a thickness of generally about 1 to 200 μm. For optimal characteristics, such as density of the carbonaceous material as a portion of the overall electrode and electrode strength, a thickness of 8 to 100 μm, and especially 8 to 30 μm, is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0209">The polarizable electrode can be produced by melting and blending the polarizable electrode composition, then extruding the blend as a film.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0210">The separator referred to above may be of a type that is commonly used in electrical double-layer capacitors. Illustrative examples include (1) separators produced by impregnating a separator base with a liquid electrolyte, (2) separators produced by shaping the polymer binder used in the polarizable electrode as a film, and (3) separators composed of a gel electrolyte film produced by shaping a thermoplastic resin having a swelling ratio, as determined by the formula indicated above, within a range of 150 to 800%, then impregnating the resin with a liquid electrolyte so as to induce it to swell. The liquid electrolyte used for this purpose may be any of the various types of above-mentioned liquid electrolytes for electrical storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0211">The separator base used in type (1) separators may be one that is commonly used in electrical double-layer capacitors. Illustrative examples include polyolefin nonwoven fabric, polytetrafluoroethylene porous film, kraft paper, sheet laid from a blend of rayon fibers and sisal fibers, manila hemp sheet, glass fiber sheet, cellulose-based electrolytic paper, paper made from rayon fibers, paper made from a blend of cellulose and glass fibers, and combinations thereof in the form of multilayer sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0212">Other types of separators that may be used include (2) separators produced by shaping the polymer binder used in the polarizable electrodes as a film, and (3) separators composed of a gel electrolyte film obtained by shaping a thermoplastic resin having a swelling ratio, as determined by the formula indicated above, within a range of 150 to 800%, then impregnating the resin with a liquid electrolyte so as to induce it to swell.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0213">Because such separators have the same composition as the polymer binder (thermoplastic resin) used in the electrodes, the electrode/separator interface can be integrally united and controlled, making it possible to further lower the internal resistance of the capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0214">The electrical double-layer capacitor of the invention can be assembled by stacking, fan-folding or winding an electrical double-layer capacitor assembly composed of a pair of polarizable electrodes produced as described above and a separator therebetween. The cell assembly is formed into a coin-like shape, then placed within a capacitor housing such as a can or a laminate pack. The assembly is then filled with the liquid electrolyte, following which the housing is mechanically sealed if it is a can or heat-sealed if it is a laminate pack.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0215">Because the electrical double-layer capacitors of the invention use the quaternary ammonium salt or quaternary phosphonium salt of general formula (1) above as the electrolyte, the ionic conductivity is higher than in prior-art electrical double-layer capacitors, in addition to which the capacitors have a high electrostatic capacitance, excellent low-temperature characteristics and a broad potential window. Moreover, the use of low-impedance polarizable electrodes like those described above makes it possible to endow the capacitor with a high power density and energy density.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0216">Because they are endowed with such characteristics, the electrical double-layer capacitors of the invention are highly suitable for use as a memory backup power supply for cellular phones, notebook computers and wireless terminals, as a power supply for cellular phones and portable acoustic devices, as an uninterruptible power supply for personal computers and other equipment, and as various types of low-current electrical storage devices such as load leveling power supplies used in combination with solar power generation and wind power generation. Moreover, electrical double-layer capacitors capable of being charged and discharged at a high current are highly suitable for use as high-current electrical storage devices in such applications as electric cars and electrical power tools.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Secondary Batteries</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0217">The secondary battery of the invention has a positive electrode and a negative electrode, a separator between the positive and negative electrodes, and an electrolyte solution. The electrolyte solution is any of the above-mentioned liquid electrolytes for electrical storage devices to which has been added an ion-conductive salt (liquid electrolytes (2) and (3) described under Liquid Electrolytes for Electrical Storage Devices).</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0218">The positive electrode active material making up the positive electrode is suitably selected in accordance with the intended use of the electrode, the type of battery and other considerations. For example, in the case of positive electrodes in lithium secondary cells and lithium ion secondary cells, use can be made of chalcogen compounds capable of occluding and releasing lithium ions, and lithium ion-containing chalcogen compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0219">Examples of such chalcogen compounds capable of occluding and releasing lithium ions include FeS<sub>2</sub>, TiS<sub>2</sub>, MoS<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, V<sub>6</sub>O<sub>13 </sub>and MnO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0220">Specific examples of lithium ion-containing chalcogen compounds include LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, LiMnO<sub>2</sub>, LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, LiMo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, LiV<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, LiNiO<sub>2 </sub>and Li<sub>x</sub>Ni<sub>y</sub>M<sub>1-y</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(wherein M is one or more metal element selected from among cobalt, manganese, titanium, chromium, vanadium, aluminum, tin, lead and zinc; 0.05≦x≦1.10; and 0.5≦y≦1.0).</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0221">The negative electrode active material making up the negative electrode is suitably selected in accordance with the intended use of the electrode, the type of battery and other considerations. For example, in the case of negative electrodes in lithium secondary cells and lithium ion secondary cells, use can be made of alkali metals, alkali metal alloys, oxides, sulfides or nitrides of at least one element selected from among group 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 elements of the periodic table capable of reversibly occluding and releasing lithium ions, and carbonaceous materials capable of occluding and releasing lithium ions.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0222">Examples of suitable alkali metals include lithium, sodium and potassium. Examples of suitable alkali metal alloys include metallic lithium, Li—Al, Li—Mg, Li—Al—Ni, sodium, Na—Hg and Na—Zn.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0223">Illustrative examples of the oxides of at least one element selected from periodic table group 8 to 15 elements capable of occluding and releasing lithium ions include tin silicon oxide (SnSiO<sub>3</sub>), lithium bismuth oxide (Li<sub>3</sub>BiO<sub>4</sub>) and lithium zinc oxide (Li<sub>2</sub>ZnO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0224">Illustrative examples of the sulfides include lithium iron sulfides Li<sub>x</sub>FeS<sub>2 </sub>(wherein 0≦x≦3) and lithium copper sulfides Li<sub>x</sub>CuS (wherein 0≦x≦3).</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0225">Illustrative examples of the nitrides include lithium-containing transition metal nitrides, and specifically LI<sub>x</sub>M<sub>y</sub>N (wherein M is cobalt, nickel or copper; 0≦x≦3; and 0≦y≦0.5) and lithium iron nitride (Li<sub>3</sub>FeN<sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0226">Examples of carbonaceous materials which are capable of reversibly occluding and releasing lithium ions include graphite, carbon black, coke, glassy carbon, carbon fibers, and sintered bodies obtained from any of these.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0227">The binder polymer and separator which make up the positive and negative electrodes are the same as those described above for electrical double-layer capacitors. Ion-conductive salts that may be used are the conductive salts described above under Liquid Electrolytes for Electrical Storage Devices.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0228">The secondary battery described above can be assembled by stacking, fan-folding or winding a cell assembly composed of a positive electrode and a negative electrode with a separator therebetween. The cell assembly is formed into a coin-like shape, then placed within a battery housing such as a can or a laminate pack. The assembly is then filled with the electrolyte solution, following which the housing is mechanically sealed if it is a can or heat-sealed if it is a laminate pack.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0229">If necessary, a reaction-curable substance such as a (meth)acrylate, an epoxy group-bearing compound or a heat-curable urethane can be added to the electrolyte solution and a reaction carried out to effect curing.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0230">Electrolyte solutions (2) and (3) described above under Liquid Electrolytes can also be used in hybrid-type electrical storage devices in which the positive or negative electrode is a polarizable electrode such as is commonly used in electrical double-layer capacitors and the other, opposing, electrode is an electrode in which the active material is a substance capable of the insertion and extraction of lithium ions, such as is commonly used in lithium ion secondary batteries.</p>

<p id="p-0189" num="0233">A mixed solution prepared by mixing together 100 ml of diethylamine (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) and 85 ml of 2-methoxyethyl chloride (Kanto Chemical) was placed in an autoclave and reacted at 100° C. for 24 hours. The internal pressure during the reaction was 1.3 kgf/cm<sup>2</sup>. After 24 hours, 200 ml of an aqueous solution containing 56 g of potassium hydroxide (Katayama Chemical Inc.) was added to the resulting mixture of deposited crystals and reaction solution. The two organic phases that formed as a result were separated off with a separatory funnel and subjected twice to extraction with 100 ml of methylene chloride (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). The separated organic phases were then combined and washed with a saturated saline solution, following which potassium carbonate (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) was added to remove water, and vacuum filtration was carried out. The solvent in the resulting organic phase was distilled off in a rotary evaporator, following which the residue was subjected to normal-pressure distillation, yielding 18.9 g of a fraction that boiled at about 135° C. This compound was confirmed from the <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum to be 2-methoxyethyldiethylamine.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0234">Next, 8.24 g of the 2-methoxyethyldiethylamine was dissolved in 10 ml of tetrahydrofuran (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), following which 4.0 ml of methyl iodide (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) was added under ice cooling. After 30 minutes, the mixture was removed from the ice bath and stirred overnight at room temperature. The solvent in the resulting reaction mixture was then driven off by vacuum distillation, and the resulting solids were recrystallized from an ethanol (Wako Pure Chemical Industries)-tetrahydrofuran system, yielding 16 g of 2-methoxyethyldiethylmethylammonium iodide.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0235">Next, 15.0 g of the 2-methoxyethyldiethylmethyl-ammonium iodide was dissolved in 100 ml of distilled water, following which 6.37 g of silver oxide (Kanto Chemical) was added and stirring was carried out for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was then vacuum filtered to remove the precipitate, following which 42% tetrafluoroboric acid (Kanto Chemical) was gradually added under stirring until the reaction solution reached a pH of about 5 to 6. The reaction solution was subsequently freeze-dried, in addition to which water was thoroughly driven off using a vacuum pump, ultimately yielding 12.39 g of a compound (3) that was liquid at room temperature (25° C.).</p>

<p id="p-0228" num="0272">Moreover, although the salt concentrations in Examples 1 to 5 were higher than in the comparative examples, deposition of the electrolyte salt did not occur. As a result, the ionic conductivities were higher than in Comparative Example 2, demonstrating the usefulness of these capacitors because a greater amount of electrical energy can be drawn at low temperatures. In Comparative Example 1, the electrolyte salt settled out of the electrolyte solution, rendering measurement of the ionic conductivity impossible.</p>

<p id="p-0241" num="0285">The following cycle was carried out three times. Charging at 10 mA and 2.5 V to a current cutoff of 1 mA (25° C.), one hour of rest (25° C.), then discharging at 10 mA to a discharge cutoff of 0.0V (25° C.).</p>
<p id="h-0045" num="0000">(2) Discharge Properties by Temperature</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0286">Charging was carried out at 10 mA and 2.5 V to a current cutoff of 1 mA (x° C.), followed by six hours of rest (x° C.), then discharging at 10 mA to a discharge cutoff of 0.0 V (x° C.). The temperature values (x) were −20.0, 0.0, 25.0, 40.0 and 60.0.</p>
<p id="h-0046" num="0000">(3) Self-Discharge Properties</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0287">Charging was carried out at 10 mA and 2.5 V to a current cutoff of 1 mA (25° C.), following which the capacitor was held at 60.0° C.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0288">The results of the above electrical tests are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0289">It is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> that the electrical double-layer capacitor obtained in Example 8 according to the invention achieves substantially the same amount of electricity as the capacitor obtained in the comparative example.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0290"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows that the electrical double-layer capacitor obtained in Example 8 of the invention does not readily achieve a discharge capacitance on the low-temperature side, but achieves a good discharge capacitance on the high-temperature side.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0291"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows that the electrical double-layer capacitors obtained in Example 8 of the invention and Comparative Example 3 also have comparable self-discharge properties.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0292">It is thus apparent that even when an ionic liquid is used by itself as the liquid electrolyte, an electrical double-layer capacitor having a performance comparable to that obtained using a conventional organic electrolyte solution can be obtained. Accordingly, from the standpoint of cost and safety, such ionic liquids can be used by themselves as useful liquid electrolytes for electrical storage devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0047" level="1">Example 9</heading>
<p id="h-0048" num="0000">Secondary Battery</p>
<p id="h-0049" num="0000">(1) Preparation of Electrolyte Solution</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0293">An electrolyte solution was prepared by mixing and dissolving 29.2 parts by weight of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in 70.8 parts by weight of the quaternary salt (ionic liquid) obtained in Synthesis Example 6.</p>
<p id="h-0050" num="0000">(2) Production of Positive Electrode</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0294">A paste-like positive electrode composition was prepared by stirring together and mixing the following: 91 parts by weight of LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>as the positive electrode active material, 3 parts by weight of Ketjenblack as the conductive material, 60 parts by weight of a solution of 10 parts by weight of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) dissolved in 90 parts by weight of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and 15 parts by weight of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0295">The positive electrode composition was applied onto aluminum foil with a doctor blade to a film thickness when dry of 100 μm. This was followed by 2 hours of drying at 80° C., then rolling to give a LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>positive electrode.</p>
<p id="h-0051" num="0000">(3) Production of Lithium Secondary Battery</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0296">The positive electrode obtained as described above and metallic lithium as the negative electrode were each cut to a diameter of 12 mm, a polyolefin porous membrane (E25MMS, made by Tonen Tapyrus Co., Ltd.) was placed as the separator between the above 12 mm diameter positive and negative electrodes, and the electrolyte solution prepared as described above was poured and impregnated therein to form a coin-type lithium secondary cell.</p>
<heading id="h-0052" level="1">Example 10</heading>
<p id="h-0053" num="0000">Secondary Battery</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0297">Aside from using an electrolyte solution prepared by mixing and dissolving 90.6 parts by weight of the quaternary salt (ionic liquid) obtained in Synthesis Example 1 and 9.4 parts by weight of lithium tetrafluoroborate, a coin-type lithium secondary battery was manufactured in the same way as in Example 9.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0298">The secondary batteries obtained in above Examples 9 and 10 were subjected to a charge/discharge test in which the upper limit voltage during charging was set at 4.2 V, the voltage cutoff during discharge was set at 3 V, and the current density was 0.025 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. The test was carried out by constant-current low-voltage charging and constant-current discharging.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0299">The discharge capacity, based on LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>in the secondary battery in Example 9, was found to be 117.8 mAh/g, and the discharge capacity based on LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>in Example 10 was 115.4 mAh/g. Both are adequate values as lithium secondary batteries. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a graph of the charge/discharge properties for the secondary battery obtained in Example 9.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0300">As described above, because the electrolyte salt for electrical storage devices according to the invention is a quaternary ammonium salt or quaternary phosphonium salt having at least one alkoxyalkyl group as a substituent thereon, it has a low melting point and excellent solubility in nonaqueous organic solvents. Thus, when liquid electrolytes for electrical storage devices are prepared using these quaternary salts, the liquid electrolyte can be set to a higher concentration than in the prior art and the electrolyte salt does not deposit out at low temperatures. As a result, there can be obtained electrical storage devices (e.g., secondary batteries and electrical double-layer capacitors, as well as other types of capacitors) which have excellent low-temperature properties and have both a high charge/discharge capacitance and a high electrostatic capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0301">Because the ionic liquids of the invention are easy to manufacture and handle, and have a broader potential window than organic ionic liquids known to the prior art, they lend themselves well to use as novel electrolytes capable of functioning at temperatures below room temperature in the electrodeposition of metals and alloys, in electroplating, and in electrochemical devices for storing energy, such as various types of batteries and capacitors.</p>
