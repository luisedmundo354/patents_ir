<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A delta-sigma modulator having predictive-controlled power consumption provides for reduced power consumption in analog-to-digital converters. The initial integrator stage of the delta-sigma modulator has a bias control input, which controls the level of power consumed by the integrator. The bias control input is coupled to a predictor circuit that predicts the level of change at the output of the integrator for the sample cycle. The predictor circuit may use changes in the output of the modulator quantizer alone or in combination with measured changes in the input signal in order to predict the level of change in the integrator output. The quantizer output may be differentiated to remove low frequency components and thereby provide the predictive input from the quantizer. Alternatively, steps in the quantizer output computed by differences may be used directly.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to delta-sigma modulators/converters, and more specifically, to power consumption control in a delta-sigma modulator.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Delta-sigma modulators are in widespread use in analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs), in which they provide very linear behavior and simple implementation due to the reduced number of bits used in the analog signal comparison. Delta-sigma modulators can be implemented with a high level of control of the frequency distribution of “quantization noise”, which is the difference between the ideal output value of the modulator as determined by the input signal and the actual output of the modulator provided by a quantizer. The relative simplicity of the architecture and the ability to finely control the quantization noise makes delta-sigma converter implementations very desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Power consumption in delta-sigma designs is usually dominated by the current requirements of the amplifier in the first integrator stage of the modulator loop filter. The feedback correction signal provided at the input of the first integrator stage contains large magnitude high frequency components. The analog input signal may also contain such high frequency components. The change in the integrator output over a sampling interval is proportionate to the difference between the input signal and feedback correction/noise-shaping signal for that interval. Therefore, the output current capability of the first amplifier must be sufficient to handle the rate of charging of the integrator capacitor for any possible slope (for continuous-time integrators) or step (for discrete-time integrators). Since the changes at subsequent stages of the integrator are dependent on already-integrated versions of the quantizer output, the changes at those integrators are typically smaller. Consequently, the first integrator stage amplifier is typically dominant in the modulator power requirement.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is generally desirable to lower circuit power requirements, in particular in battery-operated equipment, but in general for reduced heat generation and power supply requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a delta-sigma modulator having reduced power requirements.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above stated objective of reducing the power requirement of a delta-sigma modulator is achieved in a delta-sigma modulator circuit and its method of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The delta-sigma modulator includes a bias control circuit that controls power supply current through the first integrator amplifier, generally by adjusting a bias of a current sink or by selecting among a plurality of current sinks in line with the power supply connections of the amplifier. The bias control circuit controls the power supply current level proportionate with a predicted change in the output of the first integrator for the sampling cycle, so that the amplifier response is increased when needed, i.e., when the integrator change is large for a given operating cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The bias control circuit predicts the change at the output of the integrator in operational dependence on the quantizer output of the delta-sigma modulator, and optionally in dependence on the delta-sigma modulator input signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The foregoing and other objectives, features, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following, more particular, description of the preferred embodiment of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention encompasses a method and apparatus for reducing power consumption in a delta-sigma modulator. The method is a method of operation of a delta-sigma modulator circuit that embodies the invention. Power consumption is controlled by controlling the power supply current through the amplifier that implements the first integrator of the delta-sigma modulator loop filter. A bias control circuit controls the power supply current by switching among different-valued current sources or setting an analog bias signal that controls a power supply current sink or source. Alternatively, the power consumption of the amplifier may be controlled by setting internal bias points of the amplifier. Examples of such amplifiers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,653,886, 6,249,236 and 6,369,745, which are incorporated herein by reference. Specific applicable embodiments of power-consumption-controlled integrators will be disclosed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The bias control circuit predicts a change in the output of the first integrator and alters the bias current in proportion to the change, so that the first integrator's amplifier current-sourcing capability is improved for samples requiring a larger magnitude integrator output slope or step. A larger slope/step requires more charging current into the integrator capacitor and other connected devices. The resulting operation maintains the responsiveness of the delta-sigma modulator, while reducing power consumption overall, since power supply current is reduced when a large change in the integrator output is not occurring.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a circuit in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown. A noise shaping delta-sigma modulator <b>10</b> has an input IN and provides a noise-shaped output from a quantizer <b>14</b>. The output is applied to a digital low-pass filter <b>18</b>, thereby providing a digital output OUT corresponding to the analog input IN. Thus, the depicted circuit forms an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). However, the techniques of the present invention apply to any delta-sigma modulator and to integrating measurement circuits in general.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Delta-sigma modulator <b>10</b> implements a noise shaper using a series of analog integrator stages <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C that each receive an input signal from the previous stage. The outputs of integrators <b>11</b> are scaled by scaling circuits <b>12</b>B-<b>12</b>D and are combined with the input signal scaled by scaling circuit <b>12</b>A. The scaled input and integrator output signals are combined by a combiner <b>13</b>, forming a third-order feed-forward loop filter. Combiner <b>13</b> may be a summing amplifier, and scaling circuits <b>12</b>A-D may be resistors that set the gain of the summing amplifier with respect to the output of each integrator <b>11</b>. Alternatively, for switched-capacitor implementations, scaling circuits <b>12</b> will generally be the input charge-transfer capacitors and associated switching circuits. Quantizer <b>14</b> receives the output of combiner <b>13</b> and provides feedback to the integrator stages through a coarse digital-to-analog converter (DAC) <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A bias control circuit <b>20</b>A is integrated within delta-sigma modulator <b>10</b> and provides control of the power consumption level of integrator <b>11</b>A. A digital bias scaling circuit <b>22</b>, which may be a set of selectable current sinks connected directly to a power supply terminal of integrator <b>11</b>A or a DAC that provides an analog bias control signal to integrator <b>11</b>A, receives an input that predicts the change in the output of integrator <b>11</b>A during the next sample cycle of delta-sigma modulator <b>10</b>. An absolute value circuit <b>25</b> (or logical operation that may be integrated within digital bias scaling <b>22</b>) provides the magnitude of the change, which is used to proportionately control the level of bias or power supply current level supplied to integrator <b>11</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The input to absolute value circuit <b>25</b> in the illustrated embodiment is provided by a circuit that subtracts the output of quantizer <b>14</b> from a smoothed historical quantizer output value provided by a digital low-pass filter <b>24</b>. Low-pass filter <b>24</b> is generally a relatively simple filter compared to output low-pass filter <b>18</b>, as the delay of low-pass filter <b>24</b> should be relatively short in order to accurately predict the change at the output of integrator <b>11</b>A for the next sample cycle. For example, low-pass filter <b>24</b> may compute the average of the four previous quantizer outputs. A combiner <b>23</b> subtracts the output of the quantizer from the output of low-pass filter <b>24</b> yielding a signal that is a measure of the instantaneous change in the output of quantizer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a circuit in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention is shown. The circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is identical to that of the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with the exception of differences in bias control circuit <b>20</b>B. Therefore, only those differences will be described below. Bias control circuit <b>20</b>B predicts the change in the output level of integrator <b>11</b>A by combining changes in the delta-sigma modulator input signal IN with the output of the quantizer, yielding a coarse computation of the change in the signal value at the output of integrator <b>11</b>A. An auxiliary ADC <b>26</b> converts the input signal to a digital representation, from which the quantizer output is subtracted by combiner <b>23</b>. The balance of the circuit is the same as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>; the difference in operation is that the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is more responsive to large changes in input signal IN.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a circuit in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention is shown. The circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is identical to that of the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with the exception of differences in bias control circuit <b>20</b>C. Therefore, only those differences will be described below. Bias control circuit <b>20</b>C predicts the change in the output of integrator <b>11</b>A by computing the difference in the output of quantizer <b>14</b> from the previous cycle value stored in a delay <b>27</b>. Combiner <b>23</b> performs the subtraction and the balance of the bias control circuit <b>20</b>C is identical to that of bias control circuit <b>20</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> provides a simpler implementation than the circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, but lacks the advantage of the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in responsiveness to rapidly changing input signal and some of the accuracy of the circuits <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> in predicting the integrator change over each sample interval.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, an amplifier power supply current control scheme as may be employed in the delta-sigma modulator circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> is illustrated. An amplifier A<b>1</b>, in combination with resistor R and a capacitor C, provides an integrator for the first stage of a delta-sigma modulator as disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. For switched-capacitor implementations, a switched-capacitor input circuit SC<b>1</b> replaces resistor R<b>1</b>. A set of current switches <b>40</b> for each power supply rail are controlled by a control logic <b>42</b> that operates the switches in accordance with the digital output of the digital bias scaling circuit <b>22</b> in order to limit the current through the power supply rails of amplifier A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, another amplifier power supply current control scheme as may be employed in the delta-sigma modulator circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> is illustrated. The integrator structure is the same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, but in the depicted embodiment, an analog control scheme is implemented from a digital control input. A set of current mirrors <b>46</b>, one for each power supply rail, are controlled by the current outputs of a DAC <b>44</b> in order to set a current limit on the power supply rails of amplifier A<b>1</b>, in conformity with the outputs of digital bias scaling circuit <b>22</b>. Current mirrors <b>46</b> may be incorporated within amplifier A<b>1</b> and may be distributed as discrete selectable current sources that control each of the power supply current paths through amplifier A<b>1</b> in order to scale the power consumption of amplifier A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, another integrator power-supply current control scheme that may be employed in the circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> is shown. Amplifier A<b>1</b>′ is a fully-differential cascoded amplifier design with secondary cascode voltage bias inputs V<sub>b</sub><sup>+ </sup>and V<sub>b</sub><sup>− </sup>supplied from external reference voltage supplies (not shown). Separate P-bias and N-bias DACs <b>44</b>A, <b>44</b>B supply control currents that are converted to bias control voltages by a buffered current-to-voltage converter circuit I<b>2</b>V. The voltage outputs of converter circuit I<b>2</b>V provide the primary P and N current source load bias voltages to amplifier A<b>1</b>′ and also set the bias current of the input stage of amplifier A<b>1</b>′ by setting the gate voltage of transistor N<sub>Ib</sub>. Switched input capacitor stage SC<b>2</b> applies the differential input voltages In+ and In− to amplifier A<b>1</b>′ and the outputs of amplifier A<b>1</b>′ provide integrator operation by charging integrator capacitors C<sub>I1 </sub>and C<sub>I2</sub>. Additional load capacitances C<sub>L1 </sub>and C<sub>L2 </sub>are also charged by the corresponding output of amplifier A<b>1</b>′, and as mentioned above, must be taken into account in the output current capability of amplifier A<b>1</b>′ for a particular power supply control bias level set by digital bias scaling circuit <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>.</p>
