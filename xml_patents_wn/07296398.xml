<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to aircraft gas turbine engines, and more specifically to counter-rotating gas turbine engines.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">At least one known gas turbine engine includes, in serial flow arrangement, a forward fan assembly, an aft fan assembly, a high-pressure compressor for compressing air flowing through the engine, a combustor for mixing fuel with the compressed air such that the mixture may be ignited, and a high-pressure turbine. The high-pressure compressor, combustor and high-pressure turbine are sometimes collectively referred to as the core engine. In operation, the core engine generates combustion gases which are discharged downstream to a counter-rotating low-pressure turbine that extracts energy therefrom for powering the forward and aft fan assemblies. Within at least some known gas turbine engines, at least one turbine rotates in an opposite direction than the other rotating components within the engine</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">At least one known counter-rotating low-pressure turbine has an inlet radius that is larger than a radius of the high-pressure turbine discharge. The increased size of the inlet radius enables the low-pressure turbine to accommodate additional stages. Specifically, at least one known counter-rotating low-pressure turbine includes an outer turbine having a first quantity of low-pressure stages that are rotatably coupled to the forward fan assembly, and an inner turbine having an equal number of stages that is rotatably coupled to the aft fan assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">During operation, lubrication is supplied to the forward and aft fan assemblies and to the low-pressure turbine utilizing a relatively complex lubrication system. Such lubrication systems are designed to supply lubricating fluid to a plurality of bearings supporting the forward and aft fan assemblies and the low-pressure turbine, for example. However, to lubricate the forward and aft fan assemblies and the low-pressure turbine, at least one known gas turbine engine is configured to channel the lubricating fluid around the plurality of rotating components that are rotating in opposite rotational directions. Accordingly, designing and implementing a lubrication system capable of lubricating the forward and aft fan assemblies and an low-pressure turbine within a counter-rotating gas turbine engine may result in increasing the overall weight of the gas turbine engine which may cause an associated increase in the costs of manufacturing and assembling the gas turbine engine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, a method for assembling a gas turbine engine is provided. The method includes providing a first fan assembly configured to rotate in a first rotational direction, rotatably coupling a second fan assembly to the first fan assembly, wherein the second fan assembly is configured to rotate in a second rotational direction that is opposite the first rotational direction, coupling a first shaft to the first fan assembly and to a first turbine rotor that is configured to rotate in a first rotational direction, coupling a second shaft coupled to the second fan assembly and to a second turbine rotor that is configured to rotate in a second rotational direction that is opposite the first rotational direction, and coupling a lubrication system to the gas turbine engine such that a lubrication fluid is channeled through the first shaft to lubricate at least one of the first and second fan assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect, a gas turbine engine is provided. The gas turbine engine includes a first fan assembly configured to rotate in a first rotational direction, a second fan assembly rotatably coupled to the first fan assembly and configured to rotate in a second rotational direction that is opposite the first rotational direction, a first shaft coupled to the first fan assembly and to a first turbine rotor that is configured to rotate in a first rotational direction, a second shaft coupled to the second fan assembly and to a second turbine rotor that is configured to rotate in a second rotational direction that is opposite the first rotational direction, and a lubrication system coupled to the gas turbine engine such that a lubrication fluid is channeled through the first shaft to lubricate at least one of the first and second fan assemblies.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a portion of an exemplary gas turbine engine <b>10</b> that includes a forward fan assembly <b>12</b> and an aft fan assembly <b>14</b> disposed about a longitudinal centerline axis <b>13</b>. The terms “forward fan” and “aft fan” are used herein to indicate that fan assembly <b>12</b> is coupled axially upstream from fan assembly <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, fan assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are positioned at a forward end of gas turbine engine <b>10</b> as illustrated. In an alternative embodiment, fan assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are positioned at an aft end of gas turbine engine <b>10</b>. Fan assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> each include a plurality of rows of fan blades <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively, that are positioned within a nacelle <b>17</b>. Blades <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are coupled to respective rotor disks <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> that are rotatably coupled through a respective fan shaft <b>20</b> to forward fan assembly <b>12</b> and through a fan shaft <b>22</b> to aft fan assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Gas turbine engine <b>10</b> also includes a core engine <b>24</b> that is downstream from fan assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Core engine <b>24</b> includes a high-pressure compressor (HPC) <b>26</b>, a combustor <b>28</b>, and a high-pressure turbine (HPT) <b>30</b> that is coupled to HPC <b>26</b> via a core rotor or shaft <b>32</b>. In operation, core engine <b>24</b> generates combustion gases that are channeled downstream to a counter-rotating low-pressure turbine <b>34</b> which extracts energy from the gases for powering fan assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> through their respective fan shafts <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Low-pressure turbine <b>34</b> includes a stationary outer casing <b>36</b> that is coupled to core engine <b>24</b> downstream from high-pressure turbine <b>30</b>.

Outer rotor <b>38</b> has a generally frusto-conical shape and includes a plurality of circumferentially-spaced rotor blades <b>40</b> that extend radially inwardly. Blades <b>40</b> are arranged in axially-spaced blade rows or stages <b>41</b>. Although, the exemplary embodiment only illustrates four stages <b>41</b>, it should be realized that outer rotor <b>38</b> may have any quantity of stages <b>41</b> without affecting the scope of the method and apparatus described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Low-pressure turbine <b>34</b> also includes a radially inner rotor <b>42</b> that is aligned substantially coaxially with respect to, and radially inward of, outer rotor <b>38</b>.
