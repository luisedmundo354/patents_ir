<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates in general to magnetic storage systems, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for providing a reverse air bearing surface head with trailing shield design for perpendicular recording.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Disk drives are used as primary data storage devices in modern computer systems and networks. A typical disk drive comprises one or more rigid magnetizable storage disks, which are rotated by a spindle motor at a high speed. An array of read/write heads transfer data between tracks of the disks and a host computer. The heads are mounted to an actuator assembly that is positioned so as to place a particular head adjacent the desired track.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Information is written on each disk in a plurality of concentric tracks by a transducer assembly mounted on an actuator arm. Typically, the transducer assembly is suspended over the disk from the actuator arm in a slider assembly, which includes air bearing surfaces designed to interact with a thin layer of moving air generated by the rotation of the disks. Transducer assemblies are said to “fly” over the disk surface as the disk rotates. To access tracks on the disk, the actuator arm moves in an arc across the disk. The physical distance between the nominal centers of two adjacent tracks is referred to as the “track pitch”. The track pitch and linear track density define the storage capacity of the disk.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Each of the disks is coated with a magnetizable medium wherein the data is retained as a series of magnetic domains of selected orientation. The data are imparted to the data disk by a write element of the corresponding head. The data thus stored to the disk are subsequently detected by a read element of the head. Although a variety of head constructions have been utilized historically, magneto-resistive (MR) heads are typically used in present generation disk drives. An MR head writer uses a thin-film inductive coil arranged about a ferromagnetic core having a write gap. As write currents are passed through the coil, a magnetic write field is established emanating magnetic flux lines from the core and fringing across the write gap. The flux lines extend into the magnetizable medium to establish magnetization vectors in selected directions, or polarities, along the track on the data disk. Magnetic flux transitions are established at boundaries between adjacent magnetization vectors of opposite polarities.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To write a computer file to disk, the disk drive receives the file from the host computer in the form of input data that are buffered by an interface circuit. A write channel encodes and serializes the data to generate a data input stream that can be represented as a square-wave type signal of various lengths between rising and falling signal transitions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A write driver circuit uses the data input stream to generate a write current which is applied to the write head, creating the magnetic write field that writes the encoded data to the magnetizable medium of the selected disk. The write current both reverses the polarity of the magnetic write field, creating the magnetic flux transitions, and sustains a given polarity between successive magnetic flux transitions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A write head typically employs two ferromagnetic poles capable of carrying flux signals for the purpose of writing the magnetic impressions into the track of a magnetic disk or tape. The poles are fabricated on a slider with the pole tips located at the air bearing surface. Processing circuitry digitally energizes the write coil that induces flux signals into the poles. The flux signals bridge across the write gap at the air bearing surface so as to write the magnetic information into the track of the rotating disk. The thinner the thickness of the write gap layer, the greater the number of bits the write head can write into the track.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A write head is typically rated by its areal density that is a product of its linear bit density and its track width density. The linear bit density is the number of bits that can be written per linear inch along the track of the rotating magnetic disk and the track width density is the number of tracks that can be written per inch along a radius of the rotating magnetic disk. The linear bit density is quantified as bits per inch (BPI) and the track width density is quantified as tracks per inch (TPI). As discussed hereinabove, the linear bit density depends upon the thickness of the write gap layer. The track width density is directly dependent upon the width of the second pole tip at the ABS. Efforts over the years to increase the areal density of write heads have resulted in computer storage capacities increasing from kilobytes to megabytes to gigabytes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">For the past 40 years, longitudinal recording has been used to record information on a disc drive. In longitudinal recording, the magnetization in the bits on a disc is flipped between lying parallel and anti-parallel to the direction in which the head is moving relative to the disc.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In longitudinal recording, the magnetic medium on the disc is magnetized parallel to the surface of the disc. In perpendicular recording, however, the medium is magnetized perpendicular to the surface of the disc. According to perpendicular magnetic recording, a recording (write) magnetic field generated from a main pole of the head forms a magnetic path in which the magnetic field is induced to the underlayer disposed on the rear of the recording magnetic layer and returned from an auxiliary pole to the recording head. By switching the direction of recording magnetic field, the recording magnetic layer is magnetized in two directions towards the thickness of the medium in correspondence with the recording information code, thereby storing information. In such recording, an intensive and steep perpendicular recording (write) magnetic field can be applied to the recording magnetic layer, so that high-resolution information storage can be achieved. Moreover, when magnetized recording information is reproduced from the perpendicular magnetic recording medium recording the information, as described above, by the high-sensitive MR reproducing head using the MR device, a reproduced signal from the head has a rectangular-shaped signal waveform corresponding to the magnetized recording pattern which is sensed immediately by the head.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, increasing areal densities to allow greater capacities is no small task. Today it is becoming more challenging to increase areal densities in longitudinal recording. Longitudinal magnetic recording is projected to be limited by the superparamagnetic limit at recording densities range between 80 to 200 Gbit/in2. To go to even higher areal densities, researchers are looking at several alternatives, including perpendicular recording. In recent years, the increased demand for higher data rate and areal density has correspondingly fueled the perpendicular head design to scale toward smaller dimensions and the need for constant exploration of new head designs, materials, and practical fabrication methods. Current exploratory head designs focus on developing a manufacturable fabrication process that uses similar design, materials, and existing tooling to ease the conversion from longitudinal to perpendicular recording to achieve ultra-high density. This aim has resulted in an effort to evaluate the current longitudinal head and consider approaches to modify its design for perpendicular recording.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preliminary experimental evidence on head performance test on improved perpendicular media with high coercivity and tight switching field distribution indicate poor media saturation under the write pole when recording with the trailing edge of the write pole whereas substantial improvements are observed when recording is done on the leading edge. Lessons from these observations and the design of special reverse air bearing surface (ABS) suspension enable the longitudinal head to be suspended on reverse ABS, and flown them backward at zero skew. Results from flying longitudinal head backward (recording on leading edge) show improvements such as an increase in signal to noise ratio by 4-5 dB, a decrease in media transition noise by 30-50%, and elimination of poorly saturated media under the write pole. These improvements can be explained by looking at the flux path.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For a conventional single pole writer, the flux path is from the trailing edge of the write pole to the soft underlayer of the media and back to the return pole. The flux path takes the path of lowest reluctance and in this case it is the return pole. When the head is flown backward on special reverse ABS suspension, the flux is from the leading edge of the write pole to the soft underlayer of the recording media and back to the return pole. The major advantage observed from flying longitudinal head backward are mostly due to the improvement in write field gradient by the write pole's close proximity to the return pole and the direction of motion of the media in this design.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Using a conventional longitudinal head design and flying it backward for perpendicular recording requires designing a reverse ABS suspension and the development of an inverted bevel write pole fabrication to handle skew if a modified actuator arm adjusted for skew is not implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It can be seen then that there is a need for a method and apparatus for providing a reverse air bearing surface head with trailing shield design for perpendicular recording.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the following description of the embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration the specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized because structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The present invention provides a method and apparatus for providing a reverse air bearing surface head with trailing shield design for perpendicular recording. An inversed bevel shape is provided for a reverse air bearing surface head for perpendicular recording to handle skew when recording data on a magnetic recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary storage system <b>100</b> according to the present invention. A transducer <b>110</b> is under control of an actuator <b>120</b>, whereby the actuator <b>120</b> controls the position of the transducer <b>110</b>. The transducer <b>110</b> writes and reads data on magnetic media <b>130</b>. The read/write signals are passed to a data channel <b>140</b>. A signal processor <b>150</b> controls the actuator <b>120</b> and processes the signals of the data channel <b>140</b> for data exchange with external Input/Output (I/O) <b>170</b>. I/O <b>170</b> may provide, for example, data and control conduits for a desktop computing application, which utilizes storage system <b>100</b>. In addition, a media translator <b>160</b> is controlled by the signal processor <b>150</b> to cause the magnetic media <b>130</b> to move relative to the transducer <b>110</b>. The present invention is not meant to be limited to a particular type of storage system <b>100</b> or to the type of media <b>130</b> used in the storage system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates one particular embodiment of a multiple magnetic disk storage system <b>200</b> according to the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a hard disk drive storage system <b>200</b> is shown. The system <b>200</b> includes a spindle <b>210</b> that supports and rotates multiple magnetic disks <b>220</b>. The spindle <b>210</b> is rotated by motor <b>280</b> that is controlled by motor controller <b>230</b>. A combined read and write magnetic head <b>270</b> is mounted on slider <b>240</b> that is supported by suspension <b>250</b> and actuator arm <b>240</b>. Processing circuitry exchanges signals that represent information with read/write magnetic head <b>270</b>, provides motor drive signals for rotating the magnetic disks <b>220</b>, and provides control signals for moving the slider <b>260</b> to various tracks. Although a multiple magnetic disk storage system is illustrated, a single magnetic disk storage system is equally viable in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The suspension <b>250</b> and actuator arm <b>240</b> position the slider <b>260</b> so that read/write magnetic head <b>270</b> is in a transducing relationship with a surface of magnetic disk <b>220</b>. When the magnetic disk <b>220</b> is rotated by motor <b>280</b>, the slider <b>240</b> is supported on a thin cushion of air (air bearing) between the surface of disk <b>220</b> and the ABS <b>290</b>. Read/write magnetic head <b>270</b> may then be employed for writing information to multiple circular tracks on the surface of magnetic disk <b>220</b>, as well as for reading information therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram <b>300</b> showing the flow of a magnetic flux between the head and medium in the perpendicular recording process. A recording (writing) head which is composed of a main pole <b>331</b>, an auxiliary pole <b>332</b> and a coil <b>333</b> is facing a perpendicular recording medium having a recording layer <b>334</b> and a soft magnetic under layer <b>335</b>. As a current is applied to excite the coil <b>333</b>, a magnetic field is perpendicularly generated between the tip of the main pole and the soft magnetic under layer <b>335</b> so that recording is made in the recording layer <b>334</b> of the perpendicular recording medium. The magnetic flux which has reached the soft magnetic under layer <b>335</b> goes back to the auxiliary pole <b>332</b>, making up a magnetic circuit. The recording magnetic field distribution depends on the shape of the main pole. It can be understood from the figure that writing is made through the main pole's end, which is on the trailing side in the medium moving direction <b>336</b>. On the other hand, reading is made through a magnetoresistive effect element <b>338</b> located between the auxiliary pole <b>332</b> and a bottom shield <b>337</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> then, for a conventional single pole writer <b>300</b>, the flux path is from the trailing edge of the write pole <b>331</b> to the soft underlayer <b>335</b> of the media and back to the return pole <b>332</b>. The flux path takes the path of lowest reluctance and in this case it is the return pole <b>332</b>. However, as described above, advantage may be observed by flying a longitudinal head backward due to the improvement in write field gradient.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram <b>400</b> showing a reverse ABS single pole writer. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a write pole <b>410</b> and a return pole <b>412</b> are shown. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the head <b>400</b> is flown backward, the flux <b>420</b> is from the leading edge <b>430</b> of the write pole <b>410</b> to the soft underlayer of the recording media <b>440</b> and back to the return pole <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a single coil layer design for a longitudinal head design <b>500</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, two shield <b>550</b>, <b>552</b> are shown surrounding a read sensor <b>554</b>. The write head <b>502</b> including the first pole <b>510</b>, second pole <b>512</b>, trailing shield <b>514</b>, backgap <b>516</b> and coils <b>520</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. While the single coil layer design for a longitudinal head design <b>500</b> experiences flux leakage from the write pole <b>510</b> to the return pole <b>512</b> due mostly to a small separation, the height of trailing shield (TS) <b>514</b> and backgap (BG) <b>516</b> may be adjusted to minimize this effect. A reverse ABS suspension (not shown) may be use to fly the head backward.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>d </i>illustrate a method for fabricating a reverse ABS head with trailing shield design according to an embodiment of the present invention. Issues such as alignment scheme and the reader built first will be fabricated similar to a conventional longitudinal build sequence as shown. In addition, with the reader built first, issue such as annealing with a field in the hard axis direction to set the exchange bias will not affect the writer portion of the head since it is built later. The inverted bevel write head according to an embodiment of the present invention will be able to handle skew and tapering on top of the pole.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, a read head <b>600</b> including a first <b>650</b> and second <b>652</b> shield is first built. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, a separation gap <b>662</b> is deposited <b>662</b>. Vias (B<b>2</b>) are opened (not shown) and then the return pole (P<b>1</b>) <b>610</b> is formed with connection to the reader <b>600</b>. This structure is chemical mechanical polished. Then, the backgap <b>616</b> and trailing shield <b>614</b> are fabricated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>c</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>d </i>shows that the gap and open vias are deposited <b>664</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>, a hard bake resist <b>766</b> is spun on. The resist <b>766</b> is fully baked to fully cross link the resist. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b </i>shows that CMP is performed to planarize the hard bake resist <b>766</b>. The endpoint is the top surface of the pedestal <b>768</b> and the backgap <b>716</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c </i>shows that after the CMP, a thin layer of SiO<sub>2 </sub><b>770</b> is deposited and an antireflective coating <b>772</b> is spun on. The resist is then imaged. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>d</i>, the pattern transferring of the coil image <b>774</b> into the SiO<sub>2 </sub>hard mask <b>770</b> using, for example, reactive ion etching fluorine chemistry. Then, the pattern image in the oxide is transferred into the hard bake resist <b>776</b> using, for example, H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>, the imaging resist <b>770</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is stripped away, using for example hot NMP (N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone) solvent, to expose the oxide layer <b>866</b> and coating <b>872</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>, plating <b>880</b>, such as Ta (for adhesion) and a copper seed layer, is deposited using, for example, collimated PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>c</i>, damascene plating <b>882</b> is used to superfill and over-plate the trenches with copper to define the coil <b>884</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>d </i>shows that CMP is performed to remove excess copper. The endpoint is on the surface of the pedestal <b>868</b> and backgap <b>816</b>. There are several methods to fabricate the coil and pedestal/backgap such as the approach described above. In another approach, the coil <b>884</b> can be fabricated before the pedestal <b>868</b> and backgap <b>816</b>. In this approach, after fabrication of the return pole, a thin gap and copper seed layer is deposited before depositing the coil structure <b>884</b>, performing seed-layer removal, and encapsulating the coil <b>884</b>. The pedestal <b>868</b> and backgap <b>816</b> are then fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>show that a thin layer of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub><b>984</b> and second pole <b>986</b> are deposited. The write pole may then be defined. A notched and un-notched trailing shield may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a notched trailing shield design <b>1000</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the first shield <b>1010</b>, second shield <b>1012</b> and read sensor <b>1014</b> are shown for the read head. A return pole <b>1020</b> is formed over the second shield <b>1012</b>. The coil is formed between the return pole <b>1020</b> and pole <b>3</b> <b>1030</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For notched trailing shield <b>1000</b>, after CMP to expose the top of the pedestal <b>1040</b> and backgap <b>1042</b>, a thin layer of high B<sub>s </sub>material is deposited to form notch <b>1050</b>. A bi-layer photo resist is used to define the edge and dimension of the notch <b>1050</b>. Ion mill is done to remove the bulk of the high B<sub>s </sub>material except material protected by a photoresist. Alumina is deposited to refill areas recessed by ion mill. Lift-off is done to remove excess alumina on top of the photoresist. The B<sub>s </sub>material and adjacent alumina should be at the same level. A slight CMP can be used to assist in the lift-off. At this point, the trailing shield gap <b>1052</b>, such as alumina, is deposited follow by the fabrication of the trapezoidal write pole (P<b>2</b>) <b>1060</b>. The notch <b>1050</b> is formed by extending the ion mill during the trapezoidal write pole <b>1060</b> formation so ion milling is used to define the high B<sub>s </sub>material to form the notch <b>1050</b>.</p>

This is then follow by the stop layer <b>1230</b>. The high B<sub>s </sub>material is used to provide the trailing edge taper. Rh is the endpoint material that is used during ion mill to create the trailing edge taper. Preferably, stop layer <b>1230</b> is carbon (C), but could be another suitable material such as rhodium (Rh) or ruthenium (Ru). A hard mask layer <b>1232</b> is then formed in full film over stop layer <b>1230</b>. Hard mask layer <b>1232</b> may be made of polymide or epoxy, for example. Next, a central resist structure <b>1234</b> is formed over hard mask layer <b>1232</b> along the ABS. Preferably, central resist structure <b>1234</b> is made of a silicon-containing resist. The width of central resist structure <b>1234</b> is formed wider than the desired width of a pole tip to bevel and trim the write pole's trackwidth to be formed.</p>

Thus, a central hard mask <b>1233</b> and a central stop layer <b>1231</b> are formed underneath central resist structure <b>1234</b>, such that top surfaces of pole tip materials outside central resist structure are exposed. Note that an additional layer may be deposited between hard mask layer and central resist structure to separate the RIE into two separate steps using different RIE chemistry for better selectivity.
