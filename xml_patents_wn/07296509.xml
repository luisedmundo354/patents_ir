<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Application No. 2003-29105, filed May 7, 2003, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a bread maker, and more particularly to a bread maker operating with a baking tray mounted therein.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional bread makers have a main body, forming a bread making space and a door opening with a door. The bread makers also have baking trays in the bread making space. When a mixing bag, filled with raw materials for bread, is inserted into the bread maker and the bread maker is operated, raw materials are kneaded and then poured into the baking tray. The leavening and baking processes then commence.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a conventional bread maker, even if a user operates the bread maker without placing the baking tray in the bread making space, the bread making processes, such as the leavening and kneading processes, are automatically performed. Performing the bread making process without the baking tray in place causes the raw materials to be dispersed into the bread making space during the leavening and baking processes. As a result, desiring bread cannot be made and the bread making space can be contaminated.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an aspect of the present invention to provide a bread maker that will not perform a bread making process unless a baking tray is mounted therein.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional aspects and/or advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description that follows, and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve the above and/or other aspects according to the present invention, a bread maker is provided. The bread maker comprises: a main body, having an opening and forming a bread making space; a door capable of opening and closing the opening; a baking tray removably mounted in the bread making space; a tray sensor, sensing whether the baking tray is mounted in the bread making space; and a controller, controlling a bread making process to be performed on the basis of a sensing signal from the tray sensor when the baking tray is mounted in the bread making space.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an aspect of the present invention, the tray sensor comprises a sensing member in the door. When the door is closed and a baking tray is mounted, the sensing member makes contact with the baking tray. A sensing switch then generates a sensing signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect of the invention, the tray sensor comprises a sensing member in the baking tray. When the door is closed and a baking tray is mounted, the sensing member makes contact with the door. A sensing switch then generates a sensing signal.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect of the present invention, the tray sensor comprises: a sensing member supported by an internal panel of the door. The sensing member passes through the internal panel and extends into the bread making space, where it makes contact with the baking tray. An operation lever, which is interposed between the internal and external panels of the door, is supported by a central pivot. One example of an operational lever is a shaft that performs a seesaw movement. When the baking tray is mounted in the bread making space, the tray pushes against the sensing member. As the sensing member is pushed into the bread maker, the sensing member pushes against the operational lever, forcing the operational lever to pivot. When the operation lever pivots, the opposite end of the operational lever makes contact with a sensing switch. When the contact is made, a signal is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further aspect of the present invention the bread maker has a tray sensor that comprises a sensing member, a sensing switch, and a pivot arm, mounted on a pivot. In this aspect, the sensing member extends into the bread making space so that when the baking tray is mounted in the bread making space the sensing member is driven out. The sensing member is attached to the first end of the pivot arm such that when the sensing arm is driven from the bread making area the pivot arm pivots and the second end of the pivot arm makes contact with the sensing switch. When the pivot arm makes contact, the tray sensor transmits a signal to the controller, allowing it to control the bread making processes accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect, the bread maker further comprises a door sensor to sense whether the door is closed. The controller allows the bread making process to be performed only when the door is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another aspect of the present invention involves mounting a display on the bread maker that utilizes the signals from the tray sensor and/or the door sensor. Depending on the signals, the display can indicated when the tray is in place or missing, and/or when the door is open or closed.</p>

Also, the baking tray <b>10</b> has a first half <b>14</b> and a second half <b>15</b>, which can be separated from each other along their length. In the bottom of the baking tray <b>10</b> there is a slit <b>16</b> formed between the first and second halves <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. A lower part of the mixing bag <b>11</b> passes down through the slit <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Opposite ends of the mixing bag are attached to the holders <b>5</b> of the kneading drums <b>4</b>. The kneading drums <b>4</b> are then rotated by manipulating a rotation knob <b>2</b> when the door <b>20</b> is open. When one end of the mixing bag <b>11</b> is wound on the kneading drums <b>4</b> by rotating kneading drums <b>4</b>, the bar code makes contact with a bar code sensor of the bar code reader <b>6</b>. The bar code reader <b>6</b> then transmits a bread making program, read from the bar code, to the bread maker.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the door <b>20</b> is closed, the pair of the kneading drums <b>4</b> rotate clockwise and counterclockwise according to the bread making program read from the bar code, thereby kneading the raw materials contained in the mixing bag <b>11</b>. The bar code reader <b>6</b> is spaced away from the kneading drums <b>4</b>, so that interference with the rotating kneading drums <b>4</b> can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When in the bread making space the upper end of the mixing bag <b>11</b> passes through a pair of kneading members <b>17</b> and is wound on the upper kneading drum <b>4</b>. The lower end passes through the slit <b>16</b> formed in the bottom of the baking tray <b>10</b> and is wound on the lower kneading drum <b>4</b>. The mixing bag <b>11</b> filled with the raw materials is repeatedly moved up and down by the rotation of the pair of kneading drums <b>4</b>, so that the raw materials are kneaded between the kneading member <b>17</b> and the baking tray <b>10</b>. After the kneading process is completed, the lower kneading drum <b>4</b> is rotated so that the mixing bag <b>11</b> is wound around the lower kneading drum <b>4</b>, and is detached from the upper kneading drum <b>4</b>. The mixing bag <b>11</b> then passes through the kneading member <b>17</b> and finally passes through the slit <b>16</b> of the baking tray <b>10</b>. When the mixing bag <b>11</b> passes through the slit <b>16</b> of the baking tray <b>10</b>, the raw materials in the mixing bag <b>11</b> do not and are instead poured onto the baking tray <b>10</b>. The mixing bag <b>11</b> passes through the slit <b>16</b> of the baking tray <b>10</b> and is wound on the lower kneading drum.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">After the raw materials filled in the mixing bag <b>11</b> are completely kneaded, the raw materials are leavened and baked in the baking tray <b>10</b>. During the leavening and baking processes, vapor is supplied from the vapor supplying reservoir <b>8</b> to the baking tray <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the heaters generate heat in the leavening and baking process, heat generated from the first heater <b>7</b><i>a </i>is transmitted to the vapor supplying reservoir <b>8</b>, thereby vaporizing water contained in the vapor supplying reservoir <b>8</b>. The vapor then moves to an upper side of an interior of the vapor supplying reservoir <b>8</b>, and is sprayed on the raw materials in the baking tray <b>10</b> through the nozzle by a pressure difference between the interior and exterior of the vapor supplying reservoir <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Thus, cracking of the bread surface, which may be caused by a moisture shortage, is prevented and the bread surface becomes glazed. Also, when the vapor moves to an upper side of an interior of the vapor supplying reservoir <b>8</b> and is sprayed on the raw materials, water is still left in the vapor supplying reservoir <b>8</b>. Thus, water does not flow out through the nozzle part. Accordingly, the completed bread is not excessively moist.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a control block diagram of the bread maker <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The controller <b>40</b> receives sensing signals from a door sensor <b>41</b>, sensing whether the door is closed or opened, and the tray sensor <b>30</b>, sensing whether the baking tray <b>10</b> is mounted or not. The controller controls a bread making driver <b>42</b> to drive a kneading drum driving motor (not shown), the heaters <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>c </i>and <b>7</b><i>d</i>. The controller <b>40</b> can output a control signal so that the bread making driver <b>42</b> operates only when the controller <b>40</b> simultaneously receives the sensing signals from the tray sensor <b>30</b> and the door sensor <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an enlarged sectional view of the tray sensor <b>30</b> of the bread maker <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the tray sensor <b>30</b> comprises a sensing member <b>31</b>, an operation lever <b>32</b>, and a sensing switch <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The sensing member <b>31</b> is slidably supported by an internal panel of the door <b>20</b>, passes through the internal panel, and is extended toward the bread making space to contact the baking tray <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The operation lever <b>32</b> is interposed between the internal and external panel of the door <b>20</b>, and has a central pivot. The operation lever <b>32</b> elastically pushes the sensing member <b>31</b> toward the bread making space.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sensing switch <b>33</b> is turned on/off by the seesaw movement of the operation lever <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">If a user mounts the baking tray <b>10</b> and closes the door <b>20</b> when a mixing bag <b>11</b> is inserted, the sensing member <b>31</b> of the tray sensor <b>30</b> contacts the first half <b>14</b> of the baking tray <b>10</b> and is pushed away from the tray <b>10</b>. Due to the movement of the sensing member <b>31</b>, the operation lever <b>32</b> pivots, and the sensing switch <b>33</b> is pressed, thereby generating a sensing signal. Alternately, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the sensing member <b>31</b> may be provided in the baking tray <b>10</b> such that when the door <b>20</b> is closed and the baking tray <b>10</b> is mounted, the sensing member <b>31</b> makes contact with the door <b>20</b>. The sensing switch <b>33</b> then generates a sensing signal.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the above embodiment, the tray sensor <b>30</b> and the door sensor <b>41</b> are separate sensors. However, since the tray sensor <b>30</b> can confirm whether the baking tray <b>10</b> is mounted or not only when the door <b>20</b> is closed, whether the door <b>20</b> is closed and whether the baking tray <b>10</b> is mounted can be detected by only the tray sensor <b>30</b>. Thus, the door sensor <b>41</b> can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As described above, according to the present invention, a bread maker is operational only when a baking tray is mounted, thus preventing an operational error of the bread maker.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although a few embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
