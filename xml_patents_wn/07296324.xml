<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to copending Korean Patent Application No. 2003-88202 filed Dec. 5, 2003, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a vacuum cleaner, and more particularly, to a brush assembly of a vacuum cleaner which comprises a locking reinforcement unit that secures upper and lower housings so they do not separate upon impact.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vacuum cleaners are generally provided with various types of auxiliary tools for more efficient cleaning. For example, an upholstery brush, which is an auxiliary tool for cleaning upholstery, such as carpet, is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0106183A1, to Frederick et al.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Frederick et al. disclose a cleaner housing that has lower housing and an upper housing releasably attached to the lower housing. More specifically, the housing can be conveniently opened and closed, wherein the upper and lower housings are engaged with each other when the housing is closed, and disengaged from each other when the housing is open. The housings are sealingly engaged with each other by a latch, which includes a first latch tap with a latching surface formed at a rear portion of either the upper or lower housing, and a second latch tap with a latching surface formed opposite the first latch tap. When the upper and lower housings are closed, the latch surface of the first latch tap catches the latch surface of the second latch tap. A pressing button is formed on the first and second latch taps for releasing the first latch tap from the second latch tap to open the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The conventional upholstery brush of Frederick et al. includes first and second latch taps that are locked and unlocked with each other by pressing on a pressing button. However, the first and second latch taps often separate from each other, thereby opening the housing.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a brush assembly of a vacuum cleaner, including an upper housing and a lower housing; a connector secured in one of the upper and the lower housings to direct air inside the upper and the lower housings towards a suction force generator of the vacuum cleaner; and a locking unit rotatably engaged with the connector to open and sealingly close the upper and the lower housings by rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A release preventing means is disposed between the connector and the locking unit, to prevent release of the locking unit. The connector is secured in the upper housing. The locking unit includes an annular rotatable knob body for interfitting with an outer circumference of the connector; an operation projection formed on one end of the annular rotative knob body. The locking guide rib extends from the outer circumference of the annular rotative knob body, and the locking guide rib is selectively engaged and disengaged with the lower housing depending on the rotation of the annular rotative knob body. The locking guide rib includes an opening at one side such that a part of the lower housing facing the locking guide rib passes through the opening and hooks in the inner circumference of the locking guide rib.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The release preventing means includes a release preventing projection extended from the outer circumference of the connector; and a release preventing recess formed in the inner circumference of the annular rotative knob body, opposite to the release preventing projection. The release preventing recess includes a first release preventing recess accommodating the release preventing projection when the annular rotative knob body is in a first position locking the upper and the lower housings together; and a second release preventing recess accommodating the release preventing projection when the annular rotative knob body is in a second position releasing the upper and lower housings from locking condition. The release preventing projection has substantially the same shape as the release preventing recess, and rounded at distal ends.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one aspect of the present invention, a brush assembly of a vacuum cleaner includes an upper housing and a lower housing; a connector secured in one of the upper and the lower housing to direct the air inside the upper and lower housings toward a suction force generator of the vacuum cleaner; a turbine assembly rotatably disposed between the upper and lower housings; a rotatable brush for agitating embedded dust of a surface being cleaned that rotates in accordance with the rotation of the turbine assembly; a locking unit rotatively disposed on the connector to releasably engage the upper and the lower housings by rotation; and a release preventing means formed between the connector and the locking unit to prevent release of the locking unit. The connector is secured in the upper housing.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the following description, same drawing reference numerals are used for the same elements even in different drawings. The matters defined in the description such as a detailed construction and elements only provide assistance in understanding the invention. Thus, it is apparent that the present invention can be carried out without those defined matters. Also, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Additionally, while the present invention is described in the example of a turbine brush which has a rotative brush moving in accordance with a turbine assembly by the suction force of the body of the vacuum cleaner, the present invention is usable in other devices where applicable, such as in a general brush assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The brush assembly <b>100</b> of a vacuum cleaner according to an embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, includes upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> for releasable connection with each other, a connector <b>110</b> interposed between the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>, and a locking unit <b>120</b> for securing the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> in a sealingly closed state.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the upper housing <b>101</b> forms the upper part of the brush assembly <b>100</b>, and has an upwardly-extending slot <b>10</b>i a exposing the locking unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The lower housing <b>102</b>, with a suction port <b>102</b><i>a </i>located in the lower end thereof, houses a turbine assembly <b>130</b> which is rotatable by the suction force generated at the cleaner body (not shown). The turbine assembly <b>130</b> is engaged with a rotative brush <b>140</b> with a plurality of bristle tufts, and the rotative brush <b>140</b> rotates in accordance with the rotation of the turbine assembly <b>130</b> to scatter dust on the surface being cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The connector <b>110</b> includes a fastening part <b>112</b> on the upper case <b>101</b> for engagement with suitable fasteners, such as screws, and connects an extension pipe (not shown) of the cleaner to the brush assembly <b>100</b>. The extension pipe (not shown) defines a suction passage through which air and dust of the surface being cleaned is suctioned.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, the locking unit <b>120</b> is rotatably interfitted with the connector <b>110</b> of the extension pipe and has an annular rotative knob body <b>121</b> interfitted with the outer circumference of the connector <b>110</b>, an integrally-protruding operation part <b>122</b> formed on a predetermined part of the annular rotative knob body <b>121</b>, and a locking guide rib <b>123</b> protruding from the external circumference of the annular rotative knob body <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The annular rotative knob body <b>121</b> is substantially formed in the shape of a ring, with an inner circumference corresponding to the outer circumference of the connector <b>110</b>. The integrally-protruding operation part <b>122</b> on the upper side of the annular rotatable knob body <b>121</b> engages the upwardly-extending slot <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the upper housing <b>101</b>, and extends outwardly towards the brush assembly <b>100</b>. Accordingly, as the user rotates the integrally-protruding operation part <b>122</b> along the inner circumference of the upwardly-extending slot <b>101</b><i>a</i>, the annular rotatable knob body <b>121</b> rotates.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the locking guide rib <b>123</b> extends in the proximity of the lower housing <b>102</b>, opposite to the integrally-protruding operation part <b>122</b>, and to a predetermined height beyond the diameter of the annular rotatable knob body <b>121</b>. However, other alternatives are possible. For example, the locking guide rib <b>123</b> may extend from the side of the annular rotatable knob body <b>121</b> in alignment with a locking protrusion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) which is formed on the lower housing <b>102</b> corresponding to the locking guide rib <b>123</b> of the lower housing <b>102</b>. The locking guide rib <b>123</b> may be open at one side so that the locking protrusion <b>102</b><i>b </i>enters along the inner circumference of the locking guide rib <b>123</b> according to the rotation of the annular rotative knob body <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The brush assembly <b>100</b> according to one certain embodiment of the present invention may further include a release preventing means <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) between the connector <b>110</b> and the locking unit <b>120</b>. The basic purpose of the release preventing means <b>200</b> prevents the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> from separating from each other due to a sudden external impact such as if the brush assembly <b>100</b> is inadvertently dropped to the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the release preventing means <b>200</b> has a release preventing projection <b>111</b> that extends from the outer circumference of the connector <b>110</b>, and first and second release preventing grooves <b>124</b> and <b>125</b> formed in the inner circumference of the annular rotative knob body <b>121</b> opposite to the release preventing projection <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Accordingly, when the annular rotative knob body <b>121</b> is in the first position P<b>1</b> locking the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> together, the first release preventing groove <b>124</b> accommodates the release preventing projection <b>111</b>. When the annular rotative knob body <b>121</b> is in the second position P<b>2</b> releasing the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> from the locked state, the second release preventing groove <b>125</b> accommodates the release preventing projection <b>111</b>. The release preventing projection <b>111</b> is shaped to correspond to the first and the second release preventing grooves <b>124</b> and <b>125</b>, and additionally, each of the grooves <b>124</b> and <b>125</b> can be rounded at one end.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the brush assembly <b>100</b> includes the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> which are releasably engageable to each other with the turbine assembly <b>130</b> interposed between the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>. The turbine assembly <b>130</b> is rotated by the vacuum suction force generated at the suction force generator of the cleaner body (not shown) such that the rotative brush <b>140</b> can, in accordance with the rotation of the turbine assembly <b>130</b>, agitate embedded dust of the surface being cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">During operation, and over time, contaminants and foreign substances, such as hair, can wrap around the turbine assembly <b>130</b> obstructing the rotation of the turbine assembly <b>130</b> and often requiring inspection and repair. Accordingly, the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are releasably assembled with each other for convenient inspection and repair.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As the user rotates the locking unit <b>120</b> in the arrowed direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are separated from each other to open the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Additionally, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the first position P<b>1</b> where the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are sealingly engaged with each other, the locking guide rib <b>123</b> locks the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> by the engagement with the locking protrusion <b>102</b><i>b</i>. As the integrally-protruding operation part <b>122</b> rotates in the arrowed direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the locking guide rib <b>123</b> is disengaged from the locking protrusion <b>102</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In this situation, the locking unit <b>120</b> is engaged with the connector <b>110</b>, and the connector <b>110</b> is securely engaged with the upper housing <b>101</b>. Accordingly, as the locking protrusion <b>102</b><i>b </i>and the locking guide rib <b>123</b> are released from each other, the lower housing <b>102</b> is releasable downward, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If the brush assembly <b>100</b> is dropped to the ground, the release preventing means <b>200</b> disposed between the connector <b>110</b> and the locking unit <b>120</b> prevents the separation of the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The release preventing means <b>200</b> includes a release preventing protuberance <b>111</b> formed on the connector <b>110</b>, and first and second release preventing recesses <b>124</b> and <b>125</b> formed in the inner circumference of the annular rotable knob body <b>121</b> of the locking unit <b>120</b>. In the first position P<b>1</b>, the release preventing projection <b>111</b> is seated in the first release preventing recess <b>124</b>, and in the second position P<b>2</b>, the release preventing projection <b>111</b> is seated in the second release preventing recess <b>125</b>. Accordingly, the annular rotative knob body <b>121</b> is restricted from rotating by a sudden external impact, and the locking guide rib <b>123</b> is prevented from disengaging from the locking protrusion <b>102</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the user can conveniently assemble and disassemble the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> of the brush assembly <b>100</b> by rotating the locking unit <b>120</b> between the first position P<b>1</b>, thereby locking the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> together, and the second position P<b>2</b>, thereby releasing the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> from locked state. Since the locking unit <b>120</b> is held in place by the release preventing means <b>200</b>, separation of the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> from each other can be avoided when the user inadvertently drops the brush assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As described above, the disassembly of the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> is convenient because the upper and lower housings <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are held securely in place even when the brush assembly <b>106</b> is accidentally dropped during use.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The foregoing embodiment and advantages are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses. Also, the description of the embodiments of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims, and many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
