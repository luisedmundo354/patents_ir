<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to devices and methods for enhancing cable management of telecommunications systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a cable management device that mounts to a panel for managing slack cable of telecommunications systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Telecommunications systems utilize cables, such as fiber optic cables or copper twisted pair cables, to interconnect pieces of telecommunications equipment or components. The systems commonly include telecommunication racks that hold a variety of different pieces of telecommunications equipment. Often thousands of cables are used to interconnect the various pieces of telecommunications equipment mounted on the racks.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Because of the large number of cables associated with telecommunications equipment, cable management is crucial. Cable management involves efficiently routing cables to minimize the occupied space, and routing cables in an orderly manner so as to reduce the likelihood of cable tangling. Ease of cable organization is also a factor related to effective cable management.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cable management is important in preventing damage to the cables. Unnecessary or excessive bending of fiber optic cables, for example, is undesirable. Bending of fibers can cause attenuation and loss of signal strength. As the fiber bends, the fiber can also break, resulting in complete loss of signal transmission through the fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, conventional arrangements for managing cable can be improved.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure relates to a fiber optic cable management device having a segmented cable-managing arrangement. The segmented cable-managing arrangement includes a plurality of radius limiting surfaces. The device further includes a back plate having securing structure for securing the device to a telecommunications panel. One or more of the fiber optic cable management devices can be used in an assembly to provide an arrangement that defines multiple, incremental storage lengths for storing the center slack portions of fiber optic cables.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A variety of aspects of the invention are set forth in part in the description that follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practicing various aspects of the disclosure. The aspects of the disclosure may relate to individual features as well as combinations of features. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only, and are not restrictive of the claimed invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary aspects of the present disclosure that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a telecommunications assembly <b>100</b> for managing slack fiber optic cable is illustrated. The telecommunications assembly <b>100</b> can be used in telecommunications systems that interconnect various telecommunication components. One such system is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/295,169, which application is incorporated herein by reference. The telecommunications assembly <b>100</b> is typically mounted between adjacent first and second telecommunication racks (not shown). In alternative embodiments, the cable management assembly <b>100</b> can be configured for use with other telecommunication structures, such as a cabinet, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The cable management assembly <b>100</b> includes a cable management panel <b>90</b>. The cable management panel <b>90</b> can also be referred to as a back plane or riser. The panel <b>90</b> includes an interface portion <b>92</b> and first and second mounting structures <b>94</b> configured to mount or attach the cable management assembly <b>100</b> to adjacent telecommunication racks. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first and second mounting structures <b>94</b> include flanges that extend rearward from the interface portion <b>92</b> of the panel <b>90</b>. Fasteners, such as rivets or screws, can be used to mount the panel <b>90</b> to the adjacent telecommunication racks.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The interface portion <b>92</b> of the panel <b>90</b> defines a plurality of mounting locations, more specifically, a plurality of discrete openings <b>96</b>. In the illustrate cable management assembly <b>100</b>, the plurality of discrete openings <b>96</b> includes a first type of shaped apertures, i.e., attaching apertures <b>102</b>, and a second type of shaped apertures, i.e., locating apertures <b>104</b>. Further details of an example panel that can be used in accordance with the principles disclosed is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/101,143, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Fiber optic cable management devices (e.g. <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>) detachably secure to the panel <b>90</b> at the discrete openings <b>96</b>. In the illustrated assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, four different embodiments of fiber optic cable management devices <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> are shown mounted to the panel <b>90</b> for demonstration purposes. In use, the cable management assembly <b>100</b> need only include one of the disclosed embodiments, although more than one embodiment may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The discrete openings <b>96</b> of the panel <b>90</b> and the cable management devices are configured so that a technician can organize and arrange fiber optic cables at selected horizontal and vertical mounting locations along the panel <b>90</b>. What is meant by “selected” is that the technician can choose a mounting location from the plurality of mounting locations, the devices being adapted to mount at all of the mounting locations.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The cable management devices (e.g. <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>) and the panel <b>90</b> of the present cable management assembly <b>100</b> are configured to permit a technician to position any of the different cable management devices at any location on the panel <b>90</b> of the cable management assembly <b>100</b>. The cable management assembly <b>100</b> thereby permits a technician to configure the system to a particular need, reducing costs associated with fixed or custom-made cable management systems.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, one embodiment of a cable management device <b>10</b> having features in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure is illustrated. The illustrated cable management device <b>10</b> includes a segmented cable-managing arrangement <b>12</b>. The segmented cable-managing arrangement <b>12</b> is interconnected to a back plate <b>14</b> having securing structure <b>16</b> that detachably secures the device <b>10</b> to the panel <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The segmented cable-managing arrangement <b>12</b> includes a plurality of radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b>. The radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> are provided in a descending segmented manner. That is, the radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> define radius limiting segments of the cable-managing arrangement <b>12</b> that are vertically offset from one another. More preferably, the segments or radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> are vertically and forwardly offset from one another in a descending relationship. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the plurality of radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> includes three descending radius limiting segments or surfaces. The lowermost surface is the forward most surface of the three radius limiting surfaces. The feature of providing the radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> in the segmented manner is discussed in greater detailed hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the descending segmented cable-managing arrangement <b>12</b> is a stepped cable-managing arrangement. What is meant by “stepped” is that the radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> of the stepped arrangement <b>12</b> are vertically and forwardly offset from one another in a stepped or rise/run type arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> are constructed to prevent bending of a fiber optic cable beyond a minimum bend radius. In one embodiment, the minimum bend radius is about 1.50 inches. The segmented or stepped cable-managing arrangement <b>12</b> also includes a plurality of cable retaining structures <b>22</b> that retain cable on the radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the cable retaining structures <b>22</b> include tabs <b>24</b> that extend upward from the radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the tabs <b>24</b> are located along an outer edge <b>26</b> of the radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the stepped radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> are defined by radius limiting elements <b>30</b>. The tabs <b>24</b> of the stepped cable-managing arrangement <b>12</b> are an integral construction of the radius limiting elements <b>30</b>; although the tabs <b>24</b> or cable retaining structure <b>22</b> can be provided as a separate component. In the illustrated embodiment, the radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> of each of the radius limiting elements <b>30</b> is discrete or separate from the other radius limiting surfaces. The discrete radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> are oriented such that the surfaces extend outward or in a generally perpendicular direction relative to the back plate <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the radius limiting elements <b>30</b> are configured as half-spools, each having an arcuate structure <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>) extending approximately 180 degrees. It is contemplated that the arcuate structure <b>32</b> can extend more or less than 180 degrees depending upon the telecommunications application in which the element will be used. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the arcuate structure <b>32</b> includes a flange <b>34</b> located at an end opposite the cable retaining structure <b>22</b>. The flange <b>34</b> includes mounting structure <b>36</b>, such as molded fastener structure, for securing the radius limiting element <b>30</b> to a stepped mounting bracket <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, the stepped mounting bracket <b>40</b> of the cable management device <b>10</b> includes corresponding mounting structure <b>42</b> (e.g. holes) at which the radius limiting elements <b>30</b> are mounted. In the illustrated embodiment, the stepped mounting bracket <b>40</b> includes rise portions <b>44</b> and run portions <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The mounting structure <b>42</b> is located on the rise portions <b>44</b> of the stepped mounting bracket <b>40</b>. An upper rise portion <b>48</b> of the bracket <b>40</b> includes additional mounting structure <b>50</b> for securing the mounting bracket <b>40</b> to mounting holes <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) formed in the back plate <b>14</b>. The mounting bracket <b>40</b> can be secured to the back plate <b>14</b> by fasteners, rivets, or other securing elements. Further mounting structure (not shown) can be provided on the mounting bracket <b>40</b> for securing the bracket <b>40</b> to the back plate <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, the stepped mounting bracket <b>40</b> is made of bent sheet metal, although other construction methods and materials can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, in use, the securing structure <b>16</b> of the back plate <b>14</b> of the cable management device <b>10</b> is preferably configured to permit easy attachment and detachment of the device from the panel <b>90</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the securing structure <b>16</b> includes first and second attaching elements <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, a flexible tab <b>66</b>, and a locating element <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first and second attaching elements <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> of the securing structure <b>16</b> correspond to the attaching apertures <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the plurality of discrete openings <b>96</b> of the panel <b>90</b>. Each of the first and second attaching elements <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are located adjacent to a top edge <b>68</b> of the back plate <b>14</b>. As shown, the first and second attaching elements <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> are hook-like attachments having a generally squared configuration that insert and hook into the square attaching apertures <b>102</b> of the panel <b>90</b>. The flexible tab <b>66</b> also corresponds to the square attaching apertures <b>102</b> of the panel <b>90</b>. The flexible tab <b>66</b> is centrally positioned adjacent to a bottom edge <b>70</b> of the back plate <b>14</b>. The flexible tab <b>66</b> is constructed to provide an easy-to-use, snap-fit connection for detachably securing the device <b>10</b> to a selected attaching aperture <b>102</b> of the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the locating apertures <b>104</b> of the plurality of discrete openings <b>96</b> of the panel <b>90</b> correspond to the locating element <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) formed on the backside of the back plate <b>14</b> of the cable management device <b>10</b>. Further details of an example back plate that can be used in accordance with the principles disclosed is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/101,143, previously incorporated herein by reference. The present locating element <b>60</b> corresponds to the half-moon or half-circle configuration of the locating apertures <b>104</b>. The locating element <b>60</b> in combination with the locating aperture <b>104</b> ensures that the cable management device <b>10</b> is properly oriented when mounted to the panel <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the telecommunications industry, fiber optic cable <b>106</b> is typically provided in a particular standard length; yet, in each telecommunications application, the distance between the interconnected equipment varies, and most often does not correspond to the particular standard cable length. Accordingly, technicians are left with cable slack that requires careful storage to prevent attenuation or damage of the cables through which signals are transmitted. Further, storage of cable slack interconnected between two pieces of equipment is not easily collected, as each of the ends of the cable is typically terminated prior to collection of the cable slack. That is, the technician is often required to gather and store the center slack portion <b>108</b> of a terminated cable <b>106</b>, as opposed to simply collecting slack at a free end of a cable.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Depending upon the particular length of the cable, and the distance between the two pieces of equipment, the length of the slack center portion <b>108</b> of a cable <b>106</b> can greatly vary. The present cable management devices are designed to reduce the occasion of having loose or hanging cable slack due to the varying length of the slack center portion <b>108</b>. Loose or hanging cable slack can be accidentally pulled or tugged, which may cause the cable to exceed a minimum bend radius and further result in subsequent loss of signal transmission through the cable. The present cable management devices reduce the occasion of loose cable slack by accommodating the storage of many different cable lengths. In the alternative, the present cable management devices reduce overall installation costs by eliminating the need to provide specific, different cable lengths in an attempt to match the distance between two pieces of equipment and avoid the occasion of loose cable slack.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In particular, the present cable management devices incrementally take up or accommodate the center slack portions of cables. In conventional arrangements, upper and lower spools are provided a set distance apart from one another. The center slack portion is wound about the upper and lower spools; however, in most cases, the distance between the spools does not correspond to the overall length of the center slack portion. The excess center slack portion is then often left to drape or hang from the spool in an un-stored or un-taut manner. As previously described, such loose slack can become damaged. In contrast to conventional arrangements having only a single storage length defined between upper and lower spools, the present cable management devices provide multiple storage lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">More specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 9</figref>, the cable management assembly <b>100</b> of the present disclosure typically includes the cable management device <b>10</b> used in combination with another component or device, such as a spool <b>80</b>. The spool <b>80</b> can be a half-spool or a full-spool having a radius limiting structure <b>82</b>. In use, the technician selectively routes the center cable slack portion <b>108</b> of a cable about the spool <b>80</b> and one or more of the three radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> of the cable-managing arrangement <b>12</b> to accommodate an entire length of the center slack portion <b>108</b> without the occasion of loose cable slack.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, wrapping a first slack cable length of the center slack portion <b>108</b> completely around the spool <b>80</b> and an uppermost radius limiting surface <b>20</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) defines a first storage length L<b>1</b>. Wrapping a second slack cable length of the center slack portion <b>108</b> completely around the spool <b>80</b> and a middle radius limiting surface <b>20</b><i>b </i>defines a second storage length L<b>2</b>. A third storage length L<b>3</b> corresponding to a lowermost radius limiting surface <b>20</b><i>c </i>is similarly defined. Because of the descending segmented arrangement of each of the radius limiting surfaces, the first, second and third storage lengths L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b>, and L<b>3</b> are different from one another. When storing the center slack portion <b>108</b> of the cable <b>106</b>, a majority of the length of the center slack portion <b>108</b> can be wound or wrapped about the spool <b>80</b> and the uppermost radius limiting surface <b>20</b><i>a</i>, for example. Any excess of slack portion <b>108</b> not having a remaining length equivalent to the first storage length can be wrapped around one of the middle or lowermost radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>having a shorter storage length. That is, as the slack cable length shortens, the technician can selectively wrap the cable around the middle or lowermost radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>to incrementally take up the entire length of cable slack.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, two nested cable management devices <b>10</b> are provided. The nested devices <b>10</b> are stacked or positioned in close proximity to one another to provide a denser and more incremental cable management solution. That is, because of the descending segmented design of the devices, a lower second device <b>10</b> can be tucked under an upper first device in a space provided in the footprint of the upper device <b>10</b>. The space, similar to a stairwell space, accommodates the nesting of the devices to provide a denser cable management solution than provided by conventional arrangement having spools simply vertically aligned along a plane.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the nested cable management devices <b>10</b> offer six radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>f </i>that provide six storage lengths L<b>1</b>-L<b>6</b>. Because of the stepped cable-managing arrangement of the devices <b>10</b>, each of the six storage lengths L<b>1</b>-L<b>6</b> is different from each of the other storage lengths providing even greater versatility in accommodating varying cable slack lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, the plurality of radius limiting surfaces of the present cable-managing device <b>10</b> are provided in a footprint that is smaller than conventional arrangements utilizing instead a number of separate spools. In such conventional arrangements, the spools are vertically aligned along a plane. As can be understood, the spools must be sufficiently spaced apart from one another to provide a clearance space between spools so that the tabs, for example, do not interfere with the other spools. The disclosed cable management device has multiple radius limiting surfaces that project forwardly from one another so that clearance for the cable retaining structure <b>22</b>, for example, is provide forward of the preceding radius limiting surface; similarly, in the case of nesting devices, clearance for the cable retaining structure is provide under the “stairwell” space of the descending arrangement of surfaces. Accordingly, the footprint in which multiple radius limiting surfaces are provided is smaller in the present device <b>10</b> as compared to conventional arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another method of use, the segmented cable-managing arrangement of the device(s) <b>10</b> offer the technician an opportunity to separate slack cable from other slack cable in a neat and organized manner. That is, another method of using the disclosed cable management device <b>10</b> includes separating and storing cable slack about designated radius limiting surfaces or elements and the spool <b>80</b>, for example. Although in each of the previous methods of use, the devices are described in combination with the use of spools <b>80</b>, other types of cable management components, such as finger devices, constructions having edge protections, and channel guides that contain cabling, for example, can also be used in accordance with the principles disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>, alternative embodiments of a cable management device, in accordance with the principles discloses, are illustrated. Each of the alternative cable management devices is similarly configured as that of the first embodiment to manage the center slack portion <b>108</b> of cable <b>106</b>. In particular, each device includes a segmented cable-managing arrangement designed to incrementally take up the entire length of a cable slack portion <b>108</b> of a cable.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the second embodiment of the cable management device <b>110</b>, includes a segmented cable-managing arrangement <b>112</b> interconnected to a back plate <b>14</b> having securing structure <b>16</b> that detachably secures the device <b>110</b> to the panel <b>90</b>. Similar to the previous embodiment, the segmented cable-managing arrangement <b>112</b> includes a plurality of radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> vertically and forwardly offset from one another in a descending stepped relationship. The radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> are defined by radius limiting elements <b>30</b>. The radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> of each of the radius limiting elements <b>30</b> is discrete or separate from the other radius limiting surface, and is oriented such that the radius limiting surface <b>20</b> extends outward or in a generally perpendicular direction relative to the back plate <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The radius limiting elements <b>30</b> and the back plate <b>14</b> of the cable management device <b>110</b> are the same as described with respect to the first embodiment. For example, the radius limiting elements <b>30</b> include cable retaining structures <b>22</b>, such as tabs <b>24</b>, that extend upward from the radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b>. The device <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, however, illustrates a different mounting bracket embodiment <b>140</b> that can be used to mount the radius limiting elements <b>30</b> in a stepped or descending, segmented relationship. The alternative mounting bracket <b>140</b> includes mounting plates <b>158</b> to which the flanges (<b>34</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the radius limiting elements <b>30</b> mount.

That is, the front mounting plate <b>274</b> is secured to front mounting structure <b>276</b> formed on the inside of the arcuate structure <b>232</b>. The middle radius limiting element <b>230</b> can then be mounted and secured to the front mounting plate <b>274</b> of the preceding (uppermost) radius limiting element <b>230</b>. As can be understood, this assembly method can continue to provide any number of stepped radius limiting surfaces <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, still another embodiment of a cable management device <b>310</b> having features in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure is illustrated. The illustrated cable management device <b>310</b> includes a segmented cable-managing arrangement <b>312</b> interconnected to a back plate <b>14</b> having securing structure <b>16</b> that detachably secures the device <b>310</b> to the panel <b>90</b>. Similar to the previous embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>10</b>, and <b>11</b>, the securing structure <b>16</b> of the back plate <b>14</b> of the cable management device <b>310</b> includes first and second securing elements <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, a flexible tab <b>66</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>), and a locating element <b>60</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) to permit easy attachment and detachment of the device from the panel <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The segmented cable-managing arrangement <b>312</b> includes a plurality of radius limiting surfaces <b>320</b>, and a plurality of cable retaining structures <b>322</b>, such as tabs <b>324</b>, to retain cable on the radius limiting surfaces <b>320</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the segmented radius limiting surfaces <b>20</b> are defined as sections of a continuous surface <b>354</b>. The continuous surface <b>354</b> is defined by a single arcuate structure <b>332</b>. The tabs <b>324</b> extend upward from the continuous surface <b>354</b> and define the segmented or sectioned radius limiting surfaces <b>320</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the tabs <b>324</b> define four segmented radius limiting surfaces <b>320</b> of the continuous surface <b>354</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The arcuate structure <b>332</b> of the cable management device <b>310</b> is configured as half-spool extending approximately 180 degrees. It is contemplated that the arcuate structure <b>332</b> can extend more or less than 180 degrees depending upon the telecommunication application in which the element will be used. The arcuate structure <b>332</b> includes a flange or back wall (not shown) having mounting structure for securing the radius limiting element arcuate structure <b>332</b> directly to the back plate <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the continuous surface <b>354</b> of the arcuate structure <b>332</b> is oriented such that the radius limiting surfaces <b>320</b> angle downward in a non-perpendicular direction relative to the back plate <b>14</b>. The angled orientation of the continuous surface <b>354</b> vertically and forwardly offsets the segmented radius limiting surfaces <b>320</b> from one another in a descending relationship; which provides the incremental cable slack storage previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The present cable management devices (e.g., <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>) provide flexibility in permitting a technician to manage and store cables of different lengths without the occasion of loose cable slack. The above specification provides a complete description of the cable management assembly, system, and method. Since many embodiments of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, the invention resides in the claims hereinafter appended.</p>
