<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Device isolation of a semiconductor device may be achieved by local oxidation of silicon or by shallow-trench isolation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref> illustrate a conventional method for fabricating a semiconductor device using shallow-trench isolation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> having an active area and a non-active area is prepared. A pad oxide layer <b>101</b> and a pad nitride layer <b>107</b> are sequentially deposited on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a photoresist is coated on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, including the pad oxide layer <b>101</b> and the pad nitride layer <b>107</b>, and is then patterned by photolithography, thereby forming a photoresist pattern PR on the pad nitride layer <b>107</b>. The photoresist is patterned to cover the active area of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Subsequently, the exposed portion of the pad oxide layer <b>101</b> is etched and removed with the patterned photoresist PR used as a mask.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, after removing the photoresist pattern PR, the exposed pad oxide layer <b>101</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> are removed with the patterned pad nitride layer <b>107</b> used as a mask.

Wherever possible, like reference designations will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or similar parts.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2H</figref> illustrate a semiconductor device fabricated in accordance with an first exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a semiconductor substrate <b>200</b>, including an active area and a non-active area, is prepared. A pad oxide layer <b>201</b> and a pad nitride layer <b>207</b> are sequentially deposited on the entire upper surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b>. The pad nitride layer <b>207</b> can be formed of silicon nitride. The remaining portions of a semiconductor device will be formed on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a photoresist is coated on the entire upper surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b>, including the pad oxide layer <b>201</b> and the pad nitride layer <b>207</b>, and the coated photoresist is then patterned by photolithography. Thus, a photoresist pattern PR is formed on the pad nitride layer <b>207</b> provided on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b>. At this time, the photoresist is patterned to cover the active area of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b>. With the photoresist pattern PR used as a mask, the exposed pad oxide layer <b>201</b> is etched and removed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, after removing the photoresist pattern PR, the exposed pad oxide layer <b>201</b> and the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b> are removed with the patterned nitride layer <b>207</b> used as a mask, thereby forming a trench <b>202</b> in the non-active area of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although not shown, when performing an etching process with the photoresist pattern PR used as a mask, the pad oxide layer <b>201</b>, the pad nitride layer <b>207</b> and the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b> may be etched in sequence to form the trench <b>202</b> in the non-active area of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, an insulating layer is deposited on the entire upper surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b>, including the trench <b>202</b>, and then chemical-mechanical polishing is performed to the deposited insulating layer. The deposited insulating layer is planarized until the pad nitride layer <b>207</b> is exposed. As a result, the insulating layer is selectively formed inside the trench <b>202</b>.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, a passivation layer <b>204</b> is formed on each of the entire lower and upper surfaces of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b>.

The passivation layer <b>204</b> formed on the entire lower surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b> covers the pad oxide layer <b>201</b>, and the pad nitride layer <b>207</b>. At this time, the passivation layer <b>204</b> prevents the pad nitride layer <b>207</b> formed on the lower surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b> from being etched.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, the passivation layer <b>204</b> formed on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, the device isolation layer <b>203</b> is exposed by removing the patterned pad nitride layer <b>207</b> and the patterned pad oxide layer <b>201</b> from the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, the pad nitride layer <b>207</b> is exposed by removing the passivation layer <b>204</b> formed on the lower surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
