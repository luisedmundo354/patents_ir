<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for recycling a printed circuit board. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for recycling also an insulating material, which composes a printed circuit board.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, a printed circuit board, which is mainly utilized in electric equipment, has been made of fiberglass and epoxy resin, which is a sort of thermosetting resin. A method for recycling the printed circuit board according to a prior art has been available only for retrieving and recycling printed metallic material composing a printed circuit wiring. Therefore, after separating and retrieving the printed metallic material, residual insulating material and so on are only available for thermal energy by incinerating them, or bury in the ground as a waste.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the above prior art, the printed metallic material is retrieved. However, the insulating material such as thermoplastic resin and the like composing a board material are not retrieved as reusable material, and this residual insulating material causes an increase of the waste. Therefore, this is an important requirement to reduce emission of the waste and carbon dioxide for the preservation of the environment on the earth. Also it is an important requirement to utilize the resources on the earth efficiently. In the present state of affairs, not only a manufacturer of a printed circuit board but also a manufacturer of electric equipment, which utilizes a printed circuit board, has a long-pending requirement to establish a method for recycling a printed circuit board so as to retrieve and to recycle both the printed metallic material and the insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Considering the above requirements, the object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus of recycling a printed circuit board so that both a printed metallic material and an insulating material composing a printed circuit board are separated and retrieved, and that those retrieved materials are available for recycling.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To accomplish the above first object, the present invention provides a method of recycling a printed circuit board so that both metallic material and insulating material are separated and retrieved from a waste printed circuit board, which is disposed in waste electric equipment or which is a waste produced in a process of manufacturing electric equipment. The printed circuit board is composed of the insulating material and the metallic material, which involves the printed metallic material. At first, the printed circuit board is heated. Then, only the insulating material passes through a filter by force-filtration of the heated printed circuit board. By this heating and force-filtering of the filter and the like, the insulating material is separated and retrieved from mixture of insulating material and metallic material composing the printed circuit board. For example, it is easy to separate and to retrieve from the mixture of insulating material and metallic material using the filter, the mesh size of which is sufficiently large so that the filter passes only the insulating material and does not pass the printed metallic material.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">At least either the insulating material or the metallic material, which is separated and retrieved in the above way, is available for recycling. When the amounts of the retrieved insulating material and the retrieved metallic material are sufficiently large for recycling respectively, both of them are available for recycling.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The force-filtration means a filtration with heating and pressurizing the printed circuit board. This force-filtration promotes the efficiency of the filtration by the filter or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The printed circuit board, which is separated and retrieved into the insulating material and the metallic material, is composed of an insulating body base and a conductive printed circuit. The insulating body base is made of either thermoplastic resin or mixture of thermoplastic resin and inorganic loading material. The conductive printed circuit is made of printed metallic material, which is disposed on the insulating body base. The conductive printed circuit is formed on the insulating body base, which is called an insulating body base printed with conductive circuit. After that, the insulating body bases printed with conductive circuit are stacked together, adhered together by heating and pressurizing, and formed into a multi-layer printed circuit board. When the resin material composing the insulating material in the printed circuit board is thermoplastic resin or mixture of thermoplastic resin and inorganic loading material, not only the printed metallic material but also the insulating material is surely recycled. Therefore, after separating and retrieving, the retrieved insulating material is also formed into a predetermined shape by heating. Moreover, when even the stacked multi-layer printed circuit board is heated in separating and retrieving process up to a predetermined temperature, which is nearly the process temperature for forming the stacked multi-layer printed circuit board in the above stacking process, the stacked multi-layer printed circuit board is sufficiently softened so as to deform plastically. Then, only the insulating material passes by means of the above force-filtration.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The characteristic of the insulating material around at the temperature for forming the stacked multi-layer printed circuit board in the above stacking process is as follows. It is preferred that elastic modulus of thermoplastic resin is in the range of 1 MPa to 1000 MPa at a predetermined heating temperature in heating and pressurizing. Therefore, in the separating and retrieving process, when the stacked multi-layer printed circuit board is heated up to nearly the process temperature for forming the stacked multi-layer printed circuit board in the stacking process, the elastic modulus of thermoplastic resin is sufficiently reduced so that it is easy to perform the separating and retrieving operation such as filtering and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the printed circuit board has the following character, it is preferred that a conductive product in the printed circuit board is made of metallic material only, or mixture of metallic material and either thermoplastic resin composing the insulating body base or mixture of thermoplastic resin and inorganic loading material comprising the insulating body base. The character of the printed circuit board is that the insulating body base in the printed circuit board is a resin film, which is made of either thermoplastic resin or mixture of thermoplastic resin and inorganic loading material, and that conductive printed circuits formed on the printed circuit board are electrically connected together by the conductive product integrally formed in a via-hole, which is formed in the insulating body base. The retrieved insulating material may entrap a contamination of the conductive product, which composes an interlayer bonding material, during the separating and retrieving the insulating material from the printed circuit board. The retrieved insulating material is not reduced in its purity, and is expected to have the equivalent characteristics to the before-retrieving insulating material, because the composition of the contamination is the same as that of the insulating material composing the insulating body base.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An apparatus of recycling the printed circuit board performs to separate the insulating material and the metallic material by passing the insulating material only in the above heating and filtering process. This apparatus is composed of a pressurizing means for pressurizing the printed circuit board, a heating means for heating the printed circuit board up to a predetermined temperature, at which at least the printed circuit board is softened, and a filtering means for filtering the insulating material, which composes the insulating body base, from the printed circuit board maintained at the predetermined temperature by the heating means. The heating means for heating the printed circuit board can soften the thermoplastic material composing the printed circuit board, when the printed circuit board is recycled as a waste printed circuit board, in which the resin material is thermoplastic resin. Moreover, the pressurizing means provides the force-filtration to pass the thermoplastic resin only, and the filtering means provides for separating and retrieving easily. For example, the heating means maintains the temperature, which is near the process temperature for forming the printed circuit board by hot forming in primary product process. Then, the resin material, which is melted, is separated and retrieved easily by the filtering means.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The pressurizing means includes a driving shaft, a driving unit, and a holder unit. The driving shaft has a rotational body to transport the printed circuit board. The driving unit rotates the driving shaft. The holder unit accommodates the rotational body. The pressurizing means generates a predetermined pressure caused by rotating force of the rotational body, and applies the pressure on an inner circumference wall of the holder unit, which accommodates the rotational body. The above pressurizing means is an example of the means for plastically deforming the thermoplastic resin, which is heated up to the predetermined temperature and softened, so as to force-filter the thermoplastic resin composing the printed circuit board. This pressurizing means transports the printed circuit board by the rotational body and pressurizes the printed circuit board by the transport pressure by rotating the rotational body.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The rotational body to pressurize the printed circuit board in above way has a helical rotational body. The driving unit rotates the rotational body in the helical direction. It is preferred that the filtering means is disposed on an inner circumference wall of the holder unit and is disposed on the side of a top end of the rotational body. This top end is driven in the helical direction of the rotational body. The rotational force, which rotates the helical rotational body in the helical direction, generates a centrifugal force and a feeding force, i.e., pressurizing force by transport pressure. The centrifugal force is a radial component force along with a helical rotational direction, and the feeding force is an axial component force along with an axial direction. Therefore, the more the printed circuit board feeds to the top end, which is driven in the helical direction of the rotational body, the more the printed circuit board is pressurized. Moreover, when the filter in the filtering means is disposed and exposed on the inner circumference wall of the holder unit, the filtering performance prevents from reducing because the feeding force along with the axial direction eliminates the metallic material accumulated in the filtering means. Accordingly, it is easy to filter the resin material by the filtering means, and the resin material is filtered efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The filtering means has the filter to pass the resin material only from the waste printed circuit board. It is preferred that the filter is disposed and exposed on the inner circumference wall of the holder unit. Then, the resin material is retrieved in the radial outward direction of the driving shaft. Therefore, the filter has an ability that only the resin material is easily passed through the filter from the pressurized printed circuit board because the filter is disposed and exposed on the inner circumference wall of the holder unit, of which the inner circumference wall is applied the pressurizing force by the above rotational force.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is preferred that the filter is made of sintered metal. This filter may be formed to have a mesh hole, which filters the filtering object and is a meandering mesh hole, not a straight through hole. Accordingly, the filter has meandering mesh holes that pass the resin material, and the metallic material is prevented to pass through the filter because even long and thin needle-like metallic material can be caught by the meandering mesh hole.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Considering a relationship between the pressurizing means and the filtering means for passing the resin material only by the force-filtration, it is preferred that the driving shaft of the rotational body is disposed in the vertical direction. When the filter passes the resin material only from the mixture of the resin material and the metallic material, the metallic material, which is not passed through the filtering means, precipitates vertically downward. Moreover, the resin material is pressed to the inner circumference wall by pressurizing force by the above rotational force.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A reservoir means reserves the separated metallic material by the filtering means, which separates and retrieves the metallic material and the resin material. It is preferred that a space, which is provided by the reservoir means and reserves the metallic material, is disposed on one end of the inner circumference wall of the holder unit, which is opposite to the driving unit. In other words, the end of the inner circumference wall of the holder unit, which is opposite to the driving unit and composes the pressurizing means, has the space to reserve the metallic material. Accordingly, the metallic material deposits and fills the space in accordance with separating and retrieving the resin material by the filtering means from the mixture of the metallic material and the resin material, which compose the printed circuit board transported by the rotational body.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The heating means is disposed on the inner circumference wall of the holder unit, and has a heater for heating the waste printed circuit board. An aggregation is occurred by rotation of the rotational body, and the aggregation generates a frictional heat by collision of the printed circuit boards together. This frictional heat assists the heater for heating the printed circuit board, and an energy consumption of the heater is reduced.</p>

Besides, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is also a schematic block diagram showing a recycling system to perform the method of recycling the printed circuit board according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the overall system for the method of recycling the printed circuit board is composed of a waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> as a work piece <b>1</b>, a part elimination means <b>2</b> for eliminating mounted parts so as to primary-process the work piece <b>1</b>, a solder elimination means <b>3</b> for eliminating solder so as to secondary-process the work piece <b>1</b>, a hot filtration means <b>4</b> for performing after the primary and secondary processes, a resin-forming means <b>5</b> for resin-forming an insulating material, which is separated and retrieved by the hot filtration means <b>4</b>, and a metal refining and separating means <b>6</b> for refining a printed metallic material, which is separated and retrieved by the hot filtration means <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> is a printed circuit board <b>100</b> used in waste electric equipment or a so-called waste printed circuit board as a waste produced in a process of manufacturing electric equipment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> includes circuit boards <b>21</b>, which are composed of insulating body bases <b>23</b> and conductive printed circuits <b>22</b>, a mounted part <b>70</b>, which is mounted on the circuit board <b>21</b>, and solder <b>80</b>, which connect the mounted part <b>70</b> and the circuit board <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the circuit boards <b>21</b> such as conductive printed circuit film or the like (i.e., conductive printed circuit film <b>21</b>) are stacked into a multi-layer circuit board, the multi-layer circuit board has a conductive product <b>51</b>. The conductive product <b>51</b> is made of interlayer binding material to connect the conductive printed circuits <b>22</b> together, i.e., to connect layers electrically together. Then, the multi-layer circuit board of the conductive printed circuit films <b>21</b> composes an insulating body base printed with conductive circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The printed circuit board <b>100</b>, which is recycled as the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment, has properties of a work piece as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At first, the insulating body base <b>23</b> is made of insulating material, which may be any kind of insulating material such as a resin film as long as the insulating material is either thermoplastic resin only or mixture of thermoplastic resin and inorganic loading material.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">However, when solder is used for mounting the mounted part <b>70</b> such as semiconductor device and the like on the printed circuit board <b>100</b>, the insulating material composing the insulating body base <b>23</b> is limited to a material that is possible to heat more than 250 degrees Celsius among the above thermoplastic resin only or the above mixture of thermoplastic resin and inorganic loading material. For example, those materials are polyether ether ketone (i.e., PEEK) resin, polyether imide (i.e., PEI) resin, mixture of PEEK resin and PEI resin, thermoplastic polyimide (i.e., thermoplastic PI) resin, polyphenylene sulfide (i.e., PPS) resin, and liquid crystal polymer (i.e., LCP).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The inorganic loading material is an additive for the purpose of adjusting physical properties of the printed circuit board <b>100</b>. For example, silica (i.e., SiO<sub>2</sub>) powder is added in the printed circuit board <b>100</b> to decrease a coefficient of thermal expansion, aluminum nitride (i.e., AlN) powder is added to increase a coefficient of thermal conductivity, fiber glass is added to increase a mechanical strength, and so on. These additives are added in accordance with their purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The insulating body base <b>23</b> in the first embodiment is made of the insulating material composed of a resin film <b>23</b>. The resin film <b>23</b> is made of mixture of PEEK resin and PEI resin, and mica (i.e., KMg<sub>3</sub>(SiAl<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>)F<sub>4</sub>, etc) is added in the mixture of PEEK resin and PEI resin as an inorganic loading material. The weight ratio of the PEEK resin to the PEI resin is 38:62, and the weight ratio of the mixture of the PEEK resin and the PEI resin to the mica is 100:15.5.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The printed metallic material may be any kind of metallic material such as copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni), silver (Ag), copper alloy, silver alloy, or the like. The printed metallic material in the first embodiment is copper foil. For example, after the copper foil is press-contacted and adhered to the above resin film <b>23</b>, the conductive printed circuit <b>22</b> is formed by eliminating unwanted part from the copper foil, e.g., etching or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The conductive printed circuit film <b>21</b> is constructed by forming the conductive printed circuit <b>22</b> on the surface of the resin film <b>23</b>. After that, a hole as a via-hole <b>24</b> for interlayer bonding is formed by laser beam drilling in the resin film <b>23</b>, and so on. Then, a conductive bonding paste <b>50</b> as an interlayer bonding material is filled into the via-hole <b>24</b>, and is formed into the conductive product <b>51</b> to connect the conductive printed circuits <b>22</b> electrically. This electric connection is not only in a so-called electrical contact continuity but also in an electrical connection by solid phase diffusion between metals according to the third embodiment described later, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, the elimination means <b>2</b> for eliminating the mounted part shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (i.e., part elimination means <b>2</b>) is for eliminating the mounted part <b>70</b> such as a semiconductor device and so on. This part elimination means <b>2</b> is performed by well-known method. For example, it may be a mechanical elimination means for removing the mounted part <b>70</b> mechanically at room temperature, a hot elimination means for removing the mounted part <b>70</b> by heating up to the melting temperature of solder in the printed circuit board <b>100</b>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the printed circuit board <b>100</b> is assembled in the electric equipment, it is necessary to remove the assembled printed circuit board <b>100</b> from the electric equipment. This removing method is performed by any kind of removing method such as destroying the electric equipment, disassembling a connector for joining the printed circuit board <b>100</b> to the electric equipment, or the like. In the first embodiment, the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> is removed from the electric equipment by disassembling the connector for joining the printed circuit board <b>100</b> to the electric equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The solder elimination means <b>3</b> is for eliminating a solder <b>80</b>. The solder <b>80</b> is a residual solder, which is in the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> after removing the mounted part <b>70</b> by the mechanical elimination means as the part elimination means <b>2</b>, a melted solder, which is melted by the hot elimination means, or a re-solidified solder, which is re-solidified by cooling after the hot elimination means. This solder elimination means <b>3</b> is performed by well-known method, for example, a mechanical solder elimination means for removing the solder mechanically using a grinder and the like, a chemical solder eliminating means for dissolving the solder chemically using a mixture of hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid and the like, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The hot filtration means <b>4</b> heats and force-filters the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>, after the mounted part <b>70</b> such as a semiconductor device and the solder <b>80</b> are eliminated from the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> by the part elimination means <b>2</b> and the solder elimination means <b>3</b> respectively. This hot filtration means <b>4</b> is capable of separating and retrieving an insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and a printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>by filtering only the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>from the mixture of the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which are components of the printed circuit board <b>100</b>. The details of the means and the procedure to filter only the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>by heating and force-filtering the printed circuit board <b>100</b> as the work piece <b>1</b> is described later.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The insulating material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which is separated and retrieved from the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>, is formed into recycled material products by the resin-forming means <b>5</b>. This resin-forming means <b>5</b> is performed by well-known method for forming into the recycled resin products <b>1</b><i>a</i>A. The printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which is also separated and retrieved from the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>, is formed into recycled material products by the metal refining and separating means <b>6</b>. This metal refining and separating means <b>6</b> is performed by well-known method for refining and separating in each metallic category.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the hot filtration means <b>4</b> to filter the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>only by heating and force-filtering the printed circuit board <b>100</b> as the work piece <b>1</b> is performed by hot filtration equipment <b>4</b><i>a</i>. The hot filtration equipment <b>4</b><i>a </i>is composed of a filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, a punching metal <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, a pressurized room PR, a depressurized room DP, and a casing <b>4</b><i>a</i>H. The pressurized room PR and the depressurized room DP are divided by the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and so on, and are accommodated in the casing <b>4</b><i>a</i>H. The casing <b>4</b><i>a</i>H accommodates the pressurized room PR and the depressurized room DP, and has a hermetically sealed construction by screwing a sealing material <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The work piece <b>1</b> is placed on the bottom of the pressurized room PR, and is heated up to the melting temperature by a heater and the like (not shown). The work piece <b>1</b> is also pressurized by air introduced from an air introduction port, which is disposed upside of the pressurized room PR. The filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, which is disposed over the punching metal <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, is disposed under the pressurized room PR. A mesh size of the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> is selected so as to pass the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>therethrough and not to pass the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The depressurized room DR is disposed under the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, and is depressurized by force-exhausting air by a pump (not shown) from an air exhaust port, which is disposed upside of the depressurized room DR. The force-filtration is performed by the differential pressure between the pressurized room PR and the depressurized room DP, because the work piece <b>1</b>, which is placed in the pressurized room PR, especially the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which is passing through the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, is pressurized by the differential pressure. The insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is extruded into the depressurized room DR through the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, and is retrieved from the downside of the casing <b>4</b><i>a</i>H in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, the work piece <b>1</b> is heated up to 400 degrees Celsius, and is pressurized to 10 MPa in the pressurized room PR. Then, only the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>in the work piece <b>1</b> is passed through the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, which is composed of a minimum sized mesh (in detail, e.g., item #50 mesh) made of stainless. The printed metallic material, which is not passed through the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, remains on the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>. Then, the hot filtration equipment <b>4</b><i>a </i>is separated by its center so as to retrieve the printed metallic material.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the first embodiment, the hot filtration equipment <b>4</b><i>a </i>is described as the equipment for filtering the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>as the work piece <b>1</b> through the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> by the differential pressure applied to the work piece <b>1</b>. The hot filtration equipment <b>4</b><i>a </i>may be equipment that applies the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>mechanically and force-filter the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>through the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>. Moreover, the hot filtration equipment <b>4</b><i>a </i>may be any kind of equipment that heats and pressurizes the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, and passes through the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The printed circuit board <b>100</b> is heated and force-filtered as the work piece <b>1</b>. Both a waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> that has an initial shape as it is and a waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> that is preliminary processed into easy-to-process shape by cutting may be used as the work piece <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the first embodiment, the insulating body base <b>23</b> of the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> is made of the mixture of thermoplastic resin and inorganic loading material. The above resin material passes easily through the mesh even at a comparably low pressure such as 10 MPa, because the elastic modulus of the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is sufficiently reduced at temperatures of 360 degrees Celsius or higher, according to a relation between a temperature and an elastic modulus of the insulating material shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">On the other hand, the copper (Cu) foil composing the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>(i.e., in detail, the copper foil composing the conductive printed circuit <b>22</b>) and the conductive product <b>51</b> made of the interlayer bonding material are in the solid state, in other words, in the solid phase, because elastic modulus of these materials is high around at 400 degrees Celsius and is different from that of the insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Therefore, the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the conductive product <b>51</b> are not passed through the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> unless these materials are heated up to the melting point and are melted. As a result, the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is separated and retrieved.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the process of recycling the printed circuit board according to the first embodiment of the present invention is described as follows. The recycling method according to the first embodiment is composed of separating and retrieving materials so as to be classified into material categories, and recycling the separated and retrieved materials. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the process of recycling is composed of part elimination process P<b>200</b>, solder elimination process P<b>300</b>, hot filtration process P<b>400</b>, resin forming process P<b>500</b>, and metal refining and separating process P<b>600</b>. In the resin forming process P<b>500</b>, the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which is separated and retrieved in the hot filtration process P<b>400</b>, is processed so as to utilize as resin products. In the metal refining and separating process P<b>600</b>, the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which is separated and retrieved in the hot filtration process P<b>400</b>, is processed so as to utilize as metallic materials.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Besides, when the printed circuit board <b>100</b> is assembled in the waste electric equipment, disassembling process is provided before the part elimination process P<b>200</b>. In the disassembling process, the printed circuit board <b>100</b> is removed from the waste electric equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the part elimination process P<b>200</b>, any of the mechanical elimination means for removing the mounted part <b>70</b> such as a semiconductor device mechanically at room temperature, the hot elimination means for removing the mounted part <b>70</b> by heating up to the melting temperature of solder, or the like may be used as the above part elimination means <b>2</b>. In the first embodiment, the printed circuit board <b>100</b> as the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> is heated up to 200 degrees Celsius, at which the solder is melted, and is scratched by a metallic knife so as to remove the mounted part <b>70</b>. The metallic knife contacts the surface of the printed circuit board <b>100</b> and moves parallel to the above printed circuit board <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the solder elimination process P<b>300</b>, any of the mechanical elimination means for removing the solder <b>80</b> mechanically, the hot elimination means for melting the solder <b>80</b>, or the like may be used as the above solder elimination means <b>3</b>. In the first embodiment, the surface of the printed circuit board <b>100</b> is abraded by an abrasive-grinder of item #320 mounted in a rotary-type grinder. Then, the solder <b>80</b> is eliminated by the abrasive-grinder.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the hot filtration process P<b>400</b>, the printed circuit board <b>100</b> as the work piece <b>1</b>, from which the mounted part <b>70</b> and the solder <b>80</b> are eliminated by means of the part elimination process P<b>200</b> and the solder elimination process P<b>300</b>, is heated and force-filtered by the hot filtration equipment <b>4</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>made of the resin material is softened by heating, and is filtered through the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>. Then, only the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is passed through the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>. The force-filtration is the filtration with heating and pressurizing, and the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is filtered efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In detail, in the hot filtration process P<b>400</b>, the work piece <b>1</b> is heated to 400 degrees Celsius, and is pressurized to 10 MPa in the pressurized room PR of the hot filtration equipment <b>4</b><i>a</i>. The mesh size of the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, which is a partition to divide the pressurized room PR and the depressurized room DR, is item #50 mesh. Besides, the heating temperature may be not only 400 degrees Celsius but also the temperature, at which the elastic modulus is sufficiently reduced according to the relation between the temperature and the elastic modulus of the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Moreover, the mesh size may be in the range of the mesh size that passes only the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>without blocking the mesh by the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The insulating material composing the insulating body base in the printed circuit board according to the prior art is made of thermosetting resin, and the elastic modulus of the thermosetting resin is not reduced even at high temperature. Therefore, it is impossible to separate and to retrieve the insulating material by means of such a simple method.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the resin forming process P<b>500</b>, the resin products for recycling are re-produced from the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which is separated and retrieved from the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>. The resin forming process P<b>500</b> is performed by a well-known method. In the metal refining and separating process P<b>600</b>, the metallic materials for recycling are re-produced from the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which is separated and retrieved from the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>. The metal refining and separating process P<b>600</b> is also performed by a well-known method to refine in each metallic category.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Recovery ratio of the insulating material and the printed metallic material by separating and retrieving in the hot filtration process P<b>400</b> is confirmed as follows. Copper, silver, and tin composing the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>may be contaminated into the insulating material. The conductive printed circuit <b>22</b> is made of copper, and the interlayer bonding material is made of silver and tin. The contamination of copper (Cu), silver (Ag), and tin (Sn) in the insulating material is measured using ion-coupled plasma (i.e., ICP) emission spectral analysis. The measurement of the contamination by the ICP emission spectral analysis is confirmed below 50 ppm, which is the limit of detection. It is confirmed that the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, and the interlayer bonding material <b>50</b> (Hereinafter, the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the interlayer bonding material <b>50</b> are defined as the printed metallic material.) are separated by the separating and retrieving method according to the first embodiment of the present invention, in other words, by the separating and retrieving method to separate the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>in the hot filtration process P<b>400</b>, wherein the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, and the interlayer bonding material <b>50</b> compose the printed circuit board <b>100</b>, i.e., the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>. The recovery ratio of the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>according to the first embodiment is 90 percent. However, it is easy to increase the recovery ratio of the insulating material by means of simple improvement of the equipment and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the above first embodiment, the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>composing the insulating body base <b>23</b> in the printed circuit board <b>100</b> is made of the thermoplastic resin or the mixture of thermoplastic resin and inorganic loading material. Therefore, not only the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>but also the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>are separated and retrieved. Then, the separated and retrieved insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is formed into a predetermined shape by heating, and is surely recycled.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Furthermore, in the above first embodiment, when the conductive printed circuit films <b>21</b> are adhered together and formed into the multi-layer circuit board by heating and pressurizing, the elastic modulus of the insulating material is sufficiently reduced by heating up to nearly the stacking temperature for forming the multi-layer circuit board in the hot filtration process P<b>400</b>. Then, the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is sufficiently softened so as to deform elastically. As a result, only the insulating material passes through the filter by means of the above force-filtration.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the hot filtration equipment <b>4</b><i>a </i>according to the first embodiment, a heater for heating the printed circuit board <b>100</b> as the work piece <b>1</b> provides the heating means for melting the insulating material lain the work piece <b>1</b>. Air at positive pressure is introduced into the pressurized room PR, and air at negative pressure is also introduced into the depressurized room DR, wherein the filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> is sandwiched between the pressurized room PR and the depressurized room DR. The differential pressure between the positive pressure and the negative pressure provides the pressurizing means for pressurizing the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>in the work piece <b>1</b>. The filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> provides the filtration means for filtering the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>in the work piece <b>1</b>. The casing <b>4</b><i>a</i>H provides the hermetically sealing means for hermetically sealing the pressurized room PR, in which the air at positive pressure is introduced, and the depressurized room DP, in which the air at negative pressure is introduced. The casing <b>4</b><i>a</i>H also provides the accommodation means for accommodating the pressurized room PR and the depressurized room DP. The filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> is disposed at the center of the casing <b>4</b><i>a</i>H, and divides the pressurized room PR and the depressurized room DP.</p>

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the second embodiment, equipment <b>51</b> is used as a substitute for hot filtration equipment <b>4</b><i>a </i>in the first embodiment.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Similar to the hot filtration equipment <b>4</b><i>a </i>according to the first embodiment, the resin-metal separation equipment <b>51</b> provides a hot filtration means <b>4</b> correspondents to hot filtration process P<b>400</b>, which is a part of the entire system to perform a method of recycling a printed circuit board <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Other processes in the second embodiment are available to use related equipments, and these related equipments correspondent to the other processes in the second embodiment are skipped to explain.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The resin-metal separation equipment <b>51</b> in the second embodiment is applied to the printed circuit board <b>100</b> as the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>. The printed circuit board <b>100</b> recycled according to the second embodiment is not only the so-called multi-layer printed circuit board <b>100</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), which is formed by stacking the conductive printed circuit films <b>21</b> and is described in the first embodiment, but also a single layer printed circuit board and also double layer printed circuit board. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the single layer printed circuit board is composed of an insulating body base <b>23</b>, and a conductive printed circuit <b>22</b> is formed on one side of the insulating body base <b>23</b>. The double layer printed circuit board (not shown) is composed of an insulating body base <b>23</b>, and two conductive printed circuits <b>22</b> are formed on both sides of the insulating body base <b>23</b>. Besides, in general, the single layer printed circuit board may not have a conductive product <b>51</b>, and the double layer printed circuit board may have the conductive product <b>51</b>. In the second embodiment, a printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, or a printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>and an interlayer bonding material <b>50</b> in the conductive product <b>51</b> are separated and retrieved from the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>by heating and force-filtering the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>. The printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>or the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the interlayer bonding material <b>50</b> in the second embodiment are called metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>for convenience. Thermoplastic resin or mixture of thermoplastic resin and inorganic loading material, which compose the insulating material in the insulating body base <b>23</b>, are called resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>for convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the resin-metal separation equipment <b>51</b> has following functions mainly, which are expressed as main means. The main means are composed of a waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>, a pressurizing means M<b>1</b>, a heating means M<b>2</b>, and a filtering means M<b>3</b>. The waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> is a work piece <b>1</b> to be separated to the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>. The pressurizing means M<b>1</b> pressurizes the work piece <b>1</b>. The heating means M<b>2</b> heats the work piece <b>1</b> up to a predetermined temperature so as to soften the work piece <b>1</b> at least. The filtering means M<b>3</b> filters the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>from the work piece <b>1</b>, which is maintained at the predetermined temperature by the heating means M<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The second embodiment is the method for recycling the printed circuit board <b>100</b> as the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>, which is made of thermoplastic resin. In the above means, the printed circuit board <b>100</b> is heated and softened by the heating means M<b>2</b>. Only the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>passes through a filter in force-filtration equipment of the pressurizing means M<b>1</b>, and it is easy to separate and to retrieve the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>by the filtering means M<b>3</b>. For example, the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>, which is a waste of the printed circuit board <b>100</b>, is heated by the heating means M<b>2</b>. Then, the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> is heated nearly up to a process temperature for hot-forming the printed circuit board <b>100</b> in a primary product process. The resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>in the printed circuit board <b>100</b> is melted, and it is easy to separate and to retrieve the melted resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>by the filtering means M<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the architecture and operation of the above means M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>3</b> are described in detail as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">At first, the pressurizing means M<b>1</b> is composed of a driving shaft <b>53</b>, a driving unit <b>54</b>, and a holder unit Ha. The driving shaft <b>53</b> has the above rotational body <b>53</b><i>a </i>to transport the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>. The driving unit <b>54</b> rotates the driving shaft <b>53</b>. The holder unit Ha accommodates the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>. A predetermined pressure is applied to an inner circumference wall Hah of the holder unit Ha, which accommodates the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>. The predetermined pressure is generated by transport pressure caused by rotating the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>. The waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> is transported by the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>, and is pressurized by the transport pressure of the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When the predetermined pressure generated by the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a </i>is sufficiently large, a filtration of the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is efficiently performed by the force-filtration of pressurizing means. On the other hand, even when the predetermined pressure is comparably small, the filtration of the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is performed by means of taking enough time for filtering. In other words, the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is separated and retrieved under any pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The heating means M<b>2</b> is disposed on the inner circumference wall Hah in the holder unit Ha, and involves a heater <b>55</b> to heat the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>. The heating means M<b>2</b> maintains the temperature of all around the inner circumference wall Hah in the holder unit Ha, in which the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> is placed. The waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>, which is the work piece <b>1</b> accommodated inside the inner circumference wall Hah of the holder ha, is easily maintained at the predetermined temperature, at which the printed circuit board <b>100</b> is softening at least. Moreover, aggregation of the work piece <b>1</b> is generated caused by rotating the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>. Then, the aggregation may generate a frictional heat by collision of the waste printed circuit boards <b>1</b> together. This frictional heat assists the heater <b>55</b> for heating the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>, and an energy consumption of the heater <b>55</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">For example, the heating temperature of the heater <b>55</b> in the heating means M<b>2</b> is controlled so that the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> as the work piece <b>1</b>, which is a waste of the printed circuit board <b>100</b>, is maintained at the predetermined temperature, which is nearly the process temperature for hot-forming the printed circuit board <b>100</b> in the primary product process. This temperature control enables to form the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>into a melting state, which is disposed inside the inner circumference wall Hah of the holder unit Ha. The holder unit Ha accommodates the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>, and covers the peripheral surface of the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>. A filter <b>56</b> to be mentioned later is disposed and exposed on the inner circumference wall Hah of the holder unit Ha. Therefore, a circumference wall <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the filter <b>56</b> also composes the same inner circumference wall Hah.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this second embodiment, the predetermined temperature maintained by the heater <b>55</b> is set to nearly the process temperature for hot-forming the printed circuit board <b>100</b> in the primary product process. The resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>in the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> made of thermoplastic resin is softened so that the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is separated and retrieved by the filtration means M<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The filtering means M<b>3</b> provides the filter <b>56</b> to pass the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>only from the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> as the work piece <b>1</b>. The filter <b>56</b> is dispose and exposed on the inner circumference wall Hah of the holder unit Ha. The resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is retrieved in a radial outward direction of the driving shaft <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Therefore, the filter <b>56</b> passes the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>only (in detail, the melted resin material <b>1</b><i>a</i>) from the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> with pressurizing, because the filter <b>56</b> is disposed and exposed on the inner circumference wall Hah of the holder unit Ha, and the predetermined pressure is applied on the inner circumference wall Hah by the transport pressure of the above pressurizing means M<b>1</b> (in detail, caused by rotating the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The filter <b>56</b> is made of sintered metal. In general, the sintered metal has porous structure, and the porous structure forms meandering filter passages, because single holes in the porous structure are connected together, and so on. Therefore, the mesh hole of the filter <b>56</b>, which passes and filters the filtering material through therein, is formed into meandering filter passages, not into straight through holes. Therefore, the filter has meandering mesh holes that pass through the resin material <b>1</b><i>a</i>. The metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>is prevented to pass through the meandering mesh holes, because even long and thin needle-like metallic material can be caught by the meandering mesh holes.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Besides, the filter <b>56</b> may be used to any kind of filter that has mesh holes to pass the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and not to pass the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>. For example, that is disk-filter, ceramic-filter, urethane foaming filter, or the like. The disk-filter has a multi-layer structure stacking a stainless filter. The filter <b>56</b> made of the sintered metal is provided at low cost, compared with the disk-filter that is assembled in complicated structure.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the second embodiment, the filter <b>56</b> is made of the sintered metal that is formed by stainless (SUS) as a metallic material. The dimension of the mesh hole is 50 microns. When the dimension of the mesh hole is in the range of 25-200 microns, the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>can be separated from the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>. When the dimension of the mesh hole reduces, the life of the filter <b>56</b> is shortened. When the filter <b>56</b> is made of the sintered metal, the dimension of the mesh hole can be enlarged about 200 microns by substitution of stainless (SUS) to copper (Cu) as a sintered metal.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> is a multi-layer printed circuit board, it is preferred that the dimension of the mesh hole is below 100 microns, because the conductive product <b>51</b> made of the interlayer bonding material <b>50</b> is about 100-200 microns in average size.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the second embodiment, even when the comparably high pressure is applied to the circumference wall <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the filter <b>56</b>, the filter <b>56</b> is guaranteed the quality in its mechanical strength, which is due to the structural strength of the sintered metal. Therefore, the filtering area, which extends over the circumference wall <b>56</b><i>a</i>, is comparably wide even in comparably high pressure. A predetermined amount of the work piece <b>1</b> (in detail, the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>) is processed in a batch, without dividing the work piece <b>1</b>. As a result, the productivity for separating the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>promotes.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">When the filter <b>56</b> is made of the sintered metal, as mentioned above, the dimension of the mesh holes is defined by the metallic material comprising the filter <b>56</b>. Therefore, the dimension of the mesh holes is decided in substantially high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the printed circuit board <b>100</b>, which is recycled as the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>, the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>composing the insulating body base <b>23</b> may be used to any kind of insulating material that is made of thermoplastic resin only or mixture of thermoplastic resin and inorganic loading material, such as resin film. For example, those are polyether ether ketone (i.e., PEEK) resin, polyether imide (i.e., PEI) resin, mixture of PEEK resin and PEI resin, thermoplastic polyimide (i.e., thermoplastic PI) resin, polyphenylene sulfide (i.e., PPS) resin, and liquid crystal polymer (i.e., LCP). Therefore, the resin material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which is separated and retrieved by the resin-metal separation equipment <b>51</b>, is a kind of thermoplastic resin even when any kind of the above resin composes the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the retrieved resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>has the same composition, and is expected to have the equivalent characteristics to the before-retrieving resin material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, i.e., the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">A retrieving outlet <b>57</b><i>a </i>is disposed under a top end <b>53</b><i>as </i>of the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>. The metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which is remained by filtering through the filter <b>56</b>, is collected into the retrieving outlet <b>57</b><i>a</i>, and retrieved from the retrieving outlet <b>57</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a </i>is possible to slide up and down. In filtering process, the top end <b>53</b><i>as </i>of the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a </i>slides downward and contacts the retrieving outlet <b>57</b><i>a</i>. Then, the retrieving outlet <b>57</b><i>a </i>is closed by the top end <b>53</b><i>as </i>of the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, in filtering process, the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is not leaked from the retrieving outlet <b>57</b><i>a</i>, and is pressurized by the transport pressure caused by rotating the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>. On the other hand, after filtering process, the top end <b>53</b><i>as </i>slides upward. Then, a predetermined clearance between the top end <b>53</b><i>as </i>and the retrieving outlet <b>57</b><i>a </i>is provided. As the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a </i>is rotated with having the predetermined clearance, the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which does not pass though the filter <b>56</b>, extrudes into the retrieving outlet <b>37</b> through the above clearance.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">According to the second embodiment, the printed circuit board <b>100</b> as the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>, of which the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is made of thermoplastic resin, is recycled, and the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is separated and retrieved efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the second embodiment, it is preferable to provide following character.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The rotational body <b>53</b><i>a </i>in the pressurizing means M<b>1</b> has a helical body structure, and the driving unit <b>54</b> rotates the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a </i>in a helical direction (i.e., a direction of an arrow shown in the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) by the driving shaft <b>53</b>. The filtering means M<b>3</b> (in detail, the filter <b>56</b>) is disposed on the inner circumference wall Hah at the side of the top end <b>53</b><i>as</i>, which is drove in the helical direction of the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>. The helical rotational body <b>53</b><i>a </i>rotates in the helical direction, and a rotational force of the helical rotational body <b>53</b><i>a </i>generates a centrifugal force and a feeding force. The centrifugal force is a radial component of the rotational force along with a helical rotational direction. The feeding force, i.e., the pressurizing force by transport pressure, is an axial component of the rotational force along with an axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> is fed and pressurized by the transport pressure caused by rotating the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the more the printed circuit board <b>1</b> feeds to the top end <b>53</b><i>as </i>of the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>, which is drove in the helical direction, the more the printed circuit board is pressurized.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The helical shape of the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a </i>has a lead angle (i.e., screw lead angle) of non-equal pitch. The more it goes to the helical direction, i.e., to the top end <b>53</b><i>as</i>, the more the screw lead angle is reduced. This screw lead angle of non-equal pitch increases the transport pressure, which is the axial component of the rotational force, compared with the radial component of the rotational force. Then, the predetermined pressure can be generated. Therefore, even when the resin material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which is at least softened by heating, shows a high viscosity, the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>can be pressurized up to the predetermined pressure by the pressurizing force of the transport pressure along with the axial direction within comparably low rotating speed of the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a</i>. It is not necessary to increase the rotating speed of the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a </i>so as to increase the pressurizing force caused by the centrifugal force.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The filtering performance prevents from reducing because the feeding force along with the axial direction caused by rotating the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a </i>eliminates the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which is accumulated on the filtering means M<b>3</b> (in detail, the filter <b>56</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As a result, it is easy to filter the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>by the filtering means M<b>3</b>, and the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is filtered efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The driving shaft <b>53</b> of the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a </i>is preferable to dispose in the vertical direction. When the filter <b>56</b> passes the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>only from the mixture of the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which is not passed through the filter <b>56</b>, precipitates vertically downward (in detail, downward of the filter <b>56</b>, which is disposed on the inner circumference wall Hah). Then, the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is pressed on the inner circumference wall Hah by the centrifugal force. Accordingly, the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is separated and retrieved by the filter <b>56</b>, which is exposed on the inner circumference wall Hah. The metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>is precipitated downward without plugging the filter <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Moreover, in the second embodiment, it is preferable to provide following character.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The space <b>57</b><i>b </i>to reserve the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>is disposed in the retrieving outlet <b>57</b><i>a</i>, in which the residual metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>by the filtration of the filter <b>56</b> is collected. Accordingly, a metal retrieving unit <b>57</b> is located on the other end of the inner circumference wall Hah of the holder unit Ha, opposite to the driving unit <b>54</b>. The metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>is collected into the metal retrieving unit <b>57</b> through the retrieving outlet <b>57</b><i>a</i>, and the metal retrieving unit <b>57</b> reserves the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>is deposited and filled the space <b>57</b><i>b </i>in accordance with retrieving the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>by the filtering means M<b>3</b> from the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the resin material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which compose the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> transferred by the rotational body <b>53</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Besides, it is preferred that a heater <b>57</b><i>c </i>and a screw driving unit <b>57</b><i>d </i>are disposed in the metal retrieving unit <b>57</b>. The heater <b>57</b><i>c </i>and the screw driving unit <b>57</b><i>d </i>are used in the case that the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>is filled in the space <b>57</b><i>b </i>(more precisely, most part of the mixture of the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>filled in the space <b>57</b><i>b </i>is the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>). By means of the heater <b>57</b><i>c </i>and the screw driving unit <b>57</b><i>d</i>, the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>is not adhered together with the resin material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which is contaminated into the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, and is extruded by the screw driving unit <b>57</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a loading unit <b>59</b> can be provided as a preparing means before the pressurizing means M<b>1</b> described in the above second embodiment. The loading unit <b>59</b> carries the work piece <b>1</b> by screw. A screw-type loader <b>59</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (i.e., screw unit <b>59</b><i>a</i>) rotates so as to carry the work piece <b>1</b>. The work piece <b>1</b> (in detail, the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> or divided board pieces lab that is cut the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> into pieces in predetermined size) is controllable supplied to the pressurizing means M<b>1</b> according to a pitch of rotating the screw unit <b>59</b><i>a</i>. In other words, supply of the work piece <b>1</b> to the pressurizing means M<b>1</b> is regulated by controlling the rotational speed of the screw unit <b>59</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Moreover, a resin-retrieving unit <b>58</b> can be provided next to the filtration means M<b>3</b>, which is described in the above second embodiment. The resin-retrieving unit <b>58</b> involves a leading port <b>58</b><i>a</i>, which leads to the filter <b>56</b>, and reserves the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>temporary, wherein the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is separated and retrieved through the filter <b>56</b>. It is preferred that a screw-type loader <b>58</b><i>b </i>(i.e., a screw unit <b>58</b><i>b</i>) and a heater <b>58</b><i>c </i>are provided in the resin-retrieving unit <b>58</b>. The heater <b>58</b><i>c </i>heats the resin material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which is aggregated by the screw unit <b>58</b><i>b</i>. The screw unit <b>58</b><i>b </i>and the heater <b>58</b><i>c </i>prevent failure. For example, the resin material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which is separated and retrieved, is not cooled and solidified by the screw unit <b>58</b><i>b </i>and the heater <b>58</b><i>c </i>so that the resin-metal separation equipment <b>51</b> is not stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Besides, the filter <b>56</b> described in the above second embodiment, may be used to a so-called pre-coat filter. Preliminary, a mesh hole is provided slightly large. As the resin-metal separation equipment <b>51</b> operates, the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>accumulates on the circumference wall <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the filter <b>56</b>. Then, the mesh hole of the filter <b>56</b> becomes small and get into the predetermined mesh hole. This pre-coat filter promotes the life of the filter <b>56</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Therefore, when the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is separated and retrieved from the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>, the conductive product <b>51</b> is contaminated as the interlayer bonding material <b>50</b> into the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a</i>. The composition of the contamination of the conductive product <b>51</b> is the same as the composition of the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which composes the resin film <b>23</b>. Therefore, the retrieved insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is not reduced in its purity. As a result, it is expected that the retrieved insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>may show the equivalent characteristics to the before-retrieving insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, the interlayer bonding material <b>50</b>, i.e., a conductive bonding paste, which composes the conductive product <b>51</b>, is composed of first metallic particles <b>61</b> and second metallic particles <b>62</b>. The first metallic particles <b>61</b> can be formed into an alloy with the metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which composes the conductive printed circuit <b>22</b>. The second metallic particles <b>62</b> can be formed into an alloy with the metal, which composes the first particles <b>61</b>. For example, in an interlayer bonding process, the first metallic particles <b>61</b> and the second metallic particles <b>62</b> are sintered and formed into the integrated conductive product <b>51</b> by heating and pressurizing</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Specifically, the conductive bonding paste <b>50</b>, i.e., the interlayer bonding material, is made of tin (Sn) composing the first metallic particles <b>61</b> and silver (Ag) composing the second metallic particles <b>62</b>. Besides, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows the state of the conductive bonding paste <b>50</b>, which is filled and dried in the via-hole <b>24</b> before heating by vacuum hot press equipment (not shown). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows the state of the conductive bonding paste <b>50</b> after sintered by the vacuum hot press equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">At first, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the conductive bonding paste <b>50</b> is the mixture of the tin particles <b>61</b> and the silver particles <b>62</b>. When the conductive bonding paste <b>50</b> is heated up to 240-350 degrees Celsius, the tin particles <b>61</b> is melted and adhered so as to cover the surface of the silver particles <b>62</b>, because the melting point of the silver is 961 degrees Celsius, and the melting point of the tin particles is 232 degrees Celsius. When the conductive bonding paste <b>50</b> is continued to heat at 961 degrees Celsius, tin atom is diffused into the silver particles <b>62</b> from the surface. Then the alloy of silver and tin (melting point is 480 degrees Celsius) is formed. In this case, the conductive bonding paste <b>50</b> is pressurized at 2-10 MPa. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the conductive product <b>51</b> in the via-hole is formed into the integrated and sintered alloy in accordance with the alloying of tin and silver.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">When the conductive product <b>51</b> is formed in the via-hole, the conductive product <b>51</b> is adhered to the bottom surface of the conductive printed circuit <b>22</b> in the via-hole <b>24</b>, because the conductive product <b>51</b> is pressurized. Therefore, the tin component in the conductive product <b>51</b> and the copper component in the copper foil of the conductive printed circuit <b>22</b> are mutually diffused together in solid phase. Then, a solid diffusion layer <b>52</b> is formed at an interface between the conductive printed circuit <b>22</b> and the conductive product <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Another interface between the conductive printed circuit <b>22</b> and the conductive product <b>51</b> is also provided on the lower side of the via-hole <b>24</b> not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and the solid diffusion layer <b>52</b> of the tin component in the conductive product <b>51</b> and the copper component in the copper foil of the conductive printed circuit <b>22</b> is also formed. Therefore, the conductive printed circuits <b>22</b>, which are disposed on the upper and lower sides of the via-hole <b>24</b>, are electrically and reliably connected together by the solid diffusion layer <b>52</b> and the integrated conductive product <b>51</b>, that is not a contact connection. This connection promotes the reliability of the interlayer bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As a result, the above connection with the conductive product <b>51</b> promotes the reliability of the interlayer bonding. Moreover, when the conductive product <b>51</b> is heated up to 400 degrees Celsius in hot filtration process P<b>400</b> for separating and retrieving, the conductive product <b>51</b> is maintained in the solid phase surely, because the conductive product <b>51</b> is made of the alloy of tin and silver (melting point of the alloy is 480 degrees Celsius). Therefore, in the hot filtration process P<b>400</b>, the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>(the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>also involves the interlayer bonding material) are separated and retrieved surely.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Besides, in this interlayer bonding process, the conductive printed circuit <b>22</b> is formed on the surface of the resin film <b>23</b>, which composes the insulating body base <b>23</b>, so that the resin film <b>23</b> forms the conductive printed circuit film <b>21</b>. Then, the conductive printed circuit films <b>21</b> are stacked and adhered together by heating and pressurizing (i.e., formed into the multi-layer printed circuit board).</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">FOURTH EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">A waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> according to the fourth embodiment is preferable to use a printed circuit board <b>100</b> having a following constitution. When a conductive product <b>51</b> described in the third embodiment is formed, the conductive product <b>51</b> is extruded and formed into an arch-like structure in via-hole <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> under the normal hydrostatic pressure applied to a resin film <b>23</b> composing an insulating body base <b>23</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic partially enlarged view showing a shape of the conductive product <b>51</b> in a printed circuit board <b>100</b> applied to a method of recycling according to the forth embodiment after interlayer bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the heating and pressurizing process by the vacuum hot press equipment described in the third embodiment, the resin film <b>23</b> is also heated and pressurized by the vacuum hot press equipment. Therefore, the resin film <b>23</b> is deformed along with the expansion direction of the film. The resin film <b>23</b>, which is disposed around the via-hole <b>24</b>, is deformed so as to extrude into the via-hole <b>24</b>. In this case, the elastic modulus of the resin film <b>23</b> is reduced to about 5-40 MPa. When the resin film <b>23</b>, of which the elastic modulus is reduced, is pressurized, a substantially homogeneous pressure (i.e., a so-called hydrostatic pressure) is generated in the resin film <b>23</b> composing the insulating body base <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">When the resin film <b>23</b> is continued to pressurize under the substantially homogeneous pressure, the resin film <b>23</b> around the via-hole <b>24</b> is deformed so as to extrude into the via-hole <b>24</b>. Then, the extruded volume of the resin film <b>23</b> into the center portion of the via-hole <b>24</b> (i.e., the portion in the middle of the center axis of the via-hole <b>24</b>) is larger than that into the edge portion of the via-hole (i.e., the portion at the both ends of the center axis of the via-hole <b>24</b>), wherein the edge portion of the via-hole <b>24</b> is contact with the conductive printed circuit <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The inner wall of the via-hole <b>24</b> has a substantially cylindrical shape before hot pressing. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a cross-sectional profile of the inner wall of the via-hole <b>24</b> along with the center axis of the via-hole <b>24</b> has an arc-like shape after hot pressing, because the resin film <b>23</b> is extruded into the via-hole <b>24</b> as mentioned above. Besides, the elastic modulus of the resin film <b>23</b> is in the range of 1-1000 MPa in hot pressing process.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The volume (i.e., apparent volume) of the conductive product <b>51</b> is reduced in accordance with sintering. Therefore, a cross-sectional profile of the inner wall of the via-hole <b>24</b>, which is filled with the conductive product <b>51</b>, is formed into the arc-like shape along with the center axis of the via-hole <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">When the printed circuit board <b>100</b> is applied to a deformation stress, for example, bending stress and the like, it is also difficult to concentrate the deformation stress in the other portion of a contact area <b>51</b><i>b </i>in the conductive product <b>51</b>, compared with the cylindrical via-hole according to the related art, because the cross-sectional profile of the inner wall of the via-hole <b>24</b>, which is filled with the conductive product <b>51</b>, is formed into the arc-like shape along with the center axis of the via-hole <b>24</b>. As a result, the reliability of the interlayer bonding is promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In a primary product process of the printed circuit board <b>100</b>, it is constituted that the elastic modulus of the insulating body base <b>23</b> (in detail, the insulating body base made of thermoplastic resin) is in the range of 1-1000 MPa at the heating temperature in the hot pressing process. As a result, the cross-sectional profile of the inner wall of the via-hole <b>24</b>, which is filled with the conductive product, is formed into the arc-like shape <b>51</b> along with the center axis of the via hole <b>24</b>, and then the reliability of the interlayer bonding is promoted. Moreover, in hot filtration process P<b>400</b> for separating and retrieving, the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> is heated up to the predetermined temperature, which is near the process temperature for forming the printed circuit board <b>100</b> by hot pressing in a primary product process (or in the case of the multi-layer printed circuit board, the stacking temperature for stacking the multi-layer printed circuit board in a primary product process), it is easy operation to separate and to retrieve by passing through a filter <b>4</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> in hot filtration equipment <b>4</b><i>a </i>because the elastic modulus of the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is sufficiently reduced.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">FIFTH EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The fifth embodiment can be applied to a method for recycling a printed circuit board shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic block diagram showing an entire process of recycling the printed circuit board according to the fifth embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is also a schematic block diagram showing the recycling system to perform the recycling of the printed circuit board according to the fifth embodiment. A difference between the fifth embodiment and the first embodiment is described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In grinding process P<b>700</b>, a printed circuit board <b>100</b>, which is eliminated a mounted part <b>70</b> and solder <b>80</b> in part elimination process P<b>200</b> and solder elimination process P<b>300</b> respectively, is ground into powder. Then, the printed circuit board <b>100</b> as a work piece <b>1</b> becomes a mixed powder of an insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and a printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>. Besides, grinding means <b>7</b> may be used to any kind of means that grinds a resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and a metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which compose the printed circuit board <b>100</b>. In the following fifth embodiment, the printed circuit board <b>100</b> is cut into pieces about 5 cm square by a rotary wheel type cutting machine. Then, the pieces are ground into the powder by a cutter mill for grinding by rotating a rotational cutter.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">When the particle diameter of the powder in the grinding process P<b>700</b> is smaller than a dimension of thickness of a resin film <b>23</b> composing the printed circuit board <b>100</b> for recycling, a part of a printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which is sandwiched in a multi-layer printed circuit board, is surely exposed on the surface of the powder. Therefore, when the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>is, for example, eluted into an eluant, a processing time for eluting the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>is shortened by the above grinding process P<b>700</b>. As a result, the grinding process P<b>700</b> promotes the efficiency of separating and retrieving the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">On the other hand, when the particle diameter is comparably large, the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>can be eluted by means of taking enough time to elute the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>. In other words, the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>can be separated and retrieved in any particle diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In the fifth embodiment, the printed circuit board <b>100</b> is shattered into the particles, of which the average particle diameter is about 100 micron. The cutter mill has a rotational cutter, which is made of metallic cutter with titanium (Ti) coating, and rotates the rotational cutter at a rotational speed of 3000 rotations per minute (rpm/min). The cutter mill grinds into the powder during 15 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In metal elution filtering process P<b>800</b>, the powder ground in the above grinding process P<b>700</b> is dipped in the eluant, and the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>is eluted. In the printed circuit board <b>100</b>, which is recycled as the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b> according to the fifth embodiment, for example, the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>composing the conductive printed circuit <b>22</b> is made of copper (Cu) foil, and the interlayer bonding material <b>50</b> is made of tin (Sn) and silver (Ag). The eluant is prepared a mixture of hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and water so that the eluant elutes both the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the interlayer bonding material <b>50</b> simultaneously. The mixing ratio of hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and water is 1:1:2. The above ground powder is dipped in the eluant during 10 minutes, and both the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the interlayer bonding material <b>50</b> are eluted. After that, the eluant is filtered, and the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is separated and retrieved. Further, the separated insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is water-washed and dried.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">This process performs to separate and retrieve the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>completely and easily.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the fifth embodiment, the insulating body base <b>23</b> of the printed circuit board <b>100</b>, which is recycled as the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>, is made of thermoplastic resin only or mixture of thermoplastic resin and inorganic loading material.

The elastic modulus of the resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is sufficiently reduced so that the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which is separated and filtered in the metal elution filtering process P<b>800</b>, is easily formed into a predetermined shape in resin forming process P<b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The resin film <b>23</b> composing the insulating body base <b>23</b> in the printed circuit board <b>100</b>, which is recycled as the waste printed circuit board <b>1</b>, has a via-hole <b>24</b>.

It is preferred that the conductive product <b>51</b> is made of metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>only, mixture of metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>and thermoplastic resin material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which composes the resin film <b>23</b>, or mixture of metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, thermoplastic resin material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, and inorganic loading material. Even if the conductive product <b>51</b> is contaminated into the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which is separated and retrieved in the metal elution filtering process P<b>800</b>, the retrieved insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is not reduced in its purity, because the conductive product <b>51</b> has the same composition as the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which composes the resin film <b>23</b>. Accordingly, the retrieved resin material <b>1</b><i>a </i>is not reduced in its purity, and is expected to have the equivalent characteristics to the before-retrieving resin material.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As is generally known, the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the interlayer bonding material <b>50</b>, which are eluted in the metal elution filtering process P<b>800</b>, can be retrieved and recycled as the metal by means of a well-known method of processing waste acid-liquid according to a related art. In detail, for example, the metal is retrieved as a solid phase metal by heating and melting, or the metal is separated as an individual metal by electrolysis.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which is separated and retrieved by the waste acid-liquid processing method or the like, is refined in each metallic category in the metal refining and separating process P<b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The insulating material, which is separated and retrieved, is examined and analyzed using ion-coupled plasma (i.e., ICP) emission spectral analysis. The contamination of the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the interlayer bonding material <b>50</b>, which are contaminated into the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a</i>, is analyzed by the ICP emission spectral analysis and confirmed below 50 ppm, which is the limit of detection.

<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the above fifth embodiment, the insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>are separated and retrieved in the hot filtration process P<b>400</b> and the metal elution filtering process P<b>800</b> respectively, and are recycled in the resin forming process P<b>500</b> and the metal refining and separating process P<b>600</b> respectively. The insulating material <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the printed metallic material <b>1</b><i>b </i>are recycled as a material of recycled printed circuit board (referring to a recycling flow chart showing a dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>).
