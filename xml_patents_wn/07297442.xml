<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a non-aqueous electrolytic solution which imparts to lithium secondary batteries favorable battery performances in the electric capacity and the storage property and further in the battery cycle property, and further relates to a lithium secondary battery containing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">At present, a lithium secondary battery is generally employed as an electric source for driving small electronic devices. The lithium secondary battery essentially comprises a positive electrode, a non-aqueous electrolytic solution, and a negative electrode. A lithium secondary battery utilizing a positive electrode of lithium compound oxide such as LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>and a negative electrode of carbonaceous material or lithium metal is preferably used. As the electrolytic solution for the lithium secondary battery, a carbonate such as ethylene carbonate (EC) or propylene carbonate (PC) is preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Heretofore, there have been proposals to incorporate a variety of additives to a non-electrolytic solution so as to improve various performances of a lithium secondary battery.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 5,709,968 (corresponding to Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 9-50822) describes a number of compounds including p-fluoroanisole and 2,4-difluoroanisole to be used as additives for keeping a lithium secondary battery from over-charging.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 11-329490 describes pentafluorobenzene derivatives in which the six hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring are replaced with five fluorine atoms and one substituted ester group, substituted acyl group or trifluoromethyl group, such as methyl pentafluorobenzenecarboxylate and octafluorotoluene, which are employable for improving the cycle performance of a lithium secondary battery.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Further improvements of various lithium battery performances are desired. Particularly, the improvement of cycle performance (i.e., rate of retention of discharge capacity after repeated charging-discharging procedures) of a lithium secondary battery is highly desired.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">In a lithium secondary battery using LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>or LiNiO<sub>2 </sub>as the positive electrode material, a portion of a solvent of the non-aqueous electrolytic solution oxidatively decomposes in the course of charging, and the decomposition product disturbs the desired electrochemical reaction of the battery. Accordingly, the battery performances lower. It is assumed that this phenomenon arises from electrochemical oxidation of the solvent in contact with the surface of the positive electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">On the other hand, in a lithium secondary battery using a highly crystalline carbonaceous material such as natural graphite or artificial graphite as the negative electrode material, the solvent in the non-aqueous electrolytic solution reductively decomposes on the surface of the negative electrode in the course of charging. The reductive decomposition occurs in a portion of the solvent in the repeated charging-discharging procedures even if the solvent contains EC (ethylene carbonate) which is generally employed as a solvent of the non-aqueous electrolytic solution, and hence the battery performances lower.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">For these reasons, the lithium secondary batteries still are not satisfactory in their battery performances such as cycle performance and electric capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">The present invention has an object to provide a non-aqueous electrolytic solution which solves the above-mentioned problems concerning lithium secondary batteries and which is effective to impart an improved performance in the electric capacity, stability in the charged condition, and the cycle performance to a lithium secondary battery. The invention further has an object to provide a lithium secondary battery employing the non-aqueous electrolytic solution.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">The present invention resides in a non-aqueous electrolytic solution comprising an electrolytic salt in a non-aqueous solvent, which further contains a pentafluorophenoxy compound having the formula (I):</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0013">The invention further resides in a lithium secondary battery which comprises a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and a non-aqueous electrolytic solution comprising an electrolytic salt in a non-aqueous solvent, in which the non-aqueous electrolytic solution further contains a pentafluorophenoxy compound of the above-mentioned formula (I).</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0026">In the invention, one or more pentafluorphenoxy compounds are contained in the non-aqueous electrolytic solution. If the pentafluorophenoxy compound of the formula (I) is contained in the non-electrolytic solution in an excessive amount, the battery performances may lower. If the amount is too small, the expected improvement in the battery performance may not appear. Accordingly, the amount in the non-aqueous electrolytic solution generally is 0.01 to 20 wt. %, preferably 0.05 to 10 wt. %, more preferably 0.1 to 5 wt. %, from the viewpoint of increase of the cycle performance.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">Examples of the non-aqueous solvents employed in the invention are cyclic carbonates such as ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), butylene carbonate (BC), and vinylene carbonate (VC), lactones such as γ-butylolactone, linear carbonates such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC), methyl ethyl carbonate (MEC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC), ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane, and 1,2-dibutoxyethane, nitriles such as acetonitrile, aliphatic esters such as methyl propionate, methyl pivalate, butyl pivalate, and octyl pivalate, and amides such as dimethylformamide.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0033">For instance, the active material of positive electrode is a compound metal oxide comprising cobalt, nickel or manganese, and lithium. The active material of positive electrode can be used singly or in combination. Examples of the compound metal oxides include LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, and LiCo<sub>1-x</sub>Ni<sub>x</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(0.01&lt;x&lt;1).

<p id="p-0037" num="0035">As the active material of negative electrode, lithium metal, lithium alloy, carbonaceous material capable of absorbing and releasing lithium (e.g., thermally decomposed carbonaceous material, coke, graphites such as artificial graphite and natural graphite, fired organic polymer, and carbon fiber), or a compound tin oxide is employable. It is preferred to employ carbonaceous materials having a graphite crystal structure in which the lattice distance of lattice surface (002), namely, d<sub>002</sub>, is in the range of 0.335 to 0.340 nm (nanometer). The active materials of negative electrode can be employed singly or in combination. A powdery material such as the carbonaceous material is preferably used in combination with a binder such as ethylene propylene diene terpolymer (EPDM), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), poly-(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), styrene-butadiene copolymer (SBR), acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer (NBR), or carboxymethylcellulose (CMC).

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">1) Preparation of Non-aqueous Electrolytic Solution</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0039">In a non-aqueous solvent of PC:DMC (=1:2, volume ratio) was dissolved LiPF<sub>6 </sub>(electrolytic salt) to give a non-aqueous electrolytic solution of 1M concentration. To the non-aqueous electrolytic solution was further added 0.5 wt. % of pentafluorophenyl methanesulfonate.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">2) Manufacture Lithium Secondary Battery and Measurement of its Battery Characteristics</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0040">LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>(positive electrode active material, 90 wt. %), acetylene black (electro-conductive material, 5 wt. %), and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (binder, 5 wt. %) were mixed. To the resulting mixture was further added 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. Thus produced mixture was coated on aluminum foil, dried, pressed, and heated to give a positive electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0041">Artificial graphite (negative electrode active material, 90 wt. %) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (binder, 10 wt. %) were mixed. To the resulting mixture was further added 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. Thus produced mixture was coated on copper foil, dried, pressed, and heated to give a negative electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0042">The positive and negative electrodes, a microporous polypropylene film separator, and the above-mentioned non-aqueous electrolytic solution were employed to give a coin-type battery (diameter: 20 mm, thickness: 3.2 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0043">The coin-type battery was charged at room temperature (20° C.) with a constant electric current (1.1 mA) to reach 4.2 V for 5 hours. Subsequently, the battery was discharged to give a constant electric current (1.1 mA) to give a terminal voltage of 2.7 V. The charging-discharging cycle test was repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0044">The initial discharge capacity was almost the same as the capacity measured in a battery using an 1M LiPF<sub>6 </sub>and EC/DEC (3/7, volume ratio) solvent mixture (containing no additive) [see Comparison Example 2].</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0045">After the 50 cycle charging-discharging procedure, the retention of discharge capacity was 88.8% of the initial discharge capacity (100% ).</p>
