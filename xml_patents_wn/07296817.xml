<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to fifth wheel hitches for coupling trailers to tractor trucks, and, in particular, fifth wheel hitches having adjustable positions, and further, to slide rail assemblies for fifth wheel hitches having stop blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Fifth wheel hitches for towing a trailer behind a towing vehicle have long been known in the art. Examples of fifth wheel hitches include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,721,323, 5,449,191, and 5,707,070.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1D</figref>, a fifth wheel hitch assembly <b>101</b> includes a support frame <b>150</b> for mounting hitch assembly <b>101</b> to towing vehicle <b>109</b>, such as, for example, to a truck. Support frame includes a pair of base rails <b>102</b><i>a, b </i>that are bolted to the bed and/or frame of the truck <b>109</b>. Hitch plate <b>130</b> is mounted to a pedestal <b>155</b> by means of a trunnion arrangement, or journal bearing, allowing for pivotal fore-and-aft movement of hitch plate <b>130</b>. Hitch plate <b>130</b> includes a latch assembly (not shown) which further includes a jaw assembly specifically adapted to releasably engage and hold a kingpin <b>115</b> of a trailer <b>119</b> desired to be towed by the towing vehicle <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some fifth wheel hitch assemblies <b>101</b> are adjustable axially with respect to the towing vehicle <b>109</b> frame. One way of achieving this feature is attach slide rails to the support frame of the hitch and configure the pedestal <b>155</b>, upon which the hitch plate and latch assembly is mounted, to slidably engage the slide rails <b>151</b><i>a, b</i>. The conventional design of these slide rails is often a simple flange extending inward of the slide assembly which may be angled metal. Slide rails <b>151</b><i>a, b </i>are attached to the support frame by fillet welding and by bolts. Stop blocks are used to prevent over-travel of pedestal <b>155</b> in slide assembly and are affixed to the ends of slide rails <b>151</b><i>a, b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Prior art stop blocks <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are generally rectangular members that are affixed to the end of a slide plate usually with lap welding. A short-coming of this technique is that with such a small block there is a relatively small point of failure. Under large trailer loads, there can be excessive longitudinal forces pulling the hitch aft which may result in disassembly of the stop block from the fifth wheel slide assembly. Further, the attachment helping to support the stop block is limited to the slide plate area. Thus, a stop block is needed which will better withstand such longitudinal forces through distribution of the load.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure is directed to a slide rail and a slide rail assembly that satisfies this need.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For purposes of summarizing the invention, certain aspects, advantages, and novel features of the invention have been described herein. It is to be understood that not necessarily all such advantages may be achieved in accordance with any one particular embodiment of the invention. Thus, the invention may be embodied or carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or group of advantages as taught herein without necessarily achieving other advantages as may be taught or suggested herein.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A stop block for an adjustable fifth wheel hitch comprises a generally rectangular member having a double curve disposed in the member resulting in a long portion of the member and a short portion of the member and such that the long portion of the member is at a higher elevation than the short portion of said member.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The various embodiments of the present invention and their advantages are best understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3D</figref> of the drawings. The elements of the drawings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead being placed upon clearly illustrating the principles of the invention. Throughout the drawings, like numerals are used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Looking first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, an adjustable fifth wheel assembly <b>101</b> includes a fifth wheel hitch assembly <b>110</b> pivotally mounted on moveable pedestal <b>155</b>. Fifth wheel hitch assembly <b>110</b> comprises hitch plate <b>130</b> comprising two tines <b>132</b><i>a, b </i>defining slot <b>135</b> opening toward the aft end of fifth wheel assembly <b>101</b> for receiving a king pin <b>115</b> from trailer <b>119</b>. Fifth wheel hitch includes locking mechanism (not shown) to secure king pin within slot <b>135</b> for towing. Moveable pedestal <b>155</b> is configured with left and right slide flanges <b>111</b>, <b>114</b> and slidably engaged with left and right slide assembles <b>120</b><i>a, b </i>which is mounted to towing vehicle <b>109</b> frame. Slide assemblies <b>120</b><i>a, b </i>permit longitudinal positioning of fifth wheel hitch assembly <b>110</b> with respect to tractor frame, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Exemplary slide rail assemblies <b>120</b><i>a, b </i>are comprised of left and right slide rail plates <b>102</b><i>a, b </i>tied in parallel by two or more tie bars <b>104</b><i>a, b </i>which form slide frame <b>121</b>. Left slide rail <b>120</b><i>a </i>is attached to the upper surface of left slide rail plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>and right slide rail <b>120</b><i>b </i>is attached to upper surface of right slide rail plate <b>102</b><i>b </i>such that fifth wheel hitch assembly <b>110</b> and pedestal <b>155</b> are located therebetween, inboard of the left and right slide rails <b>120</b><i>a, b</i>. Slide rail plates <b>102</b><i>a, b </i>and slide rails <b>120</b><i>a, b </i>each have longitudinal axes which parallel the longitudinal axis of towing vehicle <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the slide stops of the present invention will be described in detail. Slide stops <b>205</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are located toward each end of each slide rail plate <b>102</b><i>a, b </i>and are affixed to both the tie bars and the ends of slide rail plates <b>102</b><i>a, b</i>. Slide stop blocks <b>205</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>prevent over-travel of pedestal <b>155</b>. Slide stop blocks <b>205</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are oriented with respect to slide rail assembly <b>120</b> parallel to tie bars <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, each of the stop blocks having an outward oriented end affixed to the ends of slide rail plates <b>102</b><i>a,b </i>and an inward oriented end affixed to tie bar <b>104</b><i>a,b</i>. Stop block <b>205</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>is affixed to frame such that a majority of stop block <b>205</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>rests upon slide rail plate <b>102</b><i>a, b </i>and the remainder rests upon tie bars.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, B show an exemplary stop block <b>205</b> in greater detail where stop block <b>205</b> is a plate member comprising a double curve <b>302</b> located toward one end of stop block <b>205</b> resulting in a short segment <b>305</b> and a long segment <b>307</b>. When stop block <b>205</b> is installed in slide rail assembly, bottom surface of long segment <b>307</b> rests upon the top surface of slide rail plate <b>102</b> and bottom surface of short segment <b>305</b> rests upon the top surface of tie bar <b>104</b>, the double curve <b>302</b> allowing a step-down in elevation. Thus, double curve <b>302</b> permits substantially all, if not all, of the bottom surface of long segment <b>307</b> to be seated upon the top surface of tie bar <b>104</b>. Likewise, double curve <b>302</b> allows substantially all, if not all, of the bottom surface of short segment <b>305</b> to be seated upon the top surface of slide rail plate <b>102</b>. Long segment and short segment of stop block may be affixed to slide rail plate and tie bar, respectively, by various methods known in the relevant arts, or which may be later developed. One non-limiting example is lap welding, a technique well-known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C</figref>, D depict an alternative stop block <b>310</b> where the top surface of stop block <b>310</b> departs from the top plane of stop block <b>310</b>, as defined by the top edge thereof, forming hollow <b>315</b>. Hollow <b>315</b> reduces the amount of material out of which stop block is comprised and therefore, results in a reduction of mass. Ridge <b>317</b> circumscribing hollow <b>415</b> provides lateral and longitudinal support.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As described above and shown in the associated drawings, the present invention comprises a stop block for a fifth wheel slide assembly. While particular embodiments of the invention have been described, it will be understood, however, that the invention is not limited thereto, since modifications may be made by those skilled in the art, particularly in light of the foregoing teachings. It is, therefore, contemplated by the appended claims to cover any such modifications that incorporate those features or those improvements that embody the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
