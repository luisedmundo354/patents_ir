<p id="p-0049" num="0068">The activity of the compounds of formula (I), in particular that of the compounds (I′), on the nervous system was demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo studies according to the methods described in EP-0 458 696 and neuronal survival was evaluated with the aid of an in vitro survival test performed by using isolated neurons from dissections of the septal region of rat embryos.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0069">More particularly, a sample of the septal region of 17-18 days old rats was taken under a dissection microscope under sterile conditions, then it was dissociated in trypsin-EDTA medium. The cell suspension was placed in a culture flask in DME/Ham's F12 medium (v:v) (Dulbecco Modified Eagle medium/Ham's F12 Nutrient mixture—R. G. Ham, Proc. Nat. Sci., 1965, 53: 288) containing 5% calf serum and 5% horse serum and maintained at 37° C. for 90 minutes. This treatment permits the elimination of non-neuronal cells.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0070">The neuroblasts are then inoculated into the wells of a titration plate at 17×10<sup>4 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>in a non-serum culture medium constituted by DME/Ham's F12 containing selenium (30 nM) and transferrin (1.25 mM). Each well was subject to prior treatment with poly-L-lysine. The inoculated plates are placed in an incubator (37° C.; 5% CO2).</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0072">The neuroblasts are maintained on plates containing the test compound or the corresponding solvent for 4 days without changing the medium.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0073">After 4 days the medium is replaced by culture medium in which a tetrazolium salt is dissolved (0.15 mg/ml). The cells are then placed in the incubator at 37° C. for 4 hours. The mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenases of the living cells reduce the tetrazolium salt to formazan blue, the optical density of which is measured at 540 nm after dissolution in DMSO and which is linearly correlated with the number of living cells (Manthorpe et al., Dev. Brain Res., 1988, 25: 191-198).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0074">The difference between the groups containing the test compounds and the controls was evaluated by statistical analysis using the two-tailed Dunnett t-test.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0075">In this latter test the compounds of formula (I), in particular those of formula (I′), proved to be as active or more active than the compounds described in EP-0 458 696, the efficacy of certain compounds of formula (I′) on the neuronal survival being twice that of compound A described in EP-0 458 696.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0076">As a result of this potent neuroprotective activity and their low toxicity compatible with use as medicines, the compounds of formula (I), in particular those of formula (I′), as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts, their solvates and their quaternary ammonium salts, in particular those of formula (I″), may be used for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions indicated in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of all diseases which involve neuronal degeneration, a use which constitutes a further feature of the present invention. More particularly, the invention relates to the use of the compounds of formula (I), in particular (I′) and (I″), alone or on co-administration or combination with other active ingredients acting on the CNS, for example, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, selective M1 cholinomimetics, NMDA antagonists, nootropics such as piracetam in the following indications: memory disorders, vascular dementia, post-encephalitic disorders, post-apoplectic disorders, post-traumatic syndromes due to a cranial traumatism, Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, subcortical dementia, such as Huntington chorea and Parkinson's disease, dementia caused by AIDS, neuropathies resulting from morbidity or damage to sympathetic or sensory nerves, cerebral diseases such as cerebral oedema and spinocerebellar degenerations, degeneration of motoneurons like for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0077">The administration of the compounds according to the invention may be suitably performed by the oral, parenteral, sublingual or transdermal route. The quantity of active ingredient to be administered in the treatment of cerebral and neuronal disorders according to the method of the present invention depends on the nature and gravity of the diseases to be treated as well as on the weight of the patients. In general, the total dose in man varies between 1 and 1400 mg per day, advantageously between 2 and 900 mg per day, for example 3 to 500 mg, more suitably from 10 to 300 mg per day in pharmaceutical compositions. The compositions of the present invention are preferably administered in the form of dosage units. These unit doses will usually comprise from 0.5 to 700 mg, advantageously from 2 to 300 mg, preferably from 5 to 150 mg, for example between 5 and 50 mg, namely 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 or 50 mg of product. These unit doses will usually be administered once or several times a day, for example 2, 3, 4 or 5 times per day, preferably one to three times a day.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0078">According to another of its features, the object of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition containing as active ingredients a compound of formula (I) above and a compound indicated in the symptomatic treatment of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0079">The expression “compound indicated in the symptomatic treatment of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT)” indicates a product which is capable of improving the symptomatology of the patients suffering from DAT without having any effect on the causes of the disease.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0080">Such compounds are for example acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, M<sub>1 </sub>muscarinic agonists, nicotinic agonists, NMDA receptor antagonists, nootropic agents.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0081">Preferred acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are tacrine and donepezil.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0085">According to another of its features, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing as active ingredient a compound of formula (I) and an M<sub>1 </sub>receptor agonist, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0086">M<sub>1 </sub>receptor agonists are, for example, milameline, besipiridine, talsaclidine, xanomeline, YM-796 and YM-954 (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1990, 187: 479-486), 3-{N-(2-diethylamino-2-methylpropyl)-6-phenyl-5-propyl}-pyridazinamine, also known as SR-46559 (Biorg. Med. Chem.

<p id="p-0073" num="0092">Nootropic agents which may be used according to the invention are, for example, netiracetam and nebracetam (Merck Index, 12th ed.).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0093">The doses of the two combined active ingredients are usually selected from the doses of each medicine which would be administered in an uncombined treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0094">In accordance with another feature, the present invention also relates to a method for the treatment of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type which consists of the administration to a patient suffering from this disease of an efficacious dose of a compound of formula (I) or of one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and of an efficacious dose of a compound indicated in the symptomatic treatment of DAT or of one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, said administrations being simultaneous, sequential or alternating at intervals and the efficacious doses of the active ingredients being contained in separate unit forms of administration or, when the active ingredients are administered simultaneously, the two active ingredients being advantageously contained in a single pharmaceutical form.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0097">When a solid composition is prepared in the form of tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical vehicle such as gelatin, starch, lactose, magnesium stearate, talc, gum arabic or the like. The tablets may be coated with sucrose or other suitable materials or they may also be treated so that they have a prolonged or delayed activity and so that they continuously release a predefined quantity of active ingredient.</p>
