<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the locking pin <b>4</b> is provided with a circumferential flange <b>4</b><i>b</i>. A substantially cylindrical pin-holder <b>5</b> is fixed on an outer surface of the second bracket <b>2</b> and surrounds the locking pin <b>4</b>. An outer end portion <b>4</b><i>c </i>of the locking pin <b>4</b> projects outwardly from the pin-holder <b>5</b>. The pin-holder <b>5</b> has an inwardly facing circumferential flange portion <b>5</b><i>a</i>. The coil spring <b>6</b> briefly discussed above is mounted around the locking pin <b>4</b> and disposed between the circumferential flange <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the locking pin <b>4</b> and the inwardly facing circumferential flange portion <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the pin-holder <b>5</b>. Due to an action of the coil spring <b>6</b>, the locking pin <b>4</b> is always urged toward the first bracket <b>1</b> and the inner end portion <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the locking pin <b>4</b> is releasably engaged with any one of the notches <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c </i>of the first bracket <b>1</b>.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A description will be given of embodiments with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 21</figref>. In Figures, the same components of the illustrated embodiments are denoted by like reference numerals. Each of the embodiments according to the present invention is to be applied to a left side of such a vehicle seat as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, e.g., a rear seat for a wagon car.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 10</figref>, a recliner device for a vehicle seat according to a first embodiment of the present invention will be discussed hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the recliner device according to the first embodiment of the present invention includes a first bracket <b>1</b> provided at a left side of a seat back of the vehicle seat and extending downwardly from the left side of the seat back, and a second bracket <b>2</b> provided at a left side of a seat cushion of the vehicle seat and extending rearwardly from the left side of the seat cushion. In the illustrated example, the first bracket <b>1</b> is employed as an inner bracket and the second bracket <b>2</b> is employed as an outer bracket. More particularly, a lower end portion of the first bracket <b>1</b> is disposed or overlapped on an inner surface of a rear end portion of the second bracket <b>2</b> and pivotally connected to the rear end portion of the second bracket <b>2</b> by means of a supporting pin <b>3</b>. Similarly, a third bracket and a fourth bracket (not shown) are provided at a right side of the seat back and a right side of the seat cushion, respectively. The third bracket is pivotally connected to the fourth bracket by a supporting pin (not shown) in the same manner as the first bracket <b>1</b> is pivotally connected to the second bracket <b>2</b> by the supporting pin <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The seat back is pivoted around the supporting pins relative to the seat cushion in the same manner as the seat back shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is done. That is, an attitude of the seat back can be selectively changed to a vertically standing posture, a forwardly inclined posture or a rearwardly inclined posture relative to the seat cushion. A locking pin <b>4</b> penetrates the second bracket <b>2</b> so as to be axially movable, and extends towards a lower end edge of the first bracket <b>1</b>. A lower end portion of the first bracket <b>1</b> is formed into a substantially semicircular shape and has three engaging notches <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>1</b><i>c </i>of substantially semicircular-shapes disposed at predetermined circumferential intervals of the lower end edge of the first bracket <b>1</b> around the supporting pin <b>3</b>. An inner end portion <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the locking pin <b>4</b> is releasably engaged with any one of the engaging notches <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c </i>of the first bracket <b>1</b> by an action of a coil spring discussed in greater detail hereinafter, whereby the seat back can be selectively locked in the vertically standing posture, the forwardly inclined posture or the rearwardly inclined posture relative to the seat cushion.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a receiving base <b>9</b> of a substantially ring-shape is fixed on an outer surface of the rear end portion of the second bracket <b>2</b> and coaxially surrounds the locking pin <b>4</b>. The locking pin <b>4</b> is provided with a circumferential flange <b>4</b><i>b</i>. A substantially cylindrical pin-holder <b>5</b> is mounted in the receiving base <b>9</b> so as to coaxially surround the locking pin <b>4</b>, and fixed on the outer surface of the second bracket <b>2</b>. An outer end portion <b>4</b><i>c </i>of the locking pin <b>4</b> projects outwardly from the pin-holder <b>5</b>. The pin-holder <b>5</b> has an inwardly facing circumferential flange portion <b>5</b><i>a</i>. The coil spring <b>6</b> briefly discussed above is mounted around the locking pin <b>4</b> and disposed between the circumferential flange <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the locking pin <b>4</b> and the inwardly facing circumferential flange portion <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the pin-holder <b>5</b>, whereby the locking pin <b>4</b> is always urged in such an axial direction as to be operatively engaged with any one of the engaging notches <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c </i>of the first bracket <b>1</b>. An operating knob <b>70</b> is rotatably mounted on the pin-holder <b>5</b> in a face-to-face relationship with the receiving base <b>9</b> as will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the operating knob <b>70</b> is in the form of a handle lever and comprises a cap-shaped boss section <b>70</b><i>a</i>, a substantially cylindrical section <b>70</b><i>b </i>coaxial with the boss section <b>70</b><i>a </i>and extending axially from the boss section <b>70</b><i>a</i>, and a lever section extending radially from the boss section <b>70</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the operating knob <b>70</b> is rotatably mounted on the pin holder <b>5</b> with the substantially cylindrical section <b>70</b><i>b </i>facing the receiving base <b>9</b> and with a top portion of the boss section <b>70</b><i>a </i>being attached to the outer end portion <b>4</b><i>c </i>of the locking pin <b>4</b> by means of a screw <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The recliner device further includes cooperating cam surface means on the operating knob <b>70</b> and the receiving base <b>9</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the cooperating cam surface means comprises a first cam surface <b>10</b> on a circumferential edge portion of the substantially cylindrical section <b>70</b><i>b </i>of the operating knob <b>70</b> which is opposed to or faces a circumferential edge portion of the ring-shaped receiving base <b>9</b>, and a second cam surface <b>20</b> on the circumferential edge portion of the ring-shaped receiving base <b>9</b>. The first and second cam surfaces have the substantially same shape. More particularly, the first cam surface <b>10</b> of the substantially cylindrical section <b>70</b><i>b </i>of the operating knob <b>70</b> comprises first two opposite crest portions <b>10</b><i>a </i>spaced apart from each other at intervals of about 180 degrees around the circumferential edge portion of the substantially cylindrical section <b>70</b><i>b</i>, and first two opposite valley portions <b>10</b><i>b </i>each disposed between the first crest portions <b>10</b><i>a </i>and continuously connected to the first crest portions <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, the second cam surface <b>20</b> of the ring-shaped receiving base <b>9</b> comprises second two opposite crest portions <b>20</b><i>a </i>spaced apart from each other at intervals of about 180 degrees around the circumferential edge portion of the ring-shaped receiving base <b>9</b>, and second opposite valley portions <b>20</b><i>b </i>each disposed between the second crest portions <b>20</b><i>a </i>and continuously connected to the second crest portions <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the first crest portions <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the first cam surface <b>10</b> and the second crest portions <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the second cam surface <b>20</b> are always engaged with the second valley portions <b>20</b><i>b </i>and the first valley portions <b>10</b><i>a</i>, respectively and the locking pin <b>4</b> is always engaged with any one of the notches <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c</i>, due to the action of the coil spring <b>6</b>. Thus, the seat back is selectively kept in the vertically standing posture, the forwardly inclined posture or the rearwardly inclined posture relative to the seat cushion. Incidentally, the attitude of the seat back is determined by a notch of the first bracket with which the locking pin is engaged. The operating knob <b>70</b> is adapted to be rotatable in both a clockwise direction and a counterclockwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the person causes the operating knob <b>70</b> to be rotated around the pin-holder <b>5</b> in the clockwise direction or the counterclockwise direction while gripping the lever section of the operating knob <b>70</b>, the first crest portions <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the operating knob <b>70</b> and the second crest portions <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the ring-shaped receiving base <b>9</b> are shifted from the second valley portions <b>20</b><i>b </i>and the first valley portions <b>10</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, respectively, whereby the locking pin <b>4</b> is axially moved away from the first bracket <b>1</b> against the action of the coil spring <b>6</b> and then disengaged from the one of the notches <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c </i>of the first bracket <b>1</b> with which the locking pin <b>4</b> has been engaged until now. Thus, the seat back is brought into a pivotable condition relative to the seat cushion. Incidentally, each of the first and second crest portions <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>a </i>has a height enough to allow the locking pin <b>4</b> to be axially moved and then disengaged from the notches <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c </i>of the first bracket <b>1</b>. Therefore, both the clockwise directional movement of the operating knob and the counterclockwise directional movement of the operating knob can cause the locking pin <b>4</b> to be positively disengaged from the notches <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As discussed above, the disengaging of the locking pin <b>4</b> from the notches <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c </i>of the first bracket <b>1</b> can be easily performed by merely causing the operating knob <b>70</b> to be rotated around the pin-holder <b>5</b>. Therefore, even if the person who handles the operating knob <b>70</b> is physically weak, the person can easily operate the operating knob <b>70</b>. Thus, the recliner device according to the present invention ensures that persons in a broad age-group including aged persons and children easily handle the operating knob.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A stroke of the locking pin <b>4</b> causes the coil spring <b>6</b> to be contracted and causes the locking pin <b>4</b> to be disengaged from the one of the notches <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c </i>of the first bracket <b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a height B of each of the crest portions <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the cam surfaces <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> may be set so as to be larger than a stroke distance A of the locking pin <b>4</b>, so that the rotational movement of the operating knob <b>70</b> is limited. The operating knob <b>70</b> can be rotated in both the clockwise direction and the counterclockwise direction because of the shapes of the first and second cam surfaces <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>. Therefore, the operating knob may be constructed as a type of operating knob that is drawn up and then rotated or is pushed down and then rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the lever section of the operating knob <b>70</b> is released from the person's hand after changing of the attitude of the seat back relative to the seat cushion is performed, the locking pin <b>4</b> is automatically moved toward the lower edge portion of the first bracket <b>1</b> due to the action of the coil spring <b>6</b> while causing the operating knob <b>70</b> to be returned to its original condition in which the first crest portions <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the first cam surface <b>10</b> and the first valley portions <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the first cam surface <b>10</b> are engaged with the second valley portions <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the second cam surface <b>20</b> and the second crest portions <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the first cam surface <b>10</b>, respectively. The locking pin <b>4</b> is then operatively engaged with one of the notches <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c </i>of the first bracket <b>1</b> which corresponds to the changed attitude of the seat back. Thus, the seat back is maintained in the changed attitude.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, there is illustrated a modification of the cooperating cam surface means shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref>. In this modification, the first cam surface <b>10</b> of the cylindrical section <b>70</b><i>b </i>of the operating knob <b>70</b> comprises first and second axially extending surfaces spaced at about 180° around the circumferential edge portion of the substantially cylindrical section <b>70</b><i>b </i>of the operating knob <b>70</b> which faces the circumferential edge portion of the ring-shaped receiving base <b>9</b>, a first circumferentially sloping surface <b>100</b><i>a </i>descending from a tip edge of the first axially extending surface to a root point of the second axially extending surface, and a second circumferentially sloping surface <b>100</b><i>b </i>descending from a tip edge of the second axially extending surface to a root point of the first axially extending surface. Similarly the second cam surface <b>20</b> comprises third and fourth axially extending surfaces spaced at about 180° around the circumferential edge portion of the ring-shaped receiving base <b>9</b>, a third circumferentially sloping surface <b>200</b><i>a </i>descending from a tip edge of the third axially extending surface to a root point of the fourth axially extending surface, and a fourth circumferentially sloping surface <b>200</b><i>b </i>descending from a tip edge of the fourth axially extending surface to a root point of the third axially extending surface. Due to the action of the coil spring, the first circumferentially sloping surface portion <b>100</b><i>a </i>and the second circumferentially sloping surface portion <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the operating knob <b>70</b> are always engaged with the third circumferentially sloping surface portion <b>200</b><i>a </i>and the fourth circumferentially sloping surface portion <b>200</b><i>b </i>of the receiving base <b>9</b>, respectively, and the first axially extending surface and the second axially extending surface are always engaged with the fourth axially extending surface and the third axially extending surface, respectively. Thus, in this modification, the operating knob <b>70</b> is constructed as a unidirectional operating knob. When the operating knob <b>70</b> is rotated in a direction indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> by an arrow, the first sloping surface portion <b>100</b><i>a </i>and the second sloping surface portion <b>100</b><i>b </i>are shifted from the third sloping surface portion <b>200</b><i>a </i>and the fourth sloping surface portion <b>200</b><i>b</i>, respectively, and the first axially extending surface and the second axially extending surface are disengaged from the fourth axially extending surface and the third axially extending surface, respectively, whereby the locking pin is moved away from the first bracket against the action of the coil spring and disengaged from the one of the notches of the first bracket with which the locking pin has been engaged till now. A length of each of the first, second, third and fourth axially extending surface is set so as to be larger than a stroke distance of the locking pin, so that the rotational movement of the operating knob is limited.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, there is illustrated another modification of the cooperating cam surface means. Like the modification of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, this modification includes the first circumferentially sloping surface portion <b>100</b><i>a </i>descending from the tip edge of the first axially extending surface to the root point of the second axially extending surface, the second circumferentially sloping surface <b>100</b><i>b </i>descending from the tip edge of the second axially extending surface to the root point of the first axially extending surface, the third circumferentially sloping surface portion <b>200</b><i>a </i>descending from the tip edge of the third axially extending surface to the root point of the fourth axially extending surface, and the fourth circumferentially sloping surface portion <b>200</b><i>b </i>descending from the tip edge of the fourth axially extending surface to the root point of the third axially extending surface. In the modification of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the third axially extending surface and the fourth axially extending surface of the receiving base <b>9</b> are provided at their tip edges with stopper projections <b>200</b><i>a</i>′, <b>200</b><i>b</i>′. A length L<sub>2 </sub>of each of the first and second circumferentially sloping surfaces <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the operating knob <b>70</b> is shorter than that L<sub>1 </sub>of each of the third and fourth circumferentially sloping surfaces <b>200</b><i>a</i>, <b>200</b><i>b </i>of the receiving base <b>9</b>. Like the operating knob of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the operating knob <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is constructed as a unidirectional knob.</p>

Further, as discussed above, the third axially extending surface and the fourth axially extending surface of the receiving base <b>9</b> are provided at their tip edges with the stopper projections <b>200</b><i>a</i>′, <b>200</b><i>b</i>′. Therefore, when the operating knob <b>70</b> is rotated in a direction indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> by an arrow and the first and second circumferentially sloping surfaces <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b </i>of the operating knob <b>70</b> are shifted from the third and fourth circumferentially sloping surfaces <b>200</b><i>a</i>, <b>200</b><i>b </i>of the receiving base <b>9</b>, the first and second axially extending surfaces of the operating knob <b>70</b> are abutted against the stopper projections <b>200</b><i>a</i>′, <b>200</b><i>b</i>′ of the receiving base <b>9</b>, whereby the rotational movement of the operating knob <b>70</b> is restricted. Incidentally, the shape of the first cam surface <b>10</b> of the operating knob <b>70</b> and the shape of the second cam surface <b>20</b> of the receiving base <b>9</b> may be reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the illustrated examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 12</figref>, the operating knobs <b>70</b> are of types of handle levers. In lieu of the handle lever type-knobs <b>70</b>, such a dial-type operating knob <b>71</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> may be employed. In this case, a side of the dial-type operating knob <b>71</b> which is opposed to or faces the receiving base <b>9</b> is provided with a first cam surface which is constructed in the same manner as the first cam surfaces <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is done, and is engaged with the second cam surface of the receiving base <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the above-discussed examples, the first bracket <b>1</b> is arranged on the inside of the second bracket <b>2</b>. Alternatively, the first bracket <b>1</b> may be arranged on the outside of the second bracket <b>2</b>. In this case, the locking pin is penetrated through the first bracket <b>1</b> and projected toward the second bracket <b>2</b>, and the engaging notches with which the locking pin is to be engaged are provided around the rear end portion of the second bracket <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Furthermore, bearing pieces (not shown) for bearing the inner end portion of the locking pin may be provided at edge areas of the end portion of the inner bracket which are adjacent the notches that are formed in the inner bracket. More particularly, the bearing pieces have shallow V-shaped notches and are arranged at the circumferential edge areas of the end portion of the inner bracket <b>1</b> with the shallow V-shaped notches facing the notches of the inner bracket. In this case, the inner end portion of the locking pin can be stably born between the notches of the bearing pieces and the notches of the inner bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As discussed above, in the recliner device according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the substantially ring-shaped receiving base is fixed on the outer bracket, the pin holder is mounted in the substantially ring-shaped receiving base and fixed on the outer bracket, the locking pin is penetrated though the pin holder and the outer bracket, and always projected toward the inner bracket due to the action of the coil spring, and the operating knob is mounted to the outer end portion of the locking pin with the substantially cylindrical section thereof being rotatably mounted on the pin holder and with the end portion of the substantially cylindrical section thereof facing the receiving base. Due to the action of the coil spring, the locking pin is releasably engaged with any one of the notches formed in the inner bracket. The mating cam surfaces are formed on the side of the cylindrical section of the operating knob and the side of the receiving base which are opposed to each other. The mating cam surfaces include the crest portions having heights enough to allow the axial movement of the locking pin. When the person causes the operating knob to be rotated around the pin holder while gripping the lever section of the operating knob, the crest portions of the cam surface of the operating knob are shifted from the valley portions of the cam surface of the receiving base, whereby the locking pin is axially moved and then positively disengaged from the one of the notches of the inner bracket with which the locking pin has been engaged until now. Therefore, persons in a broad age-group including physically weak persons such as aged persons and children can easily handle the operating knob and easily cause the locking pin to be disengaged from the one of the notches of the inner bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, in the recliner device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 10</figref>, the first cam surface of the operating knob comprises the first and second crest portions spaced apart from each other around the circumferential edge portion of the substantially cylindrical section which is opposed to or faces the circumferential edge portion of the substantially ring-shaped receiving base, and the first and second valley portions each disposed between the first and second crest portions and continuously connected to the first and second crest portions. Similarly, the second cam surface of the substantially ring-shaped receiving base comprises the third and fourth crest portions spaced apart from each other around the circumferential edge portion of the substantially ring-shaped receiving base, and the third and fourth valley portions each disposed between the third and fourth crest portions and continuously connected to the third and fourth crest portions. Because of the shapes of the first and second cam surfaces, the operating knob can be rotated in both the clockwise direction and the counterclockwise direction. Therefore, the operating knob may be constructed as a type of operating knob that is drawn up and then rotated or is pushed down and then rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, in the recliner device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the first cam surface of the operating knob comprises the first and second axially extending surfaces spaced at about 180° around the circumferential edge portion of the substantially cylindrical section which faces the circumferential edge portion of the ring-shaped receiving base, the first circumferentially sloping surface descending from the tip edge of the first axially extending surface to the root point of the second axially extending surface, and the second circumferentially sloping surface descending from the tip edge of the second axially extending surface to the root point of the first axially extending surface. Similarly, the second cam surface of the ring-shaped receiving base comprises the third and fourth axially extending surfaces spaced at 180° around the circumferential edge portion of the ring-shaped receiving base, the third circumferentially sloping surface descending from the tip edge of the third axially extending surface to the root point of the fourth axially extending surface, and the fourth circumferentially sloping surface descending from the tip edge of the fourth axially extending surface to the root point of the third axially extending surface. Because of the shapes of the first and second cam surfaces of the recliner device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the operating knob of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> can be constructed as a unidirectional knob.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Furthermore, in the recliner device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the third axially extending surface and the fourth axially extending surface of the receiving base are provided at their tip edges with the stopper projections, and the length of each of the first and second circumferentially sloping surfaces of the operating knob is shorter than that of each of the third and fourth circumferentially sloping surfaces of the receiving base. Therefore, the operating knob of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> can be constructed as a unidirectional knob. In addition, the rotational movement of the operating knob around the pin holder can be positively restricted by the stopper projections.</p>

A height B of each of the crest portions <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the cam surfaces <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> is set so as to be larger than a stroke distance A of the locking pin <b>4</b>, so that the rotational movement of the operating knob <b>4</b> is limited. The operating knob <b>70</b> can be rotated in both the clockwise direction and the counterclockwise direction because of the shapes of the first and second cam surfaces <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>. Therefore, the operating knob can be constructed as a type of operating knob that is drawn up and then rotated or pushed down and then rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When the operating knob <b>70</b> is released from the person's hand after changing of the attitude of the seat back relative to the seat cushion is carried out by causing the seat back to be pivoted relative to the seat cushion by the person's hand, the locking pin <b>4</b> is operatively projected toward the edge of the lower end portion of the first bracket <b>1</b> and the inner end portion <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the locking pin <b>4</b> is then operatively engaged with any one of the notches <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c </i>of the first bracket <b>1</b>, whereby the attitude of the seat back is kept changed. At this time, by causing the grooves <b>70</b><i>d</i>′ of the operating knob <b>70</b> to be engaged with the projections <b>90</b><i>d </i>of the receiving base <b>90</b> by rotating the operating knob <b>70</b>, the person can make sure that the inner end portion <b>4</b><i>a </i>of the locking pin <b>4</b> is positively engaged with any one of the notches <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">While the handle-type operating knob <b>70</b> is employed in the second embodiment of the present invention, a dial-type operating knob <b>71</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> may be employed. In this case, a side of the dial-type operating knob <b>71</b> which is opposed to or faces the ring-shaped receiving portion <b>90</b><i>a </i>of the receiving base <b>90</b> is provided with a first cam surface which is formed in the same manner as the first cam surface <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is done, and is releasably engaged with the second cam surface of the receiving base <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the second embodiment, the first bracket <b>1</b> is arranged on the inside of the second bracket <b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Alternatively, the first bracket <b>1</b> may be arranged on the outside of the second bracket <b>2</b>. In this case, the locking pin is penetrated through the first bracket <b>1</b> and projected toward the second bracket <b>2</b>, and the engaging notches with which the locking pin is to be engaged are provided around the rear end portion of the second bracket <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Furthermore, bearing pieces (not shown) for bearing the inner end portion of the locking pin may be provided at edge areas of the end portion of the inner bracket which are adjacent the notches that are formed in the inner bracket. More particularly, the bearing pieces have shallow V-shaped notches and are arranged at the circumferential edge areas of the end portion of the inner bracket <b>1</b> with the shallow V-shaped notches facing the notches of the inner bracket. In this case, the inner end portion of the locking pin can be stably born between the notches of the bearing pieces and the notches of the inner bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As discussed above, in the recliner device according to the second embodiment of the present invention, the plate-shaped receiving base is fixed on the outer bracket with the substantially ring-shaped receiving portion thereof surrounding the locking pin, the pin holder is mounted in the substantially ring-shaped receiving base and fixed on the outer bracket, the outer end portion of the locking pin projects outwardly from the pin holder, the inner end portion of the locking pin always projects toward the edge of the end portion of the inner bracket due to the action of the coil spring, and the operating knob is mounted on the outer end portion of the locking pin with the substantially cylindrical section thereof being rotatably mounted on the pin holder and with the end portion of the substantially cylindrical section thereof facing the receiving base. The locking pin is releasably engaged with any one of the notches formed in the inner bracket, by the action of the coil spring. The mating cam surfaces are formed on the side of the cylindrical section of the operating knob and the side of the receiving base which are opposed to or face each other. The mating cam surfaces include the crest portions having heights enough to allow the axial movement of the locking pin. When the person causes the operating knob to be rotated around the pin holder while gripping the lever section of the operating knob, the crest portions of the cam surface of the operating knob are shifted from the valley portions of the cam surface of the receiving base, whereby the locking pin is axially moved and then positively disengaged from the one of the notches of the inner bracket with which the locking pin has been engaged until now. Therefore, persons in a broad age-group including physically weak persons such as aged persons and children can easily handle the operating knob and easily cause the locking pin to be disengaged from the one of the notches of the inner bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Furthermore, in the recliner device according to the second embodiment, the first cam surface of the operating knob comprises the first and second crest portions spaced apart from each other around the circumferential edge portion of the substantially cylindrical section which is opposed to or faces the circumferential edge portion of the substantially ring-shaped receiving base, and the first and second valley portions each disposed between the first and second crest portions and continuously connected to the first and second crest portions. Similarly, the second cam surface of the substantially ring-shaped receiving base comprises the third and fourth crest portions spaced apart from each other around the circumferential edge portion of the substantially ring-shaped receiving base, and the third and fourth valley portions each disposed between the third and fourth crest portions and continuously connected to the third and fourth crest portions. Because of the shapes of the first and second cam surfaces, the operating knob can be rotated in both the clockwise direction and the counterclockwise direction. Therefore, the operating knob may be constructed as a type of operating knob that is drawn up and then rotated or is pushed down and then rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Furthermore, in the second embodiment of the present invention, the cap-shaped boss section is provided with the elongated protruding piece which extends axially from the cap-shaped boss section and has at least one linear groove formed in the inner surface of the protruding piece, and the one of the crest portions of the receiving base has at least one vertically extending projection. The at least one groove of the operating knob is releasably engaged with the at least one projection of the receiving base. In a condition where the groove of the operating knob is disengaged from the projection of the receiving base, when the operating knob is returned to its original position due to the action of the coil spring and the person then rotates the operating knob in such a direction as to cause the groove of the operating knob to be engaged with the projection of the receiving base, whereby the groove of the operating knob is again engaged with the projection of the receiving base while producing clicking sounds. Thus, the person can make sure that the locking pin is projected toward the edge of the lower end portion of the first bracket and positively engaged with any one of the notches of the first bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Furthermore, in the second embodiment, the substantially plate-shaped base body of the receiving base has the dowel projecting from the back side of the base body of the receiving base, and the dowel of the receiving base is fitted in the dowel hole formed in the second bracket, whereby the receiving base is positively positioned with respect to the second bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The terms and expressions which have been employed herein are used as terms of description, not of limitation. There is no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features described or any portions thereof.
