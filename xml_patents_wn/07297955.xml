<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Each semiconductor radiation detector used for a nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus (PET apparatus) is constructed with an anode electrode A facing a cathode electrode C sandwiching a CdTe semiconductor member S which generates charge through interaction with γ-rays. Then, a thickness t of the semiconductor member S sandwiched between these mutually facing anode electrode A and cathode electrode C is set to 0.2 to 2 mm. Furthermore, the devices are mounted (laid out) on substrates in such a way that the distance (distance of conductor) between the semiconductor radiation detector and an analog ASIC which processes the signal detected by this detector is shortened. Furthermore, the substrates on which the detectors are mounted are housed in a housing as a unit (detector unit).</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus, and more particularly, to a positron emission tomography (hereinafter referred to as “PET”) apparatus, which is a kind of a nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus using a semiconductor radiation detector, semiconductor radiation detection apparatus or detector unit.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A detector using a NaI scintillator is known as a conventional radiation detector for detecting radiation such as γ-rays. With a gamma camera (a kind of nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus) provided with a NaI scintillator, radiation (γ-rays) incident on the scintillator at an angle restricted by many collimators interacts with NaI crystals and emits scintillation light. This light travels in such a way as to sandwich a light guide, reaches a photoelectric multiplier and becomes an electrical signal. The electrical signal is shaped by a measuring circuit mounted on a measuring circuit fixing board and transferred from an output connector to an external data collection system. All these scintillator, light guide, photoelectric multiplier and measuring circuit, measuring circuit fixing board, etc., are housed in a light shielding case and shielded from electromagnetic waves other than external radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since a gamma camera using a scintillator has a structure with a large photoelectric multiplier (also called “photomultiplier”) placed after one large crystal such as NaI, its position resolution remains on the order of 10 mm. Furthermore, since the scintillator detects radiation in multi-stages of conversion from radiation to visible light, from visible light to electrons, it has a problem of having considerably poor energy resolution. For example, there is a PET apparatus (positron emission tomography apparatus) having position resolution of 5 to 6 mm or a high-end PET apparatus having position resolution of 4 mm or so, but since their photoelectric multipliers use vacuum tubes, it is difficult to further improve position resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are radiation detectors for detecting radiation according to principles different from those of such a scintillator, such as semiconductor radiation detectors provided with a semiconductor radiation detection element using a semiconductor material such as CdTe (cadmium telluride), TlBr (thallium bromide) and GaAs (gallium arsenide).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This semiconductor radiation detector is attracting attention because its semiconductor radiation detection element converts electrical charge produced by interaction between radiation and the semiconductor material to an electrical signal, and therefore it has better efficiency of conversion to an electrical signal than the scintillator and can also be miniaturized.

<p id="p-0008" num="0009">Meanwhile, when a semiconductor material such as T<b>1</b> making up a semiconductor radiation detection element interacts with radiation in a semiconductor radiation detector, holes having positive electrical charge and electrons having negative electrical charge are generated. While mobility of electrons is relatively large, mobility of holes is relatively small. That is, electrons move relatively easily and holes move with difficulty. This takes more time for holes to reach an electrode than electrons. Moreover, holes may be annihilated before reaching the electrode. This involves a problem that the detection sensitivity of radiation is worsened. Thus, these problems require solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor radiation detector capable of improving detection sensitivity.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">In order to solve the above described problems, a first embodiment of the present invention improves detection sensitivity by shortening a distance between electrodes for charge collection of a semiconductor radiation detector. That is, the distance between an anode electrode and cathode electrode or the thickness of a semiconductor area sandwiched between the anode electrode and cathode electrode is 0.2 to 2 mm. In this structure, the distance from positions of electrons and holes generated by interaction between the semiconductor material and radiation to the electrodes is shortened, and therefore the time required for them to reach the electrodes is shortened. Furthermore, shortening the distance up to the electrodes reduces the probability that holes may be annihilated midway the distance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">A second embodiment of the present invention is a nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus comprising a plurality of unit substrates including a plurality of semiconductor radiation detectors for introducing radiation and an integrated circuit for processing radiation detection signals output from the plurality of semiconductor radiation detectors. This allows the semiconductor radiation detectors and the integrated circuits which process the outputs to be disposed close to one another, with the result that when weak output signals of the semiconductor radiation detectors are transmitted to the integrated circuits, it is possible to reduce influences of noise on the weak output signals.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">The semiconductor radiation detector, analog LSI (Large Scale Integrated Circuit), AD converter and digital LSI are preferably arranged on the unit substrate in that order and the respective elements are connected by wiring so that a signal detected by the semiconductor radiation detector is processed by the analog LSI, the signal processed by the analog LSI is processed by the AD converter, and the signal processed by the AD converter is processed by the digital LSI. By shortening the distance between the semiconductor radiation detector and analog LSI in particular, this structure can shorten the wiring distance between the semiconductor radiation detector and analog LSI and thereby reduce noise superimposed on the wiring until the signal detected by the semiconductor radiation detector reaches the analog LSI. In an embodiment which will be described later, the LSI (integrated circuit) corresponds to an ASIC. Also, the semiconductor radiation detection apparatus corresponds to a combined substrate (detector substrate+ASIC substrate) in the embodiment which will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">According to the second embodiment, detection signals when the semiconductor radiation detectors detect radiation are processed by an application-specific IC called “ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit)” and this embodiment is intended to solve an additional problem discovered by the inventor et al. that since the detection signals output from the semiconductor radiation detectors are weak, the ASIC is easily affected by noise. A reduction of the noise leads to substantial improvement of detection sensitivity (count, peak value, time detection accuracy) by the semiconductor radiation detectors.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">Different substrates are preferably used as the substrate for mounting the semiconductor radiation detectors and the substrate for mounting the LSI. During ordinary operation, the two substrates are used in combination as a combined substrate (unified substrate) so that in the event of trouble, only the troubled substrate can be replaced to thereby facilitate maintenance and examination, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">A third embodiment of the present invention adopts a unit-type construction in which a plurality of unit substrates including semiconductor radiation detectors and an integrated circuit are mounted in a frame in a detachable/attachable manner. Since it is only necessary to mount a detector unit including a plurality of unit substrates on a nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus, a plurality of semiconductor radiation detectors can be mounted on the nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus at a time. In this way, the time required to mount the semiconductor radiation detectors on the nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus can be shortened drastically.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">The embodiment is preferably adapted so that these unit substrates can be removed from the detector unit one by one or the whole detector unit can be removed from the nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus, or more specifically, from the camera, which facilitates maintenance and examination.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">Note that many semiconductor radiation detectors are used for a nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus (radiological diagnostic apparatus) such as PET, SPECT and gamma camera. For example, a PET uses a hundred thousand to several hundreds of thousands of (channels) semiconductor radiation detectors and there is a demand for shortening the time required to mount these many semiconductor radiation detectors on the nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus. A fourth embodiment of the present invention is implemented to meet such a demand. There is also a demand for facilitating maintenance and examination of semiconductor radiation detectors.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">The present invention can prevent or reduce deterioration of the detection sensitivity of radiation using semiconductor radiation detectors. The present invention can also prevent or reduce deterioration of signals detected by the semiconductor radiation detectors. This allows, for example, a nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus to obtain clear images.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">A nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus which is a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to attached drawings in detail below as appropriate. The following are explanations of the nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus according to this embodiment, distance between electrodes of a semiconductor radiation detector, arrangement (layout) of elements such as analog ASIC on a substrate, and elements applicable to this embodiment for construction of substrate units, etc. Note that an analog ASIC refers to an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) which is an application-specific IC for processing analog signals and is a kind of LSI.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">&lt;&lt;Nuclear Medicine Diagnostic Apparatus&gt;&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">First, the nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus (radiological diagnostic apparatus) according to this embodiment will be explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a PET apparatus <b>1</b> as the nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus is constructed by including a camera (image pickup apparatus) <b>11</b>, a data processing apparatus <b>12</b>, a display apparatus <b>13</b>, etc. An examinee is laid on a bed <b>14</b> to be photographed using the camera <b>11</b>. The camera <b>11</b> incorporates many semiconductor radiation detectors <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) to detect γ-rays emitted from the body of the examinee using semiconductor radiation detectors (hereinafter simply referred to as “detectors”) <b>21</b>. The camera <b>11</b> is provided with an integrated circuit (ASIC) for measuring peak values, detection times of γ-rays and is designed to measure peak values and detection times of detected radiations (γ-rays). The data processing apparatus <b>12</b> includes a storage apparatus, a simultaneous measuring apparatus <b>12</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a tomographic information creation apparatus <b>12</b>B (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The data processing apparatus <b>12</b> takes in data of peak values, detection times of detected γ-rays and packet data including detector (channel) IDs. The simultaneous measuring apparatus <b>12</b>A carries out simultaneous measurements based on this packet data, especially data of detection times and detector IDs, identifies detection positions of 511 KeV γ-rays and stores them in the storage apparatus. The tomographic information creation apparatus <b>12</b>B creates a functional image based on the identified positions and displays it on the display apparatus <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, inside the camera <b>11</b>, many detector units <b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> for details) housing a plurality of combined substrates <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> for details) provided with many detectors <b>21</b> for detecting γ-rays emitted from the examinee are disposed circumferentially. The examinee is laid on the bed <b>14</b> and positioned at the center of the camera <b>11</b>. At this time, the detectors are disposed so as to surround the bed <b>14</b>. The detector unit <b>2</b> is designed to output for each detector <b>21</b> included in the detector unit <b>2</b>, peak value information of γ-rays obtained based on a detection signal when a detector <b>21</b> interact with γ-rays, time information on γ-ray detection and address information (detector ID) of each detector <b>21</b>. The constructions of the detector <b>21</b>, combined substrate <b>20</b> and detector unit <b>2</b> will be explained in detail later. The examinee is administered radiopharmaceuticals, for example, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) containing <sup>18</sup>F whose half-life is 110 minutes. γ-rays (annihilated γ-rays) are emitted from the body of the examinee when positrons emitted from the FDG annihilate.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">Hereafter, the characteristic parts of this embodiment will be explained.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">&lt;&lt;Semiconductor Radiation Detector; Distance between Electrodes&gt;&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">First, the detector <b>21</b> applied to this embodiment will be explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the detector <b>21</b> is constructed of a semiconductor radiation detection element (hereinafter referred to as “detection element”) <b>211</b> made of a tabular semiconductor material S, both sides of which are covered with thin-plate (film) electrodes (anode A, cathode C) (minimum construction). Of these components, the semiconductor material S is made up of a single crystal of any one of the above described CdTe (cadmium telluride), TlBr (thallium bromide), GaAs (gallium arsenide), etc. Furthermore, the electrodes (anode A, cathode C) are made of any one material of Pt (platinum), Au (gold), In (indium), etc. In the following explanations, suppose the semiconductor material S is obtained by slicing a CdTe single crystal. Furthermore, suppose radiation to be detected is 511 KeV γ-rays used for the PET apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">An overview of the principle of γ-ray detection using the detector <b>21</b> will be explained using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When γ-rays are introduced into the detector <b>21</b> and interaction occurs between γ-rays and the semiconductor material S constituting the detector <b>21</b>, an amount of hole and electron pairs schematically shown in the figure with “+” and “−” corresponding to the energy of γ-rays is generated. Here, a voltage (e.g., 300 V) for charge collection is applied between the electrodes of the anode A and cathode C of the detector <b>21</b>. Because of this, holes are moved attracted to the cathode C and electrons are moved attracted to the anode A. When holes and electrons are compared, as described in “Disclosure of the invention” the ease of movement (mobility) of electrons is relatively large and therefore electrons reach the anode in a shorter time. On the other hand, the mobility of holes is relatively small and therefore holes take more time to reach the cathode. Note that holes may be annihilated before reaching the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> which shows a comparison in the “time-peak value curve” between a case where the semiconductor material S (detection element <b>211</b>) of the detector <b>21</b> is thick and a case where it is thin, the semiconductor material S having a smaller thickness t has a quicker rise of peak value and a higher maximum value of the peak value. Having a quicker rise of the peak value contributes to improvement of the accuracy of simultaneous measurement of the PET, for example. Furthermore, having a higher peak value contributes to increasing energy resolution. Thus, a smaller thickness t speeds up rising of the peak value and increases the peak value (the efficiency of charge collection improves) because the time for electrons and holes to reach the electrodes (anode A, cathode C) (time of charge collection) is shortened. This is also because holes which would be conventionally annihilated midway can reach the electrode (cathode C) without annihilation because of the shorter distance. Note that the thickness t can also be expressed by the distance between the electrodes, anode A and cathode C facing each other.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">The thickness (distance between electrodes) t of the detection element <b>211</b> is preferably 0.2 mm to 2 mm. This is because a thickness t of not less than 2 mm slows down the rising speed of the peak value and reduces the maximum value of the peak value as well. On the other hand, a thickness t of smaller than 0.2 mm relatively increases the thickness (volume) of the electrodes (anode, cathode) and when installed on a substrate, the proportion of the very semiconductor material S that interacts with radiation decreases. That is, reducing the thickness t of the semiconductor material S relatively increases the thickness of the electrode which does not interact with γ-rays on one hand, and the proportion of the semiconductor material S which interacts with γ-rays relatively decreases on the other, with the result that the sensitivity of detecting γ-rays decreases (γ-rays pass by). Furthermore, a smaller thickness t may cause more leakage current preventing a high voltage from being applied for charge collection.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">For the same reason, the thickness t of the semiconductor material S is preferably 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm and such a thickness t allows more reliable detection of γ-rays and more correct measurement of the peak value, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">In the case of the PET apparatus <b>1</b>, since it carries out simultaneous measurement, one of problems to be solved is to correctly measure a γ-ray detection time. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is a difference in a detection time when positions at which γ-rays interact with the semiconductor material S are closer to the cathode C and when those positions are closer to the anode A. That is, since the moving speed of holes is lower, the detection time when the interaction occurs closer to the anode A is relatively late, while the detection time when the interaction occurs closer to the cathode C is relatively early (approximates to a real time). That is, also when γ-rays interact with the semiconductor material S in the same detection element <b>211</b>, there is a problem that the detection time changes depending on the position at which the interaction takes place. More specifically, when the thickness t is large, the difference in the detection time depending on the position at which the interaction takes place increases. Such an event constitutes no big problem in other fields, but it constitutes a big problem in the case of the PET apparatus <b>1</b>, which carries out simultaneous measurement (simultaneous counting) on the order of nsec (nanoseconds). Therefore, in this sense, too, it is possible to determine the detection time appropriately within the above described thickness range. The detection time is determined by the PET according to an LET system or CFD system.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> which schematically shows a relationship between the thickness t of the semiconductor material S and peak value (maximum value) of the detector <b>21</b>, the maximum value of the peak value decreases as the thickness t of the semiconductor material S increases. One of reasons that the peak value decreases is that holes are annihilated before reaching the electrode. When the thickness t becomes 2 mm, the peak value of detected radiation falls short of a threshold whereby it is possible to discriminate 511 KeV γ-rays, and therefore it is not preferable to increase the thickness t of the semiconductor material S more than 2 mm as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the detector <b>21</b> includes the semiconductor materials S (detection elements <b>211</b>) laminated in five layers each sandwiched between the cathode C and anode A. Each layer of the semiconductor material S is a single layer detector <b>21</b> having the aforementioned thickness t (0.2 to 2 mm (more preferably 0.5 to 1.5 mm)). The thickness of the anode A and cathode C is approximately 20 microns. In the detector <b>21</b> having a laminated structure shown in this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the different anodes A or different cathodes C are connected to a common wire, and therefore each layer is not designed to detect radiation independently of other layers. In other words, when γ-rays interact with the semiconductor material S, it is not possible to discriminate whether the interaction takes place on the top layer or bottom layer. Of course, it is also possible to adopt a structure in which radiation is detected by each layer. This five-layer structure is adopted because reducing the thickness t of the semiconductor material S is preferable in increasing the rising speed of the peak value and increasing the maximum value of the peak value, but a small thickness t causes more γ-rays to pass by, and therefore reducing the amount of γ-rays that pass by while increasing the efficiency of charge collection increases interaction between the semiconductor material S and γ-rays (to increase a count value).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">Adopting the detector <b>21</b> having such a laminated structure can obtain a better peak value rising speed and an accurate peak value and increase the number of γ-rays (count value)(increase the sensitivity) that interact with the semiconductor material S.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">An area s of the electrode (anode A, cathode C) is preferably 4 to 120 mm<sup>2</sup>. An increase of the area s increases the capacity (stray capacitance) of the detector <b>21</b> and this increase in the stray capacitance makes noise easier to superimpose, and therefore the area s of the electrode is preferably as small as possible. Furthermore, charge produced when γ-rays are detected is partially accumulated in the stray capacitance, and therefore there is a problem that when the stray capacitance increases, the amount of charge stored in a charge amplifier <b>24</b><i>b </i>of an analog ASIC <b>24</b> or further an output voltage (peak value) decreases. When CdTe is used for the detector <b>21</b>, its dielectric constant is 11 and if the area s of the detector <b>21</b> is 120 mm<sup>2</sup>, thickness t is 1 mm, then the capacity is 12 pF, which is not negligible considering the fact that the stray capacitance of connectors, etc. of the circuit is several pF. Therefore, the area s of the electrode is preferably 120 mm<sup>2 </sup>or less.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">Furthermore, the lower limit of the area s of the electrode is determined by position resolution of the PET apparatus. The position resolution of the PET apparatus is determined by not only the size (array pitch) of the detector <b>21</b> but also the positron range, etc., but since the range of positron of <b>18</b>F is 2 mm, setting the size of the detector <b>21</b> to 2 mm or less is meaningless. The method of mounting so that the area of the electrode becomes a minimum is a case where the surface of the electrode is placed perpendicular to the radius direction of the camera <b>11</b> and from the above described consideration, the lower limit of one side of the electrode is 2 mm and the lower limit of the area s of the electrode is 4 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">In the above described explanations, CdTe is used as the semiconductor material S which interacts with γ-rays, but it goes without saying that the semiconductor material S may also be TlBr or GaAs, etc. Moreover, the terms “laminated structure”, “upper layer” and “lower layer” have been used, but these terms are based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and when the viewing direction is turned by 90° toward the horizontal direction, the laminated structure may be read as a parallel structure and top/bottom may be read as right/left, for example. Moreover, the direction of incident γ-rays may also be upward, downward, rightward and leftward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In other words, the detector <b>21</b> has a structure in which a plurality of (e.g., five) semiconductor materials S are arranged in parallel in such a way as to sandwich cathodes C and anodes A alternately.</p>

Here, as the number of detectors <b>21</b> to be installed increases, it is easier to detect γ-rays and it is possible to increase position accuracy when γ-rays are detected. For this reason, the detectors <b>21</b> are disposed on the detector substrate <b>20</b>A as densely as possible. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, when γ-rays emitted from the examinee on the bed <b>14</b> travel from bottom to top in the figure (direction indicated by an arrow <b>32</b>, that is, radius direction of the camera <b>11</b>), arranging the detectors <b>21</b> in the left-to-right direction densely on the detector substrate <b>20</b>A is preferable because in this way, the number of γ-rays that pass by (the number of γ-rays that pass through the gap between the detectors <b>21</b>) is reduced. This increases the detection efficiency of γ-rays and increases spatial resolution of an image obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the detector substrate <b>20</b>A of this embodiment arranges the detectors <b>21</b> on both sides of the substrate body <b>20</b><i>a</i>, and therefore the substrate body <b>20</b><i>a </i>can be shared by both sides compared to the case where the detectors <b>21</b> are arranged only on one side. For this reason, it is possible to reduce the number of substrate bodies <b>20</b><i>a </i>by half and arrange the detectors <b>21</b> more densely in the circumferential direction. Moreover, as described above, the number of detector substrates <b>20</b>A (combined substrates <b>20</b>) can be reduced by half, and therefore there is a merit of saving time and trouble to mount the combined substrates <b>20</b> in the housing <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) which will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">In the above described explanations, the <b>16</b> horizontal detectors <b>21</b> are arranged in the axial direction of the camera <b>11</b>, but the arrangement is not limited to this. For example, the <b>16</b> horizontal detectors <b>21</b> may also be arranged in the circumferential direction of the camera <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, each detector <b>21</b> has a laminated structure of single crystals of the aforementioned thin-film semiconductor materials S (detection elements <b>211</b>). The structure and function thereof have already been explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, but supplementary explanations will be given here. As described above, the detector <b>21</b> is provided with the anode A and cathode C and a potential difference (voltage) of, for example, 300 V is applied between the anode A and cathode C for charge collection. This voltage is supplied from the ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B to the detector substrate <b>20</b>A via the connector C<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>). Furthermore, the signal detected by each detector <b>21</b> is supplied to the ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B via the connector C<b>1</b>. Thus, on-board wiring (for charge collection and signal exchange) (not shown) for connecting the connector C<b>1</b> and each detector <b>21</b> is provided in the substrate body <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the detector substrate <b>20</b>A. This on-board wiring has a multi-layered structure. In this embodiment, the detection elements <b>211</b> of the detector <b>21</b> are arranged in parallel to the substrate body <b>20</b><i>a</i>. However, the detectors <b>21</b> may also be provided so that the respective detection elements <b>211</b> are disposed perpendicular to the substrate body <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(ASIC Substrate)</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">Then, the ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B incorporating the ASIC will be explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B is provided with two analog ASICs <b>24</b> and one digital ASIC <b>26</b> on one side of the substrate body <b>20</b><i>b</i>. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, since the analog ASICs <b>24</b> are provided on both sides of the substrate body <b>20</b><i>b</i>, one ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B includes a total of four analog ASICs <b>24</b>. Furthermore, the ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B includes eight (=4×2) ADCs <b>25</b> on one side of the substrate body <b>20</b><i>b </i>and sixteen ADCs <b>25</b> on both sides. Furthermore, as many capacitors <b>22</b> and resistors <b>23</b> as the detectors <b>21</b> are arranged on both sides of one substrate body <b>20</b><i>b</i>. Furthermore, to electrically connect theses capacitors <b>22</b>, resistors <b>23</b>, analog ASICs <b>24</b>, ADCs <b>25</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b>, the ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B (substrate body <b>20</b><i>b</i>) is provided with on-board wiring (not shown) as with the above described detector substrate <b>20</b>A. This on-board wiring also has a laminated structure.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">These elements <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> are arranged (on-board wiring) so that a signal supplied from the detector substrate <b>20</b>A is supplied to the capacitor <b>22</b>, resistor <b>23</b>, analog ASIC <b>24</b>, ADC <b>25</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b> in that order.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">The ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B includes a connector (spiral contact) C<b>1</b> which is connected to the on-board wiring which is connected to each capacitor <b>22</b> to make electrical connections to the detector substrate <b>20</b>A and a substrate connector C<b>2</b> which makes electrical connections to the data processing apparatus (the unit combination FPGA which will be described later). Note that the above described detector substrate <b>20</b>A also includes the connector C<b>1</b> connected to the on-board wiring which is connected to each detector <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(Connection Structure between Detector Substrate and ASIC Substrate)</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">The connection structure between the detector substrate <b>20</b>A and ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">The detector substrate <b>20</b>A and ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B are connected not with their respective end faces (ends) facing each other but by providing an overlap area where both ends overlap with each other and connecting the connectors C<b>1</b> in this overlap area as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. This connection is made in a detachable/attachable manner using screws for clamping. These connections are made for the following reason. That is, when the combined substrate <b>20</b> made up of the detector substrate <b>20</b>A and ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B connected (combined) together is supported on one end (cantilever support) or on both ends in the horizontal direction, a force which flexes or bends the combined substrate <b>20</b> downward is applied to the central area (connection area) of the combined substrate <b>20</b>. Here, in the case where both ends are the connection area where their respective end faces (ends) face each other, the connection area is easily flexed or bent, which is not preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">With consideration given to this aspect, this embodiment connects the detector substrate <b>20</b>A and ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B not with the respective end faces facing each other but by providing the overlap area so that the areas close to the ends overlap with each other as described above. This improves toughness against flexure or bending compared to the connection with the end faces facing each other, which is preferable. Moreover, improving toughness against flexure or bending of the combined substrate suppresses dislocation of the detectors <b>21</b> and prevents deterioration of accuracy of identifying positions at which γ-rays are generated. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the camera <b>11</b> of the PET apparatus <b>1</b> is provided with many detector units <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) including the combined substrate <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref> in a doughnut shape and these combined substrates <b>20</b> disposed at positions of 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock in the horizontal direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are liable to flexure or bending. Thus, the toughness of the combined substrates <b>20</b> against flexure or bending becomes important.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">The detector substrate <b>20</b>A and ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B are electrically connected using the aforementioned overlap area. For this purpose, a connector C<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) which electrically connects the on-board wiring of both the substrates <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B is provided in the respective overlap areas of the detector substrate <b>20</b>A and ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. For the connector C<b>1</b>, for example, a spiral contact (R) is used to improve electrical connections. The spiral contact(R) is made of a ball-shaped connection terminal contacting a spiral contactor over a wide area and provides a characteristic of realizing optimal electrical connections. Note that when the ball-shaped connection terminal is provided on the ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B side, the spiral contactor is provided on the detector substrate <b>20</b>A side, and when the ball-shaped connection terminal is provided on the detector substrate <b>20</b>A side, the spiral contactor is provided on the ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B side.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">Using such an electrical connection structure between the detector substrate <b>20</b>A and ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B allows signals to be sent from the detector substrate <b>20</b>A to the ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B with low loss. Note that when loss is small, the energy resolution on the part of the detectors <b>21</b> improves.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">Furthermore, as described above, the detector substrate <b>20</b>A and ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B are connected in a freely detachable/attachable manner by means of screws, etc. Thus, even when trouble occurs in the semiconductor radiation detectors <b>21</b> or ASICs <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, all that should be done is just to replace the part with trouble. Therefore, this eliminates waste that the entire combined substrate <b>20</b> must be replaced due to trouble in that part. Moreover, since electrical connection between the detector substrate <b>20</b>A and ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B is made by the connector C<b>1</b> such as the aforementioned spiral contactor (R), connection or disconnection (combination or dissociation) between the substrates can be done easily.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0066">In the above described construction, one detector substrate <b>20</b>A is connected to the ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B, but it is also possible to divide the detector substrate into a plurality of portions. For example, two detector substrates may be connected to the ASIC substrate, each consisting of eight horizontal by four vertical detectors <b>21</b>. According to this construction, if one detector <b>21</b> has trouble, of the two detector substrates, only the one including the faulty detector <b>21</b> needs to be replaced and it is therefore possible to reduce waste in maintenance (cost reduction).</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(Element Layout)</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067">Then, the layout of elements such as the detectors <b>21</b>, ASICs <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> of the combined substrate <b>20</b> will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the detector <b>21</b> is connected to the analog ASIC <b>24</b> through the connector C<b>1</b>, capacitor <b>22</b> and resistor <b>23</b> by means of electrical wiring (not shown) and a detection signal of γ-rays detected by the detector <b>21</b> is passed through the capacitor <b>22</b> and resistor <b>23</b> by means of the electrical wiring and processed by the analog ASIC <b>24</b>. Furthermore, the signal processed by the analog ASIC <b>24</b> is also processed by the ADC <b>25</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">Here, the shorter the length of the circuit and length (distance) of the wiring, the better, because there is less influence of noise or less attenuation of a signal. Furthermore, when simultaneous measurement processing is carried out by the PET apparatus <b>1</b>, a shorter circuit or wiring is preferred because its time delay is smaller (preferable because the accuracy of detection time is not lost). For this reason, in order of the detector <b>21</b>, capacitor <b>22</b>, resistor <b>23</b>, analog ASIC <b>24</b>, ADC <b>25</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b> from the center axis of the camera <b>11</b> outward in the radius direction of the camera <b>11</b>, that is, the elements <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> are arranged (layout) in this embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. This order is the same as the signal processing order by the elements <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). That is, from the center axis of the camera <b>11</b> outward, the “detector, analog integrated circuit, AD converter and digital integrated circuit” are arranged on the substrate in that order and wired in the same order. Thus, it is possible to transmit a weak signal detected by the detector <b>21</b> to the analog ASIC <b>24</b> with the wiring length (distance) shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">Since the signal of the analog ASIC <b>24</b> is subjected to processing such as amplification, it is less susceptible to influences of noise even if the length of wiring from the analog ASIC <b>24</b> onward is long. That is, considering noise, there is no problem even if the wiring length from the analog ASIC <b>24</b> onward is long. However, with lengthy wiring, there is a delay in signal transmission and the accuracy of the above described detection time may deteriorate.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">In this embodiment, since not only the detector <b>21</b> but also the analog ASIC <b>24</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b> are included in one combined substrate <b>20</b>, the detector <b>21</b>, analog ASIC <b>24</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b> can be arranged in the longitudinal direction of the bed <b>14</b>, that is, the direction perpendicular to the body axis of the examinee subject to an examination, and therefore this eliminates the need to extend the length of the camera (image pickup apparatus) <b>11</b> in the longitudinal direction of the bed more than necessary. It is also possible to consider the possibility of arranging the analog ASIC <b>24</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b> outside in the radius direction of the annularly arranged detector group, and in the longitudinal direction of the bed <b>14</b>, but this causes the length of the camera <b>11</b> in the longitudinal direction of the bed to become longer than necessary. Furthermore, semiconductor radiation detectors are used as the detectors <b>21</b>, and analog ASIC <b>24</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b> are used as signal processing apparatuses, the length of the combined substrate <b>20</b> in the longitudinal direction is shortened and the length of the camera <b>11</b> in the orthogonal direction can be shortened significantly compared to the case where a scintillator is used. Furthermore, the combined substrate <b>20</b> is provided with the detector <b>21</b>, analog ASIC <b>24</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b> in that order in the longitudinal direction thereof, and therefore it is possible to shorten the length of the wiring connecting them and simplify the wiring on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0072">Here, in this embodiment, one analog ASIC <b>24</b> is connected to 32 detectors <b>21</b> to process signals obtained from the detectors <b>21</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, one analog ASIC <b>24</b> is provided with <b>32</b> sets of an analog signal processing circuit (analog signal processing apparatus) <b>33</b> made up of a slow system and fast system. One analog signal processing circuit <b>33</b> is provided for each detector <b>21</b> and connected to one detector <b>21</b>. Here, the fast system is provided with a timing pick off circuit <b>24</b><i>a </i>to output a timing signal for identifying a detection time of γ-rays. On the other hand, the slow system is provided with a polarity amplifier (linear amplifier) <b>24</b><i>c</i>, a band pass filter (waveform shaping apparatus) <b>24</b><i>d </i>and a peak hold circuit (peak value holding apparatus) <b>24</b><i>e </i>connected in this order for the purpose of calculating a peak value of the detected γ-rays. Note that the slow system is named “slow” because it takes a certain degree of processing time to calculate a peak value. Reference numeral <b>24</b><i>b </i>denotes a charge amplifier (preamplifier). A γ-ray detection signal output from the detector <b>21</b> and passed through the capacitor <b>22</b> and resistor <b>23</b> is amplified at the charge amplifier <b>24</b><i>b </i>and polarity amplifier <b>24</b><i>c</i>. The amplified gamma-ray detection signal is passed through the band pass filter <b>24</b><i>d </i>and input to the peak hold circuit <b>24</b><i>e</i>. The peak hold circuit <b>24</b><i>e </i>holds a maximum value of the detection signal, that is, the peak value of a γ-ray detection signal proportional to energy of the detected γ-rays. One analog ASIC <b>24</b> is an LSI which integrates <b>32</b> sets of analog signal processing circuits <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0073">The capacitor <b>22</b> and resistor <b>23</b> can also be provided inside the analog ASIC <b>24</b>, but this embodiment arranges the capacitor <b>22</b> and resistor <b>23</b> outside the analog ASIC <b>24</b> for reasons such as obtaining an appropriate capacitance and appropriate resistance and reducing the size of the analog ASIC <b>24</b>. Note that the capacitor <b>22</b> and resistor <b>23</b> are preferably disposed outside because in this way variations in the individual capacitance and resistance are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0074">In the analog ASIC <b>24</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the output of the slow system of this analog ASIC <b>24</b> in this embodiment is designed to be supplied to an ADC (analog/digital converter) <b>25</b>. Moreover, the output of the fast system of the analog ASIC <b>24</b> is designed to be supplied to the digital ASIC <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0075">The analog ASIC <b>24</b> and each ADC <b>25</b> are connected via one wire which sends slow system signals corresponding to 8 channels all together. Furthermore, each analog ASIC <b>24</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b> are connected via 32 wires which send 32-channel fast system signals one by one. That is, one digital ASIC <b>26</b> is connected to four analog ASICs <b>24</b> via a total of <b>128</b> wires.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">The output signal of the slow system output from the analog ASIC <b>24</b> is an analog peak value (maximum value of the graph shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Furthermore, the output signal of the fast system output from the analog ASIC <b>24</b> to the digital ASIC is a timing signal showing the timing corresponding to the detection time. Of these signals, the peak value which is the slow system output is input to the ADC <b>25</b> via the wire (wire uniting 8 channels into one) connecting the analog ASIC <b>24</b> and ADC <b>25</b> and converted to a digital signal by the ADC <b>25</b>. The ADC <b>25</b> converts a peak value to, for example, an 8-bit (0 to 255) digital peak value (e.g., 511 KeV→255). On the other hand, a timing signal which is a slow system output is supplied to the digital ASIC <b>26</b> via the above described wire connecting the analog ASIC <b>24</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">The ADC <b>25</b> sends the digitized 8-bit peak value information to the digital ASIC <b>26</b>. For this purpose, each ADC <b>25</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b> are connected via a wire. For example, since there are sixteen ADCs <b>25</b> on both sides, the digital ASIC <b>26</b> is connected to the ADC <b>25</b> via a total of sixteen wires. One ADC <b>25</b> processes signals corresponding to 8 channels (signals corresponding to eight detection elements). The ADC <b>25</b> is connected to the digital ASIC <b>26</b> via one wire for transmission of an ADC control signal and one wire for transmission of peak value information.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the digital ASIC <b>26</b> comprises a plurality of packet data generation apparatuses <b>34</b> including eight time decision circuits (time information generation apparatuses) <b>35</b> and one ADC control circuit (ADC control apparatus) <b>36</b>, and a data transfer circuit (data transmission apparatus) <b>37</b>, and integrates all these elements into one LSI. All the digital ASICs <b>26</b> provided for the PET apparatus <b>1</b> receive a 500 MHz clock signal from a clock generation apparatus (crystal oscillator) (not shown) and operates synchronously. The clock signal input to each digital ASIC <b>26</b> is input to the respective time decision circuits <b>35</b> in all the packet data generation apparatuses <b>34</b>. One time decision circuit <b>35</b> is provided for each detector <b>21</b> and receives a timing signal from the timing pick off circuit <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the corresponding analog signal processing circuit <b>33</b>. The time decision circuit <b>35</b> determines the detection time of γ-rays based on the clock signal when the timing signal is input. Since the timing signal is based on the fast system signal of the analog ASIC <b>24</b>, a time close to a real detection time can be set as the detection time (time information). The ADC control circuit <b>36</b> receives a timing signal for the timing at which γ-rays are detected from the time decision circuit <b>35</b> and identifies the detector ID. That is, the ADC control circuit <b>36</b> stores a detector ID corresponding to each time decision circuit <b>35</b> connected to the ADC control circuit <b>36</b> and can identify, when time information is input from a certain time decision circuit <b>35</b>, the detector ID corresponding to the time decision circuit <b>35</b>. This is possible because one time decision circuit <b>35</b> is provided for each detector <b>21</b>. Moreover, after inputting the time information, the ADC control circuit <b>36</b> outputs an ADC control signal including detector ID information to the ADC <b>25</b>. The ADC <b>25</b> outputs the peak value information output from the peak hold circuit <b>24</b><i>e </i>of the analog signal processing circuit <b>33</b> corresponding to the detector ID by converting it to a digital signal. This peak value information is input to the ADC control circuit <b>36</b>. The ADC control circuit <b>36</b> adds the peak value information to the time information and detector ID to create packet data. The ADC control circuit <b>36</b> has the functions of the ADC control apparatus for controlling the ADC <b>25</b> and the information combination apparatus for combining the detector ID information (detector position information), time information and peak value information. The information combination apparatus outputs combination information (packet information) which is digital information including those three kinds of information. The packet data (including detector ID, time information and peak value information) output from the ADC control circuit <b>36</b> of each packet data generation apparatus <b>34</b> is input to the data transfer circuit <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">The data transfer circuit <b>38</b> sends packet data which is digital information output from the ADC control circuit <b>36</b> of each packet data generation apparatus <b>34</b> to the integrated circuit (unit combination FPGA (Field Programmable Gate array)) <b>31</b> for unit combination provided for the housing <b>30</b> of the detector unit <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) which houses twelve combined substrates <b>20</b>, for example, periodically. The unit combination FPGA (hereinafter referred to as “FPGA”) <b>31</b> sends the digital information to the data processing apparatus <b>12</b> through an information transmission wire connected to the connector <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0080">Since the ADC <b>25</b> converts the peak value information output from the peak hold circuit <b>24</b><i>e </i>corresponding to the detector ID information included in a control signal output from the ADC control circuit <b>36</b> to a digital signal, one ADC <b>25</b> is provided for a plurality of analog signal processing circuits <b>33</b> in one analog ASIC <b>24</b>. Therefore, there is no need to provide one ADC <b>25</b> for each of a plurality of analog signal processing circuits <b>33</b> and it is possible to thereby significantly simplify the circuit construction of the ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B. Also one information combination apparatus for generating combination information is enough for a plurality of analog signal processing circuits <b>33</b> in one analog ASIC <b>24</b>, which can simplify the circuit construction of the digital ASIC <b>26</b>. Moreover, only one ADC control apparatus for identifying detector IDs needs to be provided for a plurality of analog signal processing circuits <b>33</b> in one analog ASIC <b>24</b>, simplifying the circuit construction of the digital ASIC <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">In this way, packet data output from the digital ASIC <b>26</b> and including detector IDs for uniquely identifying (1) peak value information, (2) determined time information and (3) detector <b>21</b>, one by one is sent to the next data processing apparatus <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) through an information transmission wire. The simultaneous measuring apparatus <b>12</b>A of the data processing apparatus <b>12</b> carries out simultaneous measuring processing (when two γ-rays with predetermined energy are detected with a time window with a set time, this processing regards these γ-rays as a pair of γ-rays generated by annihilation of one positron) based on the packet data sent from the digital ASIC <b>26</b>, counts the simultaneously measured pair of γ-rays as one γ-ray and identifies the positions of the two detectors <b>21</b> which have detected the pair of γ-rays using those detector IDs. When there are three or more γ-rays detection signals detected within the above described time window (when there are three or more detected detectors <b>21</b> which have detected γ-rays) the data processing apparatus <b>12</b> identifies the two detectors <b>21</b> into which γ-rays are introduced first out of three or more detectors <b>21</b> using peak value information, etc., on those γ-ray detection signals. The identified one pair of detectors <b>21</b> are simultaneously measured and one count value is generated. Furthermore, the tomographic information creation apparatus <b>12</b>B of the data processing apparatus <b>12</b> creates tomographic information on the examinee at the position where radiopharmaceuticals are concentrated, that is, position of malignant tumor, using count values obtained by simultaneous measurement and position information on the detectors <b>21</b>. This tomographic information is displayed on the display apparatus <b>13</b>. Information such as the above described digital information, count value obtained by simultaneous measurement and position information on the detectors <b>21</b> and tomographic information are stored in the storage apparatus of the data processing apparatus <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">According to the above described explanations, the detector substrate <b>20</b>A includes the detectors <b>21</b> and the ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B includes the capacitor <b>22</b>, resistor <b>23</b>, analog ASIC <b>24</b>, ADC <b>25</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b>. However, the detector substrate (first substrate) <b>20</b>A may include the detector <b>21</b>, capacitor <b>22</b>, resistor <b>23</b> and analog ASIC <b>24</b>, etc., and the ASIC substrate (second substrate) <b>20</b>B may include the ADC <b>25</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b>, etc. By the detector substrate <b>20</b>A including the detectors <b>21</b> and analog ASIC <b>24</b>, the distance (wire length) between the detector <b>21</b> and analog ASIC <b>24</b> can be further shortened. Thus, it is possible to further reduce influences of noise.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0083">Furthermore, the combined substrate <b>20</b> may include three substrates (detector substrate <b>20</b>A, analog ASIC substrate and digital ASIC substrate) and they may be connected in a detachable/attachable manner through their respective connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0084">In this case, of the three substrates, the detector substrate <b>20</b>A includes the detectors <b>21</b>, the analog ASIC substrate includes the capacitor <b>22</b>, resistor <b>23</b> and analog ASIC <b>24</b> and the digital ASIC substrate includes the ADC <b>25</b> and digital ASIC <b>26</b>. This structure separates the substrate incorporating the analog circuit from the substrate incorporating the digital circuit to thereby prevent noise on the digital circuit side from entering the analog circuit. Furthermore, this structure separates the substrate incorporating the analog ASIC from the substrate incorporating the digital ASIC and connects the two substrates using a detachable/attachable connector, and therefore even when only the digital ASIC malfunctions, only the digital ASIC substrate needs to be replaced. In this way, this structure can further reduce waste.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">In the above explanations, the substrate body <b>20</b><i>a </i>(detector substrate <b>20</b>A) for mounting the detectors <b>21</b> is different from the substrate body <b>20</b><i>b </i>(ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B) for mounting the ASICs <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. Thus, when, for example, both ASICs are soldered to a substrate by means of a BGA (Ball Grid Array) using reflow, only the ASIC substrate can be soldered and this is preferable because the semiconductor radiation detector <b>21</b> need not be exposed to a high temperature. Of course, it is also possible to arrange all the elements <b>21</b> to <b>26</b> on the same substrate and use no connector C<b>1</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0086">Next, a unit construction by housing the above described combined substrate <b>20</b> in the housing <b>30</b> will be explained. This embodiment constructs a detector unit (twelve substrate units) <b>2</b> by housing twelve combined substrates <b>20</b> in the housing (frame) <b>30</b>. The camera <b>11</b> of the PET apparatus <b>1</b> has a structure in which 60 to 70 detector units <b>2</b> are arranged in the circumferential direction in a detachable/attachable manner (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>) so as to facilitate maintenance and examination (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">(Housing in Housing)</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the detector unit <b>2</b> is provided with a housing <b>30</b>, etc., for housing or holding the above described <b>12</b> combined substrates <b>20</b>, a high-voltage power supply PS for supplying a charge collecting voltage to these <b>12</b> combined substrates <b>20</b>, the above described FPGA <b>31</b>, signal connectors for exchanging signals with the outside and power connectors for receiving a power supply from the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the combined substrates <b>20</b> are housed in the housing <b>30</b>, arranged in three rows in the depth direction (longitudinal direction of the bed <b>14</b>) without overlapping with one another and in four rows in the width direction (circumferential direction of the camera <b>11</b>). Namely, one housing <b>30</b> houses twelve combined substrates <b>20</b>. To realize such housing, a guide member <b>39</b> consisting of four rows of guide grooves (guide rails) G<b>1</b> extending in the depth direction and arranged at appropriate intervals in the circumferential direction is disposed in the housing <b>30</b> and fitted at the upper end of the housing (cover) <b>30</b>. The guide member <b>39</b> has an opening <b>40</b> opposed to each connector C<b>3</b> of a ceiling plate <b>30</b><i>a </i>in the portion of each guide groove G<b>1</b>. Furthermore, a bottom plate <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>30</b> is provided with four guide members <b>41</b> having one guide groove (guide rail) G<b>2</b> extending in the depth direction arranged at appropriate intervals in the circumferential direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The guide grooves G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b> have a depth corresponding to a capacity of housing three combined substrates <b>20</b>. An end of the combined substrate <b>20</b> on the ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B side is housed in the guide groove G<b>1</b> and an end of the combined substrate <b>20</b> on the detector substrate <b>20</b>A side is housed in the guide groove G<b>2</b>. Three combined substrates <b>20</b> are held in the depth direction of the guide grooves G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b>. Note that since the end of the combined substrate <b>20</b> on the ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B side and the other end on the detector substrate <b>20</b>A side are designed to be slidable in the guide grooves G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b>, it is possible to easily position the combined substrates <b>20</b> at predetermined locations by sliding them in the guide grooves G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b> with fingers, for example. In this case, each substrate connector C<b>2</b> is positioned in the portion of each opening <b>40</b>. After a predetermined number of combined substrates <b>20</b> are arranged in the housing <b>30</b>, the ceiling plate <b>30</b><i>a </i>is attached at the top end of the housing <b>30</b> in a detachable/attachable manner using screws, etc. Each connector C<b>3</b> fitted in the ceiling plate <b>30</b><i>a </i>is inserted in the corresponding opening <b>40</b> and connected to the corresponding substrate connector C<b>2</b>. The terms “upper” and “lower” sections of the housing <b>30</b> are applicable when the housing <b>30</b> is removed from the camera <b>11</b>, and when the housing <b>30</b> is mounted in the camera <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the upper and lower sections may be inverted or turned 90 degrees to be “right” and “left” sections or located diagonally.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the ceiling plate <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>30</b> is provided with not only the four rows of guide grooves G<b>1</b> but also FPGA <b>31</b> and connector <b>38</b>. The connector <b>38</b> is connected to the FPGA <b>31</b>. The FPGA <b>31</b> is programmable in the field. In this aspect, the FPGA <b>31</b> is different from the ASIC in that it is not programmable. Therefore, as with this embodiment, even if the number or type of the combined substrates <b>20</b> to be housed changes, the FPGA <b>31</b> can be programmed in the field to be adaptable to changes in the number of substrates appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090">Since the detectors <b>21</b> using CdTe as the semiconductor material S in this embodiment generate charge in reaction with light, the housing <b>30</b> is made of a material having light shielding properties such as aluminum and an alloy of aluminum and designed in such a way as to eliminate gaps through which light enter. That is, the housing <b>30</b> is constructed to secure light shielding properties. If, for example, light shielding properties are secured by other means, the housing <b>30</b> itself need not be provided with light shielding properties and the housing <b>30</b> can be a frame (framework) to hold the detectors <b>21</b> in a detachable/attachable manner (e.g., no light shielding plane member (panel), etc., is required).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the detector unit <b>2</b> is mounted via a unit support member. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, the detector unit <b>2</b> is mounted in the camera <b>11</b> with one end supported by the unit support member. The unit support member has a hollow disk (doughnut) shape and is provided with many windows (as many as the detector units <b>2</b> to be mounted) in the circumferential direction of the camera <b>11</b>. In order to support the detector units <b>2</b> at one end, a flange portion serving as a stopper is provided on the front side in the axial direction of the body of the housing <b>30</b> of the detector unit <b>2</b>. Note that the flange portions inside in the circumferential direciton become obtrusive when the detector units <b>2</b> are arranged as dense as possible in the circumferential direction. Therefore, kit is possible to remove the obstrusive flange portions from the housing <b>30</b> and allow the flange portions outside in the circumferential direction to remain. Or it is also possible to provide another unit support member and support both ends of the detector unit <b>2</b> by the two unit support members.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">In order to mount the detector units <b>2</b> in the unit support member, this embodiment allows many detectors <b>21</b> to be mounted in the camera <b>11</b> at a time. This can considerably shorten the time of mounting the detectors <b>21</b> in the camera <b>11</b>. Furthermore, packet data (all packet data for all detectors <b>21</b> of a combined substrate <b>20</b>) output from the data transfer apparatus <b>38</b> of all the combined substrates <b>20</b> in the detection unit <b>2</b> is sent from the unit combination FPGA <b>31</b> provided in the detection unit <b>2</b> to the data processing apparatus <b>12</b>. In this way, the number of wires through which packet data is transmitted to the data processing apparatus <b>12</b> in this embodiment is also significantly reduced compared to the case where packet data is sent from each data transfer apparatus <b>38</b> of the combined structure <b>20</b> to the data processing apparatus <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">When the detector units <b>2</b> is mounted in the camera <b>11</b>, a cover <b>11</b><i>a </i>is removed to make the unit support member exposed so that the detector units <b>2</b> are inserted until the detector units <b>2</b> touch the flange portinos. When the detector units <b>2</b> are inserted and fitted, connections between the camera <b>11</b> and the detector units <b>2</b> are made, and signals and power supply are connected between the camera <b>11</b> and the detector units <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">(Power Supply)</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0094">Then, the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS for supplying a charge collection voltage will be explained. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the detector unit <b>2</b> provides the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS for supplying a charge collection voltage to each detector <b>21</b> in a space formed inside the housing <b>30</b> on the back of the FPGA <b>31</b>. This high-voltage power supply apparatus PS receives a low voltage power supply, boosts the voltage to 300 V using a DC-DC converter (means for boosting the voltage, which is not shown) and supplies the voltage to each detector <b>21</b>. <b>64</b> detectors <b>21</b> are provided per one combined substrate <b>20</b> (=detector substrate <b>20</b>A) on one side, and <b>128</b> on both sides. Twelve such combined substrates <b>20</b> are housed in one housing <b>30</b> (that is, one detector unit <b>2</b>). Thus, the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS supplies voltages to 128×12=1536 detectors <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0095">Conventionally, a supply voltage of 300 V with extremely small fluctuations is supplied from a precision power supply apparatus in a remote place, but since (1) when the distance from the precision power supply apparatus increases, a wider insulating structure for high voltage wiring is required (the insulating distance increases) and (2) the voltage fluctuates due to a temperature variation of the detectors <b>21</b>, there is a problem that supplying a precise voltage from the precision power supply apparatus does not necessarily result in a precise voltage in the part of the target detectors <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0096">Furthermore, to facilitate maintenance and examination, it is also possible to consider providing the detector unit <b>2</b> according to this embodiment with a power connector (not shown) and removing a high-voltage power line extending from the precision power supply apparatus at this power connector. That is, according to this embodiment, it is possible to consider supplying a high-voltage power supply to the detector units <b>2</b> from outside the units <b>2</b> via power connectors. However, in the case of a high voltage of 300 V, this results in a problem that the size of the power connector increases in addition to the above described problem of insulation.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0097">According to this embodiment, the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS built in the detector unit <b>2</b> is connected to an external low voltage (5 to 15 V) DC power supply through the power connector <b>42</b> and connector <b>38</b> provided on the ceiling plate <b>30</b><i>a </i>via power wiring. A high-voltage terminal of the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS is connected to twelve connectors C<b>3</b> provided on the ceiling plate <b>30</b><i>a </i>through the connector <b>43</b> provided on the ceiling plate <b>30</b><i>a </i>and connected to electrodes C of the respective detectors <b>21</b> provided on the substrate body <b>20</b><i>a </i>through the connector C<b>2</b> of the respective combined substrates <b>20</b>, power wiring (not shown) in the substrate body <b>20</b><i>b</i>, connector C<b>1</b> and power wiring (not shown) in the substrate body <b>20</b><i>a</i>. The connectors C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> include not only connectors for transmitting output signals of the detectors <b>21</b> but also connectors for power wiring. Since the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS boosts a low voltage applied from the power supply to 300 V using a DC-DC converter, it is possible to reduce the high-voltage section and thereby shorten the insulation distance. That is, this eliminates the necessity for using high-voltage wiring for a portion from the connector <b>42</b> to the DC power supply. It also facilitates maintenance, etc. For the problem with voltage fluctuations, this embodiment provides not the high-precision power supply apparatus but the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS having accuracy according to a temperature fluctuation of the voltage. This eliminates the necessity for a high-precision power supply. Furthermore, since it is a low voltage that is received from an external power supply, it is possible to use a small power connector to be provided for the connector <b>38</b>. Using the small power connector increases the degree of freedom in the layout. Furthermore, since the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS is arranged in a space formed in the housing <b>30</b> on the back side of the FPGA <b>31</b>, the arrangement of the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS in the housing <b>30</b> makes the detector unit <b>2</b> more compact instead of upsizing. It is also possible to directly connect the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS to the power wiring provided on the substrate body <b>20</b><i>a </i>through the connector, without the ceiling plate <b>30</b><i>a</i>. Furthermore, the power connector can also be separated from the output signal connector of the detector <b>21</b>. This prevents noise from entering the signal wiring from the power supply system.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0098">Furthermore, by reducing a supply voltage to the detector unit <b>2</b>, it is possible to supply power to the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS at a low voltage through the unit combination FPGA <b>31</b> as with power supplies to the ASICs <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0099">Furthermore, supplying power using the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS eliminates the necessity for insulation from the housing (GND).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0100">The voltage supplied from the FPGA <b>31</b> to the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS is boosted to 300 V by a DC-DC converter (not shown) in the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS and after boosting, passed through the ceiling plate <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>30</b> and supplied from ASIC substrate <b>20</b>B→detector substrate <b>20</b>A→each detector <b>21</b> for each combined substrate <b>20</b>. That is, the housing <b>30</b> (ceiling plate <b>30</b><i>a</i>) is provided with wiring for voltage supply (not shown) for supplying a voltage from the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS to each combined substrate <b>20</b>. Furthermore, each combined substrate <b>20</b> is provided with wiring for voltage supply which supplies a voltage supplied from the high-voltage power supply apparatus PS to each detector <b>21</b> via the substrate connector C<b>2</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0101">A nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus according to another embodiment will be explained. The nuclear medicine diagnostic apparatus of this embodiment is single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) apparatus.</p>

The SPECT apparatus <b>51</b> is provided with a pair of radiation detection blocks <b>52</b>, a rotary holder (body of rotation) <b>57</b>, a data processing apparatus <b>12</b> and a display apparatus <b>13</b>. The radiation detection blocks <b>52</b> are disposed at two positions with a 180° difference in the circumferential direction of the rotary holder <b>57</b>. More specifically, the respective unit support members <b>56</b> of the radiation detection blocks <b>52</b> are mounted on the rotary holder <b>57</b> with a 180° difference in the circumferential direction. A plurality of detector units <b>2</b>A each including twelve combined substrates <b>53</b> are mounted on the respective unit support members <b>56</b> in a detachable/attachable manner. Thus, the detectors <b>21</b> are supported by the unit support member. The construction of each detector unit <b>2</b>A is the same as that of the detector unit <b>2</b> according to Embodiment 1 except the construction of the combined substrate <b>53</b>.</p>

The detectors <b>21</b> at one end of each detector substrate <b>20</b>A are arranged facing the bed <b>14</b>. A collimator <b>55</b> made of a radiation shielding member (e.g., lead, tungsten, etc.) is provided on each radiation detection block <b>52</b>. Each collimator <b>55</b> forms many radiation passages through which radiation (e.g., γ-rays) passes. These radiation passages are provided in a one-to-one correspondence with the detectors <b>21</b> positioned at one end of all the detector substrates <b>20</b>A of one radiation detection block <b>52</b>. All the combined substrates <b>53</b> and collimators <b>55</b> are arranged within a light/electromagnetic shield <b>54</b> mounted on the rotary holder <b>57</b>. The collimator <b>55</b> is mounted in the light/electromagnetic shield <b>54</b>. The light/electromagnetic shield <b>54</b> cuts off influences of electromagnetic waves other than γ-rays on the detectors <b>21</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0104">When the bed <b>14</b> on which an examinee administered with radiopharmaceuticals is laid is moved, the examinee is moved between the pair of radiation detection blocks <b>52</b>. When the rotary holder <b>57</b> is rotated, the detector units <b>2</b>A of each radiation detection block <b>52</b> revolve around the examinee. γ-rays emitted form an area in the body of the examinee where radiopharmaceuticals are concentrated (e.g., affected area) C pass through the radiation passages of the collimator <b>55</b> and are introduced into the corresponding detectors <b>21</b>. The detectors <b>21</b> output γ-rays detection signals. These γ-ray detection signals are processed by analog ASIC <b>24</b>A and digital ASIC <b>26</b>A, which will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0105">The construction of the detector substrate <b>20</b>A used in this embodiment (Embodiment 2) is the same as that in Embodiment 1 and therefore the explanations will be omitted in this embodiment.

<p id="p-0106" num="0107">The digital ASIC <b>26</b>A includes a packet data generation apparatus <b>34</b>A and a data transfer circuit <b>37</b> and integrates them into one LSI. The above described trigger signal is input to the ADC control circuit <b>36</b>A of the packet data generation apparatus <b>34</b>A. All the digital ASICs <b>26</b>A provided on the SPECT apparatus <b>51</b> receive a 64 MHz clock signal from a clock generation apparatus (crystal oscillator) (not shown) and operate synchronously. The clock signal input to each digital ASIC <b>26</b>A is input to the respective ADC control circuits <b>36</b>A in all the packet data generation apparatuses <b>34</b>A. The ADC control circuit <b>36</b>A identifies the detector ID when the trigger signal is input.

The ADC control circuit <b>36</b>A outputs an ADC control signal including the detector ID information to the ADC <b>25</b>. The ADC <b>25</b> converts the peak value information output from the peak hold circuit <b>24</b><i>e </i>of the analog signal processing circuit <b>33</b>A corresponding to the detector ID to a digital signal and outputs it.

<p id="p-0107" num="0108">Packet data output from the unit combination FPGA <b>31</b> is sent to the data processing apparatus <b>12</b>. A rotation angle detected by an angle gauge (not shown) connected to the rotation shaft of a motor (not shown) for rotating the rotary holder <b>57</b> is input to the data processing apparatus. This rotation angle indicates the rotation angle of each radiation detection block <b>52</b> and more specifically indicates the rotation angle of each detector <b>21</b>. Based on this rotation angle, the data processing apparatus <b>12</b> determines the position (position coordinates) of each revolving detector <b>21</b> on the revolving orbit. In this way, the position (position coordinates) of the detector <b>21</b> when γ-rays are detected is calculated. Based on the calculated position of the detector <b>21</b>, the data processing apparatus <b>12</b> counts γ-rays whose peak value information reaches and exceeds a set value. This counting is performed on each area obtained by dividing the revolving circle into 0.5° portions relative to the rotational center of the rotary holder <b>57</b>. The peak value information is an accumulated value of peak values of respective γ-ray detection signals of a plurality of detectors <b>21</b> (four detectors <b>21</b> arranged on a straight line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) positioned on an extension of the radiation passage of the collimator <b>55</b>.
