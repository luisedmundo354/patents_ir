<heading id="h-0041" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0081">The following discussion describes in detail one embodiment of the invention (and several variations of that embodiment). This discussion should not be construed, however, as limiting the invention to those particular embodiments. Practitioners skilled in the art will recognize numerous other embodiments as well. For definition of the complete scope of the invention, the reader is directed to appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0082">Turning now descriptively to the drawings, in which similar reference characters denote similar elements throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 9</figref> illustrate a pet pouch garment of the present invention which is indicated generally by the reference numeral <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0083">The pet pouch garment <b>10</b> is in the form of a long sleeve shirt <b>36</b>. The type of garment includes but is not limited to a long sleeve shirt <b>36</b>, a short sleeve shirt, a jacket, a sweatshirt, vest, and a sweater. The invention will be described hereinafter as including the shirt <b>36</b>. However, it should be known that the shirt <b>36</b> is merely exemplary and that the garment forming the pet pouch garment <b>10</b> of the preset invention may include any garment able to be worn on the torso of a user. The shirt <b>36</b> has a front side <b>33</b> and a backside <b>35</b>, not shown. The neckline of the front side <b>33</b> of the shirt <b>36</b> includes a zipper <b>24</b>, as shown herein. A pet pouch <b>16</b> is attached to the front side <b>33</b> of the shirt <b>36</b>. The pet pouch <b>16</b> can be made from the same material as the garment or can be made from a plurality of other materials. The pet pouch <b>16</b> has a pouch top <b>18</b>, a pouch bottom <b>20</b> and two opposing pouch sides <b>22</b>. The pouch <b>16</b> is formed by attaching the edges of the opposing side <b>22</b> leaving an opening at pouch top <b>18</b> as illustrated. The pouch <b>16</b> is then attached to the rent at a predetermined location along three edges as illustrated and further connected at the top pouch <b>18</b> edge of one of the opposing sides <b>22</b>. The pouch <b>16</b> is secured to the shirt <b>36</b> and able to receive and support the weight of a pet <b>14</b> therein.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0084">In one embodiment the pouch bottom <b>20</b> includes an expandable pouch base <b>34</b> to allow more room for the pet <b>14</b>. The pouch top <b>18</b> can be closed to prevent the pet <b>14</b> from inadvertently escaping from the pet pouch <b>16</b>. A plurality of means exist to close the pouch top <b>18</b> including but not limited to a pouch drawstring <b>30</b>, as shown herein, zippers, snaps, buttons, and hook and loop fasteners. The front of the pet pouch <b>16</b> includes a centrally located, single vertically extending pleat <b>28</b> also for expansion, to better accommodate pets <b>14</b> of different sizes. The bottom hem of the shirt <b>36</b> can include a waistband <b>50</b>. The waistband <b>50</b> can cinch the hem of the garment to the user. Alternatively, the hem can include a garment drawstring <b>32</b>, as shown herein. The comfort of the user <b>12</b> is increased when the pet <b>14</b> is in the pet pouch <b>16</b> by cinching the garment to the user <b>12</b>. Additionally, cinching the garment to the user <b>12</b> makes the pet <b>14</b> feel more secure.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows the garment <b>10</b> being worn by a user <b>12</b>. Shown herein, the user <b>12</b> is wearing the pet pouch garment <b>10</b> described hereinabove. Herein, the pet pouch <b>16</b> is shown retaining the pet <b>14</b>. The pouch drawstring <b>30</b> is in the open position allowing the pet <b>14</b> to peak out of the pouch top <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an illustrative view of an alternate embodiment of the pet pouch garment <b>10</b> of the present invention in use. The pet pouch garment <b>10</b> includes the shirt <b>36</b> and the pet pouch <b>16</b> attached to the shirt <b>36</b> as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The pet pouch <b>16</b> can be made from the same material as the garment or can be made from a plurality of other materials. The shirt <b>36</b> includes the front side <b>33</b> and the backside <b>35</b>. The neckline of the front side <b>33</b> of the shirt <b>36</b> includes the zipper <b>24</b>. The pouch <b>16</b> shown herein includes the pleat <b>28</b> on the front thereof to allow the pouch <b>16</b> to expand when the pet <b>14</b> is located therein, and to lay flat when the pet <b>14</b> is not located therein. The embodiment shown herein also includes a mesh viewing window <b>26</b> in the front of the pouch <b>16</b>. The mesh viewing window <b>26</b> is located between the top of the pleat <b>28</b> and the pouch top <b>18</b>. However, this placement is for purposes of example only, and the mesh viewing window <b>26</b> can be located in a plurality of locations on the pouch <b>16</b>. The mesh viewing window <b>26</b> allows the pet <b>14</b> to see outside the pouch <b>16</b> when he is enclosed therein. The mesh viewing window <b>26</b> also acts as a ventilation means when the pet <b>14</b> is enclosed therein. Shown herein, while the pouch top <b>18</b> includes the pouch drawstring <b>30</b> to close the top of the pouch <b>16</b> and retain the pet <b>14</b> therein, the drawstring is not cinched and the pet <b>14</b> is permitted to peak out of the pouch top <b>18</b>. Thus, in the figure shown herein, the mesh viewing window <b>26</b> is not in use. Alternatively, a plurality of means exist to close the pouch top <b>18</b> including but not limited to a pouch drawstring <b>30</b>, as shown herein, zippers, snaps, buttons, and hook and loop fasteners.

<p id="p-0066" num="0088">Shown herein, the pouch drawstring <b>30</b> located at the pouch top <b>18</b> is cinched to close the top of the pouch <b>16</b> and retain the pet <b>14</b> therein.
