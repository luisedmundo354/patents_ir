<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">To provide a projector reduced in size and weight and countermeasures against EMI (Electro-Magnetic Interference) as well. The projector has vertically separable outer cases which accommodate an optical system comprising: a color beam splitting optical system for splitting light from a light source into beams of predetermined colors; an electro-optical device for modulating the color beams split by the color beam splitting optical system in accordance with image information; a color beam combining optical system for combining the color beams modulated by the electro-optical devices; and a projection lens for projecting the resultant beam combined by the color beam combining optical system. These optical components constituting the optical system are attached to a inner case, and the inner case is fixed to a lower case so as to accommodate at least the color beam splitting optical system in a enclosure constituted by the inner case and the lower case.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a projector and more particularly to the structure thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally known is a projector which comprises electro-optical devices for forming an optical image of a light beam emitted from a light source in accordance with image information and a projection lens for expanding and projecting the image formed by the electro-optical devices, The projector of this type has been widely used for multi-media presentation in a conference, an academic meeting, or an exhibition.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More particularly, such a projector has a color beam splitting optical system interposed between the light source and the electro-optical devices. The color beam splitting optical system is accommodated in an optical component housing (inner case) designed to block ambient light, being adapted to split a light beam from the light source into beams of three colors (red, green, and blue) and then transmit the respective color beams to the electro-optical devices. Then, three color images of the respective color beams formed in the electro-optical devices are transmitted to a color beam combining optical system (prism) to be combined into a color image, thereafter being expanded and projected via the projection lens supported by a metallic support member (a head body).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The projector of this type may be kept installed in a conference room for making a presentation. However, it is often carried therein as required, or carried therefrom after a presentation to be stored somewhere else. Accordingly, it is necessary to improve the portability of the projector for ease of carrying it and thus it has been desired to reduce the size and weight of the projector.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, a conventional projector is provided with a inner case in each of the upper and lower cases to accommodate and fix various types of optical components, in order to prevent shift of the optical axis of the optical components caused by considerable heat generated by the light source portion, the color beam combining optical system, the power supply unit and so on. However, this configuration is a stumbling block in the way of reducing the size and weight of the projector.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is also another problem with the conventional projector. That is, it is difficult to take measures against EMI (Electro-Magnetic Interference) since circuits for processing feeble video signals at high speed and a light-source lamp causing strong noise are accommodated together in a narrow space.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention was developed in view of these problems. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a projection display system which is further reduced in weight and size and which gives sufficient consideration to the countermeasures against EMI.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a projector having vertically separable outer cases which accommodate an optical system comprising a color beam splitting optical system for splitting light from a light source into beams of predetermined colors; an electro-optical device for modulating the color beams split by the color beam splitting optical system in accordance with image information; a color beam combining optical system for combining the color beams modulated by the electro-optical device; and a projection lens for projecting a resultant beam combined by the color beam combining optical system. The system is characterized in that optical components constituting the optical system are attached to a inner case. In addition, the inner case is fixed to one of the outer cases so as to accommodate at least the color beam splitting optical system in a enclosure constituted by the inner case and the one of the outer cases.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This allows the optical system to be constituted using one inner case, thereby making it possible to reduce the size and weight of the projector. In addition, air flows into and out of the optical system through an outer case, thereby providing the projector with improved thermal radiation. Furthermore, the inner case and the outer cases are fixed to each other to thereby reinforce each other complementarily, thus making it possible to prevent the positional shift of the optical axis of the optical system caused by aging or the deformation of the components constituting the optical system. From this point of view, it is preferable that the inner case is an integrated box-shaped body with an opening provided on a side.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, the projection lens attached to the inner case facilitates the alignment of the optical axis of the optical system with that of the projection lens with ease and high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, a thermal insulation material interposed between the inner case and the outer case for accommodating the color beam splitting optical system makes it possible to prevent heat conduction from the optical system to the outer case.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, the projector is characterized in that a prism is attached to the inner case, the prism constituting the color beam combining optical system. This can obviate the need of the special prism attachment member that has been conventionally used.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The projector is also characterized in that a recessed portion is formed adjacent to the projection lens on a top outside of the inner case, and the electro-optical device and the prism constituting the color beam combining optical system are arranged in the recessed portion. This makes it possible to form a flow path of air for cooling the electro-optical device, thereby providing an increased cooling effect. Besides, it is preferable that an air vent is provided near where the prism is attached to the inner case, thereby allowing the electro-optical device to be positively cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Furthermore, the projector is characterized in that a mirror and a lens, constituting the optical systems, are fixed by resilient members. This makes it possible to fix these optical components without being damaged and prevent these components from dropping off when fixing the inner case to the outer cases.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The projector is also characterized in that a cable for electrically connecting the electro-optical device to a driver board for controlling the electro-optical device is led out from one side of the electro-optical device on the nearer side to the driver board. This allows the cables to be wired in a simple manner.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The projector is also characterized in that a driver board for controlling the electro-optical device is disposed on the top outside of the inner case. This allows the inner case to block noise generated by the light source and radiant heat from the optical systems. However, if countermeasures have been taken somehow against the noise or radiant heat, it is possible to arrange the driver board on the outer case, being integrated with the inner case, for accommodating the color beam splitting optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Besides, it is possible to increase the packing density of components by forming a notched portion in the driver board and by accommodating a fan for cooling the electro-optical device in the notched portion.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is also preferable to provide the outer cases, being integrated with the inner case, for accommodating the color beam splitting optical system with functions of positioning and supporting the optical components that constitute the optical system. Consequently,this makes it possible to positively position and stably hold each of the optical components It is also possible to fix the optical components firmly with ease by fixing the inner case and the outer case for accommodating the color beam splitting optical system to each other with screws.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The projector is also characterized in that part of a housing for holding the light source is placed on an outer surface of the outer case, and the housing is made attachable to or detachable from the outer case by using the part of the housing. This makes it possible to replace the light source in conjunction with the housing, thereby facilitating the replacement of the light source. Besides, it is possible to prevent a spark between the housing and the light source by forming the housing of a resin.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is also possible to provide further increased insulation against the light source by applying an insulation coating to a portion opposite to the light source in the inner case. This is particularly effective in the case where a high-intensity light source is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Besides, it is preferable that the inner case and the outer cases of the present invention are formed of a resin or metal. For resin, there is an advantage of being light in weight and facilitating shaping and finishing. On the other hand,the high material strength of metal makes it possible to provide stabilized accuracy in size and a reduction in thickness to thereby provide a reduction in weight.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Now, the present invention will be explained below with reference to the accompanying drawings in accordance with an embodiment.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(1) External Structure of the Projector</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show schematic perspective views illustrating a projector <b>1</b> according to an embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> being a perspective view of the projector viewed from above and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> being a perspective view of the system viewed from below.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Main components of the projector <b>1</b> are accommodated in outer cases <b>2</b> forming a housing of the projector.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The outer cases <b>2</b> comprise basically an upper case <b>3</b> for covering the upper surface of the projector, a lower case <b>4</b> for constituting the bottom surface of the projector, and a front case <b>5</b> for covering the front portion of the projector. Here, the upper and lower cases <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are made by magnesium die casting and the front case <b>5</b> is formed of a resin.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Incidentally, these outer cases <b>2</b> may be all formed of a metal or resin. The metal is preferably magnesium, aluminum, or their alloys in terms of weight and heat radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">On the upper right portion of the upper case <b>3</b> (on the right thereof when viewed from the front), there is provided an air intake <b>240</b> covered with a filter replacement lid <b>241</b> made of a resin. The filter replacement lid <b>241</b> is provided with a slit-shaped opening <b>241</b>A for introducing the air taken in from outside into the projector for cooling it. Inside the filter replacement lid <b>241</b>, there is provided an air filter <b>242</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). By detaching the filter replacement lid <b>241</b> from the upper side of the upper case <b>3</b>, the internal air filter <b>242</b> can be replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition, on the upper side of the upper case <b>3</b> and in front of the filter replacement lid <b>241</b>, a plurality of communicating holes <b>251</b> are provided for use with a loudspeaker (not shown). Adjacent to the communicating holes <b>251</b>, there is arranged a control panel <b>60</b> for adjusting the quality of an image provided by the projector <b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the portion where the filter replacement lid <b>241</b>, the communicating holes <b>251</b>, and the control panel <b>60</b> are provided is a bulging portion <b>3</b>A which is part of the upper case <b>3</b> expanded outwardly. Inside the space defined by the bulging portion <b>3</b>A, components, such as the aforementioned air filter <b>242</b>, the loudspeaker, and a printed circuit board <b>61</b> used for the control panel <b>60</b>, are accomodated.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, exposed at the bottom of the lower case <b>4</b> is a base of a housing <b>800</b> of a light source lamp unit <b>8</b> which is accommodated inside the outer cases <b>2</b>. By unscrewing a screw <b>27</b> for fixing the lower case <b>4</b> to the housing <b>800</b> and then by pulling out the base of the housing, the light source lamp unit <b>8</b> is drawn out from the lower case <b>4</b>. In addition, there are provided feet <b>31</b>R, <b>31</b>L on the corners of the bottom front side of the lower case <b>4</b>, while a foot <b>31</b>C is provided at the center of the rear side. Incidentally, the feet <b>31</b>R, <b>31</b>L are designed to be advanced or retracted in the direction of protrusion b rotating their dials or by the operation of levers <b>32</b>R, <b>32</b>L, and the amount of advancement or retraction can be adjusted to change the height and angle of a displayed image.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Facing the front side of the front case <b>5</b>, provided on the right portion thereof is a light-receiving portion <b>70</b> for receiving an optical signal from a remote controller (not shown). On a generally central portion of the front case <b>5</b>, there is provided an air outlet <b>160</b> for exhausting the air from inside of the projector.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">On a side <b>45</b> and a back <b>41</b>, close to the air intake <b>240</b> of the outer cases <b>2</b>, arranged are an AC inlet <b>50</b> for connecting with an external power supply and a group of various I/O terminals <b>51</b> that are exposed to outside.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(2) Internal Structure of the Projector</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 7</figref> illustrate the internal structure of the projector <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic perspective view illustrating the upper structure of the projector <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic perspective view illustrating the configuration and structure of the optical system of the projector <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic perspective view illustrating the optical system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> which is inverted and fixed to the lower case. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a conceptual view illustrating the arrangement of an electro-optical device, a cross dichroic prism, an air intake fan, and a driver board in the optical system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line I-I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to these figures, inside the outer cases <b>2</b>, arranged are components such as the light source lamp unit <b>8</b>, a power source unit <b>9</b> as a power supply, an optical unit <b>10</b>, the driver board <b>11</b> for controllably driving the electro-optical devices to be described later, a main board <b>12</b> as a main control circuit board, and an AV board <b>13</b> as a video &amp; audio circuit board. Thus, in this embodiment, the light source lamp unit <b>8</b>, the optical unit <b>10</b>, and the aforementioned projection lens <b>6</b> constitute a U-shaped optical system, while the boards <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> constitute a control system.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The power source unit <b>9</b> comprises a first power supply block <b>9</b>A arranged on a side of the projection lens <b>6</b> of the optical system, a second power supply block <b>9</b>B disposed inside an opening portion <b>14</b> at the center of the planate U-shaped optical system, that is, between the projection lens <b>6</b> and the light source lamp unit <b>8</b>, and a third power supply block <b>9</b>C arranged on a side of the light source lamp unit <b>8</b> of the optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first power supply block <b>9</b>A comprises an AC inlet <b>50</b> and distributes power supplied from an external power supply through the AC inlet <b>50</b> to the second power supply block <b>9</b>B and the third power supply block <b>9</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The second power supply block <b>9</b>B transforms the power provided by the first power supply block <b>9</b>A to supply the resultant power mainly to the main board <b>12</b> that constitutes the aforementioned control system. The second power supply block <b>9</b>B is provided with an auxiliary air exhaust fan <b>15</b> driven by power from the second power supply block <b>9</b>B on the side of the air outlet <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The third power supply block <b>9</b>C transforms the power provided by the first power supply block <b>9</b>A to supply the resultant power to a light source device <b>183</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) in the light source lamp unit <b>8</b>. The third power supply block <b>9</b>C has to supply power to the light source device <b>183</b> that requires the maximum amount of power consumption, and is therefore designed to be larger than the first and second power supply blocks <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B being so large as to be arranged across the projector <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first to third power supply blocks <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C described above are fixed with screws to the lower case <b>4</b> prior to installation of the optical unit <b>10</b> containing the projection lens <b>6</b>. Incidentally, the first power supply block <b>9</b>A may be adapted to supply power only to the second power supply block <b>9</b>B which in turn distributes power to the third power supply block <b>9</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The light source lamp unit <b>8</b> constitutes the light source portion of the projector <b>1</b> and is provided with the light source device <b>183</b> comprising a light source lamp <b>181</b> and a concave mirror <b>182</b>, and the housing <b>800</b> for supporting the light source device <b>183</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The light source lamp unit <b>8</b> configured as such is covered with an accommodating portion <b>9001</b> and is adapted to be removed from the projector <b>1</b> by unscrewing the screw <b>27</b> on the bottom of case <b>4</b>. The accommodating portion <b>9001</b> is formed into a unitary body with an inner case <b>900</b> to be described later. In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in front of the accommodating portion <b>9001</b> and at the position corresponding to the air outlet <b>160</b>, there is arranged a main exhaust fan <b>16</b> that is larger than the auxiliary air exhaust fan <b>15</b>. The main exhaust fan <b>16</b> is also driven by the power supplied by the second power supply block <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The optical unit <b>10</b> optically processes light emitted from the light source lamp unit <b>8</b> to form an optical image corresponding to image information and is mounted on the inner case <b>900</b> formed as an integrated box-shaped body with an opening provided on one side thereof as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The inner case <b>900</b> serves as a housing for mounting in place each optical component that constitutes the optical system and is formed of a resin or metal (Mg, Al, or an alloy of therm). The inner case <b>900</b> accommodates components such as an illuminating optical system <b>923</b>, a color beam splitting optical system <b>924</b>, a relay optical system <b>927</b>, and a cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> to which the electro-optical device <b>925</b> or liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B are fixed. The inner case <b>900</b> further comprises a vertical head plate <b>9002</b> adjacent to the light transmission side of the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> and the projection lens <b>6</b> is fixed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The inner case <b>900</b> to which the aforementioned optical components constituting the aforementioned optical path system are attached is fixedly screwed to the lower case <b>4</b>, with the opening oriented downwardly, thereby allowing the optical system except the projection lens <b>6</b> to be accommodated in the enclosure comprising the inner case <b>900</b> and the lower case <b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Incidentally, it is preferable to accommodate at least the color beam splitting optical system <b>924</b> and the relay optical system <b>927</b> in such a enclosure in order to block ambient light.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">There is provided air vents <b>9006</b> around a mounting portion of the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> on the inner case <b>900</b>. The cooling air introduced by an air intake fan <b>17</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>) flows from the air vents to the liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B to cool them. Incidentally, the power for driving the air intake fan <b>17</b> can be supplied from the main board <b>12</b> via the driver board <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The driver board <b>11</b> is arranged above the optical unit <b>10</b> (on the side of the upper case) to control each of the aforementioned liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B. Incidentally, the main board <b>12</b> has a control circuit for controlling the entire projector <b>1</b> and is installed in a standing manner at the back of the optical unit <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the main board <b>12</b> and the driver board <b>11</b> are arranged substantially at right angles to each other and electrically connected to each other via a connector. Incidentally, an AV board <b>13</b> for controlling sound and video signals is interposed in a standing manner between the optical unit <b>10</b> and the main board <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the internal configuration described above, the cooling air that has been taken in by the air intake fan <b>17</b> from the air intake <b>240</b> cools each of the liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B. Thereafter, the cooling air is guided toward the light source lamp unit <b>8</b> by the rotation of each of the air exhaust fans <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, while cooling each of the boards, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>. Then, the cooling air flows mainly into the light source lamp unit <b>8</b>, in conjunction with new cooling air from an intake hole <b>4</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) provided on the bottom of the lower case <b>4</b>, to cool the internal light source device <b>183</b>. In addition, part of the cooling air flows by the second power supply block <b>9</b>B, whereas other part flows by the third power supply block <b>9</b>C to cool each of them. After that, the cooling air is exhausted from the front side of the projector <b>1</b> through the air outlet <b>160</b> by means of each of the air exhaust fans <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(3) Structure of the Optical System</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Now, the optical unit <b>10</b> of the optical system will be explained in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The optical unit <b>10</b> comprises the illuminating optical system <b>923</b>, the color beam splitting optical system <b>924</b>, the relay optical system <b>927</b>, the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> as a color beam combining optical system, and the electro-optical device <b>925</b> disposed around the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b>, which is attached to the inner case <b>900</b>. The lens unit <b>10</b> further comprises the projection lens <b>6</b> disposed on the head plate <b>9002</b> of the inner case <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The illuminating optical system <b>923</b> is an integrator illuminating optical system for providing substantially uniform illumination on the image forming area of the three liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B as the electro-optical device <b>925</b>. The illuminating optical system <b>923</b> comprises the light source device <b>183</b>, a first lens array <b>921</b>, a second lens array <b>922</b>, a reflective mirror <b>931</b>, and a superimposing lens <b>932</b>. These first and second lens arrays <b>921</b>, <b>922</b>, the superimposing lens <b>932</b>, and the reflective mirror <b>931</b> are arranged being supported by an erected portion of the inner case <b>900</b> and fixed by resilient clips <b>7</b> as members for preventing those optical components from dropping off so that those optical components do not drop off even if the inner case <b>900</b> is inverted.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The light source device <b>183</b> constituting the illuminating optical system <b>923</b> has the light source lamp <b>181</b> serving as a source of illumination for emitting radial beams and the concave mirror <b>182</b> for transmitting the illumination from the light source lamp <b>181</b> as substantially parallel beams. As the light source lamp <b>181</b>, a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp, or a high-pressure mercury lamp is often employed. As the concavemirror <b>182</b>,a parabolic mirror or an elliptical mirror is preferable to use.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The first lens array <b>921</b> is provided with small lenses <b>9211</b>, each of which has a generally rectangular contour and which are arranged in a matrix with M rows and N columns. Each of the small lenses <b>9211</b> splits the parallel beams incident thereupon from the light source into a plurality of (i.e., M×N) sub-beams, which are in turn focused in the vicinity of the second lens array <b>922</b>. The contour of each of the small lenses <b>9211</b> is designed to be similar in shape to the image forming area of the liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B. For example, if the aspect ratio (i.e., the ratio of a horizontal to vertical dimension) of the image forming area of a liquid crystal panel is 4:3, the aspect ratio of each of the small lenses is set to the ratio of 4:3.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The second lens array <b>922</b> is provided with the small lenses <b>9221</b> arranged in a matrix with M rows and N columns corresponding to the small lenses <b>9211</b> of the first lens array <b>921</b>. The second lens array <b>922</b> has the function of allowing the center axis (principal ray) of each of the sub-beams transmitted from the first lens array <b>921</b> to impinge perpendicularly upon the incident plane of the superimposing lens <b>932</b>. Here, the superimposing lens <b>932</b> has the function of superimposing a plurality of sub-beams on each other on the three liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B. Furthermore, the second lens array <b>922</b> is arranged at an angle of 90 degrees to the first lens array <b>921</b> across the reflective mirror <b>931</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The reflective mirror <b>931</b> is a mirror for guiding beams transmitted from the first lens array <b>921</b> to the second lens array <b>922</b> and therefore not always required depending on the configuration of the optical system. For example, the reflective mirror <b>931</b> is not necessary if the first lens array <b>921</b> and the light source are arranged parallel to the second lens array <b>922</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The color beam splitting optical system <b>924</b> comprises two dichroic mirrors <b>941</b>, <b>942</b> and a reflective mirror <b>943</b> as optical components, and has the function of splitting the light transmitted from the superimposing lens <b>932</b> of the illuminating optical system <b>923</b> into beams of three colors of red, green, and blue. Just as in the foregoing, each of the mirrors <b>941</b>, <b>942</b>, <b>943</b> is supported by the erected portion of the inner case <b>900</b> and fixed to the inner case <b>900</b> by the resilient clips <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The relay optical system <b>927</b> comprises an incident side lens <b>954</b>, a relay lens <b>973</b>, and reflective mirrors <b>971</b>, <b>972</b>. These reflective mirrors <b>971</b>, <b>972</b> are also fixed to the inner case <b>900</b> by the resilient clips <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, the liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B employ polysilicon TFT as a switching element, which are arranged opposite to three sides of the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> and fixedly stuck via a fixing member on corresponding sides of the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b>. Incidentally, with respect to mutual positioning relation of the liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B, the liquid crystal panel <b>925</b>B is arranged opposite to the liquid crystal panel <b>925</b>R across the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b>, while the liquid crystal panel <b>925</b>G is arranged opposite to the projection lens <b>6</b> across the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> In addition, the liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B are provided with incident side polarizers <b>960</b>R, <b>960</b>G, <b>960</b>B on each light incident side, while being provided with transmitting side polarizers <b>961</b>R, <b>961</b>G, <b>961</b>B on each light transmitting side, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> has the function of combining beams of three colors into a color image and is provided with a multi-layered dielectric film for reflecting a red beam and a multi-layered dielectric film for reflecting a blue beam, which are formed practically in the shape of a letter X at the boundaries of four rectangular prisms. These multi-layered dielectric films serve to combine the beams of three colors.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The projection lens <b>6</b> is the heaviest optical component in the projector <b>1</b>, and is fixedly screwed to the head plate <b>9002</b> of the inner case <b>900</b> via a flange.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The optical unit <b>10</b> configured as described above is assembled as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">First, the box-shaped inner case <b>900</b> is placed to allow the opening thereof to be directed upwardly, that is, to allow the top of the inner case <b>900</b> to be directed downwardly. Then, the light source lamp unit <b>8</b> is inserted into the light-source-unit accommodating portion <b>9001</b> inside the inner case <b>900</b>. Then, disposed therein is each of the optical components (such as reflective mirrors and various lenses) that constitute the illuminating optical system <b>923</b>, the color beam splitting optical system <b>924</b>, the relay optical system <b>927</b> and the like. Then, those optical components are fixed to the inner case <b>900</b> by means of the resilient clips <b>7</b> or the like. Furthermore, the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b>, to which the liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B are fixed, is fixed to the top inside <b>9004</b> of the inner case <b>900</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Here, suppose the inner case <b>900</b> is formed of a resin such as an unsaturated polyester resin. In this case, it is possible to directly fix the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> to the inner case <b>900</b> with an adhesive or the like. On the other hand, in the case of the inner case <b>900</b> formed of a metal such as magnesium , the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> is first fixedly stuck to a prism fixture plate <b>9101</b> formed of a resin, and then the prism fixture plate <b>9101</b> and the inner case <b>900</b> can be fixed with a screw onto each other. Finally, the projection lens <b>6</b> is fixedly screwed onto the head plate <b>9002</b> of the inner case <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The inner case <b>900</b> to which the optical components have been attached as described above is inverted, and then the inner case <b>900</b> and the lower case <b>4</b> are fixed with screws <b>700</b> by making use of projected pieces <b>9005</b> provided on the inner case <b>900</b> and the screw holes of boss portions <b>4005</b> formed on the lower case <b>4</b> in a manner such that the optical components constituting the optical system are accommodated between the inner case <b>900</b> and the lower case <b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Conduction of the heat generated in the optical system to the lower case <b>4</b> can be reduced, by inserting a heat insulating sheet <b>4</b>.<b>1</b> or the like between the inner case <b>900</b> and the lower case <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Incidentally, the inner case <b>900</b> and the lower case <b>4</b>, or the inner case <b>900</b> and the projection lens <b>6</b> may be fixed to each other, by using an appropriate method such as adhesive or engagement, as well as the screws as in the foregoing.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, the lower case <b>4</b> may be provided, at the positions corresponding to each of the optical components constituting the optical systems, with projections for supporting the optical components. This facilitates their assembly and assures stable retention of the optical components so that a shifting of the optical axis is hardly caused. At this time, it is also possible to insert a resilient cushion member <b>21</b> between the edge side of each mirror or lens (excluding the projection lens <b>6</b>) and their support portion of the lower case <b>4</b>, or insert a prism retainer <b>22</b> between the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> and the lower case <b>4</b>, so that these optical components are prevented from floating.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(4) The Function of the Optical Systems</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the optical unit <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the substantially parallel light emitted from the light source device <b>183</b> are split into a plurality of sub-beams by means of the first and second lens arrays <b>921</b>, <b>922</b>, which constitute the integrator optical system (the illuminating optical system <b>923</b>). The sub-beams transmitted from each of the small lenses <b>9211</b> of the first lens array <b>921</b> are generally superimposed on each other on the image forming area of the liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B by means of the superimposing lens <b>932</b>. consequently, each of the liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B is illuminated with a beam of light having a generally uniform distribution of light intensity in a plane.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">At this time, the beam of red component of the beams transmitted from the illuminating optical system <b>923</b> is reflected on the first dichroic mirror <b>941</b> of the color beam splitting optical system <b>924</b>, while the beams of blue and green components pass through the dichroic mirror <b>941</b>. The red beam reflected on the first dichroic mirror <b>941</b> is reflected again on the reflective mirror <b>943</b> and then passes through a field lens <b>951</b> to reach the liquid crystal panel <b>925</b>R for red color. The field lens <b>951</b> collimates each of the sub-beams transmitted from the second lens array <b>922</b> with respect to the center axis (the principal ray). Other field lenses <b>952</b>, <b>953</b> disposed in front of the other liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B function similarly.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Of the blue and green beams that have passed through the first dichroicmirror <b>941</b>, the green beam is reflected on the second dichroic mirror <b>942</b> and then reaches the liquid crystal panel <b>925</b>G for green color through the field lens <b>952</b>. On the other hand, the blue beam passes through the second dichroic mirror <b>942</b> and the relay optical system <b>927</b>, and further travels through the field lens <b>953</b> to reach the liquid crystal panel <b>925</b>B for blue color. Incidentally, the relay optical system <b>927</b> is employed here in order to prevent a drop in service efficiency of light caused by the diffusion of light due to the optical path length of blue light longer than that of any other colors. In other words, the relay optical system <b>927</b> is employed to transmit sub-beams incident upon the incident side lens <b>954</b> to the field lens <b>953</b> without change.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Each of the red, green, and blue beams is provided with a certain polarization by the incident side polarizers <b>960</b>R, <b>960</b>G, <b>960</b>B upon incidence on the liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B. Thereafter, each polarized beam is modulated in each of the liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B in accordance with given image information and then transmitted to the transmitting side polarizers <b>961</b>R, <b>961</b>G, <b>961</b>B as a modulated beam. Then, the transmitting side polarizers <b>961</b>R, <b>961</b>G, <b>961</b>B allow only a certain polarized beam of the modulated beams to pass therethrough and then be transmitted to the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b>. The transmitted polarized beams of respective colors are combined through the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> into a combined beam, which is in turn transmitted towards the projection lens <b>6</b>. This combined beam is projected as a color image onto a projection plane such as a projection screen by means of the projection lens <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(5) Layout of the Control Board and the Air Intake Fan</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the layout of each control board (the driver board <b>11</b>, the main board <b>12</b>, and the AV board <b>13</b>), viewed from the rear side of the projector. As already explained, the driver board <b>11</b> is arranged in the horizontal direction perpendicularly to the main board <b>12</b> and the AV board <b>13</b>, which are provided vertically at the back in the projector <b>1</b>. These control boards <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> are placed with the driver board <b>11</b> being disposed oppositely to the top outside <b>9003</b> of the inner case <b>900</b>. Then, from the respective edge sides, closest to the driver board <b>11</b>, of the liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B, their connecting cables <b>925</b>RC, <b>925</b>GC, <b>925</b>BC are taken out and connected to the driver board <b>11</b> in the shortest possible distance(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In addition, there is formed a notched portion <b>11</b>A at a corresponding position in the driver board <b>11</b>, opposite to the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b>. The notched portion <b>11</b>A is adapted to accommodate the air intake fan <b>17</b>, thereby making it possible to accommodate the air intake fan <b>17</b> therein efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a partial perspective view illustrating the vicinity of a cross dichroic prism of an optical system according to another embodiment of the present invention. An inner case <b>902</b> to be employed in this embodiment is configured in a manner such that a recessed portion is formed in the top outside <b>9003</b> of the inner case <b>900</b> described above, on the side closer to the projection lens in order to arrange the electro-optical device <b>925</b> and the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> in the recessed portion. Therefore, with this inner case <b>901</b>, the illuminating optical system <b>923</b>, the color beam splitting optical system <b>924</b>, and the relay optical system <b>927</b> are accommodated in an enclosure comprising the inner case <b>901</b> and the lower case <b>4</b>. The electro-optical device <b>925</b> and the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> are placed outside the enclosure. The cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> to which the liquid crystal panels <b>925</b>R, <b>925</b>G, <b>925</b>B are fixed is fixed to the inner portion of a head plate <b>9012</b> in a recessed portion <b>901</b>A of the inner case <b>901</b>. Furthermore, the connecting cables <b>925</b>RC, <b>925</b>GC, <b>925</b>BC from their liquid crystal panels are extended from their edge sides opposite to the sides where the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> is fixed to the inner case <b>901</b>, and are connected to the driver board <b>11</b> that is arranged in parallel with the top outside <b>9013</b> of the inner case <b>901</b>. Incidentally, an air vent through which air for cooling these liquid crystal panels passes can be formed around where the cross dichroic prism <b>910</b> is installed in the recessed portion <b>901</b>A of the inner case <b>901</b>, thereby making it possible to improve the cooling effect. Other configuration may be the same as in the case where the inner case <b>900</b> is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the embodiments described in the foregoing the driver board <b>11</b> is arranged on the top outside of the inner case <b>900</b> or <b>901</b>, so that the inner case <b>900</b> or <b>901</b> gives the effect of preventing noise generated by the light source lamp unit <b>8</b> or radiant heat caused by the optical system. Therefore, if the noise or radiant heat has less influence or countermeasures are separately taken against them, it is possible to arrange the driver board <b>11</b> between the inner case <b>900</b> or <b>901</b> and the lower case <b>4</b>.</p>

At this time, the bottom surface of the base <b>801</b> is exposed outside the lower case <b>4</b> and thus serves as a lid. Incidentally, the housing <b>800</b> for holding the light source lamp unit <b>8</b> is preferably formed of a resin to provide increased thermal insulation against the light source device <b>183</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a conceptual view illustrating the positional relationship between the inner case <b>900</b> or <b>901</b> and the light source lamp unit <b>8</b>.
