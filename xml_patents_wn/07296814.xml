<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a frame for motorcycles includes a first frame section to support a front fork, and a second frame section to support rear arms, and more particularly, to a construction, in which the first frame section and the second frame section are connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since a motorcycle for moto-cross races, for example, travels on rough terrain having extreme irregularities, a large impact load and a load of fatigue failure are applied on a frame through a front fork and rear arms. Therefore, in order to improve a motorcycle in kinematical performance, it is necessary to enhance the stiffness and strength of the frame while achieving lightening of the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As for a frame which meets with such demands, there are conventionally known frames, in which a pivot frame to support the rear arms is constructed by a combination of casting and forging. Such pivot frame includes a pair of pivot plates to pivotally support the rear arms and an upper cross member connected to a main pipe. The pivot plates include a forging and have a cross sectional shape to be opened inward in a direction along a vehicle breadth. The upper cross member includes a casting and has a hollow closed, cross sectional shape.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The pivot plates are opposed to each other with the rear arms therebetween and include a fitted recess at an upper end thereof. The upper cross member is positioned between the upper ends of the pivot plates. The upper cross member has a pair of arms, which are bifurcated right and left to project, and fitting projections are formed at tip ends of the respective arms. The fitted recesses of the pivot plates are fitted laterally onto the fitting projections of the upper cross member. The upper end of the pivot frame is welded at an edge thereof to the arms of the upper cross member whereby the pivot frame and the upper cross member make a unitary structure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The pivot frame is welded to the upper cross member in a state of covering the fitting projections of the upper cross member in a lateral direction. Therefore, the upper cross member is connected to the pivot frame while maintaining a hollow closed, cross sectional shape.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since the pivot frame composed of a forging has a cross sectional shape to be opened inward in the direction along the vehicle breadth, however, it is not possible to avoid the situation, in which the frame is extremely varied in cross sectional shape at the connection of the upper cross member and the pivot frame. In other words, a cross sectional shape of the frame changes extremely from a closed cross section to an opened cross section at the connection of the upper cross member and the pivot frame, so that at the connection, the frame is greatly changed in strength and stiffness.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a result, when a high load generated at the time of, for example, landing in jump acts on the frame, there occurs a phenomenon that the entire frame twists about the connection of the upper cross member and the pivot frame, thus causing a disadvantage having an adverse influence on the kinematical performance of the motorcycle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention has been thought of based on the above situation, and has its advantage to provide a frame for motorcycles, capable of preventing an extreme change, in cross sectional shape, of a connection of a first frame section and a second frame section.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to attain the above advantage, a frame for motorcycles, according to an embodiment of the invention includes a first frame section having a head pipe portion that supports a front fork, and a second frame section having a pair of rear arm brackets that support a rear arm and are arranged away from each other in a direction along a vehicle breadth.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first frame section includes a gusset portion having a hollow closed, cross sectional shape and formed with an opening, which is opened rearwardly of the head pipe portion. The rear arm brackets, respectively, include a connection end having a cross sectional shape to be opened inward in the direction along the vehicle breadth, and extending toward the gusset portion. The connection ends of the rear arm brackets are welded to an edge of the opening of the gusset portion.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the gusset portion is not maintained in the closed cross sectional shape at a connection of the gusset portion and the rear arm brackets, and a cross sectional shape of the connection can be caused to smoothly change from a closed cross section to an opened cross section. Therefore, it is possible to prevent strength/stiffness of the frame from varying extremely at a connection of the gusset portion and the rear arm brackets, thus enhancing the motorcycle in kinematical performance.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An embodiment of the invention will be described below with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> discloses a motorcycle <b>1</b> for moto-cross races for example. The motorcycle <b>1</b> includes a cradle-shaped frame <b>2</b>. The frame <b>2</b> supports a front fork <b>3</b>, rear arms <b>4</b>, a water-cooled 4-cycle single cylinder engine <b>5</b>, a fuel tank <b>6</b>, and a seat <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The front fork <b>3</b> is steering-operated by a bar handle <b>8</b> and supports a front wheel <b>9</b>. The rear arms <b>4</b> extend rearward from the frame <b>2</b> and support a rear wheel <b>10</b> at rear ends thereof. The engine <b>5</b> includes a crankcase <b>11</b> and a cylinder <b>12</b> rising from the crankcase <b>11</b>. The engine <b>5</b> serves to drive the rear wheel <b>10</b> and includes a drive sprocket <b>13</b> at a rear end the crankcase <b>11</b>. The length of a chain <b>15</b> is stretched between the drive sprocket <b>13</b> and a driven sprocket <b>14</b> of the rear wheel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The fuel tank <b>6</b> is positioned just above the engine <b>5</b>. The seat <b>7</b> extends substantially horizontally rearwardly of the fuel tank <b>6</b> from an upper surface of the fuel tank <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the frame <b>2</b> includes a first frame section <b>20</b>, a second frame section <b>21</b>, right and left seat rails <b>22</b>, and right and left seat pillar tubes <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first frame section <b>20</b> is formed from a casting of aluminum alloy and includes a head pipe portion <b>24</b> and a gusset portion <b>25</b>. The head pipe portion <b>24</b> is positioned at a front end of the frame <b>2</b> to support the front fork <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The gusset portion <b>25</b> extends rearward and obliquely downward from the head pipe portion <b>24</b> and is in the form of a hollow box being longitudinal in a heightwise direction of the frame <b>2</b>. More specifically, the gusset portion <b>25</b> includes right and left side walls <b>26</b><i>a </i>(only one of them being shown) and an upper wall <b>26</b><i>b</i>, the respective walls <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>being made integral with the head pipe portion <b>24</b>. The side walls <b>26</b><i>a </i>are opposed to each other in a direction along the vehicle breadth, and a reinforcing member <b>27</b> is welded to be bridged between front edges of the side walls <b>26</b><i>a</i>. The reinforcing member <b>27</b> extends downward from a lower end of the head pipe portion <b>24</b>. Therefore, the gusset portion <b>25</b> has a hollow closed, cross sectional shape, which is surrounded by the side walls <b>26</b><i>a</i>, the upper wall <b>26</b><i>b</i>, and the reinforcing member <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the gusset portion <b>25</b> includes a connection <b>29</b> projecting in a rearward manner and obliquely downward, and a downtube <b>30</b> projecting downward. The connection <b>29</b> is located just above the engine <b>5</b>. The connection <b>29</b> includes right and left side walls <b>29</b><i>a</i>, <b>29</b><i>b</i>, an upper wall <b>29</b><i>c</i>, and a lower wall <b>29</b><i>d</i>. The side walls <b>29</b><i>a</i>, <b>29</b><i>b </i>of the connection <b>29</b> are contiguous to the side walls <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the gusset portion <b>25</b>. The upper wall <b>29</b><i>c </i>of the connection <b>29</b> is bridged between upper edges of the side walls <b>29</b><i>a</i>, <b>29</b><i>b </i>and contiguous to the upper wall <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the gusset portion <b>25</b>. The lower wall <b>29</b><i>d </i>of the connection <b>29</b> is bridged between lower edges of the side walls <b>29</b><i>a</i>, <b>29</b><i>b</i>. Further, the side walls <b>29</b><i>a</i>, <b>29</b><i>b </i>are inclined in directions away from each other as they go rearwardly of the gusset portion <b>25</b>. Therefore, the connection <b>29</b> is in the form of a quadrangular box spreading in the direction along the vehicle breadth, and includes at a rear end thereof an opening <b>31</b> opened in a rearward manner.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>, the opening <b>31</b> is defined by rear edges of the side walls <b>29</b><i>a</i>, <b>29</b><i>b</i>, a rear edge of the upper wall <b>29</b><i>c</i>, and a rear edge of the lower wall <b>29</b><i>d</i>. The rear edge of the upper wall <b>29</b><i>c </i>and the rear edge of the lower wall <b>29</b><i>d </i>are cut off in a manner to be dented in a V-shape toward the head pipe portion <b>24</b>. In other words, an opened end of the connection <b>29</b> includes a pair of bifurcated connection guides <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b</i>. The connection guides <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>project rearwardly of the gusset portion <b>25</b> and are pointed in a tapered manner.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The downtube <b>30</b> of the gusset portion <b>25</b> projects downwardly of the head pipe portion <b>24</b> and are positioned forwardly of the engine <b>5</b>. The downtube <b>30</b> is in the form of a rectangular cylinder and includes at a lower end thereof a pair of bifurcated connection arms <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>b</i>. The connection arms <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>b </i>are positioned just in front of the crankcase <b>11</b> of the engine <b>5</b>. Engine brackets <b>34</b> are mounted to the respective connection arms <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>b</i>. The engine brackets <b>34</b> support a front end of the crankcase <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>, the second frame section <b>21</b> includes a pair of rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b</i>, a cross member <b>36</b>, and a rear cushion bracket <b>37</b>. The rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>are composed of a forging made of aluminum alloy. The rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>rise rearwardly of the engine <b>5</b> in the heightwise direction of the frame <b>2</b> and are arranged in parallel to and away from each other in the direction along the vehicle breadth.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 11</figref>, the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b</i>, respectively, include a side wall <b>39</b>, a front wall <b>40</b>, and a rear wall <b>41</b>. The side wall <b>39</b> faces laterally of the frame <b>2</b> and extends in a substantially strap-like manner along the height of the frame <b>2</b>. The front wall <b>40</b> projects inward from a front edge of the side wall <b>39</b> in the direction along the vehicle breadth. Likewise, the rear wall <b>41</b> projects inward from a rear edge of the side wall <b>39</b> in the direction along the vehicle breadth. Therefore, the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>have a C-shaped cross sectional shape to be opened inward in the direction along the vehicle breadth.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A plurality of reinforcing ribs <b>42</b> are formed integrally in a region surrounded by the side wall <b>39</b>, the front wall <b>40</b>, and the rear wall <b>41</b>. The reinforcing ribs <b>42</b> reinforce the respective walls <b>39</b> to <b>41</b> from inside whereby stiffness is sufficiently ensured for the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b</i>, respectively, include a cylindrical-shaped boss portion <b>43</b> and a fitting recess <b>44</b>. The boss portion <b>43</b> is positioned rearwardly of the crankcase <b>11</b>. A rear end of the crankcase <b>11</b> and front ends of the rear arms <b>4</b> are interposed between the boss portion <b>43</b> of the rear arm bracket <b>35</b><i>a </i>and the boss portion <b>43</b> of the rear arm bracket <b>35</b><i>b </i>and supported by the boss portions <b>43</b> through pivots <b>45</b>. The fitting recesses <b>44</b> are positioned at lower ends of the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>to be opened inward in the direction along the vehicle breadth.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The cross member <b>36</b> is composed of an extruded bar made of aluminum alloy to be in the form of a rectangular cylinder. One end of the cross member <b>36</b> is fitted into the fitting recess <b>44</b> of one of the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a </i>to be welded thereto. The other end of the cross member <b>36</b> is fitted into the fitting recess <b>44</b> of the other of the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>b </i>to be welded thereto. Accordingly, the cross member <b>36</b> connects between the lower ends of the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The cross member <b>36</b> includes a pair of supports <b>47</b><i>a</i>, <b>47</b><i>b </i>protruding in a rearward manner. The supports <b>47</b><i>a</i>, <b>47</b><i>b </i>are integrally scraped from the cross member <b>36</b> and arranged in parallel to and away from each other in the direction along the vehicle breadth. A linkage <b>48</b> is bridged between the supports <b>47</b><i>a</i>, <b>47</b><i>b </i>and the rear arms <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the lower ends of the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>are connected to the connection arms <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>b </i>of the downtube <b>30</b> through a pair of lower tubes <b>49</b><i>a</i>, <b>49</b><i>b</i>. The lower tubes <b>49</b><i>a</i>, <b>49</b><i>b </i>extend below the crankcase <b>11</b> of the engine <b>5</b> in a longitudinal direction of the frame <b>2</b> and separate from each other in the direction along the vehicle breadth. Front ends of the lower tubes <b>49</b><i>a</i>, <b>49</b><i>b </i>are welded to the connection arms <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>b </i>of the downtube <b>30</b>. Rear ends of the lower tubes <b>49</b><i>a</i>, <b>49</b><i>b </i>are welded to the lower ends of the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Upwardly projecting engine brackets <b>50</b>, respectively, are welded to intermediate portions of the lower tubes <b>49</b><i>a</i>, <b>49</b><i>b</i>. The engine brackets <b>50</b> support a lower end of the crankcase <b>11</b>. Thus, the downtube <b>30</b> and the lower tubes <b>49</b><i>a</i>, <b>49</b><i>b </i>hold the crankcase <b>11</b> of the engine <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>include extensions <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b </i>extending from upper ends thereof upwardly of the engine <b>5</b>. Receivers <b>53</b><i>a</i>, <b>53</b><i>b </i>are formed on upper surfaces of the extensions <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b </i>to project upward. The receivers <b>53</b><i>a</i>, <b>53</b><i>b </i>are opposed to each other in the direction along the vehicle breadth and include fitted portions <b>54</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref>. The fitted portions <b>54</b> are opened inward in the direction along the vehicle breadth.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The rear cushion bracket <b>37</b> is composed of a casting made of aluminum alloy to be in the form of a rectangular cylinder. One end of the rear cushion bracket <b>37</b> is fitted into and welded to the fitted portion <b>54</b> of one of the receivers <b>53</b><i>a</i>. The other end of the rear cushion bracket <b>37</b> is fitted into and welded to the fitted portion <b>54</b> of one of the receivers <b>53</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the rear cushion bracket <b>37</b> connects between the extensions <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b </i>of the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The rear cushion bracket <b>37</b> includes at an intermediate portion thereof a support <b>55</b> projecting rearward. The support <b>55</b> is positioned above the front ends of the rear arms <b>4</b>. A single hydraulic damper <b>56</b> is bridged between the support <b>55</b> and the linkage <b>48</b> connected to the rear arms <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the support <b>55</b> of the rear cushion bracket <b>37</b> supports front ends of the seat rails <b>22</b>. The seat rails <b>22</b> extend in a rearward manner from the support <b>55</b> to support a rear half of seat <b>7</b>. The seat pillar tubes <b>23</b> are bridged between rear ends of the seat rails <b>22</b> and lower portions of the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>to support the rear ends of the seat rails <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b>, the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>include connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>at tip ends of the extensions <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b </i>thereof. The connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>and the extensions <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b </i>are formed by extending the side walls <b>39</b>, the front walls <b>40</b>, and the rear walls <b>41</b> of the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the extensions <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b </i>and the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b</i>, respectively, have a C-shaped cross sectional shape to be opened inward in the direction along the vehicle breadth, and are reinforced from inside by the reinforcing ribs <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>extend toward the connection <b>29</b> of the gusset portion <b>25</b> from tip ends of the extensions <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b</i>. In the embodiment, the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>are inclined in directions approaching each other as they go toward the connection <b>29</b>, and include a wall <b>61</b> projecting inward in the direction along the vehicle breadth. The walls <b>61</b> of the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>abut against each other on a center line of the frame <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thus the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>are formed to be tapered toward the connection <b>29</b> and have an external shape to follow the edge of the upper wall <b>29</b><i>c </i>and the edge of the lower wall <b>29</b><i>d</i>, which are cut off in a V-shaped manner.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>include fitting projections <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>b </i>projecting from outer surfaces thereof. The fitting projections <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>b </i>are contiguous to the walls <b>61</b> and adapted to be fitted inside the opening <b>31</b> of the connection <b>29</b>. Steps <b>63</b> are formed at boundaries of outer peripheries of the fitting projections <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>b </i>and the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b</i>. The steps <b>63</b> are opposed to the edges of the side walls <b>29</b><i>a</i>, <b>29</b><i>b</i>, the edge of the upper wall <b>29</b><i>c</i>, and the edge of the lower wall <b>29</b><i>d</i>, which face the opening <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, the walls <b>61</b> at tip ends of the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b</i>, respectively, include a recess <b>64</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the recess <b>64</b> is defined by a first wall <b>65</b><i>a</i>, which extends in the longitudinal direction of the frame <b>2</b>, and a second wall <b>65</b><i>b</i>, which extends in the direction along the vehicle breadth. The first wall <b>65</b><i>a </i>defines a butt portion of the wall <b>61</b>. Therefore, the provision of the recesses <b>64</b> makes it possible to sufficiently ensure a contact area at the walls <b>61</b> of the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The second walls <b>65</b><i>b </i>of the walls <b>61</b> are aligned on a straight line in a widthwise direction of the frame <b>2</b>. The walls <b>61</b> of the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>are joined integrally by welding corner portions defined by the first wall <b>65</b><i>a </i>and the second walls <b>65</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the pair of rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>are connected at front ends thereof to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>are fixed to the connection <b>29</b> of the gusset portion <b>25</b> by fitting the fitting projections <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>b </i>of the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>into the opening <b>31</b> of the connection <b>29</b> and welding all around between the steps <b>63</b> and the edges of the side walls <b>29</b><i>a</i>, <b>29</b><i>b</i>, the edge of the upper wall <b>29</b><i>c</i>, and the edge of the lower wall <b>29</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In other words, the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>are welded to an edge of the opening <b>29</b>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With such construction, the gusset portion <b>25</b> of the first frame section <b>20</b> includes the connection <b>29</b> formed with the opening <b>31</b> opened rearwardly.

The connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>are welded to an edge of the opening <b>31</b> whereby the gusset portion <b>25</b> of the first frame section <b>20</b> and the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>of the second frame section <b>21</b> join together.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Therefore, the gusset portion <b>25</b> is not maintained in the hollow closed, cross sectional shape at a connection of the gusset portion <b>25</b> and the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b</i>, and a cross sectional shape of the connection smoothly changes from the closed cross section of the gusset portion <b>25</b> to an opened cross section of the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Accordingly, although the construction connects a casting having the hollow closed, cross sectional shape and a forging having the C-shaped cross sectional shape to each other, it is possible to prevent strength/stiffness of the frame <b>2</b> from varying extremely at a connection of the gusset portion <b>25</b> and the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b</i>. As a result, even in the case where a large load acts on the frame <b>2</b> through the front fork <b>3</b> and the rear arms <b>4</b> when the motorcycle <b>1</b> is traveling, it is possible to prevent the frame <b>2</b> from twisting and flexing about the connection, thus improving the motorcycle <b>1</b> in kinematical performance.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Besides, edges of the upper walls <b>29</b><i>c </i>and edges of the lower walls <b>29</b><i>d </i>to define the edge of the opening <b>31</b> are cut off to be made V-shaped toward the head pipe portion <b>24</b>, and the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>of the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>are tapered in shape to follow the edge of the upper wall <b>29</b><i>c </i>and the edge of the lower wall <b>29</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Therefore, in welding the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>of the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>to the edge of the opening <b>31</b>, it is possible to ensure a sufficient weld length. Accordingly, the connection of the gusset portion <b>25</b> and the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>is enhanced in strength.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, with the construction, the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>are welded together at the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>disposed at front ends thereof, and connected together at the lower ends thereof through the cross member <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Based on the above, the second frame section <b>21</b> can be beforehand assembled as a sub-assembly. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the number of parts and locations of welding when the frame <b>2</b> is assembled, thus enabling shortening of work hours when the frame <b>2</b> is assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Besides, since the connection ends <b>60</b><i>a</i>, <b>60</b><i>b </i>of the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>and the walls <b>61</b>, respectively, are only inclined inward in the direction along the vehicle breadth, the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>are not made complicate in shape. As a result, complication in mold structure for forging is avoided and the rear arm brackets <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>do not become worse in forging quality.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The invention is not limited to the above embodiment but can be embodied in various changes within a range not departing from the gist of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">For example, according to the embodiment, the connection ends of the rear arm brackets are caused to abut against each other to be subjected to butt welding. However, the invention is not limited thereto but the connection ends may be separated from each other within an opened range of the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Also, according to the embodiment, the fitting projections fitted inside the opening are formed on the connection ends of the rear arm brackets but the invention is not limited thereto. For example, a further low step may be formed at the opened edge of the opening, and flanges covering the step may be formed on the connection ends and may be welded to the opened edge of the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, the frame in the invention is not limited to cradle-shaped one. For example, a diamond-shaped frame, in which the lower tube is omitted and which makes use of a crankcase of an engine as a strength member, is likewise workable.</p>
