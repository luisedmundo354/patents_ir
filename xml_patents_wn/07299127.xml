<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to vehicle display devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A great deal of information can now be made available to an operator of a vehicle regarding the position, speed, and altitude of the vehicle, as well as a host of operating parameters, such as various vehicle diagnostic signals including wireless signal from tire pressure sensors and the like. It is often desirable that such information be made available for display.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As recognized by the present invention, positional information may be received using a global positioning satellite (GPS) system, whereas vehicle diagnostic information and other information may be received using a wireless link. The present invention further recognizes that one wireless link that may be effectively used, owing to its broad interoperability with a large number of computing devices, is the personal area network (PAN) radiofrequency (RF) link known Bluetooth. As still further recognized herein, particularly in the case of vehicles, where space and weight are at a premium for fuel conservation and where even a few cents of additional cost can take on critical importance, advanced systems preferably should be as compact as possible and use as few components as possible. To date, a combined GPS/Bluetooth information system for a vehicle has not been provided. With the above critical observations in mind, the invention disclosed herein is provided.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A wireless GPS system for, e.g., a vehicle includes a GPS antenna, a GPS receiver unit including a GPS synthesizer coupled to the GPS antenna, a Bluetooth antenna, and a Bluetooth transceiver unit including a transceiver synthesizer coupled to the Bluetooth antenna. A module holds the GPS receiver, Bluetooth transceiver, and the Bluetooth antenna, and the module includes a reference oscillator that provides signals to both the GPS receiver synthesizer and Bluetooth transceiver synthesizer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a preferred embodiment, a dual SAW filter package is in the module, with signals from both antennae being filtered through the SAW filter package. If desired, the GPS antenna may be mounted on the module and the module may be supported on a vehicle rear view mirror housing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As set forth further below, the Bluetooth transceiver can receive data from the GPS receiver and then transmit the data to the vehicle engine control module and/or to a portable consumer computing device such -as a PDA, wireless telephone, or laptop computers, for display of the data. Also, the Bluetooth transceiver can receive vehicle diagnostic data from vehicle sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, a module includes a module housing holding a GPS receiver and a wireless transceiver communicating with the GPS receiver for transmitting information therefrom. One and only one reference oscillator is in the housing to provide mixing signals to the GPS receiver and the wireless transceiver.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another aspect, a module includes a module housing that holds a GPS receiver and a wireless transceiver communicating with the GPS receiver for transmitting information therefrom. A dual SAW filter package is in the module, with signals from both a GPS antenna and a Bluetooth antenna being filtered through the SAW filter package.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In still another aspect, a method for data transmission includes sending GPS data to a Bluetooth transceiver. The data is transmitted using the Bluetooth transceiver to at least one of: a vehicle onboard computer, and a portable consumer computing device, at least for display of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect, a system for data transmission includes wireless transceiver means, and means for sending GPS data to the transceiver means for transmission of the data to a vehicle onboard computer and/or to a portable consumer computing device in a vehicle, at least for display of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The details of the present invention, both as to its structure and operation, can best be understood in reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like parts, and in which:</p>

Alternatively, the GPS antenna may be mounted elsewhere and electrically connected to the below-described GPS components on the module <b>12</b>. For example, as shown at <b>20</b><i>a</i>, the GPS antenna may be mounted on the module itself, on the windshield <b>22</b> of the vehicle <b>16</b> in front of the mount <b>18</b>, or it may be mounted on the roof <b>24</b>, as shown at <b>20</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Using a wireless link such as the below-described preferred Bluetooth link, the module <b>12</b> may communicate information to the vehicle's onboard computer <b>26</b>, otherwise known as an engine control module. Alternatively or in addition, the module <b>12</b> may communicate with a portable consumer device <b>28</b>, such as, e.g., a personal digital assistant (PDA), wireless telephone, laptop computer, or other device that preferably has a display for presenting information from the module <b>12</b>. This information may be presented on the rear view mirror or other display surface of the vehicle <b>16</b> in accordance with mirror display principles known in the art. Instead of Bluetooth, the module <b>12</b> may use other types of personal area networks (PAN) or wireless local area networks (LAN) such as a wireless 802.11 link, the so-called “wi-fi” system, or even satellite or DSRC systems.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The information mentioned above may include vehicle diagnostic information as indicated by signals from one or more sensors <b>29</b>. The sensors <b>29</b> may include one or more of tire pressure sensors, temperature sensors, compasses, remote keyless entry signal sensors, light sensors for headlamp control, airbag status indicators, rain sensors, etc. Also, while the word “sensor” is used it is to be understood that the wireless GPS module <b>12</b> may receive input from a microphone for hands-free voice recognition commands, trip function calculations, and the like, and may also communicate signals useful for garage door control and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the details of the preferred wireless GPS module <b>12</b>. As shown, on the body of the module <b>12</b> a Bluetooth antenna <b>30</b> can be mounted, as well as, if desired, the GPS antenna <b>20</b> (preferably with preamplifying circuitry). The signal from the GPS antenna <b>20</b> is filtered through a GPS surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter <b>32</b>, whereas the signal from the Bluetooth antenna <b>30</b> is filtered through a Bluetooth surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter <b>34</b>. Preferably, the SAW filters <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are packaged together on one substrate to establish a dual SAW filter package.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">After filtering, the GPS signal is sent to a GPS mixer <b>36</b> for downconverting to an intermediate frequency, and then is demodulated by GPS demodulation circuitry <b>38</b> which may include an analog to digital converter (ADC), prior to being sent to digital GPS processing and storage circuitry <b>40</b> which may include a digital signal processor (DSP). Likewise, from its SAW filter <b>34</b> the Bluetooth signal is sent to a Bluetooth mixer <b>42</b> for downconverting to an intermediate frequency, and then is demodulated by Bluetooth modulation/demodulation circuitry <b>44</b>, prior to being sent to digital Bluetooth processing and storage circuitry <b>46</b> which can, if desired, communicate with a CODEC for audio/voice recognition input. The processing and storage circuitry <b>46</b> may include a Bluetooth baseband component and a digital signal processor (DSP). The transmit path is in the reverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, information from the GPS processing and storage circuitry <b>40</b>, such as position, speed, and altitude information, is sent to the Bluetooth processing and storage circuitry <b>46</b> over a link <b>47</b>. The link <b>47</b> may be a universal serial bus (USB) or universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) link. Accordingly, the Bluetooth transceiver can wirelessly transmit the GPS information to the ECM <b>26</b> for display thereof on, e.g., the rear view mirror, or to the portable device <b>28</b> for display of the GPS information on the display of the portable device <b>28</b>. Also, recall that the Bluetooth transceiver receives various vehicle diagnostic information from the sensors <b>29</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). This vehicle diagnostic information can also be sent wirelessly to the ECM <b>26</b> for display and/or the generation of appropriate control signals to various vehicle components. The diagnostic information may also be sent to the portable device <b>28</b> for display of the information thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The GPS circuitry described above can be implemented by a Sony CXG2956 and/or CXG2951 GPS receiver, whereas the Bluetooth circuitry can be implemented by a Cambridge Silicon Radio “Bluecore 2” transceiver die that is packaged with the GPS receiver, although other implementations of Bluetooth transceivers may be used. Those skilled in the art will understand that GPS uses an rf signal having binary bi-phase modulation or shift keying (BPSK) at a frequency of 1575.42 MHz, while Bluetooth uses an rf signal having GFSK modulation with time division multiple access (TDMA) at 2.4 GHz-2.483 GHz.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the GPS circuitry includes a GPS synthesizer <b>48</b> that sends a downconvert frequency to the mixer <b>36</b> in accordance with radio principles known in the art. Similarly, the Bluetooth circuitry includes a Bluetooth synthesizer <b>50</b> that sends a downconvert frequency to the Bluetooth mixer <b>42</b>. In accordance with the present invention, both the GPS and Bluetooth transceivers described above receive appropriate mixing signals from a single reference oscillator <b>52</b>, common to both receivers. That is, a single reference oscillator <b>52</b> feeds mixing signals to both the GPS synthesizer <b>48</b> and the Bluetooth synthesizer <b>52</b>. No other components are shared by the receivers in the non-limiting embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this way, off-the-shelf GPS and Bluetooth transceivers may be used and housed on a single module <b>12</b> without unduly modifying either receiver (typically implemented from the manufacturer on a chip), while conserving parts and space in that only one reference oscillator is used and in that both front-end SAW filters <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be implemented in a single package.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> show physical implementations of the above-described receivers. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a GPS receiver <b>54</b> and a Bluetooth transceiver <b>56</b> may be mounted on opposite sides of a substrate <b>58</b>, which could hold the common reference oscillator and dual SAW filter package if desired. Alternatively, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows that a GPS receiver <b>60</b> and a Bluetooth transceiver <b>62</b> may be mounted on the same side of a substrate <b>64</b>, which could hold the common reference oscillator and dual SAW filter package if desired. As yet another alternative, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> a GPS receiver <b>66</b> is mounted on a first substrate and a Bluetooth transceiver <b>68</b> is mounted on a second substrate, with the substrates both being contained in a wireless GPS module housing <b>70</b>. The GPS receiver <b>66</b> communicates with the Bluetooth transceiver <b>68</b> using, e.g., a wired USB/UART link.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">While the particular COMMON ELECTRONICS ARCHITECTURE FOR VEHICLE MIRROR DISPLAY as herein shown and described in detail is fully capable of attaining the above-described objects of the invention, it is to be understood that it is the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention and is thus representative of the subject matter which is broadly contemplated by the present invention, that the scope of the present invention fully encompasses other embodiments which may become obvious to those skilled in the art, and that the scope of the present invention is accordingly to be limited by nothing other than the appended claims, in which reference to an element in the singular is not intended to mean “one and only one” unless explicitly so stated, but rather “one or more”.
