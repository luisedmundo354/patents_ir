<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, a liquid crystal display device (hereinafter referred to as a liquid crystal display device) employing the semiconductor device and methods of fabricating the semiconductor device and the liquid crystal display device, and in particular to techniques of fabricating a thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as a TFT) comprising a polycrystalline semiconductor on an insulating substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is a technique for fabricating peripheral circuits such as a driver circuit for driving pixels and a control circuit for controlling the driver circuit at the periphery of an insulating substrate on which pixels are fabricated in a liquid crystal display panel, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The process for fabricating a polycrystalline Si TFT (hereinafter referred to as a p-Si TFT) of the peripheral circuits is intrinsically a hot-temperature process, but a low-temperature process for it is realized by using a process explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The low-temperature process comprises formation of an amorphous silicon (hereinafter referred to as an a-Si) film, conversion of the a-Si film into a polycrystalline film by irradiation of excimer laser, formation of a gate insulating oxide film by plasma CVD or the like, formation of a gate electrode made of a metal or a metallic silicide by a sputtering method or the like, formation of source and drain regions by ion doping or ion implantation, and then ion activation by laser annealing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above crystallization of an a-Si film by excimer laser uses a phenomenon that irradiation of a TV light pulse of about 20 ns melts the a-Si film and then crystallization occurs as the a-Si film cools.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">But with the conventional method, it is very difficult to control the grain sizes, orientations and positions of crystals in the polycrystalline film because of fast crystallization and non-equilibrium process.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The larger the grain sizes are, the better the performance of the p-Si TFT becomes, but the wider the spread in the grain sizes becomes and consequently the wider the variability of TFT characteristics becomes.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">If the grain sizes are selected to be sufficiently smaller than the length of a channel of TFTs, the variability of the TFT characteristics becomes smaller, but the TFT characteristics are degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The p-Si TFTs of the peripheral circuits in the liquid crystal panel are of the so-called SOI (Silicon-On-Insulator) type using an insulating substrate such as a glass substrate and are not capable of establishing a substrate potential, and consequently an adverse effect such as a projection called a “kink” occurs in a current-voltage characteristic curve especially of the p-Si TFT constituting the high-performance peripheral circuits.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A common method of forming the p-Si film by a low-temperature process comprises irradiation of the excimer laser light onto the a-Si film to melt to it and crystallization in the liquid phase of the melt as the film cools.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the density of irradiation energy is small, a large number of nucleuses <b>12</b><i>a </i>are produced as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A-2</figref>, grow in a direction of the thickness of the film, i.e. in a vertical direction, and finally form the p-Si film <b>1</b><i>a </i>composed of small grains as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">On the other hand, when the density of irradiation energy is large, a small number of nucleuses <b>12</b><i>b </i>are produced as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B-2</figref>, grow both vertically and laterally at the same time, and finally form the p-Si film <b>1</b><i>b </i>composed of large grains as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described above, the larger the grain sizes in the p-Si film are, the better the performance of the p-Si TFT becomes, and therefore it is the ultimate object to form the active elements of the peripheral circuit of the liquid crystal display panel in a single crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">There is a limit to the grain sizes enlarged by simply adjusting the laser irradiation conditions for crystallization and the positions of crystalline grain formation cannot be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">To control the positions of crystalline grain formation and enlarge the grain sizes, it is necessary to initially form nucleuses at predetermined positions and then grow the nucleuses laterally. Based upon this concept, various methods have been proposed. An SLS method proposed by J. S. Im et al. (R. S. Sposili and J. S. Im: “Sequential lateral solidification of thin films on SiO<sub>2</sub>”, Appl. Phys. Lett. 69(19), 4 Nov. 1996, pp. 2864-2866) and a method of irradiating through a phase-shift mask proposed by M. Matsumura et al. (C. H. Oh and M. Matsumura: “Preparation of Position-Controlled Crystal-Silicon Island Arrays”, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. Vol. 37(1998) pp. 5474-5479) realize relatively large grain sizes for the present.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Both the two methods perform the formation of nucleuses and their lateral growth differently, but they do not control the sizes or the orientation of nucleuses. There are problems with the two methods in that, in the lateral growth, the growth speed is slow and the area of crystallization is small, due to limitation to an irradiation light-distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The embodiment of the present invention employs methods of growing crystals known as Metal Induced Crystallization (sometimes hereafter referred to as MIC) and Metal Induced Lateral Crystallization (sometimes hereafter referred to as MILC), and control the nucleation, and solves the problem with the lateral growth by using excimer laser.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the process of MIC, a thin metal film made of Au, Al, Sb, In, Pd, Ti, Ni or the like is disposed on the topside or underside of the a-Si film and thermally annealed, and consequently the transition temperature from a-Si to c-Si (crystalline Si) which is normally 600° C. is lowered due to the presence of the thin metal film such that crystallization proceeds at a temperature lower than 600° C.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The mechanism of the above process has not been fully understood yet. In the case of four metals, Au, Al, Sb and In, it is thought that silicon is transported from the amorphous phase to the crystalline phase via the metal compound containing silicon due to difference between solubility of the metal into the a-Si in the compound of the metal and the a-Si and solubility of the metal into the c-Si in the compound of the metal and the c-Si (see E. Nygren, et. al, Appl. Phys. Lett. 52(6) pp. 439-441(1988) for further detail). On the other hand, in the case of Pd, Ti and Ni, it is thought that the growth from the a-Si phase into the c-Si phase occurs via formation of silicide (see C. Hayzelden and J. L. Batstone, J. Appl. Phys. 73(12) pp. 8279-8289(1993) for further detail).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The metal induced crystallization (MIC) occurs in a region in contact with the thin metal film in the process of forming crystalline nucleuses assisted by the metal. It is observed that lateral crystalline growth occurs in a region not covered with the thin metal film, and this phenomenon is so-called metal induced lateral crystallization (MILC). In this method, although the growth speed of the p-Si film depends upon process conditions and material, it is on the order of μm per hour, very fast compared with usual solid-phase growth and this method provides large grains and aligns orientations of crystalline grains well enough in planes parallel with the major surface of the substrate (see Seok-Woon Lee, et. al, Appl. Phys. Lett. 66(13) pp. 1671-1673(1995) for further detail).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4D</figref> are cross-sectional views of the film for explaining the principle of the formation of the p-Si film composed of large grains by producing nucleuses using the MIC and MILC methods.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Initially, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a first a-Si thin film <b>11</b> is formed on a substrate <b>3</b>, a metal film <b>14</b> serving as an undercoating film is deposited on the first a-Si thin film and then an opening <b>15</b> is made in the metal film <b>14</b> at a position corresponding to a p-Si island to be formed later by using a photolithography technique.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Then thermal annealing is performed at a low temperature (lower than 600° C.) insufficient to cause the transformation from the a-Si to the p-Si by using the MIC and MILC methods. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, broken line indicate the edge of the p-Si island <b>1</b> (see FIG. <b>1</b>A) to be fabricated subsequently. The a-Si film <b>11</b> under the metal film <b>14</b> is transformed into the p-Si film <b>16</b> (during this process the metal film <b>14</b> is absorbed by the p-Si film <b>16</b>), and then the lateral growth of the crystalline grains, i.e. the above-explained MILC occurs in the region not originally covered with the metal film <b>14</b>. Reference numeral <b>17</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> designate large crystalline grains produced by the MILC method.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">It is desirable that the thickness of the metal film <b>14</b> is selected to be such a value that the metal film <b>14</b> is absorbed completely by the a-Si film within a thermal annealing time required for the lateral crystalline growth of at least 0.5 μm in length, but the metal film <b>14</b> need not necessarily be absorbed completely.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Even after the metal film <b>14</b> has been absorbed completely by the a-Si film, the portion of the film <b>11</b> at the center of the opening <b>15</b> remains the a-Si film as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, and a single crystalline grain or large crystalline grains <b>17</b> having their orientations aligned parallel with each other in planes parallel with the major surface of the substrate are produced in contact with the a-Si film at the center.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, a second a-Si film <b>18</b> is deposited over the entire area and irradiation of excimer laser (not shown) onto the a-Si film <b>18</b> crystallizes the a-Si film <b>18</b> according to the state of crystallization of the p-Si film <b>16</b> underlying the a-Si film <b>18</b> and serving as the undercoating film as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. Especially in a portion of the a-Si film in proximity to large crystalline grains (as indicated by reference numeral <b>17</b>, for example) large crystalline grains are formed aligned with the large crystalline grains. Reference numeral <b>1</b> denotes a p-Si film composed of large crystalline grains.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this embodiment, it is desirable to transform a portion intended for a channel region of the TFT into a single crystal, but even if the region is divided by grain boundaries, when the number of the grains is small and the directions of the grain boundaries are parallel with the flowing direction of electric current, the TFT performance is expected to be approximately the same as that obtained with the single crystal. To fabricate such a grain structure, an area irradiated by laser is moved over the film such that crystallization proceeds from a region intended for one of drain and source regions toward a region intended to face a gate electrode or such that crystallization proceeds from a region intended for one of drain and source regions through the region intended to face the gate electrode toward a region intended for the other of the source and drain regions.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Then the unnecessary portion <b>21</b> of the p-Si film is removed by using the photolithography technique to form the p-Si island <b>1</b> indicated by broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> also). There is retained a conductive layer made of the Si film and the metal absorbed therein and having its crystalline orientations aligned parallel with each other in the planes parallel with the major surface of the substrate, in order to be used for establishing a substrate potential.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">To obtain a crystalline grain of at least 10 μm in size which is a practical length for transistors, it is necessary to utilize diffusion of material by thermal gradient. There are a number of methods proposed for performing this by using laser irradiation, one of which will be explained by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> are illustrations for explaining an intensity distribution of excimer laser irradiation for formation of the p-Si TFT <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a plan view of an arrangement of the p-Si islands <b>1</b> formed on the insulating substrate <b>3</b> (not shown) and the conductive layer <b>2</b> disposed in contact with the p-Si islands <b>1</b>, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> the gate electrodes <b>4</b> are indicated by broken lines to facilitate understanding. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates an ideal intensity distribution of laser irradiation, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> illustrates a distribution of light transmission of a mask comprised of plural dielectric films.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the ideal intensity distribution of laser irradiation is such that the irradiation extends wider than the width of a portion intended for one transistor in a direction of crystalline growth (a direction of the long sides of the p-Si islands <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>), but does not extend to adjacent portions intended for transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In practice, it is difficult to obtain the linear intensity distribution of laser irradiation for individual transistors as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, consequently it is practically useful to use a mask obtained by fabricating plural dielectric layers in the form of steps, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> shows an example of the intensity distribution of such a mask.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are illustrations for explaining a basic structure of the irradiation mask for fabrication of the peripheral circuit portion of the liquid crystal display panel, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a schematic plan view of the mask having a dielectric multilayer portion for reflecting (i.e. blocking) laser light, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates a difference in transmission between the transmissive and non-transmissive portions of the dielectric multilayer films. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, reference <b>20</b> denotes the mask and <b>19</b> is the laser-reflecting portion of the dielectric mask.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The p-Si TFTs in the liquid crystal display panel is of the so-called SOI structure fabricated on the insulating substrate such as glass. As explained above, the potential of the substrate cannot be established by the substrate itself unlike Si LSIs because the substrate is an insulator, and the greatest problem that arises due to this is that a breakdown voltage between the source and drain regions is lowered. This is because holes generated by high electric fields present in the vicinity of the drain region are accumulated in the lower portion of the channel and cause a parasitic bipolar transistor to be turned on. This problem is solved by disposing a conductive film on the substrate and establishing the substrate potential, but the parasitic capacitance increases to such a great extent that desired TFT characteristics are not obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Especially the SOI structure has a reduced parasitic capacitance and an insulating substrate, and consequently provides excellent characteristics such as high speed operation, low power consumption and high breakdown voltages. But this useful structure produces the problem of lowering the source-drain breakdown voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The above-mentioned disposition of the conductive film on the substrate is such that the charges accumulated at the interface with the substrate are extracted by the conductive layer <b>2</b> disposed in contact with the above-explained electrode structure, i.e. the p-Si islands <b>1</b> and having its crystalline orientations aligned to eliminate causes of unstable operation. This structure is known as the field shield in the conventional SOI structure (Proc. of 5th Int'l Symp. on SOI Tech. and Devices, Vol. 92-13, p64 (1992). In this embodiment, the undercoating film used for the MIC and MILC processes is remaining even during the process of laser crystallization. The accumulated charges are extracted more efficiently from the central portion of the channel as well as the ends of the source and drain regions compared with the conventional structures, though resistance of these regions is very high because of a small amount of the metal in these regions.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Instead of disposing the metal film <b>14</b> on the top surface of the a-Si film <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the metal film <b>14</b> can be disposed under the a-Si film <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>.
