<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A laminated spacer portion formed by laminating various thin films that constitute thin-film transistors is disposed in peripheral driver circuits. As a result, even in a structure in which part of a sealing member is disposed above the peripheral driver circuits, pressure exerted from spacers in the sealing member is concentrated on the laminated spacer portion, whereby destruction of a thin-film transistor of the peripheral driver circuits can be prevented caused by the pressure from the sealing portion.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an active matrix liquid crystal display panel which is integral with peripheral driver circuits, as well as to various apparatuses using such a panel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An active matrix liquid crystal display panel is known in which an active matrix circuit and peripheral driver circuits for driving it are integrated on a glass substrate or a quartz substrate. In such an active matrix liquid crystal display panel, various measures have been taken to minimize the area of portions unnecessary for display, i.e., the area occupied by the peripheral driver circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, in the liquid crystal display panel, a sealing member is provided in a peripheral portion to hold, i.e., confine a liquid crystal between a pair of substrates. As one measure to minimize the ares of portions unnecessary for display, it is now required to reduce the area occupied by the sealing member.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The active matrix liquid crystal display panel which is integral with the peripheral driver circuits has a problem that failures likely occur in the peripheral driver circuits. This tendency is more remarkable in a configuration in which part of the sealing member is disposed above the peripheral driver circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This problem occurs in the following manner. The sealing member contains a kind of spacer called a filler to maintain the gap between the substrates. In general, the peripheral driver circuits have a very high degree of integration. In these circumstances, pressure is exerted from the filler on thin-film transistors and a wiring of the peripheral driver circuits which are located right under the filler (the pressure is estimated to be very strong locally), so that a line disconnection, a contact failure, and even a disconnection of a semiconductor layer are likely to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Although spherical substrate gap holding means called spacers are also used in the active matrix area, the occurrence of failures in the active matrix area due to the existence of the spacers is not so serious as in the peripheral driver circuits, because the degree of integration is low in the active matrix area.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to minimize the area of portions other than a pixel matrix circuit in an active matrix liquid crystal display panel which is integral with peripheral driver circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the invention is to prevent destruction of a peripheral driver circuit due to pressure exerted from a sealing member even in the active matrix liquid crystal display panel that attains the above object.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a first aspect of the invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1D</figref> and <b>2</b> in the form of a specific manufacturing process, there is provided a liquid crystal display panel comprising an active matrix circuit (pixel circuit); a peripheral driver circuit, the active matrix circuit and the peripheral driver circuit being integrated on the same substrate <b>101</b>; a sealing member (indicated by numeral <b>206</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), part of the sealing member being disposed above the peripheral driver circuit; thin-film transistors formed in the peripheral driver circuit; and a protrusion (laminated spacer) formed in the peripheral driver circuit, the protrusion being a lamination of materials that constitute the thin-film transistors, the protrusion being projected (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>) from portions where the thin-film transistors are disposed.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">This embodiment is directed to an active matrix liquid crystal display panel which is integral with peripheral driver circuits. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1D</figref> and <b>2</b> show its manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">This embodiment is directed to manufacture of a liquid crystal display panel that is constituted of a pixel circuit (active matrix circuit) and peripheral driver circuits for driving it. For example, the peripheral driver circuits are composed of a shift register circuit, a buffer circuit, and a sampling circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">First, a base film (not shown) is formed on a glass substrate <b>101</b>. Alternatively, a quartz substrate may be used. In this embodiment, a 3,000-Å-thick silicon oxide film is formed by plasma CVD as the base film.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A 500-Å-thick amorphous silicon film (not shown) is then formed by low-pressure thermal CVD.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A crystalline silicon film is obtained by crystallizing the amorphous silicon film by illuminating it with laser light. Other means may be used to obtain a crystalline silicon film.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The thus-obtained crystalline silicon film is patterned into a pattern <b>102</b>, a pattern indicated by numerals <b>103</b> to <b>105</b>, and a pattern indicated by numerals <b>106</b> to <b>108</b>. The pattern <b>102</b> will become a semiconductor pattern to constitute a laminated spacer <b>1000</b>. The pattern indicated by numerals <b>103</b> to <b>105</b> will become an active layer pattern of a thin-film transistor in a peripheral driver circuit <b>1001</b>. The pattern indicated by numerals <b>106</b> to <b>108</b> will become an active layer pattern of a thin-film transistor in a pixel circuit (active matrix circuit) <b>1002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The laminated spacer is a laminated protrusion of all the components that are formed intentionally in the TFT substrate. If the laminated spacer is disposed in a peripheral driver circuit, pressure from the spacers for holding the substrate gap is concentrated on the laminated spacer. As a result, pressure exerted on thin-film transistors and a wiring that constitute the peripheral driver circuits can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this embodiment, it is assumed that all the illustrated thin-film transistors are of an n-channel type. In general, the peripheral driver circuits are constituted of n-channel and p-channel thin-film transistors. On the other hand, n-channel or p-channel transistors are used in the pixel circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">After the patterning of the semiconductor layer, a gate insulating film <b>109</b> is formed, and then an aluminum film (not shown) for forming gate electrodes (and gate lines extending therefrom) is formed on the gate insulating film <b>109</b>. In this embodiment, a 4,000-Å-thick aluminum film is formed by sputtering by using an aluminum target containing scandium at 0.18 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The thus-formed aluminum film is patterned into aluminum patterns <b>110</b> to <b>112</b>. The pattern <b>110</b> is an aluminum pattern to constitute the laminated spacer. The pattern <b>111</b> is a gate electrode of the thin-film transistor in the peripheral driver circuit. The pattern <b>112</b> is a gate electrode of the thin-film transistor in the pixel circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Subsequently, 1,000-Å-thick anodic oxide films <b>113</b> to <b>115</b> are formed by anodization in which the aluminum patterns <b>110</b> to <b>112</b> are used as the anodes. Thus, the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Silicon nitride films may be used instead of anodic oxide films. As a further alternative, oxide films (plasma oxide films) may be formed by plasma processing in an oxidizing atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a 3,000-Å-thick silicon nitride film as a first interlayer insulating film <b>116</b> is formed by plasma CVD (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">After contact holes are formed, a multilayer metal film in which an aluminum film is interposed between titanium films is formed by sputtering.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The three-layer metal film is patterned into a pattern <b>117</b>, a source electrode <b>118</b>, a drain electrode <b>119</b>, a source electrode <b>120</b>, and a drain electrode <b>121</b>. The pattern <b>117</b> will become part of the laminated spacer. Thus, the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thereafter, a 15,000-Å-thick resin layer <b>122</b>, specifically a polyimide layer, as a second interlayer insulating film is formed by spin coating. The use of the resin layer <b>122</b> is advantageous in that its surface can be made flat.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Subsequently, a 3,000-Å-thick titanium film is formed by sputtering, and then patterned into a pattern <b>124</b> and a pattern <b>125</b>. The pattern <b>124</b> is a titanium film pattern to become part of the laminated spacer. The pattern <b>125</b> is a black matrix (BM), which has a function of shielding the thin-film transistors in the pixel circuit from light.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Then, a 3,000-Å-thick resin layer <b>126</b>, specifically a polyimide layer, as a third interlayer insulating film <b>126</b> is formed by spin coating.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">After contact holes are formed, a 1,000-Å-thick ITO film is formed over the entire surface by sputtering. The ITO film is patterned into a pattern <b>127</b> and an ITO pixel electrode <b>128</b>. The pixel electrode <b>128</b> is in contact with the drain electrode <b>121</b>. An auxiliary capacitance is formed in a region where the pixel electrode <b>128</b> and the black matrix <b>125</b> coextend. Thus, the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The ITO pattern <b>127</b> is also left, as a dummy, in the laminated spacer portion. This makes the laminated spacer portion the thickest in the entire substrate structure. That is, the laminated spacer portion is provided as a protrusion which is wider than a given area and in which all the components are laminated.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Subsequently, an opposed glass substrate <b>201</b> (or a quartz substrate) is prepared as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. An opposed electrode <b>202</b> and an orientation film <b>203</b> are formed on the opposed glass substrate <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Reference numeral <b>206</b> denotes a sealing member, and numerals <b>204</b> and <b>205</b> denote spacers included in the sealing member <b>206</b>. A liquid crystal <b>207</b> is sealed within the liquid crystal cell by the sealing member <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, pressure exerted from the spacers <b>204</b> and <b>205</b> is concentrated on the laminated spacer portion. This is because the laminated spacer portion is a highest protrusion having a certain area.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The coextending portion of the black matrix <b>125</b> and the pixel electrode <b>128</b> in the pixel circuit is equal in height (i.e., thickness) to the laminated spacer portion. However, since the coextending portion has only a small area and the degree of integration is low in the pixel circuit, the occurrence of wiring disconnections and TFT failures due to pressure exerted from the spacer <b>208</b> is negligible.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is particularly advantageous in that line disconnections and operation failures of TFTs can be prevented in the peripheral driver circuit regions where the degree of integration is high.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above, by providing the laminated spacer in the active matrix liquid crystal display panel which is integral with the peripheral driver circuits, the peripheral driver circuits can be prevented from being damaged by pressure exerted from spacers that are included in the sealing member even if part of the sealing member is disposed above the peripheral driver circuits.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">This embodiment is directed to a case where the invention is applied to a configuration in which not only the peripheral driver circuits hut also various processing circuits and memory circuits are integrated on the same substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The structure called “system on panel” has been proposed as an advanced version of the liquid crystal display panel which is integral with the peripheral driver circuits. In this new structure, various processing circuits and memory circuits as well as the active matrix circuit and the peripheral driver circuits are integrated on the same substrate. This structure is intended to reduce the size of an information processing terminal by integrating its functions on a single glass substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Also in this structure, it is required to reduce the area of the portions other than the pixel circuit (active matrix circuit). This necessarily requires a structure in which the sealing member is overlapped with various integrated circuits which constitute various processing circuits and memory circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">To satisfy this requirement, the laminated spacer as described in the first embodiment may be provided in such integrated circuits, whereby the integrated circuits constituting various processing circuits and memory circuits which are high in the degree of integration can be prevented from being damaged by pressure exerted from spacers in the sealing member.</p>
