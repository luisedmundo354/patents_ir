<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a lancing apparatus used to stick a tip end of a lancet into skin for extracting blood, other body fluid or tissue for testing.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a typical lancing apparatus, a lancet holder holding a lancet is accommodated in a housing to which a front end cover is attached. When a predetermined operation is performed, the lancet holder advances toward the front end of the front end cover by a spring force. Since the lancet is generally disposable, the front end cover is made removable so that it can be removed in attaching or detaching the lancet. In using the lancing apparatus, the front end cover is pressed against skin of the human body. The front end cover is formed with an opening for allowing the needle to lance the skin. When the lancet holder is advanced, the lancet passes through the opening to lance the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, blood is extracted from the fingertip or the forearm. Although, the fingertip bleeds easily, lancing of the fingertip involves relatively strong pain. On the other hand, although the forearm is unlikely to bleed, the pain in lancing is relatively small. Further, the tendency to bleed from the skin varies among individuals at any portion of the skin. Preferably, therefore, the portion of the skin for extracting blood is selected based on the user's preference or in consideration of the tendency to bleed. In extracting blood from the forearm, it is preferable to bulge the skin by suction and to lance the bulged skin for promoting bleeding.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, when the same front cover is used for the blood extraction from the fingertip and that from the forearm, proper blood extraction may not be performed in the following reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a front end cover with a relatively large opening is pressed against the fingertip, the finger tip bulges. The amount of bulging differs among individuals because of the variations of the hardness of the skin. Therefore, the positional relationship between the needle of the lancet and the skin, and hence, the lancing depth differ among individuals, which hinders stable lancing operation. To eliminate such a problem, it is desirable to use a front end cover with a relatively small opening. On the other hand, in extracting blood from the forearm, it is preferable to bulge the skin by suction, as noted above. For this purpose, it is preferable to use a front end cover with a relatively large opening. Further, when a lancing apparatus having a manual suction mechanism is used, the positional relationship between the lancing apparatus and the skin is likely to deviate due to the vibration of the lancing apparatus during the suction. To perform stable lancing operation by preventing such deviation, the adhesion between the front end cover and the skin need be enhanced. Also for this purpose, it is preferable to use a front end cover with a relatively large opening.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As noted above, it is preferable to use a front end cover with a relatively small opening for the blood extraction from the fingertip, whereas it is preferable to use a front end cover with a relatively large opening for the blood extraction from the forearm. In the conventional lancing apparatus, however, the size of the opening of the front end cover is fixed. Therefore, to properly perform both of the blood extraction from the fingertip and that from the forearm, the user need to prepare a plurality of lancing apparatuses, i.e. one for the fingertip and one for the forearm, for example. Such preparation and use of a plurality of lancing apparatuses is inconvenient for the user and puts the financial burden on the user. However, with a single kind of lancing apparatus, proper blood extraction is possible only from a single particular portion, which is inconvenient.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In lancing the skin with a lancet by utilizing a lancing apparatus, it is desirable that the amount of lancing in the skin is adjustable for minimizing the pain the user feels and for preventing excessive or insufficient bleeding from the skin. For instance, WO97/04707 A1 discloses lancing assembly in which the lancing depth is adjustable. Specifically, the disclosed assembly includes an injector for launching a lancet, a cap attached to the injector and engageable with the lancet, a cover for coming into contact with the skin in lancing, and an adjuster for adjusting the distance between the cap and the cover. In this assembly, the distance between the cap and the cover is adjustable by turning the adjuster, whereby the lancing depth can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the lancing depth adjustment mechanism of the assembly requires three parts, i.e. the cap, the cover and the adjuster in addition to the injector. Such a large number of parts leads to an increase in the manufacturing cost. Moreover, in this assembly, the lancet is attached to the injector in a state separated from the assembly, and then the assembly is attached to the injector. Therefore, even when the lancing depth need be adjusted due to e.g. the change of the position to be lanced, the user may attach the assembly to the injector and launch the lancet without adjusting the lancing depth. In such a case, an excessive or insufficient amount of blood may be extracted or the user may suffer discomfort.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide a lancing apparatus which enables any user to properly extract blood from a selected portion without putting excessive financial burden on the user. Another object of the present invention is to provide a lancing apparatus which prevents the user from forgetting to perform the lancing depth adjustment and which is advantageous in terms of cost.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a lancing apparatus comprising an apparatus body including a housing and a movable member for advancing a needle, the movable member being arranged movably in the housing, and a plurality of front end covers each for coming into contact with a portion to be lanced in lancing. The plurality of front end covers have different structures adapted for lancing different portions and are removably attachable to a same portion of the apparatus body individually, and one of the front end covers suitable for the portion to be lanced is selected in use for attachment to the apparatus body.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">With this structure, the user can select and use a front end cover which is suitable for the portion which the user is to lance. Therefore, proper blood extraction from different portions is possible without the need for preparing a plurality of lancing apparatuses such as one for blood extraction from the forearm and one for blood extraction from the fingertip. This structure is not only convenient for the user but also reduces financial burden on the user, because preparation of a single lancing apparatus is sufficient. Further, the front end cover suitable for the portion to be lanced can be used just by selecting the cover, so that any user can perform stable blood extraction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a preferred embodiment, the lancing apparatus further comprises suction means for generating negative pressure in the front cover attached to the apparatus body. For instance, the front end covers include one having a through-hole for providing communication between the inside and the outside of the front end cover. Preferably, the plurality of front end covers include a first front end cover formed with a relatively large opening at an end for contacting a portion to be lanced, and a second front end cover formed with a relatively small opening at an end for contacting a portion to be lanced. In this case, it is preferable that the second front end cover is formed with a through-hole.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Since the above structure includes suction means, when blood is to be extracted from a portion which is unlikely to bleed (e.g. forearm), negative pressure can be applied to the portion by the suction means for promoting bleeding. In extracting blood from a portion which easily bleeds (e.g. fingertip), negative pressure may not be applied. When negative pressure is to be applied to the portion to be lanced, it is preferable to select and use the first front end cover having a relatively large opening. When the front end cover having a large opening is pressed against the portion to be lanced, the skin at that portion bulges, whereby the front end cover and the portion to be lanced contact closely with each other. Thus, the formation of a gap between the front end cover and the portion to be lanced can be prevented, so that the suction operation and the lancing operation can be performed reliably. When negative pressure is not applied to the portion to be lanced, it is preferable to use the second front end cover. Since the second front end cover has a relatively small opening, when the front end cover is pressed against the portion to be lanced, variations in the bulging degree among users due to variations of hardness of the skin at that portion are small. As a result, the positional relationship between the needle and the portion to be lanced can be made generally constant among the users, so that any user can perform the lancing operation properly.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The through-hole of the front end cover may have any configuration and may be formed at any position as long as it can provide communication between the inside and the outside of the second front end cover. Therefore, the through-hole referred to herein includes a cutout which is formed at the front end (the end for contacting the portion to be lanced) or the base end (the end to be attached to the apparatus body) of the second front cover and which opens in a direction crossing the hole-penetrating direction.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As noted above, the second front end cover is preferably used when negative pressure is not to be applied to the portion to be lanced. However, the user may erroneously apply negative pressure to the portion to be lanced while using the second front end cover. Even in such a case, the through-hole for providing communication between the inside and the outside allows air to flow into the second front end cover, whereby the application of large negative pressure to the portion to be lanced can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment, the first front end cover includes a controlling portion for controlling the degree of bulging of the portion to be lanced when the portion to be lanced is bulged by generating negative pressure in the front end cover by the suction means.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">With this structure, the bulging degree of the portion to be lanced during the suction can be made constant regardless of the softness of the portion to be lanced, so that the lancing operation can be performed reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a preferred embodiment, the lancing apparatus further comprises an operation casing accommodating the housing, and the operation casing is reciprocally movable axially of the housing relative to the housing. The suction means is capable of adjusting the negative pressure in accordance with the number of times of the reciprocal movement of the operation casing axially of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">With this structure, excess bleeding or insufficient bleeding from the lanced portion can be prevented by adjusting the negative pressure to be applied to that portion. Further, even when negative pressure is not duly generated due to insufficient contact between the front end cover and the portion to be lanced or airtightness is lost after the generation of negative pressure, intended negative pressure can be generated by moving the operation casing again.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a preferred embodiment, the lancing apparatus further comprises operation means for advancing the movable member, and after the movable member is advanced by operating the operation means, negative pressure generated by the suction means is relieved by further operating the operation means.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With this structure, when negative pressure is generated before the portion to be lanced is stuck by the needle, the negative pressure can be reliably applied to the portion until the sticking of the needle is completed. The relieving of negative pressure can be conveniently performed by utilizing the operation means for advancing the movable member.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a preferred embodiment, the movable member is provided with a first contact portion, whereas each of the front end covers is provided with a second contact portion for contacting the first contact portion for controlling movement of the movable member toward the front-end side.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this case, the lancing depth of the needle relative to the portion to be lanced is adjustable by selecting a contact position in the first contact portion or the second contact portion. With this arrangement, since the lancing depth in the portion to be lanced is adjustable, the user does not feel unnecessarily strong pain caused by unnecessarily large lancing depth. Further, since the lancing depth is adjustable in view of the portion to be lanced or the tendency to bleed of the user, excessive or insufficient bleeding can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The lancing depth adjustment function can be realized just by providing a first contact portion in the movable member of the apparatus body and providing a second contact portion in the front end cover. The lancing apparatus body and the front end covers are necessary for making the lancing apparatus even when the lancing depth adjustment function is not to be provided. The first and the second contact portions can be formed just by changing the configuration of the apparatus body and the front end cover. Therefore, the lancing depth adjustment function can be provided without increasing the number of parts of the apparatus. For example, when the movable member and the front end cover are formed by resin molding, the first and the second contact portions can be formed just by appropriately designing the configuration of the mold used for the resin molding. In this way, according to the present invention, the lancing depth adjustment function can be provided easily without increasing the number of parts of the apparatus, which is advantageous in terms of the manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, to reliably adjust the lancing depth, at least one of the first contact portion and the second contact portion includes a plurality of flat contact surfaces which differ from each other in distance from the front end surface of the selected front end cover when the front end cover is attached to the apparatus body. Alternatively, at least one of the first contact portion and the second contact portion includes a contact surface having a configuration providing a continuously varying distance between the contact surface and the front end surface of the front end cover. However, the first and the second contact surfaces may have any configuration as long as they can contact each other and adjust the lancing depth depending on the contacting portions.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a preferred embodiment, the apparatus body is provided with a reference mark, whereas each of the front end covers is provided with one or a plurality of lancing depth adjustment marks. The lancing depth of the needle in the portion to be lanced is adjustable by selecting an alignment state of the adjustment mark or the adjustment marks with the reference mark in attaching selected one of the front end covers to the apparatus body. For example, when a plurality of lancing depth adjustment marks are provided, the alignment state between the reference mark and the adjustment mark can be selected by selecting the adjustment mark to be aligned with the reference mark. When a single adjustment mark is provided, the alignment state can be selected by selecting the portion of the adjustment mark to be aligned with the reference mark.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">This structure is convenient, because the lancing depth can be adjusted in attaching the front end cover. The adjustment of the lancing depth can be performed easily just by selecting the alignment state between the reference mark and the adjustment mark.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a preferred embodiment, each of the front end covers includes a plurality of projections. The housing includes a guide portion for engaging at least one of the projections to control movement of the selected front end cover when the front end cover is attached to the apparatus body, and an engagement portion for engaging at least one of the projections when the front end cover is turned circumferentially relative to the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With this structure, the movement path of the projections of the front end cover is defined by the guide portion and the engagement portion, so that the front end cover can be reliably attached to the lancing apparatus body easily.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a preferred embodiment, at least one of the projections is positioned at the guide portion when the lancing depth adjustment mark or selected one of the lancing depth adjustment marks is aligned with the reference mark.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With this structure, the lancing depth of the lancing apparatus can be set to the depth selected by the user more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the lancing apparatus according of the present invention, the lancing depth of the needle in the portion to be lanced may be kept constant by causing the first contact portion to contact the second contact portion when the movable member is advanced. In such a case, the lancing operation providing stable lancing depth can be performed. In this case again, the first and the second contact portions may have any configuration as long as they can contact each other.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a preferred embodiment, the needle is incorporated in the apparatus body as an integral part of a lancet, and the lancet is mounted to the movable member in a state in which the front end cover is not attached to the apparatus body.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this case, the front end cover need be detached from the apparatus body before mounting the lancet and need be attached to the apparatus body after the lancet is mounted. Therefore, when a structure in which the lancing depth is to be adjusted in attaching the front end cover is employed, the selection of the lancing depth is necessary every time the lancet is mounted. With this arrangement in which the lancing depth is selected using the occasion of mounting the lancet, the lancing depth is set properly in each time of lancing, whereby just a sufficient amount of blood can be extracted without giving unnecessary pain to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a lancing apparatus with a lancing depth control function. The apparatus comprises an apparatus body including a housing and a movable member for advancing a needle, the movable member being arranged movably in the housing, and a front end cover attachable to the apparatus body for contacting a portion to be lanced in lancing. The movable member is provided with a first contact portion, whereas the front end cover is provided with a second contact portion for contacting the first contact portion for controlling the movement of the movable member toward the front-end side.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this structure, the lancing depth of the needle in the portion to be lanced is adjustable by selecting a contact position in the first contact portion or the second contact portion. The lancing depth adjustment mechanism in the present invention can be realized just by providing a first contact portion in the lancet holder of the apparatus body and providing a second contact portion in the front end cover. For example, as noted above, when the lancet holder and the front end cover are formed by resin molding, the first and the second contact portions can be formed just by appropriately designing the configuration of the mold used for the resin molding. In this way, the lancing depth adjustment mechanism can be provided easily with a smaller number of parts as compared with the prior art apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably, to reliably adjust the lancing depth, one of the first contact portion and the second contact portion may include a plurality of flat contact surfaces which differ from each other in distance from the front end surface of the selected front end cover when the front end cover is attached to the apparatus body. Alternatively, one of the first contact portion and the second contact portion includes a contact surface having a configuration providing a continuously varying distance between the contact surface and the front end surface of the front end cover. However, the first and the second contact surfaces may have any configuration as long as they can contact each other and adjust the lancing depth depending on the contacting portions.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a preferred embodiment, the front end cover is removably attachable to the apparatus body. The apparatus body is provided with a reference mark, whereas the front end cover is provided with one or a plurality of lancing depth adjustment marks. The lancing depth of the needle in the portion to be lanced is adjustable by selecting an alignment state of the adjustment mark or the adjustment marks with the reference mark in attaching the front end cover to the apparatus body.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">This structure is convenient, because the lancing depth is adjustable in attaching the front end cover. The adjustment of the lancing depth can be performed easily just by selecting the alignment state between the reference mark and the adjustment mark.</p>

The housing includes a guide portion for engaging at least one of the projections to control the movement of the front end cover when the front end cover is attached to the apparatus body with the lancing depth adjustment mark or the lancing depth adjustment marks aligned with the reference mark, and an engagement portion for engaging at least one of the projections when the front end cover is turned circumferentially relative to the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With this structure, the movement path of the projections of the front end cover is defined by the guide portion and the engagement portion, so that the front end cover can be reliably attached to the lancing apparatus body easily. Further, the intended lancing depth can be reliably selected easily.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a preferred embodiment, at least one of the projections is positioned at the guide portion when the lancing depth adjustment mark or selected one of the lancing depth adjustment marks is aligned with the reference mark.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With this structure, the lancing apparatus can be reliably set to the lancing depth selected by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a preferred embodiment, the needle is incorporated in the apparatus body as an integral part of a lancet, and the lancet is mounted to the lancet holder in a state in which the front end cover is not attached to the apparatus body.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this case, the front end cover need be detached from the apparatus body before mounting the lancet and need be attached to the apparatus body after the lancet is mounted.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lancing apparatus A in this embodiment includes an apparatus body <b>1</b>, a lancet <b>40</b>, a first front end cover <b>2</b> and a second front end cover <b>3</b>. The lancet <b>40</b> includes a main body <b>40</b><i>a </i>and a needle <b>40</b><i>b </i>projecting from the main body. The main body <b>40</b><i>a </i>may be made of a synthetic resin, for example. The needle <b>40</b><i>b </i>may be made of metal and integrally formed on the main body <b>40</b><i>a </i>by insert molding, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The first front end cover <b>2</b> has a structure for enabling proper blood extraction from a forearm, whereas the second front cover <b>3</b> has a structure for enabling proper blood extraction from a fingertip. Thus, the one which is suitable for the portion to be lanced is selected from the front end covers <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> and attached to the lancing apparatus body <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the state in which the first front end cover <b>2</b> is attached, whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the state in which the second front cover <b>3</b> is attached. Alternatively, three or more front end covers may be prepared, and one selected from these covers may be attached to the lancing apparatus body <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B, the first front cover <b>2</b> has a cylindrical configuration including a larger diameter portion <b>20</b> and a smaller diameter portion <b>21</b>. The larger diameter portion <b>20</b> has an outer circumferential surface formed with a plurality of projections <b>22</b> arranged at a predetermined pitch. Though not clearly shown in the figure, six projections <b>22</b> are provided in this embodiment. By bringing the projections <b>2</b> into engagement with a cover attach portion <b>51</b> or disengaging the projections from the cover attach portion which will be described later, the first front end cover <b>2</b> can be attached to or detached from a housing <b>5</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The smaller diameter portion <b>21</b> has an outer circumferential surface formed with a first through a third lancing depth adjustment marks <b>23</b><i>a</i>, <b>23</b><i>b </i>and <b>23</b><i>c</i>. These marks <b>23</b><i>a</i>-<b>23</b><i>c </i>are used for adjusting the lancing depth in attaching the first front end cover <b>2</b> to the apparatus body <b>1</b>. The adjustment marks <b>23</b><i>a</i>-<b>23</b><i>c </i>extend axially of the smaller diameter portion <b>21</b> and different from each other in length. The smaller diameter portion <b>21</b> has an inner wall provided with first through third contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>and <b>24</b><i>c</i>, which differ from each other in distance from the front end <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the smaller diameter portion <b>21</b>. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, two contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>a</i>, two contact surface <b>24</b><i>b </i>and two contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>c </i>are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The front end of the first front end cover <b>2</b> is formed with an opening <b>21</b><i>b</i>. Generally, skin of the forearm is soft and unlikely to bleed. Therefore, to extract blood from the forearm, it is preferable to lance the skin in a sucked state or suck the skin after lancing. As will be described later, the lancing apparatus body <b>1</b> includes a pump mechanism <b>6</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>). To perform proper sucking of the skin using the pump mechanism <b>6</b> for proper bleeding from the forearm, the opening <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the first front end cover <b>2</b> is made relatively large. For example, the opening <b>21</b><i>b </i>may have a diameter of 1 to 3 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B, the second front cover <b>3</b> has a cylindrical configuration including a cylindrical portion <b>30</b> and a tapered portion <b>31</b>. The cylindrical portion <b>30</b> has an outer circumferential surface formed with a plurality of projections <b>32</b> arrange data predetermined pitch. Though not clearly shown in the figure, six projections <b>32</b> are provided in this embodiment. Similarly to the first front end cover <b>2</b>, the second front end cover <b>3</b> can be attached to or detached from the housing <b>5</b> by bringing the projections <b>32</b> into engagement with the cover attach portion <b>51</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) or disengaging the projections from the cover attach portion. The tapered portion <b>31</b> has an outer circumferential surface formed with a first through a third lancing depth adjustment marks <b>33</b><i>a</i>, <b>33</b><i>b </i>and <b>33</b><i>c</i>. These marks <b>33</b><i>a</i>-<b>33</b><i>c </i>are used for adjusting the lancing depth in attaching the second front end cover <b>3</b> to the lancing apparatus body <b>1</b> and different from each other in length. The tapered portion <b>31</b> has an inner wall provided with first through third contact surfaces <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>b </i>and <b>34</b><i>c</i>, which differ from each other in distance from the front end <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the tapered portion <b>31</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, two contact surfaces <b>34</b><i>a</i>, two contact surface <b>34</b><i>b </i>and two contact surfaces <b>34</b><i>c </i>are provided. The second front end cover <b>3</b> is further formed with a through-hole <b>35</b> for providing communication between the inside and outside of the second front end cover <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The front end of the second front end cover <b>3</b> is formed with an opening <b>31</b><i>b</i>. In extracting blood from the fingertip, if the opening <b>31</b><i>b </i>is large, the relative height of the skin surface is largely influenced by variations in the softness of skin or the manner of pressing the front end cover against the skin and hence cannot be kept so stable as in extracting blood from the forearm. Further, it is difficult to keep the cover stably in contact with the skin. Therefore, the adjustment of the lancing depth is difficult. On the other hand, unlike the forearm, the fingertip is likely to bleed so that the blood extraction from the fingertip does not require suction of the skin. Therefore, the opening <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the second front end cover <b>3</b> is made relatively small so that the adjustment of the lancing depth can be performed reliably for proper blood extraction from the fingertip. For example, the opening <b>31</b><i>b </i>may have a diameter of 0.2 to 1 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In this way, since selected one of the first front end cover <b>2</b> for the forearm and the second front end cover <b>3</b> for the fingertip can be removably attached to the apparatus body for use, blood can be extracted from either portion without separately preparing a lancing apparatus for blood extraction from the forearm and that for blood extraction from the fingertip. When the first front end cover <b>2</b> having a relatively large opening <b>21</b><i>b </i>is used in extracting blood from the forearm, the skin bulges when the front end cover <b>2</b> is pressed against the skin <b>94</b>, whereby the adhesion between the skin and the front end cover <b>2</b> is enhanced. Therefore, the formation of a gap between the first front end cover <b>2</b> and the skin <b>94</b> during the suction is prevented, so that stable suction can be performed. On the other hand, since the opening <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the second front end cover <b>3</b> is relatively small, when the second front end cover <b>3</b> is pressed against the skin <b>94</b>, variations in the bulging amount of the skin due to the variations of softness of the skin <b>94</b> are small. Therefore, the positional relationship between the needle <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the lancet <b>40</b> and the skin <b>94</b> can be made generally constant among the users, so that any user can perform the lancing operation properly.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the lancing apparatus body <b>1</b> is made up of a lancet holder <b>4</b> for holding the lancet <b>40</b>, the housing <b>5</b> accommodating the lancet holder <b>4</b>, the pump mechanism <b>6</b>, an operation casing <b>7</b> for operating the pump mechanism <b>6</b>, an operation cap <b>8</b> for advancing the lancet holder <b>4</b> and other parts which will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The housing <b>5</b> is made up of a main body <b>50</b> and the cover attach portion <b>51</b>. The main body <b>50</b> has an interiial space <b>50</b><i>a </i>for accommodating the lancet holder <b>40</b> and allowing the lancet holder to move reciprocally. The cover attach portion <b>51</b>, to which the front end cover <b>2</b> or <b>3</b> is to be attached, is provided at the front end of the main body <b>50</b>. As clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the cover attach portion <b>51</b> includes a base portion <b>51</b>A integrally toured on the main body <b>50</b>, and two engagement pieces <b>51</b>B and two guide pieces <b>51</b>C extending from the base portion. The two engagement pieces <b>51</b>B face each other while interposing the main body <b>50</b> therebetween, so do the two guide pieces <b>51</b>C. The engagement pieces <b>51</b>B and the guide pieces <b>51</b>C are spaced from the main body <b>50</b>. Between each of the engagement pieces <b>51</b>B and the adjacent one of the guide pieces <b>51</b>C is provided a recess. In attaching the first or the second front end cover <b>2</b> or <b>3</b>, the projection <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> of the front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> is positioned at this portion to guide the end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. Each of the engagement pieces <b>51</b>B is formed with a cutout <b>51</b><i>b </i>for engaging the projection <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> of the front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. The front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> is attached to the housing <b>5</b> by bringing the projection <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> into engagement with the cutout <b>51</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The housing <b>5</b> may be formed of a single member or by combining a plurality of parts. An O-ring may be attached to the cover attach portion <b>51</b> so that the adhesion between the first or the second front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and the housing <b>5</b> is enhanced when the front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> is attached to the housing <b>5</b>. For example, the O-ring may be interposed between the upper end surface of the first or the second front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and the base portion <b>51</b>A of the cover attach portion <b>51</b> or between the inner surface of the first or the second front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> and the outer surface of the housing <b>5</b>. With this arrangement, enhanced airtightness is provided in the front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> when the front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> is brought into contact with the skin. The O-ring may be attached to the front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. Alternatively, the cover attach portion <b>51</b> may be dispensed with, and the first or the second front cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> may be rotatably attached to the housing <b>5</b> via an O-ring.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The lancet holder <b>4</b> is elongate in the direction indicated by arrows N<b>1</b>, N<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and advances toward the front end of the housing <b>5</b> (in the N<b>1</b> direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) when the operation cap <b>8</b> is pressed. The lancet holder <b>4</b> has a front end <b>41</b> formed with a recess <b>41</b><i>a </i>and a pair of projections <b>41</b><i>b</i>. The recess <b>41</b><i>a </i>serves to hold the lancet <b>40</b>. When the lancet holder <b>4</b> is moved toward the front-end side, the paired projections <b>41</b><i>b </i>come into selective engagement with the first through the third contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>c</i>, <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<b>34</b><i>c </i>of the first or the second front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. This engagement prevents further advance of the lancet holder <b>4</b>, whereby the front end position of the needle <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the lancet <b>40</b> is determined. In this way, the front end position of the needle <b>40</b><i>b</i>, i.e., the lancing depth can be adjusted by selecting which of the contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>c</i>, <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<b>34</b><i>c </i>to come into engagement with the projections <b>41</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Specifically, in using the first front end cover <b>2</b> for example, the insertion depth of the needle <b>40</b><i>b </i>in the skin <b>94</b> becomes smallest when the projections <b>41</b><i>b </i>are brought into engagement with the third contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>c </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> and largest when the projections <b>41</b><i>b </i>are brought into engagement with the first contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. When the projections <b>41</b><i>b </i>are brought into engagement with the second contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, the insertion depth of the needle <b>40</b><i>b </i>in the skin <b>94</b> becomes medium. In attaching the front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> as will be described later, the user can select which of the contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>c</i>, <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<b>34</b><i>c </i>are to be brought into engagement with the projections <b>41</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">For realizing the advance movement of the lancet holder, any conventionally known means may be utilized. In this embodiment, the means as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is utilized, which will be described below. The lancet holder <b>4</b> includes a plurality of latch pawls <b>42</b>. By bringing the latch pawls <b>42</b> into engagement with a stepped portion <b>52</b> provided in the housing <b>5</b>, the lancet holder is latched at a predetermined position in the housing <b>5</b>. The engagement of the latch pawls <b>42</b> with the stepped portion <b>52</b> can be performed by pushing the lancet holder <b>4</b> from the front end side of the housing <b>5</b> toward the base end side.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The operation cap <b>8</b> is slidably fitted in the operation casing <b>7</b>. When the operation cap <b>8</b> is pushed in the direction indicated by the arrow N<b>1</b>, a push rod <b>90</b> engaging the operation cap <b>8</b> advances while compressing a lancet-holder-advancing spring <b>91</b> to eventually push the latch pawls <b>42</b>. When pushed by the push rod <b>90</b>, the latch pawls <b>42</b> are released from the engaged state (latched state) with the stepped portion <b>52</b>. As a result, the lancet holder <b>4</b> advances quickly in the direction of the arrow N<b>1</b> due to the resilient force of the spring <b>91</b>. The advance movement of the lancet holder <b>4</b> is inhibited when the projections <b>41</b><i>b </i>engage the contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>c</i>, <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<b>34</b><i>c </i>(See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10C</figref>). After the projections <b>41</b><i>b </i>engage the contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>c</i>, <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<b>34</b><i>c</i>, the lancet holder <b>4</b> retreats by an appropriate amount due to the resilient force of a spring <b>92</b> provided in the housing <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The push rod <b>90</b> has an outer circumferential surface formed with a recess <b>90</b><i>a </i>for air passage. Thus, when the push rod <b>90</b> advances over a predetermined distance, the internal space <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>5</b> communicates with the outside through the recess <b>90</b><i>a</i>. Specifically, the push rod <b>90</b> is hermetically fitted in a cylindrical portion <b>54</b> provided at the base end of the housing <b>5</b> to be slidable in the cylindrical portion, so that normally, communication through the recess <b>90</b><i>a </i>is not provided between the internal space <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>5</b> and the outside. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, when the operation cap <b>8</b> is further pushed by a predetermined amount after the lancet holder <b>4</b> is advanced by pushing the operation cap <b>8</b>, part of the recess <b>90</b><i>a </i>is located in the internal space <b>50</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, communication through the recess <b>90</b><i>a </i>is provided between the internal space <b>50</b><i>a </i>and the outside of the housing <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The operation casing <b>7</b> serves to operate the pump mechanism <b>6</b> and has a cylindrical configuration surrounding the housing <b>5</b> and the pump mechanism <b>6</b>. The operation casing <b>7</b> is reciprocally movable longitudinally of the housing <b>5</b>, i.e. in the direction indicated by the arrows N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the operation casing <b>7</b> has an outer surface formed with a reference mark <b>70</b>. The reference mark <b>70</b> is utilized for setting the lancing depth in attaching the first or the second front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> to the housing <b>5</b>. Specifically, the lancing depth becomes smallest (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>) when the shortest adjustment mark <b>23</b><i>c </i>or <b>33</b><i>c </i>is aligned with the reference mark <b>70</b>, whereas the lancing depth becomes largest (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>) when the longest adjustment mark <b>23</b><i>a </i>or <b>33</b><i>a </i>is aligned with the reference mark. When the adjustment mark <b>23</b><i>b </i>or <b>33</b><i>b </i>of the medium length is aligned with the reference mark, the lancing depth becomes the medium (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the pump mechanism <b>6</b> includes a cylinder <b>61</b> defining therein a pressure chamber <b>60</b>, a plunger <b>62</b> slidably fitted in the cylinder <b>61</b>, a first check valve <b>63</b>A, a second check valve <b>63</b>B, and a spring <b>64</b> for returning. The plunger <b>62</b> is fixed to a first support plate <b>54</b><i>a </i>projecting from the main body <b>50</b> of the housing <b>5</b>. The cylinder <b>61</b> is reciprocally movable relative to the housing <b>5</b> and the plunger <b>62</b> in the direction indicated by the arrows N<b>1</b>, N<b>2</b>. The cylinder <b>61</b> is provided, at the base end thereof (upper portion in the figure), with a flange <b>61</b><i>a </i>engaging a projection <b>70</b> of the operation casing <b>7</b>. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when the operation casing <b>7</b> is moved downward in the direction of the arrow N<b>1</b>, the cylinder <b>61</b> also moves downward to increase the capacity of the pressure chamber <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the spring <b>64</b> for returning, which may be a compression spring, is interposed between a second support plate <b>54</b><i>b </i>projecting from the main body <b>50</b> of the housing <b>5</b> and the flange <b>61</b><i>a </i>of the cylinder <b>61</b>. When the cylinder <b>61</b> moves downward in the direction of the arrow N<b>1</b> following the movement of the operation casing <b>7</b>, the spring <b>64</b> is compressed between the flange <b>61</b><i>a </i>and the second support plate <b>54</b><i>b </i>to produce a resilient force to move the cylinder <b>61</b> and the operation casing <b>7</b> upward.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The first check valve <b>63</b>A serves to open or close an air outlet <b>66</b> formed at the front end of the cylinder <b>61</b>. The first check valve allows the air discharge from within the pressure chamber <b>60</b> to the outside of the pressure chamber <b>60</b> through the air outlet <b>66</b> but prevents the air flow in the reverse direction. The plunger <b>62</b> is hollow and has a through-hole <b>62</b><i>a</i>. The plunger <b>62</b> has a front end formed with an air inlet <b>65</b>. The second check valve <b>63</b>B serves to open or close the air inlet <b>65</b>. The second check valve allows air to flow into the pressure chamber <b>60</b> through the through-hole <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the plunger <b>62</b>, but prevents the air flow in the reverse direction. The through-hole <b>62</b><i>a </i>communicates with the internal space <b>50</b><i>a </i>in the housing <b>5</b> via an air path <b>93</b> formed between the base end of the plunger <b>62</b> and the first support plate <b>54</b> of the housing <b>5</b>. The internal space <b>50</b><i>a </i>is so designed as to provide communication between a portion adjacent the air path <b>93</b> and the front end opening <b>50</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>5</b>. Therefore, when a negative pressure is produced in the pressure chamber <b>60</b> of the pump mechanism <b>6</b>, the negative pressure is exerted onto the front end opening <b>50</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>5</b> and hence onto the inside of the front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The usage and advantages of the lancing apparatus A will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">To perform the lancing operation, after the lancet <b>40</b> is mounted to the lancet holder <b>4</b>, selected one of the first and the second front end covers <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> is attached, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. Preferably, the first front end cover <b>2</b> is selected in extracting blood from the forearm, whereas the second front end cover <b>3</b> is selected in extracting blood from the fingertip. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> show an example in which the first front end cover <b>2</b> is to be attached, and hereinafter, description will be made mainly as to this example.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The mounting of the lancet <b>40</b> is performed by fitting the main body <b>40</b><i>a </i>of the lancet <b>40</b> into the recess <b>41</b><i>a </i>(See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) from the side opposite to the needle <b>40</b><i>b</i>. At this time, the latch pawls <b>42</b> of the lancet holder <b>4</b> may be brought into engagement with the stepped portion <b>52</b> of the housing <b>5</b> to provide the latched state. Alternatively, the latching operation may be provided separately from the operation for mounting the lancet <b>40</b>. Specifically, the latched state may be provided before the lancet <b>40</b> is mounted. The attachment of the first front end cover <b>2</b> is performed by three process steps, i.e. the setting of the lancing depth, the provisional attachment of the first front end cover <b>2</b> and the fixation of the first front end cover <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The setting of the lancing depth is performed by aligning the adjustment mark <b>23</b><i>a</i>-<b>23</b><i>c </i>corresponding to the lancing depth intended by the user with the reference mark <b>70</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the provisional attachment of the first front end cover <b>2</b> is performed by fitting the first front end cover <b>2</b> around the front end of the lancet holder <b>4</b> with the selected adjustment mark <b>23</b><i>a</i>-<b>23</b><i>c </i>aligned with the reference mark. In this aligned state, the projections <b>22</b> of the first front end cover <b>2</b> are positioned in the recess between the engagement piece <b>51</b>B and the guide piece <b>51</b>C, as indicated by phantom lines in the figure. When none of the adjustment marks <b>23</b><i>a</i>-<b>23</b><i>c </i>is aligned with the reference mark <b>70</b>, the projections <b>22</b> cannot be positioned in the recess so that the provisional attachment of the first front end cover <b>2</b> to the lancet holder <b>4</b> cannot be performed. The subsequent fixation of the first front end cover <b>2</b> is performed by turning the first front end cover <b>2</b> fitted around the front end of the lancet holder <b>4</b> in the circumferential direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. By the turning of the first front end cover <b>2</b>, the projection <b>22</b> positioned in the recess fits into the cutout <b>51</b><i>b</i>. As a result, the front end cover <b>2</b> is fixed to the housing <b>5</b>, thereby realizing the state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example in which the adjustment mark <b>23</b><i>c </i>is aligned with the reference mark <b>70</b>. In this case, the projections <b>41</b><i>b </i>of the lancet holder <b>4</b> are located directly above the third contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>c </i>so that the projections <b>41</b><i>b </i>come into contact with the third contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>c </i>when the lancet holder is moved toward the front-end side.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Similarly to the first front end cover <b>2</b>, the second front end cover <b>3</b> is provided with projections <b>32</b> and adjustment marks <b>33</b><i>a</i>-<b>33</b><i>c</i>, as clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B. Therefore, the attachment of the second front cover <b>3</b> to the housing <b>5</b> can be performed similarly to the attachment of the first front end cover <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the state in which the second front end cover <b>3</b> is attached to the housing <b>5</b>. Specifically, this figure exemplarily illustrates the state in which the adjustment mark <b>33</b><i>c </i>is aligned with the reference mark <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Subsequently, the lancing operation is performed. In extracting blood from the forearm using the first front end cover <b>2</b>, it is preferable to apply negative pressure to the skin <b>94</b> before lancing the skin. In extracting blood from the fingertip using the second front end cover <b>3</b>, it is not necessary to purposely apply negative pressure on the skin <b>94</b>, because the fingertip is likely to bleed.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">To apply negative pressure to the skin <b>94</b>, with the front end of the first front end cover <b>2</b> pressed against the skin <b>94</b>, the operation casing <b>7</b> is pushed downward in the direction of the arrow N<b>1</b> for movement relative to the first front end cover <b>2</b> and the housing <b>5</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. This operation causes the cylinder <b>61</b> to move downward relative to the plunger <b>62</b>, thereby increasing the capacity of the pressure chamber <b>60</b>. Therefore, the interior of the pressure chamber <b>60</b> undergoes a pressure drop, and the second check valve <b>63</b>B opens. As a result, the air flows from the internal space <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>5</b> into the pressure chamber <b>60</b> through the air path <b>93</b> and the through-hole <b>62</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, negative pressure is generated in the first front end cover <b>2</b>, which can be applied to the skin <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">After the operation casing <b>7</b> is pushed downward, the operation casing <b>7</b> and the cylinder <b>61</b> can be easily returned to the original position by utilizing the resilient force of the spring <b>64</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, when the operation casing <b>7</b> and the cylinder <b>61</b> return upward in the direction of the arrow N<b>2</b>, the capacity of the pressure chamber <b>60</b> reduces. Therefore, the second check valve <b>63</b>B closes, whereas the first check valve <b>63</b>A opens. Therefore, when the cylinder <b>61</b> returns to the original position, the air in the pressure chamber <b>60</b> can be properly discharged to the outside through the air outlet <b>66</b> while maintaining the internal space <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>5</b> under negative pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this way, the internal space <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>5</b> can be maintained under negative pressure in returning the operation casing <b>7</b> and the cylinder <b>61</b> to the original position. Therefore, when the operation casing <b>7</b> is pushed downward again thereafter, the internal space <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>5</b> further undergoes a pressure drop, thereby increasing the negative pressure (lower the absolute pressure) in the internal space <b>50</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, in the lancing apparatus A, negative pressure to be applied to the skin <b>94</b> can be adjusted appropriately by increasing or decreasing the number of times of the reciprocal movement of the operation casing <b>7</b>. When negative pressure is not duly generated due to the insufficient adhesion of the first front end cover <b>2</b> to the skin <b>94</b> or when airtightness is lost after negative pressure is generated, intended negative pressure can be generated by moving the operation casing <b>7</b> again. Therefore, excessive bleeding or insufficient bleeding from the skin <b>94</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As noted above, in extracting blood from the fingertip using the second front end cover <b>3</b>, negative pressure need not be applied to the skin <b>94</b>. However, the user may erroneously move the operation casing <b>7</b> upward or downward. Even in such a case, since the second front end cover <b>3</b> is formed with the through-hole <b>35</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7A</figref>, air flows from the outside into the front end cover <b>3</b> through the through-hole <b>35</b>. Therefore, negative pressure is not generated in the second front end cover <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Subsequently, to lance the skin with the lancet <b>40</b>, the operation cap <b>8</b> is pushed downward in the direction of the arrow N<b>1</b> to release the latched state of the lancet holder <b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. As a result, the lancet holder <b>4</b> advances due to the resilient force of the spring <b>91</b> so that the lancet <b>40</b> lances the skin <b>94</b>. At this time, the projections <b>41</b><i>b </i>come into contact with the contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>or <b>24</b><i>c </i>corresponding to the lancing depth selected by the user, so that the lancing amount of the needle <b>40</b><i>b </i>into the skin <b>94</b> is controlled. In the example shown in this figure, the projections <b>41</b><i>b </i>are brought into contact with the third contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>c</i>. After the lancet <b>40</b> sticks in the skin <b>94</b>, the lancet holder <b>4</b> retreats due to the resilient force of the spring <b>92</b>, so that the lancet <b>40</b> is immediately pulled out from the skin <b>94</b>. Since the negative pressure previously generated is applied to the skin <b>94</b>, bleeding from the portion lanced by the lancet <b>40</b> is promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, when the operation cap <b>8</b> is further pushed downward in the direction of the arrow N<b>1</b>, the internal space <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>5</b> communicates with the outside through the recess <b>90</b><i>a </i>of the push rod <b>90</b>, and air flows into the internal space <b>50</b><i>a </i>through the recess <b>90</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the internal space <b>50</b><i>a </i>returns to the atmospheric pressure. In this state, the first front end cover <b>2</b> can be easily removed from the skin <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In the lancing apparatus A, the negative pressure applied to the skin <b>94</b> cannot be relieved unless the operation cap <b>8</b> is further pushed after the skin <b>94</b> is lanced with the lancet <b>40</b> by the operation of the operation cap <b>8</b>. Thus, since the negative pressure applied to the skin <b>94</b> is not relieved erroneously before the lancet <b>40</b> sticks in the skin, the lancing of the skin can be performed with the skin <b>94</b> bulged and good blood circulation maintained. Moreover, both of the sticking of the lancet <b>40</b> and the relieving of negative pressure can be successively performed easily by pushing the operation cap <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The lancing depth adjustment function of the lancing apparatus A is realized just by providing projections <b>41</b><i>b </i>in the lancet holder <b>4</b> of the lancing apparatus body <b>1</b> and providing contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>c</i>, <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<b>34</b><i>c </i>in the first and the second front end covers <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. The lancing apparatus body <b>1</b> and the front end covers <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are necessary for making the lancing apparatus even when the lancing depth adjustment function is not to be provided. The lancing depth adjustment function of the lancing apparatus A can be provided just by changing the configuration of these parts. For example, when the lancet holder <b>4</b> and the first and the second front end covers <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are formed by resin molding, the projections <b>41</b><i>b </i>and the contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>c</i>, <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<b>34</b><i>c </i>can be formed just by appropriately designing the configuration of the mold used for the resin molding. In this way, in the lancing apparatus A, the lancing depth adjustment function can be provided easily without increasing the number of parts of the apparatus, which is advantageous in terms of the manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In the lancing apparatus A, the first or the second front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> need be detached from the apparatus body <b>1</b> before mounting the lancet <b>40</b> and attached to the apparatus body <b>1</b> after the lancet <b>40</b> is mounted. Therefore, the necessity for selecting the lancing depth occurs every time the lancet <b>40</b> is to be mounted. This structure in which the lancing depth is to be selected on the occasion of mounting the lancet <b>40</b> prevents the user from forgetting to perform the lancing depth adjustment. Therefore, the apparatus is set to an appropriate lancing depth every time the lancing operation is to be performed, so that just a sufficient amount of blood can be extracted without giving unnecessary pain to the user. Moreover, in addition to the convenience provided by the adjustment of the lancing depth in attaching the first or the second front end cover <b>2</b> or <b>3</b>, the adjustment of the lancing depth can be performed by the easy operation of aligning the reference mark <b>70</b> with adjustment marks <b>23</b><i>a</i>-<b>23</b><i>c</i>, <b>33</b><i>a</i>-<b>33</b><i>c</i>, which also provides convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the above-described examples, the skin <b>94</b> is lanced with the lancet <b>40</b> after negative pressure is generated in the internal space <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>5</b>. However, with the lancing apparatus A, these operations may be performed in the reverse order. Specifically, the skin may be lanced with the lancet <b>40</b> by pushing the operation cap <b>8</b>, and then negative pressure may be applied to the portion lanced by the lancet <b>40</b> by operating the operation casing <b>7</b>. In the lancing apparatus A, the front end of the first or the second front end cover <b>2</b> or <b>3</b> massages the skin <b>94</b> when the operation casing <b>7</b> is moved reciprocally for generating negative pressure, so that the blood circulation in the skin <b>94</b> is further promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the lancing apparatus A, negative pressure is generated when the operation casing <b>7</b> is pushed downward. Alternatively, the apparatus may be so structured that negative pressure is generated when the operation casing <b>7</b> retreats or by using an electric motor. Since negative pressure need not necessarily be generated in the first or the second front end cover <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, the pump mechanism or the electric pump may be dispensed with.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiments. Specific structure of each part of the lancing apparatus of the present invention may be modified in various ways. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, the lancet holder <b>4</b> may be provided with a single projection <b>41</b><i>b </i>or no less than three projections depending on the number or size of the contact surfaces. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17B and 17C</figref>, the projection <b>41</b><i>b</i>′ may project radially of the lancet holder <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the first front end cover <b>2</b> may be formed with a sloping contact surface <b>24</b> instead of the first through the third flat contact surfaces <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<b>24</b><i>c </i>(See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). In this case, it is preferable that the projection <b>41</b><i>b</i>″ has a configuration corresponding to the contact surface <b>24</b>. Similarly, the second front cover <b>3</b> may be formed with a sloping contact surface instead of the first through the third flat contact surfaces <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<b>34</b><i>c </i>(See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">For the adjustment of the lancing depth, the front end of the lancet holder <b>4</b> may be formed with contact surfaces <b>48</b><i>a</i>-<b>48</b><i>c </i>or <b>48</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref>, whereas the inner wall of the first front end cover <b>2</b> may be formed with projections <b>28</b> extending radially inwardly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref>. In this case, the second front end cover <b>3</b> need be formed with similar projections, though not illustrated in the figure.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-21D</figref>, only a single lancing depth adjustment mark may be provided. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> illustrates an adjustment mark <b>23</b>A whose dimension in the axial direction of the first front end cover <b>2</b> changes continuously. This adjustment mark is provided with a plurality of projections <b>23</b><i>a</i>′, <b>23</b><i>b</i>′, <b>23</b><i>c</i>′, <b>23</b><i>a</i>″, <b>23</b><i>b</i>″ and <b>23</b><i>c</i>″ spaced from each other. The projections <b>23</b><i>a</i>′-<b>23</b><i>c</i>′ and <b>23</b><i>a</i>″-<b>23</b><i>c</i>″ of the adjustment mark <b>23</b>A function similarly to the ends of the adjustment marks <b>23</b><i>a</i>-<b>23</b><i>c </i>(See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>). Thus, the lancing depth can be adjusted by attaching the first front end cover <b>2</b> while aligning the projections <b>23</b><i>a</i>′-<b>23</b><i>c</i>′, <b>23</b><i>a</i>″-<b>23</b><i>c</i>″ with the reference mark <b>70</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref> illustrates an adjustment mark <b>23</b>B whose dimension in the axial direction of the first front end cover <b>2</b> varies continuously. The adjustment mark <b>23</b>B is suitable for such a structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, in which a sloping contact surface is provided for realizing stepless adjustment of the lancing depth. For example, when the dimension of the adjustment mark <b>23</b>B in the axial direction is made proportional to the lancing depth, the user can adjust the lancing depth as desired by aligning the reference mark <b>70</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) with a dimensional position corresponding to an intended lancing depth in attaching the first front end cover <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref>, an adjustment mark <b>23</b>C formed with projections <b>23</b>Ca, <b>23</b>Cb and <b>23</b>Cc only at one edge thereof may be employed. Alternatively, instead of the projections, the adjustment mark may be formed with recesses <b>23</b>Da, <b>23</b>Db, <b>23</b>Dc, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21D</figref>. The configuration of the adjustment mark is not limited to the illustrated ones. Although the first front end cover <b>2</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-21D</figref>, the second front end cover <b>2</b> may also be provided with a single lancing depth adjustment mark.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</figref>, the first front end cover <b>2</b> may be provided with a rib <b>29</b>. The rib <b>29</b> serves to control the bulging amount of the skin to a certain level when the skin bulges due to negative pressure. Therefore, by the provision of the rib <b>29</b>, the bulging degree of the skin during the suction can be stabilized, so that lancing can be performed reliably. Although the annular rib <b>29</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</figref>, the rib may have any other configuration as long as it can control the bulging amount of the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The present invention is not limited to a lancing apparatus including a lancet holder for holding the lancet, but is applicable to such a structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, in which a needle <b>40</b><i>b</i>′ is integrally formed on a movable member <b>4</b>′ corresponding to the lancet holder.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>, the present invention is also applicable to a structure in which the lancet <b>40</b> is held by a front end cover <b>80</b> for advance movement due to the pushing force of a hammer <b>81</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A and 24B</figref>, the front end cover <b>80</b> is provided with first through third contact surfaces <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i>, which differ from each other in distance from the front end surface. The front end of the hammer <b>81</b> is formed with a plate-like contact portion <b>81</b><i>a </i>for contact with surfaces selected from the first through third contact surfaces <b>82</b><i>a</i>-<b>82</b><i>c</i>. The front end of the front end cover <b>80</b> accommodates a coil spring <b>83</b>, and the lancet <b>40</b> is held movably relative to the front end cover <b>80</b> while engaging the coil spring <b>83</b>. The hammer <b>81</b> is moved by the latch mechanism described above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24C</figref>, when the hammer <b>81</b> is released from the latched state, the hammer <b>81</b> moves toward the front-end side to come into contact with an end of the lancet <b>40</b>, thereby pushing the lancet toward the front-end side. The movement of the hammer <b>81</b> is inhibited when the hammer comes into contact with selected ones of the first through the third contact surfaces <b>82</b><i>a</i>-<b>82</b><i>c</i>. As a result, the movement of the lancet <b>40</b> toward the front end side is inhibited. Thus, the lancing depth in the skin <b>94</b> can be adjusted by selecting, from the first through the third contact surfaces <b>82</b><i>a</i>-<b>82</b><i>c</i>, the surfaces to come into contact with the hammer <b>81</b>. Thereafter, the lancet <b>40</b> moves in the reverse direction due to the resilient force of the coil spring <b>83</b>, whereby the needle <b>40</b><i>b </i>is pulled out from the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, a leaf spring <b>83</b>′ may be employed instead of the coil spring so that the lancet <b>40</b> after the lancing is removed from the skin due to the resilient force of the leaf spring <b>83</b>′. The leaf spring <b>83</b>′ may be formed integrally on the front end cover <b>80</b> as shown in the figure or may be formed separately from the front end cover <b>80</b> and attached to the front end cover <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In the foregoing embodiments, description is made of a structure in which the lancing depth is adjustable. However, in lancing, a first contact portion provided in a movable member such as a lancet holder may be brought into contact with a second contact portion provided in a front end cover, thereby keeping the lancing depth of the needle in the skin constant. This arrangement enables the lancing operation with stable lancing depth. In this case, when the front end cover is to be attached to the cover attach portion <b>51</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the front end cover may be provided with one or a plurality of positioning marks (corresponding to the lancing depth adjustment marks <b>23</b><i>a</i>-<b>23</b><i>c</i>, <b>33</b><i>a</i>-<b>33</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). With this structure, the front end cover can be attached while properly positioning the projections (corresponding to the reference signs <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) at the recess of the cover attach portion <b>51</b>. The first and the second contact portions may have any configuration as long as they can engage with each other.</p>
