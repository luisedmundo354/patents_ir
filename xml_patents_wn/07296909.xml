<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to handheld flashlights and particularly relates to flashlights that can be disposed in an upright, self-supporting position. This invention also relates to flashlights that utilize battery sources disposed in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Connecting flashlight batteries in parallel rather than series circuits has the potential to extend the flashlight's battery life. However, conventional flashlights typically do not utilize such parallel circuits because batteries arranged in parallel tend to charge/discharge each other, which significantly reduces the flashlight's battery life. To combat the disadvantageous discharge, U.S. Pat. No. 6,181,067 discloses a flashlight that utilizes switches disposed in series with each of the parallel batteries. When the switches are opened, the batteries become electrically isolated from each other such that they do not discharge each other. Closing the switches electrically connects the batteries to the flashlight's light source in parallel. Such a flashlight requires extra parts. Moreover, the parallel batteries still discharge each other whenever the flashlight is on because the parallel batteries become electrically connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is known to provide mechanisms that hold flashlight in self-supporting upright positions to free an operator's hands. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,541,822 discloses a flashlight with a support clip to hold the flashlight in an upright position. Unfortunately, since the clip is small relative to the flashlight, the clip cannot stably support the flashlight. U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,452 discloses a flashlight with legs that expand into a tripod position to support the flashlight in an upright position. Unfortunately, the legs make the flashlight cumbersome and bulky. Other known mechanisms for holding a flashlight in a self-supporting upright position are bulky, complex, and render the flashlight cumbersome to operate.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> illustrate a hand-held flashlight <b>10</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the flashlight <b>10</b> comprises a head <b>20</b>, a body portion <b>30</b>, and three legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the head <b>20</b> includes a light source <b>100</b>, a reflector well <b>110</b>, and a clear cover <b>120</b>. The illustrated light source <b>100</b> includes a plurality of light emitting diodes (LEDs) <b>100</b><i>a, </i>but may alternatively comprise any other suitable light(s) (e.g., halogen, incandescent, florescent, etc.). The reflector well <b>110</b> is a multi-lobe reflector well. The clear cover <b>120</b> includes a plurality of discrete lenses formed therein, one for each of the LEDs <b>100</b><i>a. </i>The head <b>20</b> and light source <b>100</b> define an illumination direction <b>140</b> along which light generated by the light source <b>100</b> generally projects.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the head <b>20</b> pivotally connects to the body portion <b>30</b> for relative pivotal movement about a head pivot axis <b>160</b> that is generally perpendicular to the illumination direction <b>140</b>. While the illustrated movable connection between the head <b>20</b> and body portion <b>30</b> comprises a pivotal connection, the movable connection may alternatively comprise any other suitable movable connection that allows an operator to adjust or redirect the illumination direction relative to the body portion <b>30</b> without deviating from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the head <b>20</b> includes a frictional surface feature <b>170</b> that mates with a corresponding frictional surface feature <b>180</b> disposed on the body portion <b>30</b> to resist pivotal movement of the head <b>20</b> relative to the body portion <b>30</b> about the head pivot axis <b>160</b>. The illustrated surface feature <b>170</b> comprises two resiliently deformable paws disposed on the head <b>20</b>. The illustrated surface feature <b>180</b> comprises a spur gear with teeth <b>180</b><i>a </i>that mate with the paws <b>170</b>. To pivot the head <b>20</b>, an operator must apply sufficient pivoting force to overcome the frictional resistance between the paws <b>170</b> and toothed spur gear <b>180</b>. Each tooth <b>180</b><i>a </i>provides a positive pivotal position for the head <b>20</b> such that the head <b>20</b> pivots in finite intervals. Interaction between the paws <b>170</b> and the teeth <b>180</b><i>a </i>may provide a satisfying clicking sound as the paws jump between adjacent teeth <b>180</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">While the illustrated surface features <b>170</b>, <b>180</b> comprise paws and teeth <b>180</b><i>a, </i>any other suitable frictionally engageable surface features may alternatively be used. For example, the surface features <b>170</b>, <b>180</b> may comprise mating flat high-friction surfaces such as rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> pivotally connect to the body portion <b>30</b> for relative pivotal movement about leg axes <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, respectively. The leg axes <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> are each generally perpendicular to a longitudinal flashlight axis <b>230</b> defined by the body portion <b>30</b>. The legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> pivot relative to the body portion <b>30</b> between open positions (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and closed positions (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, physical interference between abutting surfaces <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>a </i>of the body portion <b>30</b> and the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, respectively prevent the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> from pivoting beyond their open positions.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> form a tripod to support the head <b>20</b> in an elevated position when the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> are in their open positions. An operator may rest the opened flashlight <b>10</b> on a relatively flat surface and pivot the head <b>20</b> about the head pivot axis <b>160</b> to aim the head <b>20</b> in a variety of desired directions (e.g., horizontally, upwardly, downwardly, etc.). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the pivotal range of the head <b>20</b> relative to the body portion <b>30</b> is preferably greater than 90 degrees so that the head <b>20</b> can aim the illumination direction <b>140</b> downwardly toward the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> are in their closed positions, they form a longitudinally elongated flashlight handle <b>250</b> that defines a flashlight handle axis <b>260</b> that is parallel to, and preferably concentric with the longitudinal flashlight axis <b>230</b>. The flashlight handle <b>250</b> is shaped and sized to be held by a hand of the operator as in conventional flashlights. When the flashlight <b>10</b> is used like a conventionally shaped flashlight, the head <b>20</b> may be pivoted about the head pivot axis <b>160</b> such that the illumination direction <b>140</b> is generally parallel to the flashlight handle axis <b>260</b>. When the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> are in their closed positions, the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> are preferably parallel to each other, the longitudinal flashlight axis <b>230</b>, and the flashlight handle axis <b>260</b>. The legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> are disposed adjacent to each other so that the overall flashlight handle <b>250</b> has an outer diameter that is small enough to allow an operator to comfortably grip it with one hand.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the body portion <b>30</b> includes a longitudinally elongated, rearwardly extending grip <b>280</b>. The legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> abut openings <b>280</b><i>a </i>in the grip <b>280</b> when the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> move into their closed positions. The grip <b>280</b> extends radially outwardly beyond the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> to provide a gripping surface for the operator to hold on to. The openings <b>280</b><i>a </i>preferably support the closed legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> against torsional movement and excessive inward pivotal movement. The grip <b>280</b> may be omitted without deviating from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> are equally spaced around the circumference of the body portion <b>30</b> (e.g., being spaced by 120 degrees from each other around the body portion <b>30</b>), but may alternatively be asymmetrically spaced without deviating from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the illustrated embodiment, the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> pivotally connect to the head <b>20</b> via the pivotal connections between the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> and the body portion <b>30</b>. Alternatively, the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> may directly pivotally connect to the head <b>20</b> without deviating from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the illustrated embodiment, all three legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> pivotally connect to the body portion <b>30</b>. Alternatively, one of the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, the leg <b>40</b>, for example, may be rigidly connected to or integrally formed with the body portion <b>30</b> such that only the other two legs <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> pivotally connect to the body portion <b>30</b>. In such an embodiment, opening the two legs <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> would nonetheless position the three legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> in a tripod. The body portion <b>30</b>, however, would be skewed relative to a vertical direction of the resulting tripod.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">While the illustrated flashlight <b>10</b> includes three legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, additional leg(s) may be added without deviating from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> are mechanically linked to one another so as to force them to open and close in unison. Each of the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> includes a plurality of gear teeth <b>300</b> that are circumferentially spaced around the leg pivot axes <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, respectively. A toothed rack <b>310</b> movably connects to the body portion <b>30</b> to allow relative axial movement along the flashlight axis <b>230</b>. The rack <b>310</b> includes a plurality of axially spaced teeth <b>320</b> that mesh with the gear teeth <b>300</b> of the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> such that the gear teeth <b>300</b> operatively connect to each other via the rack <b>310</b>. Consequently, the rack <b>310</b> moves axially when the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> move between their open and closed positions. The rack <b>310</b> therefore forces the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> to move between their open and closed positions in unison.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">While the illustrated teeth <b>300</b>, <b>320</b> are square, the teeth <b>300</b>, <b>320</b> may alternatively comprise any other suitable mating surface features (e.g., spiral teeth, mating protrusions and extrusions, etc.) without deviating from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">While the rack <b>310</b> is used to operatively connect the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> may alternatively include teeth that directly mesh with each other to force the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> to pivot in unison with each other. Moreover, any other suitable mechanical link may be used to force the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> to pivot in unison with each other. While synchronous movement of the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> is preferred, the mechanical link may nonetheless be omitted entirely such that the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> pivot independently without deviating from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a compression spring <b>350</b> operatively extends between the body portion <b>30</b> and the rack <b>310</b> to bias the rack <b>310</b> in a rearward axial direction that moves the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> toward their open positions. Consequently, the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> are spring-biased toward their open positions. While the illustrated spring <b>350</b> is a compression spring, the spring <b>350</b> may alternatively comprise any other suitable spring (e.g., tension spring, torsion spring, rubber band, rubber element, etc.) without deviating from the scope of the present invention. While the rack <b>310</b> and spring <b>350</b> are used to spring bias the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> in the illustrated flashlight <b>10</b>, the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> may alternatively be spring biased using any other suitable mechanism (e.g., torsional springs disposed between the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> and the body portion <b>30</b> at the leg pivot axes <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, resilient rubber element(s) such as a rubber bands disposed between the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> and the body portion <b>30</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the flashlight <b>10</b> also includes an operator-releasable detent/lock mechanism <b>400</b> that selectively holds the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> in their closed positions. The detent mechanism <b>400</b> includes a spring-loaded activation button <b>410</b>, a longitudinally elongated activation rod <b>420</b>, a magnet <b>430</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>), and metallic objects <b>440</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the activation button <b>410</b> is slidably mounted to the body portion <b>30</b> for relative vertical movement (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). A compression spring <b>450</b> extends between the body portion <b>30</b> and the button <b>410</b> to urge the button in an upward direction as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The activation rod <b>420</b> extends longitudinally rearwardly from the activation button <b>410</b> and is slidably mounted to the body portion <b>30</b> for relative longitudinal movement. A compression spring <b>460</b> extends between the rod <b>420</b> and the body portion <b>30</b> to urge the rod <b>420</b> forward (to the left as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the button <b>410</b> and rod <b>420</b> include cam surfaces <b>410</b><i>a, </i><b>420</b><i>a, </i>respectively, that abut each other and are skewed 45 degrees relative to the axes of the button <b>410</b> and rod <b>420</b>. Accordingly, downward depression of the button <b>410</b> moves the rod <b>420</b> rearwardly from a normally closed position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to a rearward open position.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The magnet <b>430</b> (or other magnetic material) is mounted to a rearward end of the rod <b>420</b>. The metal objects <b>440</b> are disposed on inward sides of the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>. The illustrated metal objects <b>440</b> are screws, but may alternatively comprise any other ferromagnetic metal. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the rod <b>420</b> is in its forward, normally closed position, the magnet <b>430</b> and metal objects <b>440</b> are aligned such that the magnet <b>430</b> tends to keep/lock the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> in their closed positions. However, the magnetic connection can be broken by pulling a leg <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> away from the other legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> or body portion <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">To open the flashlight <b>10</b> into a tripod position, the operator depresses the activation button <b>410</b>, which moves the rod <b>420</b> and magnet <b>430</b> rearwardly, which moves the magnet <b>430</b> longitudinally away from the metal objects <b>440</b>, thereby allowing the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> to open under the biasing force of the spring <b>350</b>. When the operator releases the button <b>410</b>, the rod <b>420</b> and magnet <b>430</b> return to their forward normal positions. To close the tripod of the flashlight <b>10</b>, the operator moves the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> inwardly until the metal objects <b>440</b> magnetically connect to the magnet <b>430</b>. The detent mechanism <b>400</b> remains physically mounted to the flashlight <b>10</b> regardless of whether the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> are open or closed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">While the magnet <b>430</b> is disposed on the rod <b>420</b> and the metal objects <b>440</b> are disposed on the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> in the illustrated embodiment, magnets could alternatively be disposed on the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> and a metal object disposed on or defined by the rod <b>420</b> without deviating from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While the illustrated detent mechanism <b>400</b> utilizes a magnet <b>430</b> and metal objects <b>440</b>, the detent mechanism could alternatively use any other suitable fastening system. For example, hooks on the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> could engage a corresponding surface feature at the rearward end of the rod <b>420</b> until rearward movement of the rod <b>420</b> disengages the surface feature from the legs. Moreover, any other suitable detent mechanism may be used to releasably secure the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> in their closed positions (e.g., a rubber band wrapped around the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>). Furthermore, the flashlight <b>10</b> may omit a detent mechanism altogether without deviating from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> includes a battery source holder <b>600</b> that includes electrical leads that are constructed and arranged to electrically connect to positive and negative leads of a battery source <b>610</b>. In the illustrated flashlight <b>10</b>, each battery source <b>610</b> comprises three individual cells <b>610</b><i>a </i>aligned in series. The illustrated cells <b>610</b><i>a </i>are AA cells. However, the battery source holders <b>600</b> may alternatively be shaped to accommodate any other suitable battery type. Moreover, the battery sources <b>610</b> may alternatively comprise single cells without deviating from the scope of the present invention. The battery source holders <b>600</b> are defined by tubes that are formed by the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>. The tubular legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> are shaped and sized to accommodate the battery sources <b>610</b> therein. Alternatively, the battery source holders <b>600</b> may be discrete from the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> and subsequently mounted to the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> via any suitable fastening mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Removable end caps <b>630</b> are screwed or otherwise fastened to the ends of the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> to releasably secure the battery sources <b>610</b> within the battery holders <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> preferably comprise an electrically conductive material that provides an electrical path between the front and rear of each battery source holder <b>600</b> so that additional wires need not extend over the longitudinal length of each leg <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">While battery source holders <b>600</b> are disposed in each of the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> of the illustrated flashlight <b>10</b>, battery source holders may alternatively be disposed in just one or two of the legs <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> without deviating from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an electrical circuit <b>650</b> of the flashlight <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, the electrical circuit includes an on/off switch <b>660</b> for turning the flashlight <b>10</b> on and off. The illustrated switch <b>660</b> is a depressible momentary switch, but may alternatively comprise any other suitable switch. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the battery sources <b>610</b> and associated battery source holders <b>600</b> are connected to each other in a parallel circuit and adapted to connect to the light source <b>100</b> in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a diode <b>670</b> is disposed in series with each of the battery sources <b>610</b> and battery source holders <b>600</b>. The diodes <b>670</b> discourage electricity from flowing between the battery sources <b>610</b>. Such electricity flow has plagued conventional parallel battery circuits because it discharges the interconnected batteries. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, any complete electrical path between any two of the battery sources <b>610</b> comprises two oppositely biased diodes <b>670</b> in series with each other. Consequently, the battery source holders <b>600</b> and battery sources <b>610</b> remain in a closed parallel circuit with each other without discharging each other.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The parallel circuit formed between the battery source holders <b>600</b> enable the flashlight <b>10</b> to efficiently use the electricity stored in the battery sources <b>610</b>. One or two of the battery source holders <b>600</b> may be left empty without reducing the light output of the light source <b>100</b>. Instead, omitting a battery source(s) <b>610</b> from up to two of the battery source holders <b>600</b> will merely result in decreased flashlight battery life. The flashlight <b>10</b> may therefore be operated with one, two, or all three of the battery source holders <b>600</b> filled with battery sources <b>610</b>. One or even two of the battery source holders <b>600</b> may be eliminated altogether without deviating from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The diodes <b>670</b> also protect the battery sources <b>610</b> if one or more of the battery sources <b>610</b> are placed in the battery source holders <b>600</b> backwards (i.e., negative battery source <b>610</b> leads connected to positive battery source holder <b>600</b> leads and positive battery source <b>610</b> leads connected to negative battery source holder <b>600</b> leads). In a conventional parallel circuit, such backward alignment would create a closed series circuit between the battery sources <b>610</b> that would quickly discharge the battery sources. However, the presence of the diodes <b>670</b> prevents such current flow between such improperly connected battery sources <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the circuit <b>650</b> provides for the selective lighting of one, three, or six of the LEDs <b>100</b><i>a. </i>Depressing the switch <b>660</b> once electrically connects the battery sources <b>610</b> to one of the LEDs <b>100</b><i>a </i>on (a first closed switch <b>660</b> position). Depressing the switch <b>660</b> a second time electrically connects the battery sources <b>610</b> to an additional two of the LEDs <b>100</b><i>a </i>(a second closed switch <b>660</b> position). Depressing the switch <b>660</b> a third time electrically connects the battery sources <b>610</b> to all six LEDs <b>100</b><i>a </i>(a third closed switch <b>660</b> position). Depressing the switch <b>660</b> a fourth time electrically disconnects the battery sources <b>600</b> from the LEDs <b>100</b><i>a </i>(i.e., an open switch <b>660</b> position).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The LEDs <b>100</b><i>a </i>are connected to each other in parallel such that the light intensity of each LED <b>100</b><i>a </i>remains constant regardless of how many of the LEDs <b>100</b><i>a </i>are electrically connected to the battery sources <b>610</b>. However, connection of a greater number of LEDs <b>100</b><i>a </i>to the battery sources <b>610</b> will discharge the battery sources <b>610</b> more rapidly. Flashlight <b>10</b> battery life is maximized when all three battery sources <b>610</b> are used to light just one of the LEDs <b>100</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, the circuit <b>650</b> includes a low-battery-level indicating LED <b>680</b>. The circuit <b>650</b> turns on the LED <b>680</b> when the battery level of the connected battery sources <b>610</b> is within 10% of being fully discharged. The LED <b>680</b> indicates to the operator that the operator may want to use just one of the six LEDs <b>100</b><i>a </i>to conserve battery source <b>610</b> life.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an electrical circuit <b>700</b> according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. The circuit <b>700</b> may replace the circuit <b>650</b> without deviating from the scope of the present invention. In the circuit <b>700</b>, the battery sources <b>610</b> (and battery source holders <b>600</b>) and light source <b>100</b> are connected to each other in parallel. The on/off switch <b>660</b> is electrically disposed between the light source <b>100</b> and the battery sources <b>610</b>, in series with the light source <b>100</b>. The switch <b>660</b> may be a momentary switch or a two position switch. The battery sources <b>610</b> are electrically connected to the light source <b>100</b> when the switch <b>660</b> is closed (ON), and the battery sources <b>610</b> are electrically disconnected from the light source <b>100</b> when the switch <b>660</b> is in the open position (OFF). Diodes <b>670</b> are disposed in series with each of the battery sources <b>610</b> to discourage the parallel battery sources <b>610</b> from discharging each other.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a flashlight <b>800</b> according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. Because the flashlight <b>800</b> is similar to the flashlight <b>10</b>, a redundant description of the redundant features is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The flashlight <b>800</b> includes a light source <b>810</b>, which is mounted to a head <b>820</b>. The head <b>820</b> pivotally connects to a body portion <b>830</b>. Three legs <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b> pivotally connect to the body portion <b>830</b> so that the legs <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b> can pivot between a closed position, in which the legs form a handle of the flashlight <b>800</b>, and an open tripod position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A detent mechanism <b>870</b> releasably secures the legs <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b> in their closed positions. The detent mechanism <b>870</b> comprises a flexible cord <b>880</b>, openings <b>890</b> in the base of each leg <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b>, and a clasp <b>900</b>. The clasp <b>900</b> slidingly engages two spaced portions of the cord <b>880</b> so as to form a length/loop of cord <b>880</b> on one side of the clasp <b>900</b>. The length of cord <b>880</b> on the one side of the clasp <b>900</b> threads sequentially through the openings <b>890</b> in the base of each of the legs <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b>. The clasp <b>900</b> releasably and selectively clamps the cord <b>880</b> to selectively vary a length/perimeter of the length of the cord <b>880</b> on the one side of the clasp <b>900</b>. By reducing the length of cord <b>880</b> on the one side of the clasp <b>900</b> and clamping the clasp <b>900</b>, an operator can close the legs <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b> and secure them in the closed position such that the legs <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b> for the flashlight's handle. By increasing the length, the operator can allow the legs <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b> to open into their tripod position.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The flexible cord <b>880</b> comprises any suitable elongated, flexible material (e.g., rope, twine, plastic, string, ribbon, rubber, chain link, woven metal, wire, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the loop of cord <b>880</b> has its largest length, the cord <b>880</b> prevents the legs <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b> from opening beyond their predetermined open position. The detent mechanism <b>880</b> thereby preferably secures the legs <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b> in their open position. As in the flashlight <b>10</b>, the legs <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b> may move in unison and be spring biased toward their open position. Alternatively, the legs may freely independently pivot such that the operator, himself/herself, manually moves each leg <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b> between its open and closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">One or both ends of the cord <b>880</b> connect to a key ring <b>910</b> such that the flashlight <b>800</b> and key ring <b>910</b> create a key chain. The entire flashlight <b>800</b> is preferably relatively small so that it can be conveniently used as a key chain. When the legs <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b> are in their closed positions, the cord forms a flexible connector between the flashlight <b>800</b> and the key ring <b>910</b>. While the illustrated key ring <b>910</b> connects to the cord <b>880</b>, the key ring <b>910</b> may alternatively connect to any other suitable part of the flashlight <b>800</b> (e.g., the head <b>820</b>, one of the legs <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b>, etc.) without deviating from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The light source <b>810</b> comprises a single LED, but may alternatively comprise any other suitable light source (multiple LEDs, tungsten bulb, etc.). Three button cell batteries (not shown) are disposed in the head <b>820</b> and define a battery source for the flashlight <b>800</b>. The battery source electrically connects to the light source <b>810</b> via an ON/OFF switch <b>920</b>. Alternatively, battery source(s) (e.g., single AAA batteries) may be disposed in one, two, or three of the legs <b>840</b>, <b>850</b>, <b>860</b> and connect in series or in parallel to the light source <b>810</b> via the switch <b>920</b> to power the flashlight <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Throughout this text and appended claims, the term “generally perpendicular” is intended to mean that the referenced directions are within five degrees of perpendicular to each other (i.e., form an angle with each other of between 85 and 95 degrees).</p>
