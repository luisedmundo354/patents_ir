<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Method of making an integrated passive, such as a high quality decoupling capacitor, includes providing a first temporary support, a silicon capacitor wafer, and providing an oxide layer and a conductive layer on it. Then, a second temporary support, such as a handle wafer, may be attached to the capacitor wafer (i.e., to the oxide layer on it) by an adhesive bond. The capacitor wafer may then be destructively removed. A second conductive layer is then provided on an exposed backside of the oxide layer. The addition of a second electrode on the second conductive layer yields the desired high quality capacitor. Further processing steps, such as solder bumping, may be carried out while the capacitor wafer is still attached to the handle wafer. When the desired processing steps are complete, the handle wafer is removed, and the relatively thin high quality integrated capacitor wafer results.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">U.S. Pat. No. 6,218,729 to Zarrel, Jr. et al. discloses a method for densifying assemblies by integrating capacitors into the substrates on which ICs are attached.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Known techniques have often been complicated, required unusual processing sequences, and have failed to keep up with the demand for compact, low profile applications.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, cell phones and the like may require even more passives, such as capacitors, than integrated circuits.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It can be seen that there likewise is a need for a method of providing integrated passives, such as capacitors, as close as possible to the associated IC(s).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is an object of the invention to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is a further object of the invention to provide components thinner than prior art components, and with the possibility of reducing the space required when mounting on an IC surface.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is a further object of the invention to provide a silicon wafer as a substrate which is compatible with high quality thermal oxides, and then, for example, removing the substrate completely as part of the fabrication process.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Another object of the invention is to provide a method of providing a high quality thermal oxide layer on a silicon wafer, which will serve as a temporary substrate on which to fabricate at least a part of a passive, and then provide, such as by deposition or sputtering, a high quality metal layer, such as an aluminum layer, on the thermal oxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A further object of the invention is to provide a method of producing a passive, such as a capacitor, by which one yields a desired capacitance wherever one wants such capacitance, in an integrated passive.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Yet another object of the invention is to substantially eliminate solder balls with optional 3-dimensional integration of an integrated passive, such as a capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A further object of the invention is to avoid the prior art drawback of building a capacitor on the chip; rather, a further object is to provide a capacitor sized and configured so that the chip may be provided on the capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A further object of the invention is to provide a passive, such as a capacitor, which yields an integrated passive that minimizes production costs while maximizing quality; namely, there are no quality versus cost trade-offs.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Yet another object of the invention is to provide a passive, such as a capacitor, sized and configured so that a chip may be provided within a perimeter of solder connections or solder bumps on the capacitor, and at a desired distance from an electrode of the capacitor, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Another object of the invention is to provide for the manufacturing of integrated passives, such as capacitors, having superior electrical and physical characteristics as compared to known devices.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A further object of the invention is to provide for the use of a releasable adhesive or bonding material for enhancing and simplifying the process of producing such passives, such as when using capacitance wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Another object of the invention is to provide a method of fabricating decoupling capacitors with high capacitance values, low parasitic losses, good yield, and long-term reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Another still further object of the invention is to provide a method of fabricating passives, such as inductors and resistors, as well as interconnect lines.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Yet another object of the invention is to provide for the use of thinned acrylic bonding material during one or more of the fabrication steps.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Yet another object of the invention is to use a fabrication process which minimizes package thicknesses as compared with known technologies, while providing the desired quality and reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another object of the invention is to provide a method of fabricating integrated passives, such as capacitors, which are readily manufactured, even in conventional production lines.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In summary, the invention is directed to a method of fabricating a high quality capacitor that includes providing a substrate, such as a capacitor wafer, having a topside, a thickness, and a diameter, and providing an oxide layer on the topside of the capacitor wafer to yield an oxide layer having a topside. One may then provide a conductive layer on the topside of the oxide layer, and a handle wafer on the topside of the oxide layer. The handle wafer may have a thickness, and a diameter, the thickness being substantially constant, and the diameter being substantially the same as the diameter of the capacitor wafer. Further, the method may include providing an adhesive on the topside of the handle wafer for adhering the topside of the handle wafer to the topside of the oxide layer. The adhered handle wafer and the capacitor wafer may be treated in a wafer bonder to yield a wafer stack including a bond. The capacitor wafer may then be removed by thinning a backside of the capacitor wafer to yield an exposed backside of the oxide layer. A second conductive layer, as well as an electrode, may then be provided on the backside of the oxide layer to yield a high quality capacitor. After additional processing steps, such as bumping and adding an IC, the handle wafer may be removed from the wafer stack.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The invention may include the attaching of a capacitor wafer and a handle wafer to each other by an adhesive layer, such as BCB (e.g., bisbenzocyclobutene or benzocyclobutane).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The fabrication of the inventive passive likewise may include use of a thinned adhesive, an acrylic, which is readily removable with a solvent, such as acetone, when attaching substrates, such as wafers, in the production process.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The inventive method overcomes the prior art drawback of providing relatively large solder bumps on relatively thin passives, such as capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The inventive method likewise includes the fabrication of thinner passives, such as capacitors, which are as thin as possible to the point at which the minimum amount of material necessary for functionality remains.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">After completion of the initial process, the capacitor wafer may be tested, diced, and flip-chip assembled. A bonded supporting substrate, such as a handle wafer, may then be released, yielding the desired extremely dense assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Relative terms such as left, right, topside, backside, height, width, up, and down are for convenience only and are not intended to be limiting.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">If desired, vias through the oxide layer may be patterned.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates a further step of providing a second temporary support <b>30</b>, such as a handle wafer, to which first temporary support <b>10</b> may be attached.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Good results have been achieved when the second temporary support <b>30</b> has a uniform thickness. Such uniform thickness has ensured that in a later wafer thinning or destructive removal steps the processing is more uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">An adhesive or bonding layer <b>34</b> may be provided on topside <b>32</b> of second support <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The fabricator may now perform a step of providing an adhesive <b>36</b> on a topside of the conductive layer <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Second temporary support <b>30</b> may be in the form of a known handle wafer or other support or substrate configured for mating well with the wafer <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Such mating has been achieved with good results by providing second temporary support <b>30</b> in the form of a substrate, such as a silicon wafer, which has the same width, extent, and outer perimeter as wafer <b>10</b>; i.e., is substantially the same size and covers substantially the same footprint as viewed in plan. In this manner, wafer <b>10</b> is evenly supported over its entire extent during processing steps in which forces are exerted on wafer <b>10</b>, for example. Such even support over its entire footprint has provided for the desired high quality fabrication in practice.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The handle wafer <b>30</b> may be made of a conventional material such as glass.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The handle wafer <b>30</b> material may also include a stainless steel, or any material compatible with the adhesive (e.g. acrylic) and the bonding process described immediately below.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Attaching of the handle wafer <b>30</b> to wafer <b>10</b> may be carried out by bonding a topside <b>18</b> of metallization layer <b>16</b> to the topside of handle wafer or second temporary support <b>30</b> with an adhesive material, such as BCB or acrylic, and the BCB or acrylic may be spun onto one or both of handle wafer <b>30</b> and the capacitor wafer <b>10</b>. For example, the BCB or acrylic may be spun onto a surface of the conductive layer <b>16</b> (onto the topside as shown) of wafer <b>10</b> that will face the second support <b>30</b>, and the BCB or acrylic may likewise be spun on a counterpart surface of the second temporary support <b>30</b> which will face the conductive layer <b>16</b>. A resultant wafer stack <b>40</b>; i.e. adhered support <b>30</b> and capacitor wafer <b>10</b> may then be bonded, e.g., soft baked, in accordance with a known process, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The adhesive of bonding layers <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> may include an acrylic, which has been spun onto both respective opposed wafer surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">An acrylic used as the bonding material of layers <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> may include a commercially available acrylic material such as HumiSeal® 1B31 (HumiSeal® is a registered trademark of Chase Corporation, Braintree, Mass.), www.humiseal.com. Such commercially available HumiSeal® may be first diluted by 50% volume with acetone. Such dilution allows for deposition of a relatively thin, uniform layer of acrylic to be deposited on the wafer surfaces by spin coating.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Details of the use of a diluted acrylic, described above, and of the bonding with a conventional wafer bonder, described immediately below, are set forth in Applicant's co-pending application Ser. No. 11/134,600, entitled “Method for Thinning a Bumped Wafer”, filed May 16, 2005, and which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Good results have been achieved when using an Electronic Visions wafer bonder available from EVGroup, Schärding, Austria (Electronic Visions Group, www.evgroup.com).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">This bonded stack including handle wafer <b>30</b> and capacitor wafer <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Wafers <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> may be oriented, pressed, and bonded together in a wafer bonder under a force of about 2 times atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A resultant bonded adhesive layer <b>38</b> made of layers <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> is shown to simply point out the layers which were used to produce layer <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Owing to use of the wafer bonder according to the vendor specifications, as described in the above-incorporated co-pending application, and in the inventive manner, little or no air can be trapped when the respective adhesive layers <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are contacted to form bonding layer <b>38</b>. For example, in the case of acrylic, elevated temperature and high pressure allow for the acrylic films to flow over any topography on the opposed surfaces of wafers <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> that is common for finished semiconductor device wafer. Therefore, no or substantially no voids are present in the resultant acrylic bond layer <b>38</b>, and it is relatively strong, even though layer <b>38</b> is relatively thin. Good results have been achieved when layer <b>38</b> has been formed with BCB as the adhesive of layers <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, and with a resultant cured bond thickness of about 8 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows that after the stack wafer bonding process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the silicon substrate wafer <b>10</b> may be thinned by using a known, readily available process including one or more of etching, grinding, and polishing, for example. That thinning/removal will typically be a destructive removal process which completely or substantially completely removes the silicon wafer <b>10</b>. Appropriate equipment is readily available for carrying out such processes of thinning the silicon wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The thermal oxide layer <b>14</b> may serve as an excellent etch stop during the destructive removal process.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">After the silicon capacitor wafer <b>10</b> has been destructively removed in the step of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, oxide <b>14</b> of the desired thickness and quality remains, and has an exposed backside <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The bonding and thinning processes described above are applicable to any type of passive device fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a step of adding an additional or second metallization layer <b>46</b>, such as a high quality aluminum layer, to backside <b>44</b> of oxide layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Vias through oxide layer <b>14</b> to first electrode <b>22</b> may be formed, if required, prior to the addition of metallization layer <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Second Metallization layer <b>46</b>, may be formed by depositing and patterning, and may be an aluminum layer.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Second metallization layer <b>46</b> may be formed to include a second electrode <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As shown, a capacitor including oxide layer <b>14</b>, aluminum layers <b>16</b> and <b>46</b>, and electrodes <b>22</b> and <b>48</b>, has thus been formed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Good results have been achieved, in the case where acrylic was used as the adhesive, when a relatively short wet strip at ambient temperature in acetone was used to readily remove the above-described original bond layer. This wet strip solvent has been successfully used without it attacking the device wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a bumping process which may then be completed, such as by electroplating, printing, or solder dispense. Depending on the end use, relatively few process steps remain. Second metal layer <b>46</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, may be provided with one or more solder bumps <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>, as shown. Solder bumps <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> may be micro-bumps.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Wafer bumps <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> may be relatively large solder bumps, depending on the intended use, such as for assembly to a processor chip, and in accordance with the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">This method is believed to be compatible with most conventional solders in the industry, and bumps other than the usual solder, such as gold (Au) bumps may be provided, although such may be more time-consuming to fabricate.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">It will be seen that the goal of providing a capacitor as thin as possible to minimize its height and meet the requirements of thinner devices, such as integrated passives, has been achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">After the electrode fabrication and solder bumping of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, any additional capacitor or other integrated passive processing steps may be completed while handle wafer <b>30</b> is still attached. For example, the capacitor may be tested, diced, and the like prior to its use.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The tested and diced integrated passive may then be assembled to an integrated circuit <b>66</b>, using solder bumps <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">At an appropriate time, the finished capacitor may be released, such as after it has been attached to its final substrate, in use. The remaining bond <b>38</b> between handle wafer <b>30</b> and the first metal layer <b>16</b> may be removed, such as by being dissolved in acetone in the case of acrylic bonds.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Prior to being released, chip <b>66</b> and its associated capacitor may be flip-chip assembled. Thanks to the micro-bump joining and close proximity, the capacitor maximizes electrical decoupling while minimizing parasitic losses.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Good results have been achieved when capacitors wafers have been produced in accordance with the fabrication steps of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As regards the use of alternate dielectric and electrode materials, alternate dielectric materials such as PZT or Barium Titanate can be used because the silicon substrate is compatible with multiple methods of deposition and can withstand very high processing temperatures. Other electrodes besides aluminum (such as copper) can also be used. Other passive components can also be partially or fully fabricated at this point.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As to using different bonding materials, easily releasable bonding materials such as acrylic or PVA can be used. This may be most useful when the capacitor chip needs to be extremely thin when assembled onto the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">It is further contemplated that as regards capacitor wafer thinning other possible final steps may be included to maximize the uniformity of the thinning process and/or the quality of the capacitor dielectric:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0101">1. if the capacitor is fabricated on an SOI (silicon on insulator) wafer the buried oxide layer serves as a natural etch stop for chemical solutions such as ethylene-diamine pyrocatechol (EPD) or tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH); in this case a layer of oxide or nitride may protect the back of the handle wafer; the extremely thin (&lt;1 micron) silicon remaining can be quickly removed by various processes that do not damage the thermal oxide or alternate dielectric materials.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0102">2. if the capacitor is fabricated on a wafer with a lightly doped epitaxial layer on top of a heavily doped substrate, as is common in many silicon processes, solutions of Nitric:HF:Acetic acid will preferentially etch the silicon with high doping levels; the interface between the two layers thus may serve as an etch stop; this also preserves the electrical quality of the dielectric.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0103">It is also contemplated that as regards backside processing:

    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0104">1. after thinning is complete, other passive components can also be fully fabricated or complete their fabrication at this point.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>

</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0105">It is likewise contemplated that as regards assembly/transfer/release process steps:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0106">1. as regards assembly and release of the substrate, depending on the thickness required for the capacitor chip, it can be thinned or destructively removed by conventional means (backgrind, etc.); if space above the processor chip is at a premium, the handle piece can be released to make the capacitor chip very thin (a few microns at most); solvent or water soaks, as needed can be used to release the bond; use of porous supports and ultrasonic agitation will also greatly accelerate the release time, reducing it to a few minutes in some cases.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0107">2. materials other than BCB, and acrylic, can be used for the transfer bond; an example is polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which is water-soluble; if PVA is used, the bonded material can be released using a water soak, which will be very benign to other components in the environment, including the materials used for attaching the device to its final substrate; polymethyl</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0108">Methacrylate (PMMA), wax, or other materials may also be used as the adhesive; and

    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0109">3. specialized handle wafers can be used; for example, a substrate with a porous silicon layer on top, or a glass substrate, can be used for the handle; these are especially useful if the capacitor chip needs to be extremely thin when assembled onto the processor; after bonding, a high-speed jet stream can split open the porous silicon layer, leaving only a thin silicon layer to be removed.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0110">It is contemplated that as regards handle wafer removal:
<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0111">1. if special release layers have been incorporated into the handle wafer, appropriate release mechanisms for them such as temperature, UV (ultraviolet) irradiation, etc. may be used.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0112">It is also contemplated that as regards assembly release:
