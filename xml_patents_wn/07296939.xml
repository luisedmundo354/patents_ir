<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a laser module in which a laser beam emitted from a semiconductor laser element is coupled to an optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, the laser modules having the following construction are known as the pigtail-type laser modules, and widely used in the field of optical communications. The pigtail-type laser modules are constituted by a semiconductor laser element contained in a package, an optical fiber being fixed to the package and having an end which appears inside the package, and an optical condensing system which couples a laser beam emitted from the semiconductor laser element with a light-entrance end face.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a variation of the above pigtail-type laser modules, the combined-laser modules are also known, for example, as indicated in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003-298170. In the combined-laser modules, a plurality of laser beams are emitted from one or more semiconductor laser elements, and enter an optical fiber which is arranged as in the pigtail-type laser modules, so that the plurality of laser beams are combined into a single laser beam having high intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the above laser modules, in order to stably maintain the state in which the semiconductor laser and the light-entrance end face of the optical fiber are optically coupled with a precision on the order of micrometers, the optical fiber, the optical condensing system, and the like are normally fixed by using a means of adhesion such as a solder or an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, in the laser modules for communications, in order to prevent deterioration of the laser caused by moisture in the atmosphere and the like, normally the package is hermetically sealed. The so-called CAN package is a typical sealing structure which protects semiconductor laser elements and laser end facets. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003-298170 also discloses hermetic sealing of a package containing the aforementioned one or more semiconductor laser elements and optical fiber, an optical condensing system, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the laser modules as mentioned above, contaminants remaining in the hermetically sealed package are likely to be deposited on the light-emission end face of the semiconductor laser element and other optical components such as the optical condensing system and the optical fiber, so that the laser characteristics deteriorate. In particular, in the regions through which light passes and in which the optical density is high, the effect of depositing materials (i.e., the dust collection effect) is enhanced. Further, in the laser modules containing semiconductor laser elements which emit laser beams in the wavelength range of 350 to 500 nm (e.g., in the 400 nm band) such as GaN semiconductor laser elements, the photon energy is high. Therefore, photochemical reactions with the deposited materials are likely to occur, and the dust collection effect becomes further enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Typical examples of the contaminants are hydrocarbon compounds which enter the package from ambient atmospheres during manufacturing processes. The laser light polymerizes or decomposes such hydrocarbon compounds, and the materials produced by the polymerization or decomposition are deposited and impede increase in the optical output power.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, it is known that ultraviolet light causes photochemical reactions with low-molecular-weight siloxane suspended in air, and the reaction products SiOx are deposited on optical glass window elements. Therefore, periodic replacement of the window elements exposed to air is recommended, for example, as indicated in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 11(1999)-054852.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various proposals have been made for suppressing the aforementioned dust collection effect. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,392,305 indicates a proposal to mix 100 ppm or more of oxygen into sealing gas for decomposing the hydrocarbon compounds and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, in optical systems in which ultraviolet light having a wavelength of 400 nm or smaller is applied to optical elements, arrangement of the optical elements in an atmosphere containing nitrogen of 99.9% or more has been proposed, for example, as indicated in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 11(1999)-167132.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, it is known that the dust collection effect can be suppressed by degassing the inside of the package immediately before hermetically sealing the package.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, in the case where a laser module in which a commercially available optical fiber covered with a primary coating of an ultraviolet-light-curing resin and a secondary coating of a polymer is fixed to a package, degassing is performed after the optical fiber is fixed to the package. That is, the fiber coatings exist in a degassing system. Therefore, chemical components are outgassed during the degassing operation, and thus the inside of the laser module is contaminated with the outgassed chemical components. In order to prevent this contamination, all the coatings of the optical fiber may be removed in advance. Nevertheless, since the optical fiber without coatings is prone to break, and it is difficult to handle an optical fiber without coatings, the removal of the coatings is not practical.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As indicated in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2003-298170, hermetic sealing of a package containing a semiconductor laser element, an optical fiber, an optical condensing system, and the like is effective at preventing contamination of the inside of the laser module. However, in this case, the volume of the package becomes considerably large. When the volume of a hermetically sealed package is increased, the cost of the package is also increased, and assembly becomes more difficult. Therefore, in the case where a laser module is produced by hermetically sealing a large package containing a semiconductor laser element, an optical fiber, an optical condensing system, and the like, the cost of the laser module becomes very high.</p>

<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0025">(iii) The first package is hermetically sealed by one of fusion, welding, soldering using a flux-free solder, and adhesion using an adhesive which does not contain a silicon-based organic material.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0026">(iv) The first package is filled with inert gas.</li>

        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0028">(vi) The laser modules according to the first and second aspects of the present invention may further comprise a third package which is separated from the first package, contains the light-entrance end face of the optical fiber, and is hermetically sealed.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0029">(vii) In the laser modules having the feature (vi), the third package is hermetically sealed by one of fusion, welding, soldering using a flux-free solder, and adhesion using an adhesive which does not contain a silicon-based organic material.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0030">(viii) In the laser modules having the feature (vi), the third package is filled with inert gas.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0031">(ix) In the laser modules having the feature (viii), the inert gas contains one or a mixture of oxygen gas, halogen gas, and halide gas at a concentration of 1 ppm or higher.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0008" num="0032">(x) The one or more semiconductor laser elements have an oscillation wavelength of 350 to 500 nm.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0009" num="0033">(xi) The one or more semiconductor laser elements are realized by an array of single-cavity semiconductor laser elements, or a single multi-cavity semiconductor laser element, or an array of multi-cavity semiconductor laser elements, or a combination of at least one single-cavity semiconductor laser element and at least one multi-cavity semiconductor laser element.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0010" num="0034">(xii) The one or more semiconductor laser elements emit a plurality of laser beams which are combined into a single laser beam in the optical fiber.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0011" num="0035">(xiii) In the laser modules having the feature (xii), the one or more semiconductor laser elements are arranged so that the plurality of laser beams emitted from the one or more semiconductor laser elements are two-dimensionally arrayed along a plane perpendicular to the light-emission axes of the one or more semiconductor laser elements.</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0012" num="0036">(xiv) The light-emission end face of the optical fiber is terminated with a connector.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0037">(III) The laser modules according to the first and second aspects of the present invention have the following advantages.
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0038">(1) The optical density is high and the dust collection effect is enhanced at the light-emission end faces of the one or more semiconductor laser elements and the lens surfaces through which light passes. In the laser modules according to the present invention, the one or more semiconductor laser elements and the one or more collimator lenses (or the one or more magnifying condenser lenses) are contained in the first package, and the first package is hermetically sealed. Therefore, it is possible to suppress dust collection at the light-emission end faces of the one or more semiconductor laser elements and the lens surfaces through which light passes. Thus, the laser modules according to the present invention are highly reliable.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0039">(2) Since the light-entrance end face of the optical fiber is not contained in the first package, it is possible to prevent contamination caused by outgassing from the resin coatings of the optical fiber. In particular, in the laser module according to the first aspect of the present invention, the condensing lens is also arranged outside the first package. Therefore, it is possible to prevent contamination of the light-emission end faces of the one or more semiconductor laser elements with volatile components emanated from an adhesive or the like used for fixing the condensing lens.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0040">(3) Only the one or more collimator lenses or the one or more magnifying condenser lenses are contained in the first package as well as the light-emission end faces of the one or more semiconductor laser elements. Therefore, the volume of the first package in each of the laser modules according to the present invention is smaller than the volume of the package in the conventional laser modules, which contains all the optical components constituting each of the conventional laser modules. Since the cost of the hermetically sealed package markedly increases with the volume of the package, the cost of the package according to the present invention can be significantly reduced. Thus, the entire laser modules according to the present invention can be produced at low cost.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0041">(4) If only the semiconductor laser elements are contained in a package, and the collimator lenses or the magnifying condenser lenses are arranged outside the package, the volume of the package can be further reduced. However, in this case, the divergent laser beams emitted from the semiconductor laser elements pass through a window which is required to be arranged in the package for passage of the laser beams, and the window is located at a location at which the diameters of the laser beams are still small, i.e., at which the optical density is very high. Therefore, the dust collection effect at the window is markedly enhanced, and the laser characteristics seriously deteriorate.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0042">On the other hand, in the laser modules according to the present invention, the collimator lenses or the magnifying condenser lenses are also contained in the first package. Therefore, the diameters of the laser beams are great, i.e., the optical density is relatively low, at the location of a window arranged in the first package for passage of the laser beams. Thus, the dust collection effect at the window is reduced, and the deterioration of the laser characteristics can be suppressed.
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0043">(5) In the laser module according to the first aspect of the present invention, the optical condensing system which makes the laser beams enter the optical fiber is constituted by the collimator lenses and the condensing lens which is arranged outside the first package. Therefore, it is preferable to make provision for preventing contamination of the condensing lens in order to prevent deterioration of the laser characteristics of the laser module according to the first aspect of the present invention.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0044">In the case where the condensing lens is contained in the second package which is hermetically sealed and has lower sealing performance than the first package, the cost of the second package is relatively low. Therefore, the total cost of the first and second packages is smaller than the cost of the conventional package which contains all of the semiconductor laser elements, the collimator lenses, and the condensing lens. Thus, the laser module according to the first aspect of the present invention can be produced at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0045">Further, in the case where the second package contains the first package, the semiconductor laser elements and the collimator lenses are doubly sealed with the first and second packages. Therefore, the effect of preventing contamination of the semiconductor laser elements and the collimator lenses is further enhanced.
<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0046">(6) In the case where the first package is hermetically sealed by one of fusion, welding, soldering using a flux-free solder, and adhesion using an adhesive which does not contain a silicon-based organic material, it is possible to suppress emanation of volatile components which causes contamination, and prevent contamination of the semiconductor laser elements and the like.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0047">(7) In the case where the first package is filled with inert gas, it is possible to prevent entry of contaminated gas into the first package. Further, in the case where the inert gas contains one or a mixture of oxygen gas, halogen gas, and halide gas at a concentration of 1 ppm or higher, the effect of preventing contamination is enhanced since oxygen gas, halogen gas, and halide gas cause decomposition of hydrocarbon components and the like.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0048">(8) In the case where the light-entrance end face of the optical fiber is contained in another package (the third package) which is hermetically sealed, it is possible to prevent dust collection at the light-entrance end face although the optical density is likely to become high. In this case, it is possible to arrange the first package and the third package in such a manner that the total volume of the first and third packages is smaller than the volume of a large, hermetically sealed package which contains all the constituents of the laser module. Therefore, the cost can be reduced by arranging the first and third packages as above, in comparison with the case where the above large, hermetically sealed package is used.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0049">(9) In the case where the third package is hermetically sealed by one of fusion, welding, soldering using a flux-free solder, and adhesion using an adhesive which does not contain a silicon-based organic material, it is possible to suppress emanation of volatile components which causes contamination, and prevent contamination of the light-entrance end face of the optical fiber.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0005" num="0050">(10) In the case where the third package is filled with inert gas, it is possible to prevent entry of contaminated gas into the third package. Further, in the case where the inert gas contains one or a mixture of oxygen gas, halogen gas, and halide gas at a concentration of 1 ppm or higher, the effect of preventing contamination is enhanced since oxygen gas, halogen gas, and halide gas cause decomposition of hydrocarbon components and the like.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0006" num="0051">(11) In the case where the one or more semiconductor laser elements have an oscillation wavelength of 350 to 500 nm, the optical energy is great, and the dust collection effect is enhanced. Since the deposition of contaminants is prevented according to the present invention, the present invention is particularly effective at preventing deposition of contaminants in laser modules in which laser beams having the above oscillation wavelength are used.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0007" num="0052">(12) In the case where the one or more semiconductor laser elements emit a plurality of laser beams which are combined into a single laser beam in the optical fiber, the optical density at the light-entrance end face of the optical fiber becomes very high, and therefore the dust collection effect is enhanced. Since the deposition of contaminants on the light-entrance end face of the optical fiber is prevented by the provision of the third package, the provision of the third package is particularly effective at preventing deposition of contaminants in laser modules in which the one or more semiconductor laser elements are arranged as above.</li>
        <li id="ul0010-0008" num="0053">(13) If a package containing all the constituents of a laser module is used in the case where one or more semiconductor laser elements are arranged so that a plurality of laser beams emitted from the one or more semiconductor laser elements are two-dimensionally arrayed along a plane perpendicular to the light-emission axes of the one or more semiconductor laser elements, the volume of the package becomes great. Since the first package according to the present invention is small, the present invention is particularly effective at reducing the cost of the laser modules in which the one or more semiconductor laser elements are arranged as above.</li>

<p id="p-0044" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are respectively plan and side views, partly in cross section, of a laser module according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0071">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the laser module according to the first embodiment comprises a plurality (e.g., two) of semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b>, a heat block (heat-dissipation block) <b>10</b>, a plurality (e.g., two) of collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, a plurality (e.g., two) of collimator-lens holders <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b>, a condensing lens <b>15</b>, a condensing-lens holder <b>16</b>, and an optical fiber <b>20</b>. The semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> are fixed on the upper surface of the heat block <b>10</b>. The collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> collimate divergent laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> emitted from the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b>. The collimator-lens holders <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> respectively hold the collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. The condensing lens <b>15</b> condenses the collimated laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> so that the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> converge at an identical position. The condensing-lens holder <b>16</b> holds the condensing lens <b>15</b>. The optical fiber <b>20</b> is arranged so that the above identical position is located at an end <b>20</b><i>a </i>(on the light-entrance end face) of the optical fiber <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0072">In addition, a plurality (e.g., two) of photodiodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>, four small electrode pads <b>33</b>, and a single large electrode pad <b>34</b> are also fixed on the upper surface of the heat block <b>10</b>. The photodiodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> detect backward emission light emitted from the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> in the direction opposite to the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0073">Further, the collimator-lens holders <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>, the condensing-lens holder <b>16</b>, and a holding member <b>41</b> for holding the heat block <b>10</b> are fixed on a base plate <b>42</b>, and a package <b>40</b> is formed by fixing a front plate <b>43</b>, a rear plate <b>44</b>, and two side plates <b>45</b> on the base plate <b>42</b>, and adhesively fixing a cover plate <b>46</b> is to the upper end faces of the front plate <b>43</b>, the rear plate <b>44</b>, and the side plates <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0074">Furthermore, a light-source package <b>50</b> is arranged in the package <b>40</b>. The light-source package <b>50</b> is constituted by a vertical member <b>51</b> and a cover plate <b>52</b>. The vertical member <b>51</b> has a U-shaped horizontal cross-section, the rear end faces of the vertical member <b>51</b> are fixed to the rear plate <b>44</b> of the package <b>40</b>, and the cover plate <b>52</b> is adhesively fixed to the upper end faces of the vertical member <b>51</b>. The light-source package <b>50</b> contains the heat block <b>10</b> and the collimator-lens holders <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>. A transparent plate <b>53</b> being made of an optical glass or the like and realizing a window is inserted into the vertical member <b>51</b> so that the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> can pass through the transparent plate <b>53</b>, and is outputted from the light-source package <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0075">GaN-based semiconductor laser elements having an oscillation wavelength of 350 to 500 nm are used as the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b>, and mounted on the heat block <b>10</b> through a submount <b>17</b>. For example, the InGaN-based semiconductor laser elements disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-134555 can be used as the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b>. For example, the submount <b>17</b> may be made of AlN, and an electric pattern may be formed on the submount <b>17</b>. Alternatively, the submount <b>17</b> may be constituted by a ceramic pattern on which copper wirings are arranged. The submount <b>17</b> can be mounted in various manners. For example, the submount <b>17</b> as above may be directly fixed to the heat block <b>10</b> by soldering. Alternatively, a submount may be arranged for each component of the laser module.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0076">The semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> and the photodiodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> are connected to the leads <b>18</b> through the electrode pads <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> to which the leads <b>18</b> are bonded. For example, the number of the leads <b>18</b> is five. The leads <b>18</b> are led out of the light-source package <b>50</b> in such a manner that the inside of the light-source package <b>50</b> is sealed off from the outside. In addition, the leads <b>18</b> are further led out of the package <b>40</b> in a similar manner (although not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0077">The condensing lens <b>15</b> is a truncated lens having a shape obtained by cutting out a portion of an axisymmetric spherical lens so that the portion contains the optical axis of the spherical lens, and the top and bottom surfaces of the truncated lens are flat. The condensing lens <b>15</b> is fixed to the condensing-lens holder <b>16</b>, for example, by bonding a flat bottom surface of the condensing lens <b>15</b> to the upper surface of the condensing-lens holder <b>16</b>. Alternatively, the condensing lens <b>15</b> may be a normal axisymmetric spherical lens, an aspherical lens, a pair of cylindrical lenses which are combined so as to increase the circularity of each of the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b>, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0078">A light-passage hole <b>43</b><i>a </i>is arranged in the front plate <b>43</b> of the package <b>40</b>, and a transparent plate <b>21</b> made of glass or the like is arranged on the front surface of the front plate <b>43</b> so as to hermetically close the light-passage hole <b>43</b><i>a</i>. The transparent plate <b>21</b> is fixed to a ferrule holder <b>22</b>, which has a cylindrical portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>shaped to hold a ferrule <b>24</b> having a cylindrical shape. The ferrule holder <b>22</b> is fixed to the front plate <b>43</b> of the package <b>40</b> with a flux-free solder <b>23</b>. The resin coating of the optical fiber <b>20</b> in the vicinity of the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>is removed so as to expose the bare optical fiber <b>20</b><i>b</i>, and the bare optical fiber <b>20</b><i>b </i>is inserted into a small hole which is formed through the center of the ferrule <b>24</b>. Then, the ferrule <b>24</b> is inserted into the cylindrical portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the ferrule holder <b>22</b>, and fixed to the cylindrical portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>with a flux-free solder <b>25</b>. Thus, the optical fiber <b>20</b> is fixed to the package <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0079">In the laser module having the above construction, the divergent laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> emitted from the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> are collimated by the collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, respectively, and outputted from the light-source package <b>50</b> through the transparent plate <b>53</b>. Then, the collimated laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> are condensed by the condensing lens <b>15</b>, and outputted from the package <b>40</b> through the transparent plate <b>21</b>, so that both the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> converge on the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>(specifically, the end face of the core) of the optical fiber <b>20</b>. Thus, the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> enter and propagate through the optical fiber <b>20</b>. At this time, the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> are combined in the optical fiber <b>20</b> to generate a high-intensity, combined laser beam CB, which is then outputted from the optical fiber <b>20</b>. It is preferable that the light-emission end of the optical fiber <b>20</b> be terminated. Details of the termination of the optical fiber are explained later.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0080">As mentioned before, in addition to the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> as forward emission light, the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> emit the backward emission light (not shown) in the direction opposite to the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b>. The intensities of the backward emission light from the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> are detected by the photodiodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>, respectively, and the driving currents of the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> are APC (Automatic Power Control) controlled according to the outputs of the photodiodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>, respectively, so that the output power of the combined laser beam CB is maintained constant.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0081">Alternatively, in order to perform APC in a laser module having a plurality of semiconductor laser elements, it is possible to input the signals corresponding to the detected backward emission light into a multi-channel driver, and control the respective semiconductor laser elements by using the multi-channel driver. Further, it is also possible to split off a portion from each of the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> after the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> are outputted from the light-source package <b>50</b> (or after the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> are condensed by the condensing lens <b>15</b>) by using a beam splitter or the like, detect the intensities of the split portions of the collimated laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> (instead of the backward emission light) by using optical detectors, and perform APC on the basis of the outputs of the optical detectors.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0082">Hereinbelow, prevention of contamination of the surfaces through which the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> pass is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0083">As explained above, the light-source package <b>50</b> which contains the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> and the collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> is constituted by the vertical member <b>51</b> and the cover plate <b>52</b>, and is hermetically sealed. A flux-free solder or an adhesive which does not contain a silicon-based organic material is used for fixing the cover plate <b>52</b> to the vertical member <b>51</b>, and the cover plate <b>52</b> and the vertical member <b>51</b> to the base plate <b>42</b> or the rear plate <b>44</b>. Alternatively, fusion or welding may be used for fixing the above plates and members. In addition, the other components and parts arranged in the light-source package <b>50</b> are also fixed or bonded in similar manners. Thus, it is possible to suppress emanation of volatile components which causes contamination. Further, it is preferable to perform degassing in order to remove volatile components remaining in the light-source package <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0084">The adhesive which does not contain a silicon-based organic material is, for example, one of the adhesive mixtures which are disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-177166 and do not contain a silane coupling agent, where each of the adhesive mixtures contains an alicyclic epoxy compound, a compound having an oxetanyl group, and a photoreaction initiator of an onium salt as a catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0085">The flux-free solders used in the laser module according to the first embodiment are, for example, Sn—Pb, Sn—In, Sn—Pb—In, Au—Sn, Ag—Sn, Sn—Ag—In, or the like. Although the flux contained in the most soldering materials causes contamination, it is possible to prevent production of contaminants by use of the flux-free solders. In addition, from the environmental viewpoint, it is preferable to use lead-free solders.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0086">It is possible to perform welding by using a commercially available, seam welding machine, for example, one of the seam welders which are available from Nippon Avionics Co., Ltd. Specifically, it is possible to perform a seal weld of the light-source package <b>50</b>, for example, by placing the cover plate <b>52</b> on the vertical member <b>51</b>, and applying a high voltage to the regions at which the cover plate <b>52</b> and the vertical member <b>51</b> are in contact, with a seam welding machine. In addition, it is possible to perform fusion by using a commercially available, fusion machine, for example, the fusion machine FITEL S-2000, which is available from Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0087">The above features in the construction of the laser module according to the first embodiment bring the following advantages.
<ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0088">(a) Since the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> and the collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are arranged in the light-source package <b>50</b> which is hermetically sealed so that contaminants inside the light-source package <b>50</b> are sufficiently reduced, it is possible to suppress dust collection on the light-emission end faces of the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> and the surfaces of the collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> through which light passes (at which the optical density is high and the dust collection effect is enhanced). Thus, the laser module according to the first embodiment has high reliability.</li>
        <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0089">(b) Since the light-entrance end face of the optical fiber <b>20</b> is not contained in the light-source package <b>50</b>, it is possible to prevent contamination caused by outgassing from the resin coating of the optical fiber <b>20</b>. In addition, according to the first embodiment, the condensing lens <b>15</b> is arranged outside the light-source package <b>50</b>. Therefore, it is also possible to prevent contamination of the light-emission end faces of the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> and other surfaces by volatile components emanated from an adhesive used for fixing the condensing lens <b>15</b>.</li>
        <li id="ul0012-0003" num="0090">(c) Since only the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> and the collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are arranged in the hermetically sealed, light-source package <b>50</b>, the volume of the light-source package <b>50</b> can be smaller than the volume of the conventional hermetically sealed packages each containing all the constituents of a laser module. Since the cost of the hermetically sealed package markedly increases with the volume of the package, the cost of the light-source package <b>50</b> can be significantly reduced. Thus, the entire laser module according to the first embodiment can be produced at low cost.</li>
        <li id="ul0012-0004" num="0091">(d) If only the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> are contained in a light-source package <b>50</b>, and the collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are arranged outside the light-source package <b>50</b>, the volume of the light-source package can be further reduced. However, in this case, the window (realized by the transparent plate <b>53</b>) of the light-source package <b>50</b> should be located between the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> and the collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Therefore, the divergent laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> emitted from the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> pass through the window at a location at which the diameters of the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> are still small, i.e., at which the optical density is very high. Thus, the dust collection effect at the window is markedly enhanced, and the laser characteristics seriously deteriorate.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0092">On the other hand, in the laser modules according to the first embodiment, the collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are also contained in the light-source package <b>50</b>. Therefore, the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> after passage through the collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> pass through the transparent plate <b>53</b> at a location at which the diameters of the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> are great, i.e., at which the optical density is relatively low. Thus, the dust collection effect at the transparent plate <b>53</b> and the deterioration of the laser characteristics can be reduced.
<ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0093">(e) Since the package <b>40</b> containing the light-source package <b>50</b> and the condensing lens <b>15</b> is also hermetically sealed, it is possible to prevent contamination of the surfaces of the condensing lens <b>15</b> through which laser beams pass. In addition, the package <b>40</b> is hermetically sealed in such a manner that the sealing performance of the package <b>40</b> is lower than the sealing performance of the light-source package <b>50</b>. Therefore, it is possible to make the total cost of the packages <b>50</b> and <b>40</b> smaller than the cost of the conventional hermetically sealed package which contains all of the semiconductor laser elements, the collimator lenses, and the condensing lens. Thus, the laser module according to the first embodiment can be produced at low cost.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0094">Further, since the package <b>40</b> contains the light-source package <b>50</b>, the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> and the collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are doubly sealed off from the atmosphere with the packages <b>50</b> and <b>40</b>. Therefore, the effect of preventing contamination of the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> and the collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> is further enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0095">In addition, in the laser module according to the first embodiment, the light-source package <b>50</b> is filled with inert gas, so that entry of contaminated gas into the light-source package <b>50</b> is prevented. The inert gas may be, for example, nitrogen gas or rare gas. In addition, the inert gas may contain one or a mixture of oxygen gas, halogen gas, and halide gas at a concentration of 1 ppm or higher. For example, the light-source package <b>50</b> may be filled with the clean air, which is a mixture of nitrogen gas and oxygen gas at the same ratio as the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0096">In the case where the inert gas contains one or a mixture of oxygen gas, halogen gas, and halide gas at a concentration of 1 ppm or higher, the effect of preventing contamination is enhanced since oxygen gas, halogen gas, and halide gas cause decomposition of hydrocarbon components and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0097">When the oxygen content in the sealed atmosphere is 1 ppm or more, deterioration of the laser module can be suppressed more effectively. This is because the oxygen contained in the sealed atmosphere oxidizes and decomposes solid materials produced by photodecomposition of hydrocarbon components.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0098">The halogen gas includes chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>) gas, fluorine (F<sub>2</sub>) gas, and the like, and the halide gas includes gaseous compounds containing a halogen atom such as chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), or fluorine (F).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0099">Specifically, the halide gas includes CF3Cl, CF2Cl2, CFCl3, CF3Br, CCl4, CCl4-O2, C2F4Cl2, Cl—H2, PCl3, CF4, SF6, NF3, XeF2, C3F8, CHF3, and the like. Compounds of fluorine or chlorine with carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), or xenon (Xe) are preferable for use in the present invention, and compounds containing the fluorine atom are particularly preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0100">Although inclusion of even a very small amount of halogen-based gas (halogen or halide gas) produces the effect of suppressing the deterioration of the laser, in order to make the effect prominent, it is preferable that the concentration of halogen-based gas in the sealed atmosphere be 1 ppm or more. The inclusion of halogen-based gas in the sealed atmosphere suppresses the deterioration of the laser characteristics because the halogen-based gas in the sealed atmosphere decomposes deposited materials which are produced by photodecomposition of organic silicon compound gas.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0101">Further, in the laser module according to the first embodiment, the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the optical fiber <b>20</b> is also arranged in another package <b>60</b> which is hermetically sealed. Specifically, the package <b>60</b> is realized by the ferrule <b>24</b>, the transparent plate <b>21</b>, and the ferrule holder <b>22</b> in which the ferrule <b>24</b> is inserted. The light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the optical fiber <b>20</b> is arranged in the package <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0102">The package <b>60</b> is hermetically sealed as indicated in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0103">First, the resin coating of the optical fiber <b>20</b> in the vicinity of the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>is removed so as to expose the bare optical fiber <b>20</b><i>b</i>, the bare optical fiber <b>20</b><i>b </i>is inserted into the small hole formed through the center of the ferrule <b>24</b>, and fused with the ferrule <b>24</b> so that air cannot pass through the gap between the bare optical fiber <b>20</b><i>b </i>and the ferrule <b>24</b>. The outer surface of the ferrule <b>24</b> is metalized by evaporation or plating, and the end surface of the ferrule <b>24</b> in which the bare optical fiber <b>20</b><i>b </i>is inserted is polished into a spherical or planar shape, and then AR (antireflection) coated by evaporation. When the end surface of the ferrule <b>24</b> is AR coated, a jig designed for cooling the fiber coating is used so that the heat at the evaporated end of the bare optical fiber <b>20</b><i>b </i>does not propagate to the fiber coating during the evaporation. In advance, the entire surface of the ferrule holder <b>22</b> is gold plated, and degassing is performed. Then, the ferrule <b>24</b> is fixed to the ferrule holder <b>22</b> with the flux-free solder <b>25</b> so that air cannot pass through the gap between the ferrule <b>24</b> and the ferrule holder <b>22</b>. The surfaces on both sides of the transparent plate <b>21</b> are AR coated in advance, and the transparent plate <b>21</b> is also fixed to the ferrule holder <b>22</b> with a flux-free solder so that air cannot pass through the gap between the transparent plate <b>21</b> and the ferrule holder <b>22</b>. Thereafter, the ferrule holder <b>22</b> is fixed to the front plate <b>43</b> with the flux-free solder <b>23</b> so that air cannot pass through the gap between the ferrule holder <b>22</b> and the front plate <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0104">It is possible to adjust the position of the optical fiber <b>20</b> so that the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> converge at the center of the core of the bare optical fiber <b>20</b><i>b </i>on the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a</i>, by moving the ferrule holder <b>22</b> in the vertical and horizontal directions along the front plate <b>43</b> when the ferrule holder <b>22</b> is fixed to the front plate <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0105">The above construction related to the package <b>60</b> brings the following additional advantages.
<ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0016" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0106">(a′) In the above construction of the laser module according to the first embodiment, the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the optical fiber <b>20</b> is isolated from the atmosphere, it is possible to effectively prevent deposition of contaminants on the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a</i>, through which the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> enter the optical fiber <b>20</b> with high optical density. Alternatively, it is possible to prevent the contamination of the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>by covering the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>with a protection member made of a transparent material, instead of arranging the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>in the hermetically sealed package <b>60</b>.</li>
        <li id="ul0016-0002" num="0107">(b′) Even in the case where the package <b>60</b> is formed as explained above in addition to the light-source package <b>50</b>, it is possible to arrange the packages <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> in such a manner that the total volume of the hermetically sealed packages is smaller than the volume of a large, hermetically sealed package which contains all the constituents of the laser module, and therefore the total cost of the laser module can be reduced in comparison with the case where the above large, hermetically sealed package is used.</li>
        <li id="ul0016-0003" num="0108">(c′) Since the package <b>60</b> is hermetically sealed with a flux-free solder, it is possible to suppress emanation of volatile components which causes contamination, and prevent contamination of the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the optical fiber <b>20</b> with the volatile components. Alternatively, even in the case where the package <b>60</b> is hermetically sealed by one of fusion, welding, and adhesion using an adhesive which does not contain a silicon-based organic material, it is also possible to achieve similar advantages.</li>
        <li id="ul0016-0004" num="0109">(d′) It is preferable that the package <b>60</b> be filled with inert gas, and the inert gas contain one or a mixture of oxygen gas, halogen gas, and halide gas at a concentration of 1 ppm or higher. In this case, advantages similar to the advantages of the filler gas in the light-source package <b>50</b> are obtained.</li>
        <li id="ul0016-0005" num="0110">(e′) In the laser module according to the first embodiment, the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> emitted from the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> have a wavelength of 350 to 500 nm. That is, the optical energy is great, and the dust collection effect is enhanced. Since the deposition of contaminants is prevented in the laser module according to the first embodiment, the construction of the first embodiment of the present invention is particularly effective at preventing deposition of contaminants in the laser modules in which laser beams having the above wavelength are used.</li>
        <li id="ul0016-0006" num="0111">(f′) In the case where the one or more semiconductor laser elements emit a plurality of laser beams which are combined into a single laser beam in the optical fiber, the optical density at the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the optical fiber <b>20</b> becomes very great, and therefore the dust collection effect is enhanced. Since the deposition of contaminants on the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the optical fiber <b>20</b> is prevented by the provision of the package <b>60</b>, the provision of the package <b>60</b> is particularly effective at preventing deposition of contaminants in the laser modules in which the one or more semiconductor laser elements are arranged as above.</li>
        <li id="ul0016-0007" num="0112">(g′) For example, it is possible to stack four semiconductor laser elements in two layers (i.e., arrange a pair of semiconductor lasers as the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> in each of upper and lower layers), and combine laser beams emitted from the four semiconductor laser elements in an optical fiber as the optical fiber <b>20</b>. In the case where one or more semiconductor laser elements are arranged so that laser beams emitted from the one or more semiconductor laser elements are two-dimensionally arrayed along a plane perpendicular to the light-emission axes of the one or more semiconductor laser elements, the light-source package <b>50</b> is required to have a large volume. Since the light-source package <b>50</b> according to the present invention is small, the present invention is particularly effective at reducing the cost of a laser module in which the one or more semiconductor laser elements are arranged as above.</li>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0075" num="0113">Hereinbelow, the second embodiment of the present invention is explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which is a plan view, partly in cross section, of a laser module according to the second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0114">The laser module according to the second embodiment is basically different from the first embodiment in that magnifying condenser lenses <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> are used instead of the collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and the condensing lens <b>15</b>, and the light-source package <b>50</b> contains the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> and the magnifying condenser lenses <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>. In addition, in the second embodiment, the photodiodes <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>, which are arranged in the first embodiment for monitoring the backward emission light, are not used.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0115">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the laser module according to the second embodiment, the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> emitted from the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> are respectively collimated by the magnifying condenser lenses <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>, and converge on the core end face in the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the optical fiber <b>20</b>. Thus, the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> enter and propagate through the optical fiber <b>20</b>, so that the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> are combined and the combined laser beam CB is outputted from the optical fiber <b>20</b> with high intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0116">Since the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> and the magnifying condenser lenses <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> are contained in the light-source package <b>50</b>, it is possible to prevent contamination of the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> and the magnifying condenser lenses <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> in a basically similar manner to the prevention of contamination of the semiconductor lasers LD<b>1</b> and LD<b>2</b> and the collimator lenses <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0117">The laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> converge after passage through the magnifying condenser lenses <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>. However, the diameters of the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> are relatively large and the optical densities of the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> are relatively low at the position at which the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> pass through the transparent plate <b>53</b>, since the position of the transparent plate <b>53</b> is relatively near to the magnifying condenser lenses <b>61</b> and <b>62</b>. Therefore, the dust collection effect at the transparent plate <b>53</b> is not great, and thus deterioration of the laser characteristics can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0118">In addition, according to the second embodiment, an inert-gas-introduction tube <b>63</b> and an inert-gas-discharge tube <b>64</b> are arranged through the side plates <b>45</b> of the package <b>40</b> so that the inert gas such as nitrogen gas is supplied to the package <b>40</b> through the inert-gas-introduction tube <b>63</b>, circulates round the package <b>40</b>, and is discharged through the inert-gas-discharge tube <b>64</b>. Since the package <b>40</b> is filled with the inert gas as above, it is possible to prevent entry of contaminants into the package <b>40</b>, and deposition of the contaminants on the transparent plate <b>53</b> and a transparent plate <b>65</b> (inserted in the front plate <b>43</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) through which the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> pass.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0119">The above circulative supply of the inert gas is more effective in the laser module in which the output power of the laser beams B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> is high and the transparent plates <b>53</b> and <b>65</b> are likely to be contaminated. The above circulative supply of the inert gas can also be used in the laser module illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0120">Further, in the laser module according to the second embodiment, the optical fiber <b>20</b> is coupled to the package <b>40</b> in a different manner from the first embodiment. In the laser module according to the second embodiment, the tip-side portion (on the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the ferrule <b>24</b> in which the bare optical fiber <b>20</b><i>b </i>is inserted is inserted in a receptacle <b>70</b> which is formed to hold the ferrule <b>24</b>, and the receptacle <b>70</b> is fixed to the front plate <b>43</b> of the package <b>40</b> with the flux-free solder <b>23</b>. The tail-side portion (on the right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the ferrule <b>24</b> is inserted in a connector <b>71</b> in a slidable manner. In the connector <b>71</b>, the ferrule <b>24</b> is pressed toward the front plate <b>43</b> by a compression spring <b>72</b>. The connector <b>71</b> is fixed to the receptacle <b>70</b> by fitting with the receptacle <b>70</b> or by screwing the connector <b>71</b> onto the receptacle <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0121">Specifically, first, the tail-side portion of the ferrule <b>24</b> is inserted in the connector <b>71</b> in which the compression spring <b>72</b> is inserted in advance, and then the connector <b>71</b> is fixed to the receptacle <b>70</b> so that the tip-side portion of the ferrule <b>24</b> in which the bare optical fiber <b>20</b><i>b </i>is inserted is inserted into the receptacle <b>70</b>. At this time, the ferrule <b>24</b> is pressed by the compression spring <b>72</b> toward the transparent plate <b>65</b>, so that the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>in the ferrule <b>24</b> is pressed against the transparent plate <b>65</b> and brought into contact with the transparent plate <b>65</b>. Thus, it is possible to prevent deposition of contaminants on the light-entrance end face <b>20</b><i>a </i>or the transparent plate <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0122">Furthermore, the manner of coupling the optical fiber <b>20</b> to the package <b>40</b> is not limited to the manners used in the first and second embodiments.

<p id="p-0085" num="0123">Hereinbelow, termination of the optical fiber <b>20</b> and structures for connecting optical fibers are explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 8</figref>. The optical fiber <b>20</b> in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 8</figref> is an optical fiber which is terminated, and corresponds to the optical fiber <b>20</b> in either of the laser modules according to the first and second embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0124">&lt;First Structure&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0125">First, the first structure for connecting optical fibers and a manner of termination associated with the first structure are explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which is a cross-sectional side view of the first structure for connecting optical fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0126">In the first structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, near-end portions of two optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> are respectively inserted into and fixed to the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>, and flanges <b>115</b> and <b>116</b> each having an annular shape are fixed to the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> at vicinities of the rear ends of the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>, respectively. An O-ring <b>127</b> is placed around the ferrule <b>113</b> in contact with the inner face of the flange <b>115</b>, and an O-ring <b>128</b> is placed around the ferrule <b>114</b> in contact with the inner face of the flange <b>116</b>. The ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are inserted into a sleeve tube <b>120</b> constituting a connector <b>124</b> from both ends of the sleeve tube <b>120</b>. That is, the termination of the optical fiber <b>20</b> is realized by the attachment of the ferrule <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0127">The ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are formed of ceramic, glass, metal, or a combination of the ceramic, glass, and metal. In the case where the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are formed of ceramic or glass, it is preferable to metalize the side surfaces of the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> by metal plating or sputtering. After the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are fixed to the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b>, the tips of the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are polished into a spherical or planar shape.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0128">The sleeve tube <b>120</b> constituting the connector <b>124</b> has an internal diameter slightly greater than the external diameter of the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>. Flanges <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> are formed at both ends of the sleeve tube <b>120</b>, and a gas-introduction portion <b>123</b> having a through hole <b>123</b><i>a </i>which connects the inside and the outside of the sleeve tube <b>120</b> is arranged at approximately the middle of the length of the sleeve tube <b>120</b>. A screw thread is formed on the external surface of the gas-introduction portion <b>123</b>, and a valve <b>125</b> for closing the through hole <b>123</b><i>a </i>is fixed to the gas-introduction portion <b>123</b> by screwing the valve <b>125</b> onto the gas-introduction portion <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0129">The flanges <b>115</b> and <b>116</b> are fixed to the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> so that the gaps between the flanges <b>115</b> and <b>116</b> and the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are sealed along the entire circumferences of the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>, respectively, for example, at the positions indicated by black circles a in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by using, for example, a solder, which is preferably a flux-free solder not emanating organic gas.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0130">After the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are inserted into the sleeve tube <b>120</b> of the connector <b>124</b> from the front portions of the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>, the flanges <b>115</b> and <b>116</b> are fixed to the flanges <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> through the O-rings <b>127</b> and <b>128</b>, respectively, with an appropriate number of bolts <b>129</b>. Thus, the inside of the connector <b>124</b> is sealed off from the outside with the O-rings <b>127</b> and <b>128</b> and the flanges <b>115</b> and <b>116</b>. In addition, at this time, tips of the optical fiber cores are brought into contact with and pressed against each other, and the tips of the optical fiber cores are coaxially aligned. Thus, the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> are optically connected. Further, it is preferable that the O-rings <b>127</b> and <b>128</b> are made of a fluorocarbon polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0131">While the operation of connecting the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> is performed, inert gas is introduced into the connector <b>124</b> by placing the connector <b>124</b> in an atmosphere of inert gas as mentioned before, connecting the valve <b>125</b> to a vacuum pump (not shown), and reducing the internal pressure of the connector <b>124</b>. Thereafter, the valve <b>125</b> is closed. Thus, when the inside of the connector <b>124</b> is sealed up by inserting the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> as mentioned before, the inside of the connector <b>124</b> is filled with the inert gas.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0132">In the case where the connector <b>124</b> is filled with the inert gas as above, and at least portions of the tips of the cores of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> are not in contact, the at least portions are surrounded by the inert gas. Therefore, organic materials and the like which cause the aforementioned dust collection effect do not exist around the tips of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b>, and thus the light propagating through the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> does not cause the photochemical reaction. That is, the dust collection effect at the tips of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0133">In this example, laser light having a wavelength in the range of 350 to 500 nm, which is likely to cause the dust collection effect, propagates through the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b>. Therefore, use of the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is particularly effective.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0134">In the case where the inside of the connector <b>124</b> is degassed before the inert gas is introduced into the connector <b>124</b>, it is possible to suppress the dust collection effect with higher reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0135">In the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> are not fused. Therefore, the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> can be easily connected without an elaborated fusion machine. In addition, the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> can be easily detached from the connector <b>124</b> by loosening and taking out the bolts <b>129</b>. Thus, it is possible to easily reconnect the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> after the optical fibers are once connected.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0136">Further, in the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> can be automatically brought into coaxial alignment by simply inserting the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> into the sleeve tube <b>120</b>, which guides the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>. Therefore, the operation for alignment of the optical fibers is easy.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0137">Nitrogen gas and rare gas are preferable examples of the inert gas used in the above structure for connection of optical fibers. In addition, it is preferable that the inert gas contain one or a mixture of oxygen gas, halogen gas, and halide gas at a concentration of 1 ppm to 30%. The examples of the halogen gas and halide gas which are indicated to be preferable for use in the package <b>50</b> in the first embodiment are also preferable for use in the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0138">When the oxygen content in the inert gas is 1 ppm or more, deterioration of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> can be suppressed more effectively. This is because the oxygen contained in the inert gas oxidizes and decomposes solid materials produced by photodecomposition of hydrocarbon components. Alternatively, in order to contain oxygen in the sealed atmosphere, it is possible to fill the connector <b>124</b> with the clean air (i.e., the mixed gas having the composition of the atmosphere).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0139">Alternatively, when at least one of halogen gas and halide gas is contained in the inert gas, the inclusion of the at least one of halogen gas and halide gas in the inert gas can also effectively suppress deterioration of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> as the inclusion of oxygen gas. Although inclusion of even a very small amount of halogen or halide gas (halogen-based gas) produces the effect of suppressing the deterioration of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b>, in order to make this effect remarkable, it is preferable that the concentration of halogen or halide gas in the sealed atmosphere be 1 ppm or more. The inclusion of halogen or halide gas in the sealed atmosphere suppresses the deterioration of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> because the halogen or halide gas in the sealed atmosphere decomposes deposited materials which are produced by photodecomposition of organic silicon compound gas.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0140">Since the tips of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> are fixed so as to be in close contact, it is unnecessary to coat the tips with films. In the case where the tips are not coated with films, no steplike change occurs in the refraction index, and normally the coupling efficiency of the propagation light is maximized.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0141">However, it is possible to coat the tips with films when necessary. In this case, if the outermost layers of the films are made of a material which is reactive with halogen-based gas, such as oxides or nitrides of silicon (Si), molybdenum (Mo), chromium (Cr), tin (Sn), or zirconium (Zr), the outermost layers are likely to be etched, and therefore the reliability of devices using the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0142">Consequently, it is preferable that the outermost layers of the films covering the tips of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> be made of a material which is inert to halogen-based gas, such as oxides or nitrides of indium (In), gallium (Ga), aluminum (Al), titanium (Ti), or tantalum (Ta)</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0143">Further, the connector <b>124</b> can be filled with inert gas by introducing pressurized inert gas into the connector <b>124</b> through the valve <b>125</b>, instead of using the aforementioned process of introducing the inert gas.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0144">Furthermore, the connector <b>124</b> can be sealed by press-fitting the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> into the sleeve tube <b>120</b>, instead of using the O-rings <b>127</b> and <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0145">&lt;Second Structure&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0146">Next, the second structure for connecting optical fibers and a manner of termination associated with the second structure are explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which is a cross-sectional side view of the second structure for connecting optical fibers. In this case, the termination of the optical fiber <b>20</b> is also realized by attachment of the ferrule <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0147">In the second structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, near-end portions of two optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> are respectively inserted into and fixed to the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>, and the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are inserted into a cylindrical sleeve <b>130</b> from both ends of the cylindrical sleeve <b>130</b>. In addition, the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are fixed to the cylindrical sleeve <b>130</b> in such a manner that the tips of the optical fiber cores are in contact with and pressed against each other. The ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are fixed to the cylindrical sleeve <b>130</b> so as to be sealed along the entire circumferences of the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>, for example, at the positions indicated by black circles a in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by using, for example, a solder. The inside of the cylindrical sleeve <b>130</b> is filled with inert gas by fixing the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> to the cylindrical sleeve <b>130</b> in an inert gas atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0148">The second structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> has the same advantages as the first structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> except that it is impossible to reuse and reconnect the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> after the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> are once connected by using the second structure.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0149">In the first and second structures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, it is possible to use a liquid which is transparent to the light propagating through the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> and is not decomposed by the light, instead of the inert gas. In this case, the advantages of the first and second structures are not changed. An example of the above liquid is pure water.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0150">&lt;Third Structure&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0151">Next, the third structure for connecting optical fibers and a system containing the third structure are explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, which are a schematic perspective view and a cross-sectional side view of the third structure for connecting optical fibers and a peripheral system.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0152">In the system containing the third structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, a general connector <b>140</b> is contained in a container <b>160</b>, and the peripheral system is provided for circulating inert gas through the container <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0153">In the third structure, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, near-end portions of two optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> are respectively inserted into and fixed to the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>, and the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are inserted into a sleeve tube <b>141</b> from both ends of the sleeve tube <b>141</b>. In addition, outer tubes <b>143</b> and <b>144</b> hold the rear portions of the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>, respectively. In addition, the outer tubes <b>143</b> and <b>144</b> have through holes through which the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> pass. Further, a compression spring <b>145</b> is arranged between the bottom of the outer tube <b>143</b> and the ferrule <b>113</b>, and a compression spring <b>146</b> is arranged between the bottom of the outer tube <b>144</b> and the ferrule <b>114</b>. That is, the termination of the optical fiber <b>20</b> is realized by attaching the ferrule <b>113</b>, the outer tube <b>143</b>, and the compression spring <b>145</b> to the optical fiber <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0154">Male threads are formed on both near-end portions of the outer surface of the sleeve tube <b>141</b>, and female threads are formed on near-end portions of the internal surfaces of the outer tubes <b>143</b> and <b>144</b> so that the female threads engage with the male threads.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0155">The structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> is realized as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0156">First, the front portions of the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are inserted into the sleeve tube <b>141</b>, and the rear portions of the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are respectively inserted into the outer tubes <b>143</b> and <b>144</b>. Thereafter, the outer tubes <b>143</b> and <b>144</b> are engaged with the sleeve tube <b>141</b> by screwing the outer tubes <b>143</b> and <b>144</b> onto the sleeve tube <b>141</b> until the tips of the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are brought into contact. Then, the outer tubes <b>143</b> and <b>144</b> are further screwed forward on the sleeve tube <b>141</b> so that the tips of the ferrules <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> (i.e., the tips of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b>) are pressed against each other. Thus, the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> are optically connected.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0157">The container <b>160</b> has a two-part structure constituted by an upper part <b>161</b> and a lower part <b>162</b>. The upper and lower parts <b>161</b> and <b>162</b> are swingably connected by hinges <b>163</b>, and can be integrally fixed to each other by using latches <b>164</b>. A gas inlet <b>165</b> and a gas outlet <b>166</b> are arranged in the upper and lower parts <b>161</b> and <b>162</b>, respectively. Half-round openings are formed in opposite side walls of each of the upper and lower parts <b>161</b> and <b>162</b> so that cylindrical fiber passages <b>167</b> and <b>168</b> can be arranged through round openings in opposite side walls of the container <b>160</b>, where the round openings are realized by the half-round openings when the upper and lower parts <b>161</b> and <b>162</b> are integrally fixed to each other. The fiber passages <b>167</b> and <b>168</b> are formed of an elastic material such as fluorocarbon rubber, and have through holes through which the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> can be drawn in such a manner that the round openings in the opposite side walls of the container <b>160</b> are airtightly closed with the fiber passages <b>167</b> and <b>168</b> and the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> when the upper and lower parts <b>161</b> and <b>162</b> are integrally fixed to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0158">The gas inlet <b>165</b> and the gas outlet <b>166</b> are connected to gas-circulation piping <b>170</b>.

In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a fluid circulation system is realized by the gas-circulation piping <b>170</b> with the tank <b>171</b> and the gas pump <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0159">Before the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> are optically connected by using the connector <b>140</b> in the aforementioned manner, the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> are respectively threaded through the fiber passages <b>167</b> and <b>168</b>. The connector <b>140</b> is held on the bottom surface of the lower part <b>162</b>.

Thus, the connector <b>140</b> in which the tips of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> are optically connected is contained in the container <b>160</b>. In addition, in order to secure the airtightness between the upper and lower parts <b>161</b> and <b>162</b>, it is preferable that the edges of the upper and lower parts <b>161</b> and <b>162</b> which are to be brought into contact be coated with an elastic material such as fluorocarbon rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0160">After the connector <b>140</b> is contained in the container <b>160</b>, the gas pump <b>172</b> is activated, so that the inert gas stored in the tank <b>171</b> circulates through the container <b>160</b>. It is preferable that the inert gas is the same as that used in the first structure for connecting optical fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0161">In the case where the connector <b>140</b> is filled with the inert gas as mentioned before, and at least portions of the tips of the cores of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> are not in contact, the at least portions are surrounded by the inert gas.

The low-melting-point glass <b>181</b> is transparent to the light propagating through the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> and is not decomposed by the light.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0175">As indicated above, in the fourth structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the tips of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> including the tips of the cores are isolated from the outside by the low-melting-point glass <b>181</b> which is solidified after the molten low-melting-point glass <b>181</b> is supplied to the vicinities of the tips of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b>. Therefore, in the case where at least portions of the tips of the cores of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> are not in contact, the at least portions are in contact with the low-melting-point glass <b>181</b>. Thus, organic materials and the like which cause the aforementioned dust collection effect do not exist around the tips of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b>, and the light propagating through the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> does not cause the photochemical reaction. That is, the dust collection effect at the tips of the optical fibers <b>20</b> and <b>112</b> can be reliably suppressed.</p>

Therefore, the laser beams B<b>1</b>, B<b>12</b>, B<b>13</b>, B<b>14</b>, B<b>21</b>, B<b>22</b>, B<b>23</b>, and B<b>24</b> enter the optical fiber <b>20</b>, and are combined into a single combined laser beam CB, which is then outputted from the optical fiber <b>20</b> with high output power.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0179">The spread angle of each of the laser beams B<b>1</b>, B<b>12</b>, B<b>13</b>, B<b>14</b>, B<b>21</b>, B<b>22</b>, B<b>23</b>, and B<b>24</b> is different between the first direction parallel to the junction planes of the semiconductor laser element (parallel to the plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) and the second direction perpendicular to the junction planes. On the other hand, the numerical aperture of the optical fiber <b>20</b> is axisymmetric.

<p id="p-0142" num="0180"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a plan view of a portion of a laser module according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention. The laser module according to the fourth embodiment is different from the third embodiment in the optical condensing system. Specifically, the optical condensing system in the laser module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> comprises first and second cylindrical lenses <b>85</b> and <b>86</b> and a condensing lens <b>87</b>.

<p id="p-0143" num="0181">In the laser modules according to the third and fourth embodiments, it is possible to use light-source packages which are basically similar to the light-source packages used in the first and second embodiments.

<p id="p-0144" num="0182">In addition, the number of stacked layers in each of which semiconductor laser elements are arrayed is not limited to two, and may be three or more.</p>

The following optical condensing systems are identical in having a cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and an anamorphic lens <b>92</b> (which replace, for example, the aforementioned first cylindrical lens <b>80</b> and the second cylindrical lens <b>81</b> in the construction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), and different in the structure for fixing the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b>. Even when the following optical condensing systems are used, the aforementioned packages according to the present invention can be used. Therefore, the explanations on the packages are not repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0185">&lt;First Optical Condensing System&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0186"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a schematic perspective view of a first example of the optical condensing system used in the laser modules according to the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the X, Y, and Z directions are perpendicular to each other, the Y direction corresponds to the direction of the optical axis, and the Z direction is perpendicular to an upper surface <b>90</b><i>a </i>of a lens holder <b>90</b>, which holds the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the one or more laser beams emitted from the one or more semiconductor laser elements are collectively represented by the laser beam B. In the optical condensing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> condenses the laser beam B only in the X-Y plane, and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> condenses the laser beam B only in the Y-Z plane, in such a manner that the diameters of the converged laser beam at the core end face of the optical fiber (not shown) in the X and Y directions become desired values.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0187">The structures for fixing the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> in the optical condensing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0188">The cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> are fixed to the lens holder <b>90</b> by bonding the bottom surfaces <b>91</b><i>a </i>and <b>92</b><i>a </i>of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> to the upper surface <b>90</b><i>a </i>of the lens holder <b>90</b>, which is flat. The cylindrical lens <b>91</b> is formed by precision glass molding so that the bottom surface <b>91</b><i>a </i>is perpendicular to the symmetry plane of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> with the precision of +30″, where the symmetry plane of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> is a plane containing the normal to a rear-end surface <b>91</b><i>d </i>of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> (which is flat) and the central axis of the cylindrical surface of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b>. The anamorphic lens <b>92</b> is also formed by precision glass molding so that the bottom surface <b>92</b><i>a </i>of the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> is parallel to the symmetry plane of the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> with the precision of ±30″, where the symmetry plane of the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> is a plane containing the normal to a rear-end surface <b>92</b><i>d </i>of the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> (which is flat) and the central axis of the cylindrical surface of the anamorphic lens <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0189">The cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> are required to be aligned so that the straight line which is perpendicular to the rear-end surface <b>91</b><i>d </i>and intersects with the central axis of the cylindrical surface of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> is identical to the straight line which is perpendicular to the rear-end surface <b>92</b><i>d </i>and intersects with the central axis of the cylindrical surface of the cylindrical lens <b>92</b>. The identical straight line is the optical axis of the optical condensing system. Two conditions are necessary for realizing the above alignment. The first condition is that the projection of the central axis of the cylindrical surface of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> onto the Y-Z plane is perpendicular to the symmetry plane of the anamorphic lens <b>92</b>, and the projection of the central axis of the cylindrical surface of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> onto the Z-X plane is perpendicular to the central axis of the cylindrical surface of the anamorphic lens <b>92</b>. Since the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> are formed with the aforementioned precision, the first condition is automatically satisfied when the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> are placed on the flat upper surface <b>90</b><i>a </i>of the lens holder <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0190">The second condition is that the projection of the symmetry plane of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> onto the X-Y plane is perpendicular to the central axis of the cylindrical surface of the cylindrical lens <b>92</b>. Therefore, reference surfaces <b>91</b><i>b </i>and <b>92</b><i>b </i>respectively perpendicular to the symmetry planes (i.e., respectively parallel to the rear-end surfaces) of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> are formed on the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b>. Since the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> are formed by precision glass molding, the precision of the perpendicularity of the reference surfaces <b>91</b><i>b </i>and <b>92</b><i>b </i>can be maintained as high as ±30″.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0191">The orientations and the positions of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> are adjusted at the time of assembly of the optical condensing system as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0192">First, the orientations of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> are adjusted on the lens holder <b>90</b> so as to make the reference surfaces <b>91</b><i>b </i>and <b>92</b><i>b </i>parallel to each other, by use of a high-precision angle measurement device such as the laser auto-collimator having the precision of 10″. Thus, the projection of the symmetry plane of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> onto the X-Y plane becomes perpendicular to the central axis of the cylindrical surface of the cylindrical lens <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0193">Then, the relative positions between the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> in the X direction are adjusted so as to align the central position of the cylindrical lens <b>92</b> in the longitudinal direction with the symmetry plane of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b>. Thus, the orientations and the positions of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> are adjusted so that the straight line which is perpendicular to the rear-end surface <b>91</b><i>d </i>and intersects with the central axis of the cylindrical surface of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> coincides with the straight line which is perpendicular to the rear-end surface <b>92</b><i>d </i>and intersects with the central axis of the cylindrical surface of the cylindrical lens <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0194">While the above arrangement is maintained, the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> are fixed to the lens holder <b>90</b>, for example, by making an adhesive spread between the bottom surfaces <b>91</b><i>a </i>and <b>92</b><i>a </i>of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> and the upper surface <b>90</b><i>a </i>of the lens holder <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0195">As indicated above, when the optical condensing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is used, the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> can be aligned and fixed with high precision, without using a lens holder having a complex structure, for example, as indicated in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 10(1998)-213769. Therefore, a high-precision optical condensing system can be produced at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0196">&lt;Second Optical Condensing System&gt;</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0197"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a schematic perspective view of a second example of the optical condensing system used in the laser modules according to the present invention. In the optical condensing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a first positioning guide <b>90</b><i>b </i>and a second positioning guide <b>90</b><i>c </i>are formed on the upper surface <b>90</b><i>a </i>of the lens holder <b>90</b>. The first positioning guide <b>90</b><i>b </i>is arranged for positioning the cylindrical lens <b>91</b>, and has an internal side surface which is parallel to the Y-Z plane. The second positioning guide <b>90</b><i>c </i>is arranged for positioning the anamorphic lens <b>92</b>, and has an internal side surface which is parallel to the Y-Z plane. The cylindrical lens <b>91</b> is produced by precision glass molding and has a side surface <b>91</b><i>c</i>, which is parallel to the symmetry plane of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> with the high precision of ±30″, and located at a predetermined distance from the symmetry plane of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> with the precision of ±10 micrometers. The anamorphic lens <b>92</b> is also produced by precision glass molding and has a side surface <b>92</b><i>c</i>, which is perpendicular to the central axis of the cylindrical surface of the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> with the high precision of ±30″, and located at a predetermined distance from the center of the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> in the longitudinal direction of the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> with the precision of ±10 micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0198">Thus, the orientations and the positions of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> can be precisely adjusted by positioning the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> in such a manner that the side surface <b>91</b><i>c </i>of the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> is in contact with the internal side surface of the first positioning guide <b>90</b><i>b</i>, and the side surface <b>92</b><i>c </i>of the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> is in contact with the internal side surface of the second positioning guide <b>90</b><i>c</i>. That is, in the optical condensing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the cylindrical lens <b>91</b> and the anamorphic lens <b>92</b> can be positioned and aligned as in the optical condensing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0162" num="0200"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a schematic perspective view of a third example of the optical condensing system used in the laser modules according to the present invention. The optical condensing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is different from the optical condensing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> in that a third positioning guide <b>90</b><i>d </i>is further arranged on the upper surface <b>90</b><i>a </i>of the lens holder <b>90</b>.
