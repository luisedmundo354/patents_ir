<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This invention relates to strollers, particularly to such strollers used for jogging or running.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Running strollers are conventionally configured with a seating area for the infant and three wheels that can be utilized while running or jogging. Such vehicles are referred to as jogging strollers, whereby the parent, or other person, while pushing the infant therein, may conveniently exercise by jogging, or even running.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Originally, running strollers only had a forward facing seat. This made it difficult for the person pushing the stroller to see the rider in the seat. This forward facing arrangement was the only option for running stroller users. This configuration limits the versatility and safety of running strollers. Since the person pushing the stroller can't see the child face to face, the ability to easily check on each other is limited. This checking up is especially needed when the rider is a small infant and needs constant care and attention by an adult. Previous running strollers were designed so that the rider can face forward, into cold wind etc., for children that want to see what is before them but did not design for the need of the adult to be able to see and care for the child.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with an aspect of the invention, there is provided a jogging stroller with removable wheels, a collapsible frame, and a reversing directional seat which may be readily assembled and disassembled, which stroller is compact, stable and lightweight.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, several object and advantages of my invention are the ability to have the rider face to the rear. This allows the one pushing the stroller to see face to face with the rider. In addition, if the rider would like to face forward, this option is also easily available. Since the running stroller is reversible, the rider can face forward or rearward. Facing to the rear, the rider can avoid cold wind. Facing to the front, the rider can see before him. In addition, my invention allows for the ability to have the rider seated at varied degrees of reclining. This lets younger children that have less support of their head to be totally or partially reclined and for older children to sit up.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to the drawings, and particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> there is shown a multi-wheeled jogging stroller, generally designated <b>40</b>, which includes a frame assembly, generally designated <b>42</b>; angled tubes <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b</i>, wheels <b>2</b>-<b>4</b>, a handlebar assembly, generally designated <b>20</b>, <b>6</b>, and a seat <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the wheel support assembly <b>42</b> includes a rear axle assembly <b>5</b>. The rear wheels <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, as will be hereinafter described, include detachable axle stubs which are attached to opposite ends of the rear axle assembly <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">At the distal free ends, the upright tubes <b>7</b>, the handlebar <b>20</b>, handle tubes <b>6</b>, upper seat tubes <b>10</b>, and lower food support tubes <b>9</b>, are pivotally coupled together, such as by machine screw member or other such coupler. This pivot allows the upper seat members <b>10</b>, to rotate relative to the plane formed by the three points of contact of the wheels with the ground so that the seat <b>15</b>, turns inward and outward as seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. This turning allows for forward <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or rear facing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, of the rider.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> depict handlebar support members <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i>, handlebar support members may be made of a tubular section and a saddle-shaped member wherein the tubular section of the handlebar support member encircles the handlebar tube <b>20</b>. The end of the angled tubes <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i>, is positioned in the bight portion of the saddle-shaped member and releasably attached thereto with a removable pin <b>28</b> or similar such attachment. The handlebar supports <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>is formed with an angle between the tubular section and the saddle-shaped member such that when engaged with the handlebar and angled tube, there is an angle between the two tubes and therefore supports the handlebar at a usable and adjustable height.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The handlebar member <b>20</b> is pivotable from a first operative position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in which the bar portion is encircled within the handlebar support on one end and received on the angled tubes <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i>, within the length of the saddle-shaped member opening.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The saddle-shaped member of the handlebar supports <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i>, has a depth and length sufficient to enable opposing sidewalls to receive significant lengths of the angled tubes snugly and fully therein in the depth-wise and length-wise directions to provide stability at the coupling location so that wobbling and rattling is eliminated and the handlebar and the angled tubes act as an integral unit during use.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b> attached to one seat support members <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>, the seat support members may be made of a tubular section and a saddle-shaped member. The tubular section of the seat support member encircles the lower handlebar tube <b>6</b>. The end of the upper seat tube <b>10</b>, is positioned in the bight portion of the saddle-shaped member and may be releasably attached thereto with e.g. removable pin. The seat support members <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>are formed with various apertures which receive a removable pin or the like to provide for varying angles between the lower handle bar tubes <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>and the upper seat tubes <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>. This varying position allows for different reclined positions of the upper seat in either the rear facing configuration <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b> or forward facing configuration <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For the rear facing configuration, e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the seat support members <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>, rotates about the lower handlebar tubes <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>and receive the upper seat member <b>10</b>, in the bight thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The pin that passes through the aperture of the interconnector <b>22</b>, preferably achieves a snug fit and more preferably, the pin urges against the upper seat member <b>10</b>, which urges it against the lower handlebar member <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The upper seat members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>are connected at opposite ends of a span member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>, the handlebar <b>20</b> is generally U-shaped with opposing sides converging toward the front. In the operative positions, the lower handlebar tubes <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>are likewise arranged to be in general alignment with the side arms of the upper handlebar portion <b>20</b> and converge toward the front wheel <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A span support member <b>18</b>, can be formed of a tubular member or can be formed of a generally trapezoidally configured plate shaped injected plastic material of the like, as long as it is dimensioned for snugly attaching, such as by welding or riveting, to opposite sides of the handlebar tubes <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b </i>at a point proximate the outer diameter of the front wheel <b>2</b>, this span member <b>18</b> providing added front end stability.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The span support member <b>18</b>, is pivotally connected to a single support member <b>19</b> by a releasably attached interconnector, <b>17</b>. The interconnector <b>17</b>, releasably attaches by a pin <b>29</b>, (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) to the single support member <b>19</b>. The other end of the single support member <b>19</b>, is pivotally connected by an interconnector <b>16</b>, to the rear axle <b>5</b>, and provides support generally in tension while in use.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Best viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the lower seat tubes <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b</i>, are pivotally coupled at the upper end and coupled by rivets, screws, etc. to a support span <b>11</b>, at the other end. Although the support span <b>11</b> can be formed of a generally trapezoidally configured plate shaped injected plastic material or the like, and is dimensioned for snugly attaching, such as by welding or riveting, to opposite sides of the lower seat portions <b>9</b><i>a</i>, <b>9</b><i>b </i>but it is shown as a single tubular member in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The support span <b>11</b>, is pivotally coupled to an interconnector which is similar and preferably identical to the interconnector <b>14</b>. The interconnector <b>14</b> is made preferably in a T-shape and in tubular form. The top tubular section thereof rotates about the support span <b>11</b>, and couples with a support member in the lower tubular section. The lower tubular section is releasably attached by a pin to an interconnector <b>16</b>. The interconnector <b>16</b> is rotatably attached to the rear axle.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Best viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the frame is configured in its collapsed or folded state. The wheels are dismounted, pins removed, and releasably attached members are released. The single support member <b>19</b> is released from the interconnector <b>16</b> and the pivotally attached members are rotated as to generally overlay each other.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While the description has utilized directional references, such as up, down, front, rear, clockwise, etc., it is to be understood that these terms are utilized with reference to the orientations in the figures and are not intended to be limiting. The construction of the jogger stroller <b>40</b> is of aluminum can be of any suitable material with sufficient strength, which are all preferably of the same diameter, thus effecting economies of assembly. Furthermore, the exception of the handlebar portion <b>20</b>, and the upper seat tube <b>10</b>, all of the tubular stock consists of straight or linear lengths of material. The interconnectors and support members, such as <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, etc., are likewise formed of injected plastic of wall thickness sufficient to provide the required stability at the points of connection. In addition, the interconnectors which are configured to include pivot axes for one or more tubes are dimensioned and configured for providing support in the lengthwise directions of the tubes during operation of the stroller, with the spacing between opposing walls closely approximating the diameter of the tube sections therein for lateral as well a lengthwise stability.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In use, the stroller <b>40</b> is stable, convenient, and versatile. In side elevational view, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the sections which make up the handlebar form a generally straight line directed to the pivot <b>26</b>, at an angle from the horizontal, and then the sections from the pivot <b>26</b>, to the center of the front wheel <b>2</b>, at a lesser angle to the horizontal. Thus, there is a definite angle between the axis of the rear handlebar portion <b>20</b>, and the extension tubes <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b</i>, however, optimum pushing force toward the axis of the front wheel is not compromised.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The upper seat members <b>10</b>, form generally a straight line directed to the pivot <b>26</b>, and continue at an angle of approximately 140 degrees relative to itself. The upper seat members <b>10</b>, pivot about the corner of the bend. The bent shape sections <b>10</b><i>c</i>, <b>10</b><i>d </i>are the primary contact portion with the seat support members <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, with the large diameter wheels <b>2</b>-<b>4</b>, lateral stability is provided during movement.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, certain approximate dimensions are as follows:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0041">Distance between front and rear axles—34″.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0042">Distance between rear wheels—22″.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0043">Dimensions unfolded (wheels off)—30″ H, 43″ L, 20″ W.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0044">Dimensions folded—30″.times.20″.times.6″.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0045">Handlebar height—39″.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0046">Wheel size—20″ R, 20″ F.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0047">While there has been shown and described a preferred embodiment, other adaptations and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus the reader can see that the running stroller of the invention provides a highly versatile arrangement that allows the rider to face the person pushing the stroller. It also allows the rider to face forward in the direction of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">While this written description contains many details and specificities, these should not be understood as limitations on the overall scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of one preferred embodiment thereof. Many other variations are possible. For example, the upper seat members <b>10</b>, and the connecting span member <b>12</b>, could be formed into a single U-shaped member. The lower seat member <b>9</b>, and connecting span member <b>11</b> could also be a single U-shaped member. The color, size, and shape can be modified to allow for riders, single or multiple, of all sizes and preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0049">Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined not by the embodiments illustrated, but by the appended claims and their legal equivalents.</p>
