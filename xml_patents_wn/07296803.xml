<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a drill chucking device, and particularly, to a self-tightened reverse locking chuck.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As we all know, a drill chuck in the prior art generally comprises such parts as a body member, jaws, a nut, a nut jacket, a rolling member, an outer sleeve and a locking device. Three jaws are respectively received in three equally spaced angled bores of the body member, the nut is disposed in a nut groove of the body member, the threads of the nut engage with those on the jaws to form a thread transmission mechanism, the nut jacket is connected, with interference, to the nut, the exterior of the nut jacket is provided with the outer sleeve, the inner wall of the outer sleeve is provided with keys, the nut jacket or the nut are provided thereon with key slots, and the outer sleeve is connected to the nut jacket or the nut via the keys. In mounting and use, the body member is directly connected to a transmission shaft of a power-generating machine to drive the body member and further the three jaws and the clamped tool to rotate. The outer sleeve is rotated with hands so that the outer sleeve drives the nut to rotate via the nut jacket, the jaws are driven by the nut via threads to move forward and backward in the angled bores of the body member, thereby causing the three jaws to open or close and realizing the object of loosening or chucking a tool shank. The chuck of this kind is liable to loosen and release the tool shank if being vibrated. In a chuck having a locking device, for example in patented chuck U.S. Pat. No. 5,957,469, after the jaws clamp the tool shank, the locking device relatively secures the nut to the body member so that the nut cannot rotate relative to the body member due to vibration, thereby avoiding the loosening between the jaws and the tool shank. But when subject to relatively strong working resistance, due to elastic deformation of all parts, particularly of the jaws, the clamping force of the jaws for the tool shank will change in a working state so that the tool shank is likely to be loosened. In addition, there is another self-tightened chuck, for example the present applicant's utility model patent ZL00257070.X. In use of said chuck, the resisting moment functions to exert force to and tightly clamp the tool shank, but easily the jaws clamp the tool shank so tightly that the tool shank is hard to remove and that very often the tool shank can only be removed by virtue of specialized tools, therefore causing much inconvenience. Meanwhile, the drill chuck of this kind will automatically loosen and detach in the event of reverse rotation so that it cannot operate in the state of reverse rotation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Object of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The object of the present invention is to overcome the disadvantages in the prior art, and to provide a novel chuck for operations such as drilling and milling, which is reasonably configured, which can automatically exert force and clamp the tool shank and can refrain from exerting an excessive clamping force during operation, from which the tool shank can be conveniently manually removed, and meanwhile which can operate in both positive and reverse rotation states.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to achieve the above object, the technical solution of the present invention is: a chuck, comprising: a body member, jaws, a nut, a front sleeve and a rolling member, characterized in that a transmission connecting shaft and a spring ring are mounted, with a clearance fit, in a central hole or a rear end of the body member, a rear end of the transmission connecting shaft is connected to a drive sleeve, the drive sleeve has a plurality of drive keys at the front portion thereof, the nut is fixedly connected to an annular drive member, the annular drive member is provided thereon with a plurality of elastic drive detents, a movable ratchet wheel is provided between a thrust face of the body member and the nut, the surface between the movable ratchet wheel and the nut is an antifriction surface, a reverse locking ratchet wheel is fixedly mounted on the body member at a position adjacent to the movable ratchet wheel, a control ring and a detent lock ring are provided on the outer circumference of the movable ratchet wheel and the reverse locking ratchet wheel, the detent lock ring is provided with a plurality of elastic locking detents, the control ring is provided thereon with control keys corresponding to the elastic locking detents, and in that a control ring outer sleeve is provided outside of the drive sleeve and the detent lock ring.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The inner wall of the above drive sleeve can be provided with annular connecting slots; the reverse locking ratchet wheel can be integral with the body member; the annular drive member is provided with a plurality of drive slots; the elastic drive detents of the annular drive member have protrusions; the annular drive member can be integral with the nut jacket; the nut jacket can also be an independent piece and the annular drive member is integral with the detent lock ring; the detent lock ring is provided with a plurality of drive slots; the detent lock ring can have a plurality of connecting keys and the connecting keys have connecting portions at the end thereof; the control ring is provided with protrusions; the detent lock ring is provided with a plurality of drive slots; the inner surface of the control ring outer sleeve is provided with grooves, and the outer surface of the transmission connecting shaft is provided with annular slots; annular slots are provided in the central hole of the rear end of the body member; the inner bore of the drive sleeve is provided with serrations, and the drive sleeve is press fit connected to the transmission connecting shaft; the front portion of the body member is provided with a hole for a wrench or has a multi-prismy structure; the body member has annular protruding edges behind the thrust face.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Due to the above configuration, in the present invention, the transmission connecting shaft can be connected to a power-generating machine such as an electric portable drill and transmits the rotating torque. The transmission connecting shaft remains axially positioned to the body member through the spring ring. The drive keys of the drive sleeve are connected to the drive slots of the annular drive member and the detent lock ring so that the annular drive member, the nut and the detent lock ring can synchronously rotate together with the drive sleeve. The rotation of the transmission connecting shaft is transformed into the advance or retraction of the jaws, that is, clamping or loosening of the tool shank, via the threaded transmission of the nut and the jaws. In operation, the drive sleeve is manually rotated in the positive direction and the drive keys drive the drive slots of the detent lock ring and the protrusions on the elastic drive detents of the annular drive member so that the detent lock ring, the annular drive member, and the nut connected to the annular drive member can rotate together with the drive sleeve relative to the body member and the movable ratchet wheel, and the rotation of the nut drives the jaws to advance to clamp the tool shank. The control ring outer sleeve is rotated to drive the detent control ring to rotate and drive the locking detents of the detent lock ring to engage with the reverse locking ratchet wheel, thereby achieving the reverse locking. In this state, the antifriction surface between the nut and the movable ratchet wheel reduces the frictional resistance so that a greater clamping force can be obtained when the chuck is manually rotated to clamp the tool shank. In operation, when the working resisting moment is relatively great, the drive keys of the drive sleeve press the protrusions on the elastic drive detents of the annular drive member to deform inwardly, then the drive keys continue to advance relative to elastic drive detents, meanwhile driving the control ring and the detent lock ring to synchronously rotate; the elastic locking detents of the detent lock ring and reverse locking ratchet wheel will make relative leaping movement and generate a sound of “click, click” until the drive keys are in contact with the wall of the drive slots of the annular drive member. As drive keys press the protrusions on the elastic drive detents, the elastic drive detents are driven to deform in engagement with the movable ratchet wheel. When the working resistance further increases, the drive keys directly drive the drive slot wall of the annular drive member so that the annular drive member together with the nut tend to continue to rotate relative to the body member and the clamping force of the jaws to the tool shank will meanwhile tend to increase. As the clamping force of the jaws counteracts on the nut through threaded transmission to generate the axial pressure of the nut to the movable ratchet wheel, the frictional force between the movable ratchet wheel and the body member thrust face greatly increases, generating a frictional force moment that prevents the movable ratchet wheel together with the nut and the annular drive member from rotating relative to the body member. Because the frictional force moment functions to limit the rotation of the movable ratchet wheel, the annular drive member and the nut relative to the body member, the increase of the clamping force of the jaws to the tool shank is to some extend limited so that the clamping force cannot unlimitedly increase, so that the tool shank cannot be loosened upon completion of the operation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the above state, the elastic locking detents of the detent lock ring are in engagement with and is locked with the reverse locking ratchet wheel, whereby the tool shank will not loosen in the event of reverse rotation operation, thereby overcoming the disadvantage that a common self-tightened chuck cannot operate in the reverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">If the tool shank needs to be released, first the control ring outer sleeve is rotated so that the elastic locking detents disengage with the reverse locking ratchet wheel, then the drive sleeve is rotated in a reverse direction, and the jaws are driven to retract through the threaded transmission of the nut and the jaws to release the tool shank.</p>

The drive sleeve <b>5</b> is fixedly connected to a rear end portion <b>4</b>-<b>5</b> of the transmission connecting shaft; the affixation and connection is effected by means of making serrations <b>5</b>-<b>1</b> on the inner bore of the drive sleeve as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and then pressing the drive sleeve into the rear end portion <b>4</b>-<b>5</b> of the transmission connecting shaft, or by means of making the connecting bore of the drive sleeve as a flat bore <b>5</b>-<b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and then assembling the flat bore <b>5</b>-<b>2</b>, in interference relationship, with flat curved surface <b>4</b>-<b>2</b> of the transmission connecting shaft as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, or by means of threaded connection and then locking by punching marks, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, or by means of making the rear end of the transmission connecting shaft to have serrations <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and then pressing the read end together with the drive sleeve <b>5</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the drive sleeve <b>5</b> is mounted by inserting drive keys <b>5</b>-<b>4</b> in series into the drive slots <b>81</b>-<b>4</b> of the detent lock ring, drive slot middle portions <b>80</b>-<b>4</b> of the annular drive member, and control ring positions <b>82</b>-<b>1</b>. The movable ratchet wheel is mounted on the body member <b>1</b> with a play and in contact with a thrust face <b>1</b>-<b>1</b>, the reverse locking ratchet wheel is fixedly mounted on a body member surface <b>1</b>-<b>2</b>, the nut <b>2</b> is mounted in a nut groove <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> on the body member adjacent to the thrust face <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> and is in threaded engagement with the jaws <b>3</b>. The rolling member <b>7</b> is mounted between the nut <b>2</b> and the movable ratchet wheel <b>6</b>. The annular drive member <b>80</b> is affixed and connected to the nut <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the detent lock ring can be allowed to have a structure <b>51</b> having a connecting key <b>51</b>-<b>1</b>, the connecting key <b>51</b>-<b>1</b> is coupled to an annular groove <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> in the drive sleeve, and an annular protruding edge <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> on the body member prevents the connecting key <b>51</b>-<b>1</b> from moving backward relative to the body member, thus ensuring that the drive member connected to the connecting key and the transmission connecting shaft will not move backward relative to the body member. The drive sleeve can have a combined structure of an inner sleeve and an outer sleeve, as shown by the reference numerals <b>5</b> and <b>53</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The front sleeve can also have a combined structure as designated by reference numerals <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The combined function of the annular drive member <b>80</b> and the detent lock ring <b>81</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be replaced by a nut jacket <b>8</b> and the detent lock ring <b>51</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, whereby the control ring <b>82</b> is correspondingly replaced by the control ring <b>52</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The reverse locking ratchet wheel can have an end face ratchet structure denoted by the reference numeral <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the detent lock ring corresponding thereto has a combined structure of an upper end face elastic locking detent and a elastic drive detent on the outer peripheral wall as shown by the reference numeral <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, correspondingly the control ring is as shown by the reference numeral <b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and the outer ring outer sleeve is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention operates as follows: as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the transmission connecting shaft <b>4</b> is connected and secured to a transmission component of a power tool, the tool shank is placed between the jaws <b>3</b> and the body member <b>1</b>, the drive sleeve <b>5</b> and the front sleeve <b>10</b> are respectively held by both hands and rotated in opposite directions, and subsequent chucking and locking are effected in three phases: in the first phase, the drive sleeve <b>5</b> is rotated, drive keys <b>5</b>-<b>4</b> drive the detent lock ring <b>81</b> and the control ring <b>82</b> to rotate, meanwhile the drive keys <b>5</b>-<b>4</b> contact and thereby drive the protrusions <b>80</b>-<b>1</b> on the elastic drive detents of the annular drive member to enable the annular drive member <b>80</b> to rotate together with the drive sleeve <b>5</b>, the detent lock ring <b>81</b> and the control ring <b>82</b>, meanwhile the nut <b>2</b> secured to the annular drive member also rotates, and the jaws <b>3</b> are moved forward via thread transmission to clamp the tool shank. The operation mode and resultant clamping force in the first phase are similar to those of a common manually tightened drill chuck. In the second phase, the control ring outer sleeve <b>83</b> is rotated, and the control ring <b>82</b> is meanwhile driven to rotate in the same direction due to the engagement between grooves <b>83</b>-<b>1</b> of the control ring outer sleeve and protrusions <b>82</b>-<b>2</b> on the control ring, the control keys <b>82</b>-<b>3</b> of the control ring press the protrusions <b>81</b>-<b>2</b> on the elastic locking detents of the detent lock ring to make the elastic locking detents flex and deform until the protrusions <b>82</b>-<b>2</b> of the control ring are in contact with the drive keys <b>5</b>-<b>4</b> of the drive sleeve, whereby the elastic locking detents <b>81</b>-<b>3</b> engage with the ratchets of the reverse locking ratchet wheel to thereby achieve the reverse locking. In the state of reverse locking, when the power tool drives the chuck and the tool to rotate in a reverse direction, the jaws <b>3</b> of the chuck will not release the tool shank, thereby preventing the disadvantage that a common self-tightened drill chuck cannot operate in an opposite direction. Following the above two phases comes the third phase. In the third phase, during operations such as drilling and milling, if the resisting moment in work is greater than the corresponding elastic force that the protrusions <b>80</b>-<b>1</b> on the elastic drive detents of the annular drive member can bear, the dynamic force, which is in balance with the resisting moment in work, allows the drive keys <b>5</b>-<b>4</b> to press protrusions <b>80</b>-<b>1</b> on the elastic drive detents to deform inwardly and then to continue to move forward, meanwhile driving the control ring <b>82</b> and the detent lock ring <b>81</b> to synchronously rotate; the elastic locking detents <b>81</b>-<b>3</b> of the detent lock ring and the ratchets <b>50</b>-<b>1</b> of the reverse locking ratchet wheel will make relative leaping movement and generate a sound of “click, click”; the drive keys <b>5</b>-<b>4</b> move forward until they are in contact with the drive slot wall <b>80</b>-<b>3</b> of the annular drive member, whereby the elastic drive detents <b>80</b>-<b>2</b> of the annular drive member deform under the pressing of the drive keys <b>5</b>-<b>4</b> and thereby are in engagement with the ratchets <b>6</b>-<b>1</b> of the moveable ratchet wheel <b>6</b>, and in this state, the annular drive member <b>80</b> and the nut <b>2</b> can only make synchronous and positive movement together with the movable ratchet wheel <b>6</b>. As the operation resistance continues to increase, the moment of force that the jaws <b>3</b> holding the tool shank transmit to the nut <b>2</b> via thread transmission increases, the axial pressure exerted by the nut <b>2</b> onto the movable ratchet wheel <b>6</b> and the body member thrust face <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> via the rolling member <b>7</b> also increases, and meanwhile the frictional resisting moment between the movable ratchet wheel <b>6</b> and the body member thrust body <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> increases. The frictional resisting moment restricts the drive keys <b>5</b>-<b>4</b> in driving the annular drive member <b>6</b> and the nut <b>2</b> to rotate relative to the body member <b>1</b>, thereby restricting the relative movement between the threads of the nut <b>2</b> and the threads of the jaws <b>3</b>, and eventually resulting in the restriction of unlimited increase of the clamping force that the jaws <b>3</b> exert on the tool shank.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">When the tool shank needs to be released, what to be done is rotated the control ring outer sleeve <b>83</b> along with the control ring <b>82</b> to allow the control keys <b>82</b>-<b>3</b> of the control ring to release the pressure on the protrusions <b>81</b>-<b>2</b> on the elastic locking detents of the detent lock ring and to move to the inwardly recessed positions <b>81</b>-<b>1</b> of the elastic detents of the detent lock ring such that the elastic locking detents <b>81</b>-<b>3</b>, due to the elastic restoring force, release the engagement with the ratchets <b>50</b>-<b>1</b> of the reverse locking ratchet wheel. The drive sleeve <b>5</b> and the front sleeve <b>18</b> are rotated in opposite directions such that the drive keys <b>5</b>-<b>4</b> pass over the protrusions <b>80</b>-<b>1</b> on the elastic drive detents, contact with the drive slot wall <b>80</b>-<b>4</b> of the annular drive member, and drive the annular drive member along with the threads of the nut <b>2</b> and the jaws <b>3</b> to make a relative movement in opposite directions, and the jaws <b>3</b> move backward and thereby release the clamping of the tool shank.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an embodiment having no reverse locking device, and the structure as illustrated is used for an operation in which no reverse rotation is involved. The reference numeral <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> denotes the annular drive member. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The numeral <b>70</b>-<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> denotes a connecting key of the drive detent <b>70</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
