<heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to extendible legs for vehicles, and more particularly, an improved extendible leg suitable for use as a leveling leg for recreational vehicles and landing gear for semi-trailers.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Vehicles, such as a recreational vehicle or semi-trailers, incorporate extendible legs to support, level, or raise the vehicle. Semi-truck trailers utilize extendible legs as landing gear legs in a landing gear assembly to raise and support the front of the trailer when disengaged from a semi-truck tractor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recreational vehicles, such as motor homes, trailers, and the like, often include one or more extendible legs proximal each end of the recreational vehicle. The legs can be extended individually, or as part of a vehicle leveling system, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,391, to level the recreational vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A typical semi-truck tractor and trailer are attached utilizing a “fifth wheel” type connection. A fifth wheel connection has a lubricated flat swivel plate and catch assembly mounted on the semi-truck tractor to engage a corresponding lubricated flat swivel plate and downwardly protruding “king pin” mounted on the underside of the forward portion of the trailer. The trailer king pin is received in a slot in the tractor swivel plate where it engages the tractor catch assembly locking the tractor and trailer together.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to disengage the tractor from the trailer, landing gear legs mounted on a forward section of the trailer are extended to the ground raising the king pin upwardly disengaging it from the catch assembly. Upon disengagement, the tractor pulls away from the trailer which is now supported by trailer rear wheels and the landing gear.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Known extendible legs, suitable for use as a landing gear leg and leveling leg, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,307,896, are formed with interfitting box-section supporting members. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,307,896, the interfitting box-sections have a axially driven ground engaging member telescopically interfitted with a box-like fixed member which is mounted to the vehicle. The ground engaging member telescopes between a retracted position and an extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Typically the axially driven ground engaging member is manually or electrically driven in the telescoping direction. The driven member can be damaged when the driven member abruptly reaches the end limit of travel at either the extended or retracted position. In electrically driven landing gear, when the driven member abruptly reaches the end limit, the motor forming part of the drive mechanism remains energized until the operator turns the motor off, or the motor amperage exceeds a predetermined level which signals a control system controlling the motor to deenergize the motor. The sudden stop at the end limit can damage the drive mechanism and/or the members, and continued energization of the motor can cause the motor to overheat.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In recreational vehicle leveling legs, in order to withstand the forces exerted on the legs, the leg members are typically formed from tubes formed to tight tolerances to minimize gaps between the fixed leg member and the driven leg member. Providing tubes built to tight tolerances increases the cost of the leg. The tubes then form part of welded assemblies that provide a rigid structure to further strengthen the leg. Unfortunately, the welded assemblies are practically impossible to disassemble. As a result, if an internal component, such as a bearing, nut, thread screw, and the like fail, the entire landing gear is replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Legs having a ground engaging member axially driven by a thread screw engaging a nut have additional problems. Radial and axial forces exerted on the thread screw are transferred to a drive shaft extending from the landing gear drive mechanism and rotatably driving the thread screw. These forces can cause the drive mechanism to bind and/or prematurely fail. In addition, side loads exerted on the ground engaging member of the landing gear can misalign the screw with the nut causing the screw and nut to bind or completely fail. Accordingly, a need exists for an improved extendible leg that overcomes one or more of the above problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention provides an extendible leg adapted for mounting to a vehicle. The leg includes an outer member telescopically receiving an inner member. The inner member is telescoped slidably into the outer member, and has a first end extending axially beyond said outer member. A nut is fixed relative to the inner member. A rotatable screw is axially fixed relative to the outer member and threadably engaging the nut, wherein rotation of the screw axially drives the nut to axially move the inner member relative to the outer member.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A general objective of the present invention is to provide an improved extendible leg that solves one or more of the above deficiencies in the prior art. This is accomplished by providing an extendible leg including one or more of the features described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In particular, in one embodiment disclosed herein the extendible leg includes a thread screw that threadably engages a nut to axially drive the inner member telescopically in the outer member. The thread screw and nut are detachably fixed to the outer member and inner member, respectively to simplify disassembly of the landing gear for service.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another embodiment disclosed herein, the extendible leg includes a resilient member interposed between the inner member and the nut. The resilient member allows the inner member to pivot relative to the outer member in order to maintain the screw substantially aligned with the nut upon deflection of the inner member relative to the outer member by a side load.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In yet another embodiment disclosed herein, the extendible leg includes a biasing member interposed between an outer member assembly including the screw and an inner member assembly including the nut. The biasing member cushions the inner member relative the outer member as the inner member approaches a travel limit.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet another embodiment disclosed herein, the extendible leg includes a low friction material interposed between inner and outer surfaces of the outer and inner members. The low friction material close the gap between the inner and outer members formed from standard sized tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Finally, in another embodiment disclosed herein, the extendible leg includes a drive shaft coupled to the screw by a connecting assembly that transfers axial and radial forces from the screw to the outer member. The connecting assembly minimizes forces that are transferred from the screw to the drive shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The foregoing and other objects and advantages of the invention will appear from the following description. In the description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which there is shown by way of illustration a preferred embodiment of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, a vehicle <b>10</b>, such as a recreational vehicle trailer, motor home, semi-trailer, and the like, has a vehicle leveling system comprising extendible legs <b>12</b>. Preferably, the system includes at least one leg <b>12</b> at each end of the vehicle <b>10</b> to level the vehicle <b>10</b>. Most preferably, the system includes a leg <b>12</b> proximal each corner of the vehicle <b>10</b>. Each leg <b>12</b> has an outer member <b>16</b> and a telescoping inner member <b>18</b>. The telescoping inner member <b>18</b> is forcibly slidably driven by a drive mechanism <b>22</b> between a retracted and an extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The extendible legs <b>12</b> can be driven independently by separate drive mechanisms <b>22</b>, such as described herein, or by a single drive mechanism coupled to two or more legs <b>12</b>, without departing from the scope of the invention. Regardless of whether the legs <b>12</b> are driven independently, or both are driven by a single drive mechanism <b>22</b>, the structure of the extendible legs <b>12</b> is substantially identical. Accordingly, one leg <b>12</b> will be described with the understanding that the description applies to the other legs <b>12</b>, as well.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the extendible leg <b>12</b> includes the tube shaped outer member <b>16</b> having a first end <b>24</b> rigidly mounted to the drive mechanism <b>22</b> and an open second end <b>26</b>. Preferably, the outer member <b>16</b> is a square tube, formed from steel or other suitable material having similar strength characteristics. An outer member top plate <b>92</b> that covers the top of the outer member first end <b>24</b> is bolted to the gear box <b>68</b> to rigidly fix the outer member <b>16</b> relative to the drive mechanism <b>22</b>. Although a square tube is described herein, any shaped tube may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention. Moreover, the tube shaped outer member <b>16</b> can be formed from a single length of tube shaped material or two or more pieces of material, such as a length of U-shaped material joined to a plate forming the tube shaped outer member <b>16</b>, to reduce material costs without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The inner member <b>18</b> has a shape corresponding to the outer member <b>16</b> with a first end <b>28</b> disposed inside the outer member <b>16</b> and a second end <b>32</b> extending out of the outer member second end <b>26</b>. A top plate <b>34</b> fixed, such as by welding, to the first end <b>28</b> of the inner member <b>18</b> closes the inner member first end <b>28</b> and includes a center aperture <b>36</b> for receiving a thread screw <b>38</b> therethrough. A bottom plate <b>42</b> fixed, such as by welding, to the second end <b>32</b> of the inner member <b>18</b> closes the inner member second end and includes a threaded aperture <b>44</b> for bolting a foot <b>46</b> thereto. The outer surface <b>48</b> of the inner member <b>18</b> can be proportioned so as to form a close sliding fit within the inner surface <b>52</b> of the outer member <b>16</b>. Engagement between the inner and outer surfaces <b>52</b>, <b>48</b> provides structural support to the inner and outer members <b>18</b>, <b>16</b>. Preferably, the inner member <b>18</b> is formed from the same or similar material as the outer member.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the inner and outer members <b>18</b>, <b>16</b> are formed from standard size tube steel which does not provide a close sliding fit, and instead, forms a gap <b>54</b> between the inner and outer surfaces <b>52</b>, <b>48</b> of the outer and inner members <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, respectively. A low friction wear sleeve <b>56</b> formed from a low friction material, such as Ultra High Molecular Weight (UHMW) material, plastic impregnated with a lubricant, bronze, and the like, is fixed in the gap <b>54</b> to radially support the inner member <b>18</b> as the inner member <b>18</b> moves axially relative to the outer member <b>16</b>. Advantageously, the wear sleeve <b>56</b> radially supports the inner member <b>18</b> as the inner member <b>18</b> moves axially relative to the outer member <b>16</b> while minimizing friction between the inner and outer members <b>18</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Preferably, the wear sleeve <b>56</b> includes a sleeve body <b>57</b> having a first end <b>58</b> and a second end <b>59</b> joined by inner and outer surfaces <b>60</b>, <b>61</b>. The inner surface <b>60</b> of the wear sleeve body <b>57</b> slidably engages the outer surface <b>48</b> of the inner member <b>18</b>. Outwardly extending cam surfaces <b>63</b> formed on the wear sleeve outer surface <b>61</b> frictionally engage the inner surface <b>52</b> of the outer member <b>16</b> to fix the wear sleeve <b>56</b> in the second end <b>26</b> of the outer member <b>16</b> by a friction fit. A flange <b>65</b> extending outwardly from the second end <b>59</b> of the wear sleeve <b>56</b> engages the second end <b>26</b> of the outer member <b>16</b> to prevent the wear sleeve <b>56</b> from sliding axially into the outer member <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although a wear sleeve <b>56</b>, such as described above is preferred because fixing the wear sleeve <b>56</b> to the outer member is simple and easy, any shaped low friction material that fills the gap <b>54</b> between the inner and outer surfaces <b>52</b>, <b>48</b> of the outer and inner member <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> can be provided without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, one or more strips of low friction material can be fixed to one of the inner and outer surfaces <b>52</b>, <b>48</b> using any method known in the art, such as adhesives, mechanical fasteners, and the like, to radially support the inner member <b>18</b> as the inner member <b>18</b> moves axially relative to the outer member <b>16</b> while minimizing friction between the inner and outer members <b>18</b>, <b>16</b> without departing from the scope of the invention. Moreover, a second wear sleeve (not shown) can be fixed to the inner member <b>18</b> proximal the first end <b>28</b> of the inner member <b>18</b> in addition to the wear sleeve <b>56</b> fixed to the outer member <b>16</b> proximal the second end <b>26</b> of the outer member <b>16</b> without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>5</b>-<b>8</b>, the inner member <b>18</b> is axially driven telescopically relative to the outer member <b>16</b> between a retracted position and an extended position by the drive mechanism <b>22</b>. Preferably, the drive mechanism <b>22</b> rotatably drives a ball screw assembly <b>62</b> having a thread screw <b>38</b> threadably engaging a ball nut <b>64</b> resiliently fixed relative to the inner member <b>18</b>. The drive mechanism <b>22</b> include, a drive shaft <b>66</b> extending from a gear box <b>68</b>. The drive shaft <b>66</b> is coupled to the thread screw <b>38</b> by a connecting assembly <b>72</b>. The gear box <b>68</b> is driven by an electric motor <b>74</b> to rotatably drive the drive shaft <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The gear box <b>68</b> houses a gear train (not shown) driven by the electric motor <b>74</b> that rotatably drives the drive shaft <b>66</b>. The drive shaft <b>66</b> has a first end <b>67</b> extending into the gear box <b>68</b> and coupled to the gear train. A second end <b>69</b> of the drive shaft <b>66</b> extends out of the gear box <b>68</b> and is coupled to the connecting assembly <b>72</b>. Preferably, the drive shaft second end <b>69</b> includes a transverse through hole <b>70</b> that receives a drive shaft pin <b>71</b> having a length greater than the drive shaft diameter, such that the ends <b>73</b> of the drive shaft pin <b>71</b> extend beyond the shaft diameter to rotatably fix the drive shaft <b>66</b> relative to a first coupler <b>106</b> forming part of the connecting assembly <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The connecting assembly <b>72</b> transfers axial and radial forces from the thread screw <b>38</b> to the outer member <b>16</b> to prevent damage to the gear box <b>68</b> coupling the electric motor <b>74</b> to the drive shaft <b>66</b>. Rotational forces are transmitted from the drive shaft <b>66</b> to the thread screw <b>38</b> by a connecting shaft <b>76</b> forming part of the connecting assembly <b>72</b>. Preferably, the connecting assembly <b>72</b> is detachably fixed to the outer member <b>16</b> proximal the outer member first end <b>24</b>, and includes a weight bracket <b>78</b> fixed to the outer member <b>16</b> by transversely extending bolts <b>82</b> which transfer forces to the outer member <b>16</b> and simplify assembly and disassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The weight bracket <b>78</b> includes a bracket top plate <b>84</b> joined to a bracket bottom plate <b>86</b> by bracket side plates <b>88</b> to form a tube having a rectangular cross section. A shaft aperture <b>94</b> formed through the outer member top plate <b>92</b>, bracket top plate <b>84</b>, and bracket bottom plate receives the drive shaft <b>66</b> and connecting shaft <b>76</b>. Aligned apertures <b>96</b> formed through the bracket side plates <b>88</b> are aligned with apertures <b>98</b> formed through the outer member <b>16</b> and receive the transversely extending bolts <b>82</b>. Advantageously, the apertures <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> are positioned to locate the bolts <b>82</b> on opposing sides of the shaft aperture <b>94</b> with the shafts <b>66</b>, <b>76</b> extending through the shaft aperture <b>94</b> between the bolts <b>82</b>. Nuts <b>102</b> threading engaging the bolts <b>82</b> secure the bolts <b>82</b> relative to the weight bracket <b>78</b> and outer member <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The drive shaft <b>66</b> is coupled to the first end <b>104</b> of the connecting shaft <b>76</b> by the rotatable, cylindrical first coupler <b>106</b> received in the weight bracket shaft aperture <b>94</b>. The second end <b>69</b> of the drive shaft <b>66</b> is received in a first end <b>107</b> of the first coupler <b>106</b>, and a through hole <b>114</b> formed through the first end <b>107</b> of the first coupler <b>106</b> receives the ends <b>73</b> of the drive shaft pin <b>71</b> to rotatably fix the drive shaft <b>66</b> relative to the first coupler <b>106</b>. A first coupler pin <b>108</b> extending radially through a through hole <b>112</b> formed through the first coupler <b>106</b> and aligned with a through hole <b>116</b> formed through the connecting shaft <b>76</b> connects the first coupler <b>106</b> to the connecting shaft <b>76</b> to rotatably couple the drive shaft <b>76</b> to the connecting shaft <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Advantageously, the drive shaft <b>66</b> is axially slidably received in the first coupler <b>106</b> to simplify assembly and disassembly. Moreover, the drive shaft pin ends <b>69</b> can extend into a transverse slot <b>110</b> formed in the first end <b>107</b> of the first coupler <b>106</b> to allow the first coupler <b>106</b> to float axially relative to the drive shaft <b>66</b> to further minimize axial forces being transmitted to the drive shaft <b>66</b>. Although, the above arrangement is preferred, the drive shaft <b>66</b> can be coupled to the connecting shaft <b>76</b> using other methods known in the art, such as by directly connecting the drive shaft <b>66</b> to the connecting shaft <b>76</b>, without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A downwardly opening cup-shaped cage <b>124</b> fixed, such as by welding, to the bracket bottom plate <b>86</b> includes a shaft aperture <b>126</b> coaxial with the weight bracket shaft aperture <b>94</b>. A second end <b>136</b> of the connecting shaft <b>76</b> extends through the cage shaft aperture <b>126</b> and is coupled to the ball screw assembly thread screw <b>38</b> by a second coupler <b>134</b>. Of course, the cage <b>124</b> can be fixed to the weight bracket <b>78</b> using other methods known in the art, such as mechanical fasteners and the like, or be allowed to float axially, without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The downwardly opening cup-shaped cage <b>124</b> defines a cavity <b>128</b> that receives a thrust bearing <b>132</b> that radially supports the connecting shaft <b>76</b>. The thrust bearing <b>132</b> can be any bearing known in the art capable of transmitting axial forces. The particular thrust bearing selected for a particular application is dependent upon the connecting shaft diameter and the radial and axial forces expected in the application.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The second rotatable coupler <b>134</b> connected to the second end <b>136</b> of the connecting shaft <b>76</b> and a first end <b>138</b> of the thread screw <b>38</b> engages the thrust bearing <b>132</b>. The thrust bearing <b>132</b> is axially interposed between the second coupler <b>134</b> and cage <b>124</b> and transmits axial and radial forces from the thread screw <b>38</b> through the cage <b>124</b> and weight bracket <b>78</b> into the outer member <b>16</b> through the bolts <b>82</b>. Forces exerted on the outer member <b>16</b> are transferred to the vehicle <b>8</b> through a mounting plate <b>148</b> to prevent internal damage to the gear box <b>68</b>. Advantageously, the axial forces exerted on the thread screw <b>38</b> are substantially transferred to the outer member <b>16</b> and not to the drive shaft <b>66</b> to minimize damage to the drive mechanism. Although a cage <b>124</b> securing the thrust bearing <b>132</b> relative to the weight bracket <b>78</b> is preferred, the thrust bearing <b>132</b> can be fixed relative to the weight bracket <b>78</b> without the cage <b>124</b>, such as by securing the thrust bearing <b>132</b> directly in shaft aperture <b>94</b> formed in the weight bracket <b>78</b>, without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Preferably, radially extending through holes <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> formed through the second coupler <b>134</b> are aligned with radially extending through holes <b>156</b>, <b>158</b> formed through each of the connecting shaft <b>76</b> and thread screw <b>38</b> to receive pins <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> that connect the second coupler <b>134</b> to the connecting shaft <b>76</b> and thread screw <b>38</b>. The pins <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> rotatably fix the connecting shaft <b>76</b> relative to the thread screw <b>38</b> to transfer the rotational forces from the drive shaft <b>66</b> to the thread screw <b>38</b>. However, any method known in the art for rotatably fixing shafts together, such as flexible shaft couplings, directly connecting the shafts together without a coupler, and the like, can be used without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The connecting shaft <b>76</b> rotatably drives the thread screw <b>38</b> of the ball screw assembly <b>62</b> to axially drive the ball nut <b>64</b>, and thus the inner member <b>18</b>, relative to the outer member <b>16</b>. The thread screw <b>38</b> is an elongated shaft that extends from the first end <b>138</b> connected to the second coupler <b>134</b> and through the aperture <b>36</b> formed in the inner member top plate <b>34</b> into the inner member <b>18</b> to a second end <b>168</b>. A ball nut stop <b>170</b> fixed proximal the second end <b>168</b> of the thread screw <b>38</b> prevents the thread screw <b>38</b> from disengaging the ball nut <b>64</b> past the thread screw second end <b>168</b>. Threads (not shown) formed in the outer surface of the thread screw <b>38</b> between the thread screw first and second ends <b>138</b>, <b>168</b> threadably engage the ball nut <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>9</b>-<b>12</b>, the ball nut <b>64</b> includes a rectangular body <b>172</b> having a cylindrical upper collar <b>174</b>. An axially extending bore <b>176</b> formed through the ball nut <b>64</b> includes internal helical grooves (not shown). The grooves align with the helical threads formed in the outer surface of the thread screw <b>38</b> to define an internal ball path. Balls (not shown) circulating through the ball path engage the thread screw <b>38</b> to threadably engage the thread screw <b>38</b> with the ball nut <b>64</b>. External ball returns <b>178</b> circulate the balls through the internal ball path. Although a thread screw <b>38</b> and ball nut <b>64</b> are preferred for certain applications, acme screws including a threaded shaft threadably engaging threads in a threaded nut fixed relative to the inner member <b>18</b> can be used without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A ball nut top plate <b>182</b> fixed, such as by welding, to the ball nut <b>64</b> extends outwardly from the ball nut collar <b>174</b>. Bolt holes <b>184</b> formed in each corner of the top plate <b>182</b> are aligned with threaded bolt holes <b>186</b> formed through the inner member top plate <b>34</b>. Bolts <b>188</b> including a head <b>190</b> with a threaded shaft <b>194</b> extending through the nut top plate bolt holes <b>184</b> and threadably engaging the inner member top plate bolt holes <b>186</b> detachably fix the nut top plate <b>182</b>, and thus the nut <b>64</b> relative to the inner member <b>18</b>. Preferably, the ball nut top plate bolt holes <b>184</b> have a diameter that is greater than the diameter of the bolt shafts <b>194</b> to allow the nut top plate <b>182</b> to move axially and pivot relative to the inner member <b>18</b>. The diameter of the nut top plate bolt holes <b>184</b>, however, do not have a diameter that allows the bolt heads <b>190</b> to slip therethrough. Although bolts <b>188</b> threadably engaging the inner member top plate <b>34</b> are preferred to simplify assembly and disassembly, the bolts <b>188</b> can be slidably secured relative to the plates <b>34</b>, <b>182</b> by nuts threadably engaging the bolts <b>188</b>, clips, pins, and the like, without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The ball nut <b>64</b> is resiliently fixed to the inner member <b>18</b> by a resilient member <b>192</b> that allows the ball nut <b>64</b> to pivot relative to the inner member <b>18</b> and maintain the ball nut <b>64</b> aligned with the thread screw <b>38</b>. Preferably, the resilient member <b>192</b> formed from a compressible material, such as a rubber based or plastic elastomeric material, a spring, and the like, is axially interposed between the nut top plate <b>182</b> and the inner member top plate <b>34</b>. The resilient member <b>192</b> can also be positioned to allow lateral movement in addition to pivotal and axial movement of the inner member <b>18</b> relative to the ball nut <b>64</b> to maintain the thread screw <b>38</b> substantially aligned with the nut <b>64</b> upon deflection of the inner member <b>18</b> relative to the outer member <b>16</b> by a side load acting on the inner member <b>18</b> without departing from the scope of the invention. Advantageously, if a side load acting on the inner member <b>18</b> urges the inner member <b>18</b> transverse to the thread screw <b>38</b>, the resilient member <b>192</b> interposed between the nut top plate <b>182</b> and inner member top plate <b>34</b> allows the ball nut <b>64</b> to pivot relative to the inner member <b>18</b> and remain substantially aligned with the thread screw <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although detachably mounting the nut <b>64</b> relative to the inner member <b>18</b> using bolts <b>188</b> slidably received in the bolt holes <b>184</b> through the ball nut top plate <b>182</b> is preferred, any fastener can be used, such as clips, clamps, pins, and the like, without departing from the scope of the invention. In certain applications, the nut <b>64</b> can be fixed relative to the inner member <b>18</b> using methods that do not allow detaching the nut <b>64</b> from the inner member <b>18</b> without departing from the scope of the claims. Moreover, if resiliently fixing the nut <b>64</b> relative to the inner member <b>18</b> is not desired, the resilient member <b>192</b> can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first biasing member <b>202</b>, such as a Belleville washer, axially interposed between the nut <b>64</b> and the second coupler <b>134</b> cushions the inner member <b>18</b> relative to the outer member <b>16</b> when the inner member <b>18</b> is retracted into the outer member <b>16</b> to the retracted position. The first biasing member <b>202</b> is compressed when the inner member <b>18</b> reaches an upper limit to cushion the inner member <b>18</b> relative to the outer member <b>16</b> when the inner member <b>18</b> is retracted into the outer member <b>16</b> to the retracted position. Likewise, a second biasing member <b>204</b> interposed between the nut <b>64</b> and nut stop <b>170</b> cushions the inner member <b>18</b> relative to the outer member <b>16</b> when the inner member <b>18</b> is driven out of the outer member <b>16</b> to the extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Advantageously, the biasing members <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> can be selected to have a spring constant that increases the amperage draw of the electric motor <b>74</b> sufficiently to signal a control system (not shown) controlling the motor <b>74</b> that the inner member <b>18</b> is approaching the upper or lower limits of inner member travel prior to coming to an abrupt stop at the limit. Although Belleville washers encircling the thread screw <b>38</b> are preferred because they can be selected with a sufficiently high spring constant that significantly increases the amperage draw of the electric motor <b>74</b>, any biasing member, such as a spring, a rubber based material, a biasing plastic based material, and the like, axially interposed between the nut <b>64</b> and the second coupler <b>134</b> and/or stop <b>170</b> can be used without departing from the scope of the invention. Moreover, the biasing members <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> can be axially interposed anywhere between the inner member assembly including the nut <b>64</b> and an outer member assembly including the thread screw <b>38</b> without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a foot <b>46</b> mounted to the inner member second end <b>32</b> engages a supporting surface to lift and steady the vehicle <b>8</b>. The foot <b>46</b> provides a large surface area for engagement with the supporting surface to prevent the extendible leg <b>12</b> from sinking or forming a depression in the surface. Preferably, the foot <b>46</b> is mounted to the second end <b>32</b> of the inner member <b>18</b> by a bolt <b>208</b> threadably engaging a threaded aperture <b>212</b> formed through the bottom plate <b>42</b> closing the second end <b>32</b> of the inner member <b>18</b>. A pivot bushing <b>214</b> encircling the bolt <b>208</b> and disposed between the bottom plate <b>42</b> and foot <b>46</b> can be provided. Of course, the foot <b>46</b> can be mounted to the inner member <b>18</b> using any method known in the art, such as pivotally mounting the foot <b>46</b> to the inner member <b>18</b> to accommodate an uneven ground or other non-level supporting surface, without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The mounting plate <b>148</b> fixed, such as by welding, to the outer member <b>16</b> adapts the extendible leg <b>12</b> for mounting to the vehicle <b>10</b>. Preferably, the mounting plate <b>148</b> includes a plurality of parallel holes <b>216</b> to accommodate a variety of mounting holes on the vehicle <b>10</b> for bolting the extendible leg <b>12</b> to the vehicle <b>10</b>. Of course, the mounting plate <b>148</b> can be omitted, and the extendible leg <b>12</b> can be adapted for mounting to the vehicle <b>10</b> by welding, strapping, clamping, and the like, to the vehicle <b>10</b> without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-12</figref>, each extendible leg <b>12</b> is assembled by fixing the wear sleeve <b>56</b> in the second end <b>26</b> of the outer member <b>16</b> and slipping the inner member <b>18</b> into the outer member second end <b>26</b> such that the first end <b>28</b> of the inner member <b>18</b> extends past the first end <b>24</b> of the outer member <b>16</b>. The second biasing member <b>204</b> is positioned between the ball nut <b>64</b> and nut stop <b>170</b>, and the ball screw assembly <b>62</b> including the thread screw <b>38</b> and ball nut <b>64</b> is bolted to the inner member <b>18</b> with the resilient member <b>192</b> interposed between the ball nut top plate <b>182</b> and inner member top plate <b>34</b> to form the inner member assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The outer member <b>16</b> having the mounting plate <b>148</b> fixed thereto is assembled with the inner member assembly by positioning the first biasing member <b>202</b> between the nut <b>64</b> and second coupler <b>134</b> and connecting the thread screw first end <b>138</b> to the second coupler <b>134</b>. The connecting shaft <b>76</b> is then slipped through the shaft aperture <b>126</b> formed through the cage <b>124</b> and the weight bracket shaft aperture <b>94</b>. The second end <b>136</b> of the connecting shaft <b>76</b> is connected to the second coupler and the first end of the connecting shaft <b>76</b> is connected to the first coupler <b>106</b>. The first coupler <b>106</b> is then connected to the drive shaft <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Once the inner member assembly is completed and the drive shaft <b>66</b> is coupled to the thread screw <b>38</b> the outer member is slipped axially over the connecting assembly <b>72</b>, such that the apertures <b>98</b> formed in the outer member <b>16</b> align with the apertures <b>96</b> formed through the weight bracket <b>78</b>. The bolts <b>82</b> are slipped through the aligned apertures <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> and secured with the nuts <b>102</b> to fix the weight bracket <b>78</b> relative to the outer member <b>16</b>. Finally, the foot <b>46</b> is bolted to the inner member bottom plate <b>42</b> to complete assembly of the extendible legs <b>12</b>. Of course, the order of assembly steps described above can be altered by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. Advantageously, the extendible legs <b>12</b> can be easily disassembled by reversing the order of the assembly steps.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In use, the extendible leg inner member <b>18</b> is axially moved between the extended and retracted position by energizing the motor <b>74</b> to rotate the thread screw <b>38</b>. Rotation of the thread screw <b>38</b> axially drives the ball nut <b>64</b>, and thus the inner member <b>18</b>. In one direction of rotation of the thread screw <b>38</b>, the inner member <b>18</b> is driven toward the extended position until the desired extension of the inner member <b>18</b> is achieved or the ball nut <b>64</b> engages the second biasing member <b>204</b> adjacent the ball nut stop <b>170</b> which cushions the ball nut <b>64</b> and increases the motor amperage to signal the control system to turn off the motor <b>74</b>. In an opposite direction of rotation, the inner member <b>18</b> is driven toward the retracted position until the inner member <b>18</b> is retracted to a desired position or the ball nut <b>64</b> engages the first biasing member <b>202</b> which cushions the ball nut <b>64</b> and increases the motor amperage to signal the control system to turn off the motor <b>74</b>. Advantageously, if a side load acting on the inner member <b>18</b> urges the inner member <b>18</b> transverse to the thread screw <b>38</b>, the resilient member <b>192</b> interposed between the nut top plate <b>182</b> and inner member top plate <b>34</b> allows the nut <b>64</b> to pivot relative to the inner member <b>18</b> and remain substantially aligned with the thread screw <b>38</b> to prevent the thread screw from binding in the nut <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an alternate embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, an extendible leg <b>312</b> proximal each corner of the vehicle <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes an outer member <b>316</b> and a telescoping inner member <b>318</b>. The telescoping inner member <b>318</b> is forcibly slidably driven by a drive mechanism <b>322</b> between a retracted and an extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The tube shaped outer member <b>316</b> is formed from a U-shaped length of material <b>320</b>, such as steel, which is joined to a back plate <b>324</b>, such as by welding. Advantageously, forming the outer member <b>316</b> from two pieces reduces material costs. Wings <b>326</b> extending from longitudinal edges <b>328</b> of the back plate <b>324</b> include a plurality of parallel holes <b>332</b> to accommodate a variety of mounting holes on the vehicle <b>10</b> for bolting the extendible leg <b>312</b> to the vehicle <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the embodiment disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, a linear hall sensor <b>334</b> fixed relative to the outer member <b>316</b> senses the position of the inner member <b>318</b> relative to the outer member <b>316</b>. Advantageously, by knowing the position of the inner member <b>318</b> relative to the outer member <b>316</b>, the drive mechanism <b>322</b> can be turned off, either manually or automatically, prior to the inner member <b>318</b> reaching a physical stop which can damage the drive mechanism <b>322</b>. Although a linear hall sensor <b>334</b> is disclosed, any sensor known in the art can be used, such as limit switches, non-linear sensors, and the like, for determining the position of the inner member <b>318</b> relative to the outer member <b>316</b> without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">While there has been shown and described what are at present considered the preferred embodiment of the invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the drive system can be provided with a manual override, a third member can be provided to provide a quick to ground feature, and the like, without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
