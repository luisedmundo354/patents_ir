<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, a support is hingedly connected to the rear member to provide added stability to the rear member of the seat. In a further embodiment, the transportable apparatus includes a support strap positioned between the support and the rear member where the support strap is connected to the support and the rear member. The support strap prevents the support from moving beyond a designated distance from the rear member.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, the interface includes at least one of a steering wheel and a pedal. In one aspect of this embodiment, the pedal includes at least one of an accelerator pedal and a brake pedal. It should be appreciated that the interface may be any suitable interface or control to control the operation of a simulated image such as a simulated vehicle displayed on a display device associated with the video game system. It should also be appreciated that the transportable apparatus of the present invention may be used to control any suitable simulated image such as a simulated vehicle, simulated airplane, simulated helicopter, simulated motorcycle, simulated boat or any other suitable simulated image associated with a game operated by a game system or video game system.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, the transportable apparatus includes a communication member adapted to be in communication with the interface. In one aspect of this embodiment, the communication member includes at least one cable such as an electrical cable. In another aspect of this embodiment, the communication member includes a wireless communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the transportable apparatus includes a first frame member and a second frame member hingedly connected to the first frame member, where the first frame member and the second frame member are movable between a storage position and an operative position. The transportable apparatus also includes a seat foldably connected to the first frame member where the seat includes a base and a rear member hingedly connected to the base. The rear member is movable towards and away from the base to a plurality of different positions. The transportable apparatus also includes a steering wheel removably connected to the first frame member and a plurality of pedals each movably connected to the second frame member. A communication device is associated with one of the frame and the seat and provides user input to the video game system. When the first frame member, the second frame member and the seat are in the operative position, the first frame member and the second frame member are movable to enable a user such as a player to move the second frame member towards the first frame member and move the first frame member to a position adjacent to the seat to place the apparatus in the storage position. In the storage position, the transportable apparatus is transportable to one or more different locations.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, the first frame member includes at least two telescoping members connected in a sliding relationship with each other where the telescoping members are slidable or movable to a plurality of different positions. The positions of the telescoping member is determined by the size and comfort preferences of the player. In an embodiment, the transportable apparatus includes a lock attached to at least one of the telescoping members to hold the telescoping members in a desired position.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Similarly, the second frame member includes at least two telescoping members connected in a sliding relationship, where the telescoping members are slidable to a plurality of different positions. In an embodiment, the transportable apparatus includes a lock attached to at least one of the telescoping members to hold the telescoping members in a desired position.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, the transportable apparatus includes a frame including a first member and a second member hingedly connected to the first member. The transportable apparatus also includes a seat foldably connected to the frame, where the seat includes a base and a rear member hingedly connected to the base. The rear member is movable to a plurality of different positions. The transportable apparatus also includes a container attached to the seat for holding the steering wheel during transportation of the transportable apparatus. A support is hingedly connected to the rear member to further support the rear member. The transportable apparatus includes a steering wheel removably connected to the frame and at least one pedal movably connected to the frame. A connector is connected to the frame and is in communication with the steering wheel and the pedal to communicate the signals from these components to the video game system.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention generally refers to an apparatus for a video game system and more specifically, to a transportable apparatus for a video game system.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7B</figref>, the transportable apparatus of the present invention is generally indicated as numeral <b>10</b>. The transportable apparatus <b>10</b> is an accessory or additional controller for use with a game system such as a video game system to enhance a player's experience with a game operated by the video game system and, more specifically, for a transportable game played or operated on that video game system. The transportable apparatus <b>10</b> is a portable apparatus or device which can be transported by a player to several different locations such as from the player's house to a friend's house. The transportable apparatus <b>10</b> generally includes a player support or seat <b>12</b> which is foldably connected to a frame <b>14</b>. A pedal base or front base <b>16</b> is connected to the opposite end of the frame <b>14</b>. An interface such as position controller or steering wheel <b>18</b> is removably attached to the frame and is operable to change the lateral positioning of a simulated image such as a simulated vehicle or car on a display device associated with a video game system. Additionally, at least one and preferably two additional interfaces such as pedals <b>60</b> are movably attached to the pedal base <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, one of the pedals is a gas pedal or accelerator pedal and the other pedal is a brake pedal.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2D</figref>, initially, the transportable apparatus <b>10</b> is sold or displayed in a closed or storage position as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, where the transportable apparatus <b>10</b> can be easily transported from the store to a player's house or to other locations. The transportable apparatus <b>10</b> is then unfolded and adjusted to adapt to the size of the player using the apparatus. Once the transportable apparatus <b>10</b> is unfolded and adjusted to the size of the player, the player connects the transportable apparatus to the video game system using a communication device such as a cord, cable or electrical cable <b>74</b>. The cord or cable <b>74</b> communicates the signals delivered from the steering wheel and/or one or more of the pedals to the video game system so that the video game system can simulate the player's inputs using the steering wheel and the pedals in the game operated by the video game system. Alternatively, a wireless communication device</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When a player is finished using the transportable apparatus <b>10</b> and desires to either store the transportable apparatus in a storage closet or other location or desires to transport the transportable apparatus to another location such as a friend's house, the transportable apparatus can be folded up easily and quickly. In one embodiment, as is further explained in more detail below, the frame <b>14</b> folds towards and onto the bottom of the seat <b>12</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The rear member or back portion of the seat <b>12</b> is then folded onto the top of the frame and pedal base. The support <b>26</b> of the seat <b>12</b> is rotated about the top of the seat until the support <b>26</b> is on top of the frame <b>14</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. The steering wheel <b>18</b> is placed in the container or pocket <b>76</b>. The top ends of the seat can then be secured together using velcro or a similar fastener to secure the transportable apparatus <b>10</b> in a compact package or carrying pack as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. The transportable apparatus <b>10</b> can now be transported to another location easily and then set up at that location very quickly by unfolded the transportable apparatus as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the seat <b>12</b> of the transportable apparatus <b>10</b> includes a seat base <b>20</b>, a rear member or back support <b>22</b>, which is movably connected to one end of the seat base <b>20</b>, a head rest <b>24</b>, which is integrally formed with or connected to the rear member <b>22</b> and the seat support <b>26</b>, which is hingedly connected to the top of the rear member <b>22</b> to enable the seat support to be able to be pivoted or rotated about the top of the rear member <b>22</b>. The seat base <b>20</b>, the rear member <b>22</b>, the head rest <b>24</b> and the seat support <b>26</b> form a seat cover which covers a seat frame or frame <b>13</b>. The cover material includes any suitable material such as a canvas or nylon material, which makes the seat <b>12</b> more comfortable. It should be appreciated that the cover material may be any suitable material. Additionally, it should be appreciated that the material may be any color or configuration as desired by the manufacturer. In one embodiment, a padding or padding-like material is inserted between the cover material and the components of the seat to provide additional cushion or support to enhance the player's comfort level while sitting in the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The seat support <b>26</b> is hingedly attached or connected to the rear member <b>22</b>. The seat support <b>26</b> can be pivoted to adjust the recline angle of the rear member <b>22</b> to adjust to different comfort preferences of a player. The seat support <b>26</b> is connected to the rear member so that the angle of the seat support <b>26</b> enables the seat support to remain stationary while the player is playing a game using the transportable apparatus <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, a position lock such as strap <b>78</b> is attached between the support <b>26</b> and rear member <b>22</b> to prevent the seat support from moving further away from the rear member. The seat <b>12</b> is movably or rotatably connected to a horizontal support or bar <b>56</b> as shown in the illustrated embodiment. The support bar <b>56</b> is connected to frame <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the illustrated embodiment, the frame <b>14</b> includes a first frame support <b>28</b> and a second frame support <b>30</b>, which is hingedly connected to the first frame support. The first frame support <b>28</b> and the second frame support <b>30</b> can therefore pivot towards or away from each other to adjust the position of the pedal base <b>16</b> and also adjust the height or placement of the position control or steering wheel <b>18</b>. In one embodiment, the first frame support <b>28</b> includes an upper member <b>32</b> and a lower member <b>34</b>, which is slidingly engaged with or connected to the upper member. Generally, the upper member <b>32</b> and the lower member <b>34</b> are shaped and sized so that the upper member <b>32</b> fits within or slides within the lower member <b>34</b>. The upper member <b>32</b> can be moved into or out of the lower member <b>34</b> to adjust the length or height of the first frame support <b>28</b>. Adjusting the length or height of the first frame support <b>28</b> enables the user to adjust the height or position of the steering wheel <b>18</b>. A locking member or lock <b>36</b> is attached to the upper end of the lower member and includes a lever which causes the lock <b>36</b> to compress or expand when the lever is pushed inward or pulled outward, respectively. When the lever is pushed inward or toward the first frame support <b>28</b>, the tension or compression of the lock <b>36</b> on the upper member and lower member causes the upper member <b>32</b> to be locked or held in position or place. This prevents the upper member from accidentally or inadvertently moving upward or downward within the lower member during operation of the transportable apparatus. The lock or locking member <b>36</b> may be any suitable tensioning device.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A second frame support <b>30</b> includes three sections: a top member <b>38</b>, a middle member <b>40</b> and a bottom member <b>42</b>. The top member <b>38</b>, the middle member <b>40</b> and the bottom member <b>42</b> are sized and shaped so that the middle member <b>40</b> fits within or slides within the bottom member <b>42</b> and is held in position by the locking device or lock <b>46</b>. The locking device or lock operates or functions in the same manner as the lock <b>36</b> described above. Similarly, the upper member or top member <b>38</b> fits within or slides within the middle member <b>40</b>. A locking device or lock <b>44</b> is positioned between the middle member and the top member to hold the top member in place as described above. To adjust the length of the second frame support <b>30</b>, the top member <b>38</b> and/or the middle member <b>40</b> may be adjusted accordingly. The top member <b>38</b> may be moved into or out of the middle member <b>40</b> to increase or decrease the length of the second frame support <b>30</b>. Alternatively or in addition to the movement of the top member <b>38</b>, the middle member <b>40</b> may be moved into or out of the bottom member <b>42</b> to further adjust the length of the second frame support <b>30</b>. Once the top member and/or the middle member are positioned in a desired position by the player, the levers on the locks <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are pressed inward or pushed towards the second frame support <b>30</b> to lock the top member <b>38</b> and the middle member <b>40</b> in place. The locks prevent the top member and middle member from sliding and moving out of position during operation of the transportable apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the illustrated embodiment, a frame connector <b>47</b> connects the first frame support <b>28</b> and the second frame support <b>30</b>. Specifically, the frame connector <b>47</b> hingedly connects the first frame support to the second frame support so that the first frame support and the second frame support may pivot or move towards and away from each other to adjust the height and/or position of the steering wheel and adjust the length or distance of the pedal base from the seat. These adjustments are made to accommodate the different sizes of different players that use the transportable apparatus. The frame connector <b>47</b> includes a position control connector or steering wheel connector <b>48</b> including lock lever <b>82</b>, a controller or output connector <b>54</b> and an adjustable lock <b>52</b>. The frame connector <b>47</b> includes extenders or arms (not shown) which securely attach to or fit into one end of the first frame support <b>38</b> and one end of the second frame support <b>30</b> as illustrated. Once the first frame support <b>28</b> and the second frame support <b>30</b> are in a desired position, the player tightens or turns the adjustable lock <b>52</b> clockwise to press the sides of the frame connector <b>47</b> against each of the sides of the ends of the first frame support <b>28</b> and the second frame support <b>30</b> to hold or secure the first frame support and the second frame support in position at a designated angle <b>84</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The player then turns the lock <b>52</b> counterclockwise to loosen or lessen tension on the first frame support and the second frame support so that the positions of the first frame support and second frame support can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the illustrated embodiment, the steering wheel connector <b>48</b> is a generally circular connector which includes a receptacle having a post or extender <b>81</b> that receives the steering wheel <b>18</b>. The steering wheel <b>18</b> is matingly engaged with the steering wheel connector <b>48</b> and the lock lever or lock arm <b>82</b> is moved to an opposite position to lock or secure the steering wheel to the steering wheel connector <b>48</b>. Moving the lever <b>82</b> in the opposite direction releases the steering wheel so that it can be removed for storage. When the steering wheel is connected to the steering wheel connector <b>48</b>, the steering wheel is rotatable in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction to enable a player to simulate the steering of a vehicle such as a car displayed on a screen associated with the video game system. It should be appreciated that the lock mechanism of the steering wheel connector <b>48</b> may be any suitable lock or locking mechanism which will enable the steering wheel to be removably and rotatably connected to the steering wheel connector and prevent the steering wheel from being removed during operation or use of the transportable apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, the steering wheel includes inputs such as inputs <b>80</b> that enable a player to communicate with the game system to perform other functions such as starting a game, ending a game, saving a game, selecting the number of player or any other suitable game functions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, the pedal base <b>16</b> includes a housing <b>58</b> and a base connector <b>50</b> which is connected to the housing and defines a receptacle for receiving the end of the second frame support <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, the second frame support is sized so that the second frame support matingly fits into the receptacle of the base connector <b>50</b> in a snap fit or compression fit relationship. It should be appreciated that any suitable connectors such as screws or bolts may be used to secure the base connector <b>50</b> to the second frame support <b>30</b>. The base connector <b>50</b> is rotatably connected to the housing <b>58</b> to enable the housing <b>58</b> to pivot towards and away from the second frame support <b>30</b>. The housing <b>58</b> pivots towards the second frame support <b>30</b> to store the transportable apparatus <b>10</b> and pivots away from the second frame support <b>30</b> when the transportable apparatus is being set up or placed in the operating position.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment, at least two pedals <b>60</b> are movably connected to the housing <b>58</b>. A separate housing or cover <b>15</b> is connected to the housing <b>58</b> to provide protection and to improve the aesthetic appearance of the apparatus. Each pedal includes a foot support <b>62</b> which is a generally rectangular or flat surface as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. It should be appreciated that the foot support <b>62</b> may be any suitable size or shape. The foot support <b>62</b> is rotatably connected to an arm <b>64</b> which is a substantially vertical or upright. An axle or pin is inserted through the foot support <b>62</b> and the arm <b>64</b> to hold the foot support <b>62</b> on the end of the arm <b>64</b>. The foot support <b>62</b> is rotatably or pivotably connected to the arm such that the foot support can be adjusted to accommodate different foot placement preferences of a player. The arm <b>64</b> is movably connected within the channel <b>68</b> defined by the housing <b>58</b>. At least one tension spring (not shown) is connected to the bottom of the pedal <b>60</b> to bias the pedal towards the seat <b>12</b>. Accordingly, when a player pushes against the foot support <b>62</b>, the foot support moves or slides away from the seat <b>12</b> within the channel <b>68</b>. This enables the transportable apparatus <b>10</b> to simulate the operation of a pedal of an actual vehicle such as a car. In one embodiment, one of the pedals <b>60</b>, such as the right pedal, is a gas pedal or accelerator pedal similar to a car. The other pedal <b>60</b> is a brake pedal which stops the movement or forward motion of the simulated car. It should be appreciated that the transportable apparatus <b>10</b> of the present invention may include any suitable number of pedals as desired by the game manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, an electrical connector such as cord <b>74</b> is electrically connected to the transportable apparatus <b>10</b> and extends from the transportable apparatus <b>10</b> to the video game system (not shown) to communicate signals supplied by the steering wheel and/or the pedals to the video game system.
