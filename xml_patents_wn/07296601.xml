<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An aboveground fueling facility includes one or more vertical fuel supply tanks, each of which is positioned on a reinforced mounting pad on a fueling island that also includes one or more fuel dispensers. Fuel is supplied from the vertical fuel supply tanks to the dispensers via piping that is secondarily contained within the reinforced mounting pad. Each of the vertical fuel supply tanks may have more than one compartment so as to permit different grades of fuel to be dispensed by the dispensers, including mixtures. Fueling lanes are defined between the vertical fuel supply tanks for permitting vehicular access to the fuel dispensers. A canopy for sheltering the fueling lanes is structurally supported by the vertical fuel supply tanks, and informational signage is provided on the canopy for providing information such as fuel pricing to the consumer.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an aboveground fueling or service station that can be conveniently and efficiently deployed in the desired location, and that is environmentally friendly, aesthetically attractive and particularly suited for installation in parking lots of supermarkets and shopping centers, as well as rural and underdeveloped areas.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Technology</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Prior to 1987 and the passage of U.S. Environmental Protection Legislation, the majority of retail fuel stations stored product in underground tanks with pipes running to fuel islands that were under large canopies. Those few stations that used aboveground tanks typically ran underground pipe from a remote area at the edge of the station, where the tanks were contained in a dike, to a fuel island, as required by the national codes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One significant disadvantage of in-ground refueling stations such as most existing vehicular service stations is the time and labor involved in preparing and constructing such a facility. Some factors that contribute to the expense of constructing a belowground facility include the need for construction permits, subcontractors, excavation, removing or boring through unanticipated underground obstructions, pumping out water due to high water table anchoring tanks so they do not float to the surface and the time and planning involved in locating a permanent site for the facility. Once installed, such facilities cannot practically be moved to different locations, or be sold.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the realization that many underground fuel tanks and pipe were leaking and the subsequent passage of laws requiring expensive secondary containment of underground tanks and pipe, companies began designing aboveground tanks for fueling vehicles. Fueling facilities that use aboveground tanks have become more common in recent years, in no small part because of the efforts of the inventor, R. Michael Webb, and the company he founded, U-Fuel, Inc. of Eau Claire Wis. Aboveground fueling facilities that have been designed by Mr. Webb and marketed by U-Fuel, Inc. are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,988,020; 5,033,637; 5,305,926; and 5,562,162, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated as if set forth fully herein.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aboveground fueling facilities have a number of advantages, some of which are set forth above. However, traditional aboveground tanks are sometimes not aesthetically suitable for the purpose of service stations in developed areas, such as residential neighborhoods or in automotive service areas that are near busy highways. It is also necessary to lay large concrete pads to support the weight of the tank and to direct fluids such as rain water away from the tank so as to avoid contamination, especially in areas that have strict environmental regulations. Such pads must be constructed on site, because of their great size and weight. This prevents a contractor from prefabricating an entire aboveground service station and moving it on site, which would otherwise be economically desirable, especially when deploying a system in an underdeveloped or rural area that is remote from the facilities of the contractor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Due to the required capacities of these systems, and the corresponding installation and the safety issues, most aboveground tanks used for fueling vehicles were oriented horizontally. Some of the disadvantages of using horizontal aboveground tanks are: the amount of horizontal space required for the tank and equipment; the obstructed view of the vehicles that circulate about the tank, the increased possibility of damage from impact by objects or traffic, and the potential of fire developing from transfer of fuel to and from the tank. Given these concerns, national and international codes prohibited the use of aboveground tanks for retail fuel sales and only permitted these systems for use at private fleet facilities.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, with the increased interest and popularity of alternative fuels such as Ethanol E-85 and bio Diesel, there has developed a need for a small, inexpensive, environmentally safe, fuel station that can be quickly installed and operated as a vending machine, or be added to an existing retail station to provide additional fuels to the public without having to dig holes or do extensive construction. Until the new fuels increase in popularity, station owners are reluctant to risk the additional cost required to add these products.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Since there are very few locations in the United States that offer alternative fuels, demand is insufficient to justify increased supply. In order to increase demand, it is important that alternative fuel stations have a unique appearance so the motoring public can quickly recognize the availability of the fuel and feel confident enough to buy alternative fuel vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Even though the three major automobile companies have been producing cars that will burn the lower priced and environmentally safe E85 Ethanol since the year 2000, such as the Ford Taurus, the Ranger, the Chrysler Mini-Vans and the GM Suburban, much of the motoring public are not aware that they could be using alternative fuel and saving up to 20% of their cost. Those that are aware, find it difficult to locate stations that sell alternative fuels when they travel.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is clear that a need exists for an improved aboveground service station facility that is convenient and inexpensive to deploy, space efficient, and that is aesthetically proper for use in developed areas such as residential neighborhoods or in automotive service areas by a busy highway.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding structure throughout the views, and referring in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an aboveground vertical tank fueling facility <b>10</b> that is constructed according to the preferred embodiment of the invention includes a plurality of vertical fuel storage tanks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> which in the preferred embodiment number four. Alternatively, according to the invention, there could be more or fewer vertical fuel storage tanks than that depicted with respect to the preferred embodiment, including an embodiment that would have just one vertical fuel storage tank. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows, each of the vertical fuel storage tanks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> is respectively positioned on an elongated fueling island <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, each of which is further provided with a fueling system that preferably includes a plurality of vehicular fueling dispensers <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the preferred embodiment, each of the fueling islands is elongated in shape, having first and second ends at which concrete barriers <b>30</b> are deployed and first and second sides that define vehicular fueling lanes through which vehicles may drive in order to receive fuel that is dispensed from one of the vehicular fueling dispensers <b>28</b>. In order to provide protection for the storage tanks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and the vehicular fueling dispensers <b>28</b>, a plurality of vertically extending metal ballards <b>32</b> are positioned about the periphery of each of the fueling islands <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. Each of the vertical fuel storage tanks <b>12</b>,<b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> further preferably includes a reinforced aboveground pad <b>34</b> for structurally supporting the aboveground vertical storage tank and the fueling dispensers, an enclosure protecting electrical and signal connections providing structure for anchoring tanks to concrete pads and for providing secondary containment for the piping therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to one important aspect of the invention, the aboveground vertical fuel storage tanks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> in addition to holding fuel that will be dispensed by the dispensers <b>28</b> provide a structural support for a canopy <b>36</b> that is sized and configured to provide shelter from rain, snow and sunlight to vehicles that are positioned for fueling at the aboveground fueling facility <b>10</b>. In other words, canopy <b>36</b> is configured to completely cover each of the fueling island's <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and the fueling lanes that are defined therebetween. In addition, given the large size of the canopy, signage <b>37</b> is preferably provided on the canopy <b>36</b> for providing information to consumers such as the types of fuels that are available at the aboveground fueling facility <b>10</b> and the prices for each grade of fuel. Preferably, signage <b>37</b> includes a plurality of electronic signs that may be electronically adjusted remotely by an operator. The provision of signage <b>37</b> on the canopy <b>36</b> eliminates the need for separate signage to be erected at the site of the aboveground fueling facility <b>10</b> and facilitates the quick, efficient deployment of the fueling facility <b>10</b> at a desired location.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As a means of protecting against damage to the large canopy <b>36</b> from strong winds creating an uplifting force, air vents <b>35</b> are located in the roof of canopy <b>36</b> adjacent to storage tanks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> to relieve air pressure and provide access for maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it will be seen that a plurality of fueling lanes <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are defined by the sides of the elongated fueling islands <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, a first fueling lane <b>38</b> is defined by a first side of the first elongated fueling island <b>20</b>, a second fueling lane <b>40</b> is defined between the second side of the first elongated fueling island <b>20</b> and a first side of the second elongated fueling island <b>22</b>, a third fueling lane <b>42</b> is defined by a second side of the second elongated fueling island <b>22</b> and a first side of the third elongated fueling island <b>24</b>, a fourth fueling lane <b>44</b> is defined by a second side of the third elongated fueling island <b>24</b> and a first side of the fourth elongated fueling lane <b>26</b> a fifth fueling lane <b>46</b> is defined on a second side of the fourth elongated fueling lane <b>26</b>. Preferably, each of the vehicular fueling dispensers <b>28</b> are constructed so that they can dispense fuel to a vehicle that is positioned in either adjacent fueling lane. In the illustrated embodiment, the fueling lanes are sized to permit one-way traffic therethrough, with each fueling lane permitting access to two fuel dispensing dispensers <b>28</b> on each side of the vehicle. Accordingly, each fueling lane may simultaneously service two vehicles, one in a forward position and one in a rearward position within the fueling lane. Alternatively, the fueling lanes may be configured so as to permit two-way vehicular traffic, in which case they would be roughly twice the width that they are in the preferred embodiment. In the preferred embodiment, each of the fueling lanes defined between adjacent fueling islands is preferably between about 6 feet to about 10 feet in width, as measured from the outermost extent of the ballards that are positioned at the side of the fueling islands. An embodiment that permitted two-way traffic, each of the fueling lanes defined between adjacent fueling islands would preferably be about 10 feet to about 20 feet in width.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">One important advantage that is created by the present invention is the relatively small horizontal dimension of a vertical fuel storage tank permits space efficient deployment of the vertical storage tank within the fueling island itself, as opposed to a remote location, and further permits fuel to be dispensed from both sides of the fueling island. The dimensions of the vertical storage tanks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are critical in permitting the vehicular fuel dispensing dispensers to be able to dispense fuel to vehicles in either of the fueling lanes that are defined by the sides of the elongated fueling islands. Preferably, each of the vertical storage tanks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> is constructed so as to have an outer diameter that is within a range of about 7 feet to about 15 feet, and more preferably that is within a range of about 8 feet to about 12 feet, which as may be seen in the drawings represents the maximum horizontal dimension of the vertical storage tank. Most preferably, the vertical fuel storage tanks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> have an outer diameter that is within a range of about 9 feet to about 11 feet. Moreover, each of the vertical fuel storage tanks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> preferably has a height or maximum vertical dimension that is within a range of about 8 feet to about 35 feet, and more preferably within a range of about 15 feet to about 24 feet. This height is important in determining the location of the attached canopy <b>36</b> and a volumetric capacity of the fuel storage tanks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the preferred embodiment, and as is best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each of the vertical fuel storage tanks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> preferably includes a generally cylindrical inner tank <b>48</b> and a concentrically disposed generally cylindrical outer tank <b>50</b>. An interstitial space <b>49</b> is defined between the inner and outer tanks <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>. Preferably, structural reinforcement is provided in the interstitial space <b>49</b>, which in the preferred embodiment comprises a plurality of angle iron elements <b>52</b> that extend vertically within the interstitial space <b>49</b>. Alternatively, structural reinforcement could be achieved by packing the interstitial space <b>49</b> with a material such as concrete.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a vertical fuel storage tank that has only a single compartment defined therein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a vertical storage tank having more than one compartment defined therein, so that multiple grades of fuel may be dispensed therefrom. In an aboveground fueling facility <b>10</b> such as that shown in the preferred embodiment that has multiple storage tanks <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, different grades of fuel may be dispensed to vehicles by piping the fuel from a remote storage tank, i.e. a vehicle in second fueling lane <b>40</b> could be supplied with premium fuel that is supplied by the third vertical fuel storage tank <b>16</b>, or the vehicle could receive a blended midgrade fuel supplied by third fuel storage tank <b>16</b> and second fuel tank <b>14</b>. In this case, the piping between the different fueling islands would be secondarily contained above the canopy <b>36</b> extending overhead. Preferably, however, different grades of fuel are dispensed from the storage tank that is disposed immediately adjacent to the fueling lane.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows, the canopy <b>36</b> is structurally supported by the outer tank <b>50</b> by means of a plurality of lower canopy support brackets <b>54</b> and a plurality of upper canopy support brackets <b>56</b> that are welded to the outside of the outer tank <b>50</b> opposite internal braces <b>52</b>. A secure fill box <b>58</b> is positioned at a lower portion of the fuel storage tank and is preferably locked to permit secure access by authorize refilling personnel, such as a tanker truck. A fill connection is provided therein that permits fuel to be pumped into the vertical fuel storage tank through a fill pipe <b>60</b> that extends upwardly through the interstitial space <b>49</b> and downwardly into the inner tank <b>48</b>, terminating near the bottom of the inner tank <b>48</b>. A stage I vapor recovery system <b>62</b> is further provided for ensuring that vapor that is displaced from the vertical fuel storage tank during refilling is recovered by the fuel service vehicle. Suction lines <b>64</b> are preferably provided within the inner tank <b>48</b>, extending upwardly and then downwardly within the interstitial space <b>49</b>, leading to the vehicular refueling dispensers <b>28</b> through a secondarily contained pipe <b>76</b> that is provided within the reinforced pad <b>34</b> at the fueling island. Each compartment of the vertical fuel storage tank is provided with a conventional emergency vent <b>66</b>, a conventional working vent <b>68</b> and an access manway <b>70</b> that is configured to permit service personnel to access the inside of the vertical fuel storage tank. An internal ignition suppression system <b>72</b> is preferably provided within each of the fuel storage compartments defined within the vertical fuel storage tank. Advantageously, the working vent <b>68</b>, the emergency vent <b>66</b> and the access manway <b>70</b> extend through the canopy roof <b>36</b>, best-shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, so that venting can be achieved without interference by the canopy <b>36</b> and without jeopardizing consumers to unnecessary fumes and hazards, and so that service personnel can access the interior of the vertical fuel storage tanks without interference by the canopy <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a top view of the exterior of a single product vertical fuel storage tank with four short dispensing islands <b>27</b> designed for perpendicular fueling lanes. This embodiment of the vertical fueling facility allows fueling of the large number of vehicles in the smallest space of approximately 900 ft.<sup>2</sup>, including the station. Removable covers <b>29</b> provide access to secure vertical fuel station to a mounting pad <b>34</b> and electronic junction boxes <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a cross-sectional view of a reinforced mounting pad <b>34</b> that is provided at each of the fueling islands <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> for supporting the vertical fuel storage tank <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and the associated vehicular refueling dispensers <b>28</b> and anchoring the station to prevent uplifting due to high winds. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, mounting pad <b>34</b> extends into a recess that is defined into the ground <b>82</b> and includes concrete <b>84</b> that is reinforced with structural metallic rebar material <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</p>
