<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to an indicator or monitor of fluid flow. More specifically, the present invention relates to a self-contained in-line fluid flow monitor including an indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Industrial and medical gases are typically conducted through a conduit such as a tube or cannula from a storage tank to an implement that utilizes the gases or to a patient. Such gases are often clear and give no visual indication of their presence in the ambient air or their flow within the tubes. Therefore, it is desirable to have an indicator to provide an indication when gas is flowing through a tube. It is also desirable to provide an indication when the tube has been disconnected from a supply, a leak has occurred, or pressure in the tube has dropped below a predetermined level.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides an indicator that is configured to be coupled directly to the gas supply tube or cannula. Therefore, the present invention provides an effective, inexpensive indicator to provide a visual, audible or other indication when gas is flowing through a tube, when the tube has been disconnected from a supply, or when pressure in the tube has dropped below a predetermined level due to a leak or pressure drop in the gas supply.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, exemplary embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a representation of a fluid flow monitor or fluid flow indicator <b>10</b> is shown. Fluid flow monitor <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>12</b> having an inlet coupler <b>14</b>, an outlet coupler <b>16</b>, and a fluid passage <b>18</b>. Fluid passage <b>18</b> connects inlet coupler <b>14</b> and outlet coupler <b>16</b> in fluid communication such that fluid introduced at fluid inlet coupler <b>14</b> may be passed to fluid outlet coupler <b>16</b>. Inlet coupler <b>14</b> and outlet coupler <b>16</b> are each configured to be coupled to an external device such as a conduit, a single lumen cannula, a fluid flow regulator, a source of regulated fluid, and other fluid transporting, utilizing, and/or delivery devices. In one example, inlet coupler <b>14</b> and/or outlet coupler <b>16</b> include a hose barb configured to receive a section of conduit or tubing. In another example, inlet coupler <b>14</b> and/or outlet coupler <b>16</b> include a threaded portion, such as an exterior threaded portion, the threaded portion sized to be received by a mating threaded portion on an external device. The above two examples are examples of removable couplers. In still a further example, input coupler and/or output coupler are permanently coupled to an external device by welding, with an adhesive, or other means.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Fluid flow monitor <b>10</b> further includes a sensor <b>20</b> and an indicator <b>22</b>. As explained in more detail herein, sensor <b>20</b> is in fluid communication with fluid passage <b>18</b> and senses the pressure and/or flow of fluid in fluid passage <b>18</b>. In one example, sensor <b>20</b> is a mechanical sensor, such as a diaphragm or a piston. In another example, sensor <b>20</b> is an electrical sensor, such as a temperature measuring resistor or electrical transducer.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Sensor <b>20</b> in one embodiment includes a flow sensor which provides a measurement of the flow rate of fluid in fluid passage <b>18</b>. Sensor <b>20</b> in another embodiment includes a pressure sensor which provides a measurement of the fluid pressure in fluid passage <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a preferred embodiment, input coupler is connected to a source of fluid, such as oxygen gas, outlet coupler <b>16</b> is coupled to a single lumen cannula which is positioned to provide fluid, such as oxygen gas, to the nostrils of a patient. Since the single lumen cannula is not capped, but is constantly permitting oxygen gas to escape to the nostrils of the patient a pressure sensor can be used to give an indication of fluid flow in the fluid passage <b>18</b> and to determine if the cannula has been disconnected from fluid monitor <b>10</b>, if fluid monitor <b>10</b> has been disconnected from the fluid source, or if pressure in the fluid passage has dropped below a predetermined level due to a leak or pressure drop in the fluid supply. Assuming the gas delivery system, the single lumen cannula and fluid source, are operating correctly, the pressure sensor should expect to detect a pressure determined by calculating the back pressure expected due to the single lumen cannula and the expected flow rate from the fluid source. Fluid flow monitor <b>10</b> may be configured to operate with any length of tubing for the single lumen cannula, such as about 4 feet, about 8 feet, about 14 feet, or about 21 feet.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, fluid flow monitor or indicator <b>10</b> will detect a decrease in the pressure of fluid supplied by a flow regulator or other fluid source thereby indicating an empty fluid tank.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Indicator <b>22</b> provides at least one of a visual cue, an audible cue, a tactile cue, and a status signal to a remote device, each of which provides an indication to an observer or operator of the operation of the gas delivery system. Indicator <b>22</b> may be a light emitting element, such as an LED, a speaker, a vibrating member, and/or a rotating member. Wherein indicator <b>22</b> provides a visual cue, one of housing <b>12</b> and input coupler <b>14</b> or output coupler <b>16</b> is partially transparent or translucent such that the visual cue is visible from an exterior of housing <b>12</b>. In an alternative embodiment, indicator <b>22</b> is mounted or coupled to an exterior of housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, an alarm is provided to indicate that the conduit has been removed from the output coupler <b>16</b> by including a fluid passage from fluid passage <b>18</b> to an exterior of the output coupler <b>16</b>, the fluid passage configured to whistle when fluid exits the passage at the exterior of the output coupler. The whistle would serve as an alarm to indicate that the conduit has been removed from the output coupler <b>16</b>. When the conduit is properly coupled to the output conduit, the opening of the fluid passage on the exterior of the output coupler <b>16</b> is covered by the conduit, hence the fluid passage cannot whistle.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As explained in more detail below sensor <b>20</b> may include an electrical circuit and/or controller which controls the operation of indicator <b>22</b>. In such a case, a portable power supply, such as one or more button batteries, is included within housing <b>12</b> to provide power to sensor <b>20</b> and/or indicator <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, indicator <b>22</b> provides a first cue in response to the detection that the gas delivery system is operating properly. In another embodiment, indicator <b>22</b> provides a second cue in response to the detection that the gas delivery system is operating improperly. In a further embodiment, indicator <b>22</b> provides a third cue in response to the detection that the gas delivery system is operating properly and a fourth cue in response to the detection that the gas delivery system is operating improperly. Further, indicator <b>22</b> may provide a plurality of cues to indicate that the gas delivery system is operating properly and/or that the gas delivery system is operating improperly. For example, indicator may provide an audible cue if the gas delivery system is operating improperly and provide a signal to a remote device including status information that the gas delivery system is operating improperly.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>a first exemplary fluid flow indicator or monitor is shown. Fluid flow indicator or monitor <b>110</b> is an in-line monitor for use with a conduit for fluids such as a cannula <b>128</b> as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Flow indicator <b>110</b> includes a housing <b>111</b>, an electrical circuit <b>118</b>, a plurality of batteries <b>120</b>, a flexible diaphragm, such as rubber diaphragm <b>122</b>, and a housing seal <b>124</b>.

Circuit <b>300</b> is configured for a pressure sensing switch <b>334</b> which is closed when the gas delivery system is operating properly and which is open when the gas delivery system is operating improperly. As will be appreciated in the discussion of exemplary software <b>400</b> (or firmware) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>), controller <b>300</b> may be configured for a pressure sensing switch <b>334</b> which is open when the gas delivery system is operating properly and which is closed when the gas delivery system is operating improperly.</p>

Exemplary audio amplifier circuits include circuits that have a bandwidth of 0.5 to 3 Khz and can utilize a 5V DC coupled input.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As explained in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, circuit <b>300</b> is configured to flash LED <b>342</b> when pressure sensing switch <b>334</b> is closed and if the pressure sensing switch has been open for a time greater than a threshold an alarm will sound with second output circuit <b>316</b>. An exemplary threshold time is about 10 seconds to about 15 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, exemplary software <b>400</b> is shown for controller <b>302</b>. It should be understood by those skilled in the art, that software <b>400</b> may be implemented as firmware in other embodiments. In step <b>402</b>, controller <b>302</b> initializes circuit <b>300</b>, such as by resetting counters discussed herein, setting port A as output, and setting port B as input.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In step <b>404</b>, controller <b>302</b> reads the input to determine the state of pressure sensing switch <b>334</b>. The step of reading the input includes reading the value of Port B Bit <b>6</b> followed by a second reading of Port B Bit <b>6</b> (“DeBounce”). If the input is high at block <b>406</b>, indicating that the pressure in the respective fluid passage is low (the gas delivery system is operating improperly), controller <b>302</b> executes a time for alarm routine <b>408</b>. If the input is low at block <b>406</b>, indicating that the pressure in the respective fluid passage is not low (the gas delivery system is operating properly), controller <b>302</b> executes a flash LED routine <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Flash LED routine <b>410</b> includes the steps of turning on the respective LED (or other indicator), as represented by block <b>412</b>, leaving the LED on for a given time period, as represented by block <b>414</b>, and turning LED off, as represented by block <b>416</b>. It should be appreciated that as long as the input at block <b>406</b> is low the flash LED routine <b>410</b> will be repeated, thus simulating a flashing LED. Also, in one example the separation between flashes and the duration of each flash are chosen to maximize battery life.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As stated above, circuit <b>300</b> is configured to wait for a predetermined time before sounding an alarm condition. This delay is implemented with time for alarm routine <b>408</b>. Once a high condition is read on the input at block <b>406</b>, time for alarm routine <b>408</b> is executed. As represented by step <b>418</b>, a counter is incremented. Next, the input is read again, as represented by block <b>420</b>. If the value of the counter exceeds a threshold number (the threshold being set based on the delay desired), then an alarm routine <b>422</b> is executed, as represented by block <b>424</b>. If the threshold has not been exceeded, the routine increments the counter again if the value of the input is still high or resets the counter and returns to the main routine if the value of the input is low, as represented by block <b>426</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an exemplary alarm routine <b>422</b> is shown. As represented by step <b>430</b>, an alarm counter is incremented. An alarm, such as piezoelectric sounding unit <b>348</b>, is turned on, as represented by block <b>432</b>, for a predetermined time (such as about ¾ of a second), as represented by block <b>434</b>. Next the alarm is turned off, as represented by block <b>436</b>, for a predetermined time <b>9</b> such as about two seconds), as represented by block <b>438</b>. The input is read again, as represented by block <b>440</b>, to determine if the input has changed, as represented by block <b>442</b>. If the input has changed to low, the alarm counter is reset, as represented by block <b>444</b>, and the software returns to the main routine if the input remains high, it is determined if an alarm counter threshold has been exceeded, as represented by block <b>446</b>. If the threshold has been exceeded the software returns to the main routine after resetting the counter until the alarm routine is initiated again. If the threshold has not been exceeded the counter is incremented as represented by block <b>430</b>. The threshold value allows the system to control the duration of a given alarm sequence. In an alternative embodiment, the alarm threshold is removed and the alarm continues to sound indefinitely.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, housing seal <b>124</b> is illustratively a rubber annular element configured to be compressed between inlet housing <b>114</b> and outlet housing <b>112</b> when the housings <b>112</b>,<b>114</b> are threadably engaged. Housing seal <b>124</b> prevents fluid in the interior of the housing from escaping to outside the housing at the point where inlet housing <b>114</b> meets outlet housing <b>112</b>. Housing seal <b>124</b> likewise prevents fluid on the exterior from entering the interior at the point where inlet housing <b>114</b> meets outlet housing <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Outlet housing <b>112</b> includes pathways <b>160</b>, an internal threaded portion <b>162</b>, barbed end <b>132</b>, and an outlet <b>164</b>. Pathways <b>160</b> are configured to direct fluid from beneath circuit <b>118</b> to outlet <b>164</b>. Threaded portion <b>162</b> is configured to engage threaded portion <b>134</b> of inlet housing <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> to, along with housing seal <b>124</b>, provide a fluid tight housing. Barbed end <b>132</b> receives a piece of plastic tubing/cannula <b>128</b> thereon as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In use, inlet housing <b>116</b> is connected to a cannula <b>128</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) or inlet housing <b>114</b> is connected to a regulator <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and outlet housing <b>112</b> is connected to a cannula <b>128</b> which is in turn connected to a fluid utilizing device or fluid dispensing device <b>166</b>. Once fluid flow is introduced to the cannula <b>128</b> or regulator <b>126</b> connected to input <b>131</b>, pressure is applied to diaphragm <b>122</b>. Diaphragm <b>122</b> is then deflected or biased from the first position to the second position such that conductive pad <b>146</b> moves toward circuit board <b>154</b> to engage contact <b>158</b> and complete circuit <b>118</b>. Completing circuit <b>118</b> causes LED <b>152</b> to receive power from batteries <b>120</b> and emit light. Furthermore, distortion of the diaphragm <b>122</b> allows fluid to flow from input <b>131</b>, around diaphragm <b>122</b> and circuit <b>118</b>, to outlet <b>164</b>. If fluid flow stops, or drops below a predetermined pressure, diaphragm <b>122</b> moves back to first position causing pad <b>146</b> to move away from contact <b>158</b>, thereby opening circuit <b>118</b>. The position of diaphragm <b>122</b> is dictated by the pressure developed therebehind.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">While the present invention has been described as using circuit gap between contact <b>158</b> and conductive pad <b>146</b>, it should be appreciated that other switch mechanism such as a piston that activates a switch or any other switching mechanism known in the art may be used. It is also envisioned to use different colored LED's <b>152</b> to indicate different gases. The placement of LED <b>152</b> within housing <b>111</b> allows light from LED <b>152</b> to be seen by a user. LED <b>152</b> light can be seen if housing <b>111</b> is transparent or translucent or if the light from LED <b>152</b> travels down a transparent/translucent outlet cannula <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In yet another embodiment, fluid flow indicator <b>110</b> includes a flow meter <b>168</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Flow meter <b>168</b> is preferably includes a digital readout <b>170</b> that displays the fluid flow speed. Flow meters which measure flow rate through a tube are generally known. Alternatively, the rate at which LED <b>152</b> flashes or a change in color of LED <b>152</b> may be used to indicate the fluid flow speed. Also, while the invention has been described as activating an indicator when fluid flow is present, embodiments are envisioned where indicators such as lights or buzzers are activated upon loss of fluid flow or fluid pressure. Such an embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an indicator or monitor <b>200</b> such that an alarm sounds when indicator <b>200</b> becomes un-attached from the fluid source or a significant amount of fluid is escaping, or pressure in the fluid supply drops below a predetermined level. Pressure within a flow path <b>202</b> is translated to a diaphragm <b>204</b> similarly as it was for indicator <b>110</b>. However, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a conductive pad <b>246</b> is in a fixed position and normally engaged with a contact <b>258</b> on diaphragm <b>204</b> when diaphragm is in its first, unbiased position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Pressure within flow path <b>202</b> distorts diaphragm <b>204</b> moves contact <b>258</b> away from pad <b>246</b> to de-activate circuit <b>206</b>. However, distorted diaphragm <b>204</b> does not allow the passage of the gas thereby. The gas is maintained beneath diaphragm <b>204</b>. A loss of pressure in flow path <b>202</b> results in diaphragm <b>204</b> returning to its first, rest position and activating circuit <b>206</b> that in turn activates an indicator such as an LED <b>208</b> or a buzzer. Thus, a lack of connection to the fluid source, a leak in the system, or drop in pressure of the source will visually or sonically alert the user. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be used concurrently with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The back pressure indicator <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is preferably mounted as close as possible to the regulator, because it relies on tubing restriction for proper operation. Typical tubing restrictions range from three to 15 inches of water. The electrical circuit is designed to give a battery life of about 28 days of continuous operation per set of batteries. This is accomplished with the use of short duty cycles and careful circuit design to minimize current consumption. In one embodiment, the back pressure indicator <b>200</b> emits a pattern of beeps for 3 minutes (or other preselected time) after the gas pressure is lost or until the gas pressure is restored. If the beeper timer has passed three minutes, the unit will not beep, until the gas has been restored. (Light operates.)</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Other features of the invention include having LED <b>152</b>, <b>208</b> flash at a first speed to indicate that the fluid flow is normal and flash at a second speed to indicate that fluid flow is abnormal. In another system, LED's <b>152</b>, <b>208</b> flash at a certain speed and are detected by an alarm system that determines the speed or existence of flashing LED <b>152</b>, <b>208</b> and alerts appropriate individuals upon noting an abnormal signal. Likewise, a preferably wireless transmitter may be placed in circuits <b>118</b>, <b>206</b> to transmit signals to an alarm system in a facility. The transmission may alert appropriate individuals upon noting an abnormal flow signal.</p>
