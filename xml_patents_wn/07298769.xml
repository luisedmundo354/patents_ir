<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser and, more particularly, to a structure of a semiconductor laser using a p-type InP substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Semiconductor materials from such systems as an InGaAsP system and an AlGaInAs system are used for a material of a semiconductor laser for use in communication with a 1.3 μm band and a 1.55 μm band. These materials have bandgap energies corresponding to the above-mentioned wavelength range and can be lattice-matched to the InP of the substrate. Moreover, as a substrate of the above-mentioned semiconductor laser, a p-type substrate is in wide use. This is because an NPN type bipolar transistor operable at a high speed can be used as a driving circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a conventional InGaAsP system semiconductor laser element formed by employing a p-type substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This semiconductor laser is produced by using a p-type substrate <b>1</b> containing Zn. A Zn-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b>, an InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>5</b>, an InGaAsP MQW (Multiple Quantum Well) <b>6</b>, an n-type InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>7</b>, and an n-type InP clad layer <b>8</b> are successively stacked on the p-type substrate <b>1</b> to be formed in a film. This stacked film has slopes on both sides thereof. A p-type InP buried layer <b>10</b>, an n-type InP current blocking layer <b>11</b>, and a p-type current blocking layer <b>12</b> are provided outside these slopes. Moreover, an n-type InP contact layer <b>13</b> is formed on the n-type InP clad layer <b>8</b> and the p-type current blocking layer <b>12</b> so as to cover the entire area of both layers (for example, it should be referred to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-53385).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Zn has been widely used as a p-type dopant in the aforementioned conventional semiconductor laser. Since the diffusion coefficient of Zn in InP is large, Zn contained in the p-type InP substrate <b>1</b> and in the Zn-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b> is apt to diffuse into the InGaAsP MQW (Multiple Quantum Well) active layer <b>6</b>. Zn that was diffused into the aforementioned active layer becomes a non-radiative center which causes a reduction in the efficiency, resulting in deteriorating the device characteristics. In order to suppress this defect, a method has been employed in which the Zn concentration profile was controlled by decreasing the carrier concentration in the vicinity of the active layer of the Zn-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b>. However, this method must depend on the diffusion of Zn, so that it was rather difficult to obtain a steep doping profile in the vicinity of the aforementioned active layer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention was made to overcome the aforementioned defects and thus, an objective of the present invention is to control the diffusion of dopants into an active layer of a semiconductor laser employing a p-type InP substrate thereby improving the aforementioned semiconductor laser characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention, diffusion of dopants into an active layer is controlled, so that the characteristics of a semiconductor laser can be improved.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Descriptions of the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be provided hereinbelow, with reference to the accompanying drawings. In each of the drawings, identical or corresponding parts or elements will be designated by the same reference characters to simplify or omit the description thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a semiconductor laser of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">This semiconductor laser is produced by employing a Zn-doped p-type InP substrate <b>1</b> in which Zn (zinc) is doped into an InP (indium phosphorus) substrate. A Zn-doped p-type InP buffer layer <b>2</b> is provided on the Zn-doped p-type InP substrate <b>1</b>, and on that layer, is stacked an undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b> in which the carrier density is controlled to be 3×10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>or less. A Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b> in which Mg (magnesium) is doped as a p-type dopant into the InP is stacked on the layer <b>3</b>. This layer <b>4</b> is electrically connected to the Zn-doped p-type InP substrate <b>1</b> through the Zn-doped p-type InP buffer layer <b>2</b> and the undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>5</b>, an InGaAsP MQW (Multiple Quantum Well) active layer <b>6</b>, an n-type InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>7</b>, and an n-type InP clad layer <b>8</b> are stacked one after the other on the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b>. While electrically energizing this semiconductor laser, holes are injected into the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b> from the side of the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b> and electrons are injected into the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b> from the side of the n-type InP clad layer <b>8</b>. A laser beam is emitted from the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b> by coupling these holes and electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The stacked film constituted by the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b>, the InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>5</b>, the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b>, the n-type InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>7</b>, and the n-type InP clad layer <b>8</b> has slopes on both sides (hereinafter, they are referred to as mesa <b>9</b><i>a </i>and mesa <b>9</b><i>b</i>, respectively). Mesas <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>have a skirt-shaped form in which the width of each mesa becomes wider as it approaches a position in vicinity of the Zn-doped p-type InP substrate <b>1</b>. A p-type InP buried layer <b>10</b>, an n-type InP current blocking layer <b>11</b>, and a p-type current blocking layer <b>12</b> are successively stacked to have predetermined widths outside the mesas <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b</i>. The Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b> is exposed at the bottom of the mesas <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b</i>. Zn is doped as a p-type dopant in the p-type InP buried layer <b>10</b> and the p-type current blocking layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An n-type InP contact layer <b>13</b> is formed on the entire surface of the n-type InP clad layer <b>8</b> and the p-type current blocking layer <b>12</b>. Isolation grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>are formed outside the p-type InP buried layer <b>10</b>, the n-type InP current blocking layer <b>11</b>, the p-type current blocking layer <b>12</b>, and the n-type InP contact layer <b>13</b>. The p-type InP buried layer <b>10</b>, the n-type InP current blocking layer <b>11</b>, the p-type current blocking layer <b>12</b>, and the n-type InP contact layer <b>13</b> are exposed at the sidewalls of the isolation grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b> is exposed at the bottom of the isolation grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this semiconductor laser, while being electrically energized, a positive voltage is applied to the side of the Zn-doped p-type InP substrate <b>1</b> and a negative voltage is applied to the side of the n-type InP contact layer <b>13</b>, and then, current flows.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the semiconductor laser shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the Zn-doped p-type InP buffer layer <b>2</b> is provided on the Zn-doped p-type InP substrate <b>1</b>. This layer <b>2</b> is one in which the Zn concentration is made lower than the Zn-doped p-type InP substrate <b>1</b>. As a result, the amount of Zn existing in the interstitial sites of this layer is smaller than the Zn-doped p-type InP substrate <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Herein, a lot of inactive Zn is contained in interstitial sites of the Zn-doped p-type InP substrate <b>1</b>. This Zn easily diffuses toward the undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b>. However, an employment of the aforementioned structure allows the distance over which this Zn reaches the undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b> to be longer. Therefore, the amount of the dopant (Zn) which diffuses from the Zn-doped p-type InP substrate <b>1</b> and reaches the undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b> can be suppressed to a small amount.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Moreover, in the above-mentioned semiconductor laser, the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b> is stacked on the undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b>. This layer is one in which Mg is doped in InP as a p-type dopant. Namely, although Zn has been conventionally used as a p-type dopant, Mg is now used in Zn's stead. Herein, the Mg concentration is controlled to be approximately 5×10<sup>17 </sup>to 2×10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is to be noted that the diffusion coefficient of Mg in InP is smaller than that of Zn. Therefore, in the above-mentioned semiconductor laser, diffusion of dopant to the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b> can be suppressed compared with the conventional semiconductor laser.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Moreover, the undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b> is provided between the Zn-doped p-type InP buffer layer <b>2</b> and the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b> in the above-mentioned semiconductor laser. No dopant is doped in the layer <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Herein, in the case when a film containing therein Zn and another film containing therein Mg come into contact with each other, it is well known that these elements diffuse in such a way as to mutually exchange each other (hereinafter, it will be referred to as interdiffusion). However, an application of the aforementioned structure enables it to use the undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b> as a barrier for the above-mentioned interdiffusion. Therefore, the interdiffusion between the Zn-doped p-type InP buffer layer <b>2</b> and the Mg-doped p-type clad layer <b>4</b> can be suppressed. The thickness of each of the Zn-doped p-type InP buffer layer <b>2</b> and the undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b> is controlled so that the interdiffusion is prevented from occurring during crystal growth after forming these layers and in the subsequent heat treatment process.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the aforementioned semiconductor laser, the undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b> is one that does not contain dopants, so that it has a specific resistance larger than the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b>. Therefore, the resistance in the current path from the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b> to the Zn-doped p-type InP substrate <b>1</b> increases compared with that of the structure according to the prior art as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Here, it is to be noted that the undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b> is arranged so as to be located under the bottom faces of the mesas <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>and the bottom faces of the isolation grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the width of the undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b> in the above-mentioned current path is assumed to be larger than that of the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b>. Therefore, an increase in the resistance in the current path can be suppressed to a small level.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the described semiconductor laser, Mg is used as a dopant. The amount of diffusion of Mg into the active layer in this case will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates the measurement results of the Mg concentration of the semiconductor laser (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the present embodiment and the Zn concentration of a conventional semiconductor laser (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) using the Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (hereinafter, it will be referred to as called “SIMS”). The film-configuration of the semiconductor laser used in this measurement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is an enlargement of the dotted line part A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is an enlarged view of the dotted line part A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is graphical view in which the Mg and Zn concentrations are plotted where the abscissa indicates the depth of the InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref> with the bottom part of this layer set to be the point of origin (the direction of an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> or <b>2</b>C being toward the plus side). These concentrations are shown on the left side ordinate. Moreover, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the measured intensity of Ga (gallium) contained in the aforementioned semiconductor laser is also plotted. This measured intensity is indicated on the right side ordinate. The distribution of the measured intensity corresponds to the position of the film shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref>. That is to say, the positions of regions A through E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref> correspond to the regions A through E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the profile of Mg concentration is steeper than the profile of Zn concentration in the vicinity of the interface of the region D and the region E. This indicates that a steep doping profile is formed in the vicinity of the active layer of the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b> by using Mg as a p-type dopant. Moreover, at the region C, the Mg concentration becomes smaller than the Zn concentration. This indicates that the amount of dopant diffusing into the active layer is decreased by using Mg as a p-type dopant.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As a result, it was confirmed that a steep doping profile could be formed in the vicinity of the active layer of the clad layer and that the diffusion of dopants into the active layer could be suppressed by using Mg as a p-type dopant. Therefore, deterioration of device characteristics can be suppressed and the semiconductor laser characteristics can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, a description of the manufacturing method of a semiconductor laser as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be provided hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">First of all, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the Zn-doped p-type InP buffer layer <b>2</b>, the undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b>, the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b>, the InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>5</b>, the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b>, the n-type InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>7</b>, and the n-type InP clad layer <b>8</b> are successively stacked on the Zn-doped p-type InP substrate <b>1</b>. These respective layers are formed by using, for instance, a Metal Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (hereinafter, it will be referred to as MOVPE) technique.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a silicon oxide film <b>15</b> is formed on the n-type InP clad layer <b>8</b>. Then, a resist pattern (not shown in the figure) is formed on the n-type InP clad layer <b>8</b>. By using this as a mask, photolithography is performed to form a mask <b>15</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. Subsequently, wet etching is carried out using the mask <b>15</b><i>a </i>as a mask. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, the mesas <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>are formed at the side walls of the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b>, the InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>5</b>, the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b>, the n-type InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>7</b>, and the n-type InP clad layer <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the p-type InP buried layer <b>10</b>, the n-type InP current blocking layer <b>11</b>, and the p-type current blocking layer <b>12</b> are stacked along the mesas <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b</i>, in order, by using the MOVPE technique. Moreover, the mask <b>15</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> is removed, and the n-type InP contact layer <b>13</b> is formed on the entire surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>. Furthermore, although it is not shown in the drawing figure, the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b>, the p-type InP buried layer <b>10</b>, the n-type current blocking layer <b>11</b>, the p-type current blocking layer <b>12</b>, and the n-type InP contact layer <b>13</b> are selectively etched by the photolithography and the etching technology. As a result, the isolation grooves <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described above, a semiconductor laser shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be manufactured.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a semiconductor laser according to the second embodiment. Herein, it will be described with particular emphasis on points, which are different from the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A p-type InP buried layer <b>16</b>, an n-type InP current blocking layer <b>11</b>, and a p-type current blocking layer <b>17</b> are successively stacked in order, so as to come into contact with the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b>, the InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>5</b>, the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b>, the n-type InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>7</b>, and the n-type InP clad layer <b>8</b> along the mesas <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b</i>. Mg is doped as a p-type dopant into the p-type InP buried layer <b>16</b> and the p-type current blocking layer <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The description of the other configuration will be omitted here since it is identical with that of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this second embodiment, since Mg is used as a dopant for the p-type InP buried layer <b>16</b> and the p-type current blocking layer <b>17</b>, the diffusion of dopants into the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b> can be suppressed, in contrast to the case where Zn is used. Therefore, it is possible to effectively suppress the deterioration of the device characteristics, so that the semiconductor laser characteristics may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Moreover, since Mg is used as a dopant for the p-type InP buried layer <b>16</b> and p-type current blocking layer <b>17</b> in this embodiment, the interdiffusion does not occur between the p-type InP buried layer <b>16</b> (or the p-type current blocking layer <b>17</b>) and the Mg-doped p-type clad layer <b>4</b>. Thus, in addition to the advantageous effects shown by the first embodiment, the diffusion of dopants into the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b> can be further effectively suppressed. Therefore, it is possible to further effectively suppress the deterioration of the device characteristics, so that the semiconductor laser characteristics may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, a description of another modified example of the above-described second embodiment will be provided hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In theaforementioned second embodiment, Mg was used as a dopant for the p-type InP buried layer <b>10</b> and the p-type current blocking layer <b>12</b>. Mg may also be used as a dopant for either of these layers. Namely, it may be acceptable that Mg be used as a dopant for one layer and Zn be used as dopant for the other layer.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the case where such a configuration is applied, any interdiffusion might occur between the layer in which Zn is used as a dopant and the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b>. However, the amount of Zn diffusing into the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b> can be controlled to become smaller than that in the first embodiment. Therefore, in addition to the effects described with the first embodiment, the diffusion of Zn into the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b> can be more effectively suppressed. Therefore, it is possible to further effectively suppress the deterioration of the device characteristics, so that the semiconductor laser characteristics may be improved.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a semiconductor laser according to the third embodiment. Herein, it will be described with particular emphasis on points that are different from the first and second embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An AlGaInAs optical confinement layer <b>18</b>, an AlGaInAs MQW active layer <b>19</b>, an n-type AlGaInAs optical confinement layer <b>20</b> are successively stacked in order on the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b>. The description of the other configuration is omitted as it is essentially the same as that in the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The shown structure is one in which the InGaAsP contained in each of the InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>5</b>, the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b>, and the n-type InGaAsP optical confinement layer <b>7</b> of the semiconductor laser (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) as shown in the second embodiment is replaced by AlGaInAs. AlGaInAs has almost the same range in the band energy gap as InGaAsP and is a material capable of exhibiting the lattice matching to InP. Therefore, the aforementioned replacement is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Moreover, in this case, the difference in the band gap energy of the conductive band at the hetero-interface becomes larger than the case of using InGaAsP. Therefore, an overflow of electrons during energizing may be suppressed. As a result, a semiconductor laser suitable for use in operation at a high temperature can be acquired compared with the first and second embodiments.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a semiconductor laser according to the fourth embodiment. Herein, it will be described with particular emphasis on points that are different from the first to third embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A Be-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>21</b>, in which Be (beryllium) is doped into InP, is stacked on the undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b>.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The description of the other configuration will be omitted, as it is substantially the same as that in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this structure, the Mg-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>4</b> of the semiconductor laser shown in the first embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is replaced by the Be-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>21</b>. Since the diffusion coefficient of Be in the InP film is smaller than that of Zn, a steep doping profile can be formed in the Be-doped p-type InP clad layer <b>21</b> in the vicinity of the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b> in a manner similar to the first embodiment. Moreover, the diffusion of Zn into the above-mentioned active layer can be suppressed. Therefore, similarly to the first embodiment, it is possible to suppress the deterioration of the device characteristics, so that the semiconductor laser characteristics may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Zn may also be used as a p-type dopant for the p-type InP buried layer <b>22</b> and the p-type current blocking layer <b>23</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In this case, the amount of Zn which diffuses from the Zn-doped p-type InP substrate <b>1</b> to the InGaAsP MQW active layer <b>6</b> can be suppressed by the presence of the undoped InP buffer layer <b>3</b>, in contrast to the prior art.</p>
