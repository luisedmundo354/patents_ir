<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) mobile telecommunication system, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for reporting a voice service load to a mobile station in a system supporting both a voice service and a data service.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In CDMA, a pilot signal used for initial acquisition and channel estimation is transmitted continuously or periodically in time. In an IS-2000 based system a base station transmits the pilot signal continuously, while in an HDR (High Data Rate) based system, the base station, transmits the pilot signal periodically.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an IMT-2000 system, a mobile station, if it wants to receive a data service, measures the reception strength (Ec/Io) of a forward pilot signal transmitted continuously from the base station and reports the reception strength to the base station regardless of a handoff situation or a normal situation. The base station then transmits information about a data rate corresponding to the reception strength to the mobile station and provides the data service to the mobile station at the data rate on a supplemental channel (SCH).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, in the HDR system proposed for a high data rate service, the mobile station, if it wants to receive a data service, measures the reception strength (C/I) of a forward burst pilot signal, selects a data rate and a sector corresponding to the reception strength regardless of a handoff situation or a normal situation, and transmits the data rate and the sector as a signal to the base station on a reverse DRC (Data Rate Control) channel in each slot. Upon receipt of forward data rate requests from mobile stations within the sector, the base station schedules user data according to the amount of user packet data and the requested data rates, determines a mobile station to be serviced in next slots after the current packet is completely transmitted, and provides the data service to the selected mobile station at the requested data rate. Here, the base station transmits a traffic channel to a mobile station in time division by scheduling.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The base station can transmit a pilot signal in the above two methods and the mobile station implements a handoff according to the pilot signal. For handoff, the mobile station manages neighboring base stations. The base stations are grouped into sets. The base station sets are categorized as an active set, a candidate set, a neighbor set, and a remaining set. If two or more base stations belong to the active set, the mobile station is placed in a handoff situation. If only one base station exists in the active set, the mobile station is in a normal situation. Base station sets and set management associated with the present invention will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For voice service, the mobile station usually performs a soft handoff in which it communicates with all the base stations in the active set. For data service, the mobile station performs the soft handoff or a hard handoff in which it selects one of the base stations in the active set and communicates with the selected base station in a handoff area. To determine which base stations belong to the active set, the mobile station measures the reception power of pilot signals received from the base stations and reports the measurements to the network. If the reception power measurement is at a threshold level or above, the network requests that the mobile station includes in the active set the base station whose reception power is at or above the threshold level. The mobile station then classifies that base station in the active set as requested.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the case of a hard handoff for data service, the mobile station selects a base station corresponding to the strongest of the reception power of pilot signals from the base stations in the active set and reports the selected base station to the network. Communication with the base station corresponding to the strongest pilot reception power is favorable for voice service because as the base station offers stronger pilot reception power, it can provide a better quality voice service. In data service, however, the quality of a data service and a data rate available to the mobile station are determined according to the transmission power of the base station. Therefore, the pilot reception power cannot be the only criterion by which the mobile station selects a base station for handoff in order to receive a good quality data service.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a signal reception procedure in a mobile station to select a base station in a handoff situation or a normal situation in a conventional system employing a continuous pilot transmission scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the mobile station measures the reception strengths (Ec/Io) of pilot signals from all base stations in an active set that the mobile station manages for handoff in step <b>101</b>. In step <b>103</b>, the mobile station reports information about the strongest reception power and a base station corresponding to the strongest reception power to the network. The network determines a data rate available to the mobile station based on the reported information and transmits the determined data rate as a signal to the mobile station. The mobile station receives the determined data rate from the network in step <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a signal reception procedure in a mobile station to select a base station in a handoff situation or a normal situation in another conventional system employing a periodic pilot transmission scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the mobile station measures the reception strengths (C/I) of pilot signals from all base stations in an active set that the mobile station manages for handoff in step <b>201</b>. If two or more base stations belong to the active set, the mobile station is placed in a handoff situation. If only one base station exists in the active set, the mobile station is in a normal situation. In step <b>203</b>, the mobile station determines a base station and a data rate corresponding to the strongest reception power. The mobile station transmits information about the determined base station and data rate to the network in a DRC symbol that is transmitted in every slot in step <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As described above, the mobile station selects a base station to provide a data service and a data rate for the data service based on pilot reception power without considering transmission power that the base station can spare for the data service in the conventional systems. The pilot signal is a signal transmitted with fixed power from a base station. When a data service and a voice service are provided at the same time, the base station first determines transmission power for the voice service (or voice load) and then assigns the remaining power to the data service. In other words, even though the reception power of a pilot signal is great, it does not imply that the reception power of the data service is great. Hence, it is preferable that the mobile station selects a base station with the highest data service power for data service. Therefore, the best base station and an optimal data rate cannot be determined based on pilot reception power alone.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide an apparatus and method for enabling a mobile station receiving a data service or both a data service and a voice service to select a base station that can provide best services and an optimal data rate in a mobile telecommunication system.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method for selecting an optimal base station and determining an optimal data rate based on transmission power of base stations available for a data service being received by a mobile station in a mobile telecommunication system.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method for broadcasting a voice service load of the base station so that a mobile station receiving a data service or both the data service and a voice service can estimate the transmission power of the base station available for the data service in a mobile telecommunication system.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Still another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method for transmitting two pilot signals with two different orthogonal codes in a base station of a mobile telecommunication system.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method for estimating the transmission power of a base station available for a data service based on the reception strengths of two pilot signals received from the base station by a mobile station of a mobile telecommunication system.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The foregoing and other objects can be achieved by providing an apparatus and method for selecting an appropriate base station and an optimal data rate to provide a voice service and a data service based on a voice service load to provide a voice service and a data service in a mobile telecommunication system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a base station, a pilot gain controller generates a first gain value and a second gain value according to a current transmission power and a remaining transmission power of the base station, a first multiplier receives pilot bits and generates a first control signal by controlling the transmission power level of the pilot bits with the first gain value, a second multiplier receives the pilot bits and generates a second control signal by controlling the transmission power level of the pilot bits with the second gain value, a first spreader generates a first pilot signal by spreading the first control signal with a first orthogonal code, a second spreader generates a second pilot signal by spreading the second control signal with a second orthogonal code different from the first orthogonal code, and an adder adds the first pilot signal to the second pilot signal.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a mobile station, a first receiver despreads the first pilot signal received on a forward pilot channel with the first orthogonal code and measures reception power of the first despread signal, a second receiver despreads the second pilot signal received on the forward pilot channel with the second orthogonal code and measures a reception power of the second despread signal, and a service load estimator estimates the current transmission power and the remaining transmission power of the base station by utilizing a ratio of a second pilot signal reception power to a first pilot signal reception power.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present invention provides a method of broadcasting a voice service load to mobile stations in a base station. According to the present invention, a power ratio of a first pilot signal to a second pilot signal is transmitted in association with a voice load, the two pilot signals being orthogonally spread with different orthogonal codes. For example, a base station with a 30% voice load transmits two pilot signals such that a comparative pilot-reference pilot power ratio is 0.3. This is applicable to both the systems where pilot signals are transmitted continuously and periodically in time. Then, a mobile station estimates the voice service load of the base station based on the power ratio and determines the transmission power of the base station available for a data service. Here, it is assumed that the IS-2000 system transmits a pilot signal continuously in time and the HDR system transmits a pilot signal periodically in time.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates pilot signals transmitted continuously in time and a voice service load in a mobile telecommunication system according to an embodiment of the present invention. As noted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the transmission power of the pilot signals does not vary with time, while the voice service load varies with time. By definition, the maximum transmission power of the base station minus the transmission power of the first and second pilot signals and the power assigned to the voice service load is the remaining available transmission power of the base station, or in particular, is the transmission power available to a data service. The transmission power of the pilot signals is chosen such that a power ratio of the second pilot signal to the first pilot signal is representative of the power of the voice service load. Thus, the mobile station estimates the transmission power of the base station available for the data service by calculating a ratio of the reception powers of the second pilot signal to the first pilot signal broadcast from the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates pilot signals transmitted periodically in time and a voice service load in a mobile telecommunication system according to another embodiment of the present invention. As noted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the total transmission power of the pilot signals does not vary with time, while the voice service load varies with time. The maximum transmission power of the base station minus the power assigned for the voice service load is the remaining available transmission power of the base station, or in particular, is the transmission power available to a data service. The transmission power of the pilot signals is chosen such that the ratio of the transmission powers of the second pilot signal to the first pilot signal is representative of the voice service load. Thus, the mobile station can estimate transmission power of the base station available for the data service by calculating a second pilot-first pilot power ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, each first pilot signal is a reference pilot signal and each second pilot signal is a comparative pilot signal. The first and second pilot signals are orthogonally spread with different orthogonal codes. A base station transmitting device for transmitting two pilot signals with different orthogonal codes will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram of a base station-transmitting device for broadcasting information descriptive of a voice service load on a forward pilot channel according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a reference pilot multiplier <b>512</b> multiplies pilot bits by a first gain received from a pilot gain controller <b>511</b>, for gain control. A comparative pilot multiplier <b>513</b> multiplies the pilot bits by a second gain received from the pilot gain controller <b>511</b>, for gain control. The pilot bits are meaningless data of all 0s or 1s. The pilot gain controller <b>511</b> determines the first and second gains such that a comparative pilot-reference pilot power ratio is representative of a voice service load. An orthogonal spreader <b>514</b> multiplies the output of the reference pilot multiplier <b>512</b> by a first orthogonal code W<b>0</b> assigned to the reference pilot signal. An orthogonal spreader <b>515</b> multiplies the output of the comparative pilot multiplier <b>515</b> by a second orthogonal code W<b>1</b> assigned to the comparative pilot signal. An adder <b>516</b> adds the outputs of the orthogonal spreaders <b>514</b> and <b>515</b>. A pilot channel transmitter <b>517</b> subjects the output of the adder <b>516</b> to PN spreading and frequency conversion and transmits the frequency-converted signal through an antenna (not shown). The pilot channel transmitter <b>517</b> may transmit the pilot signal continuously or periodically in time according to the pilot signal transmission scheme of the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The signal transmitted in the path from the reference pilot multiplier <b>512</b> through the orthogonal spreader <b>514</b> and the adder <b>516</b> to the channel transmitter <b>517</b> is referred to as a first pilot signal, and the signal transmitted in the path from the comparative pilot multiplier <b>513</b> through the orthogonal spreader <b>515</b> and the adder <b>516</b> to the channel transmitter <b>517</b> is referred to as a second pilot signal.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In operation, the pilot gain controller <b>511</b> determines the reference pilot signal gain and the comparative pilot signal gain based on information of a voice service load received from an upper layer controller (not shown). For example, if the voice service load of the serving base station is 30%, the gains of the reference and comparative pilot signals are determined by</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A data service load that the base station can bear is estimated by subtracting the voice service load from the total serviceable load. Then, the reception power of the data service is estimated based on the estimated data service load. Here, the data service reception power can be achieved using a predetermined algorithm based on the reception power of the pilot signals and the estimated data service load, or referring to an internal mapping table. If the voice service load is 0.3 and a ratio of the transmission power of a common channel including a pilot channel to the overall transmission power is 0.25, the IS-2000 system calculates the data Ec/Io from the voice service load by total Ec/Io×(1−0.3−0.25), that is, data Ec/Io=total Ec/Io×(1−voice service load−(transmission power of the common channel/overall transmission power)). The total Ec/Io is known from Ec/Io of the received pilot and the pilot channel transmission power to total transmission power ratio 0.2 generally determined (total Ec/Io=pilot Ec/Io÷0.2). In the HDR system, if the voice service load is 0.3, data C/I=pilot C/I×(1−0.3). Herein, it is noted that a ratio of the transmission power of common channels to the overall transmission power is assumed to be known to the mobile station. That is, the ratio of the transmission power of the common channel to overall transmission power 0.25 and the pilot channel transmission power to total transmission power 0.2 are constant as parameters of a CDMA system.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The mobile station estimates the data service reception power of the base stations that belong to the active set and selects a base station capable of offering the highest data rate based on the estimated reception power, for a handoff. Or the mobile station can request the data rate for the data service from the selected base station.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a mobile station operation for estimating a voice service load using pilot signals continuous in time according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the mobile station measures the reception power (Ec/Io) of pilot channel signals received from all base stations that belong to an active set managed for handoff by the mobile station in step <b>701</b>. Each pilot channel signal includes two pilot signals spread with two different orthogonal codes, for example, a reference pilot signal and a comparative pilot signal. A comparative pilot-reference pilot power ratio represents the load of a voice service provided by a base station. In step <b>703</b>, the mobile station estimates a voice service load by calculating a power ratio of two pilot signals received on each pilot channel. The mobile station estimates a data service load by subtracting the estimated voice service load from the overall load of each base station and then the reception power (Ec/Io) of the data service according to the estimated data service load in step <b>705</b>. Then, the mobile station reports the strongest reception power and a base station corresponding to the strongest reception power to the network in step <b>707</b>. Herein, it is noted that the network indicates a BSC including a BTS. The network determines an optimal data rate based on the reported base station information and informs the mobile station of the determined data rate. In step <b>709</b>, the mobile station receives information about the determined data rate with respect to the transmitted base station information from the network.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the mobile station measures the reception power (C/I) of pilot channel signals received from all base stations that belong to an active set managed for handoff by the mobile station in step <b>801</b>.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As described above, a mobile station, for which a data service or both a data service and a voice service are being serviced, reports a network not the reception power of a pilot signal but the reception power of a data service based on a voice service load reported by a base station. Therefore, the mobile station can select a better base station in a handoff situation and receive a better quality data service at an optimal data rate in a normal situation.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates pilot signals continuous in time, pilot signals periodic in time, and voice service load with respect to power and time according to a third embodiment of the present invention. This pilot signal transmission scheme supports both a system transmitting a pilot signal continuously in time and a system transmitting a pilot signal periodically in time. The mobile station acquires pilot signals continuous or periodic in time according to the pilot transmission scheme and service that it supports and estimates a voice service load in the procedure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In accordance with the present invention, a mobile station, which receives a data service or both a data service and a voice service at the same time, can more accurately estimate the reception power of a data service based on a voice service load reported by a base station. Therefore, the mobile station can select a better base station in a handoff situation and receive a better quality data service at an optimal data rate in a normal situation.</p>
