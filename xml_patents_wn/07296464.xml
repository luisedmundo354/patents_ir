<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a side view of an measurement means or instrument pack <b>10</b> which is adapted to be towed underneath a boat in a body of surface water, such as a lake, in order to take measurements of one or more water quality variables. The instrument pack or sled <b>10</b> includes of an instrument housing, or stack <b>20</b>, which is centrally mounted within a supporting frame <b>50</b>. The frame <b>50</b> comprises a pair of vertically mounted generally trapezoidal outer frames <b>30</b> with a horizontally disposed rectangular frame member <b>31</b> along its top side. The frame <b>50</b> additionally includes vertically and horizontally disposed support members <b>60</b>, <b>65</b> and <b>55</b> respectively to provide additional strength to the frame <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, which depicts a front view of the sled <b>10</b>, shows the horizontal support members <b>55</b> spaced between the pair of trapezoidal frame members <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The sled <b>10</b> additionally includes a fixed rudder <b>70</b>, which comprises a vertically oriented generally flat plate. The rudder <b>70</b> acts as a vane to orientate the sled <b>10</b> when in use. The sled <b>10</b> additionally includes a plurality of lifting eyes <b>80</b> from which the sled <b>10</b> is suspended when in use.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The sled <b>10</b> is adapted to carry various sensors and instruments which can be used to map bodies of surface water. The stack <b>20</b> comprises a cylinder of perforated PVC pipe inside which is housed one or more sensors used by the measurement means to take measurement of physical or chemical variables. In a preferred embodiment the sensor(s) loosely mounted within the stack <b>20</b> to provide shock absorption. Further shock protection for the sensor(s) can be provided by a layer of protective padding, such as foam rubber or the like, which can be mounted between the sensor(s) and the inner wall of the stack <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Sensors can be provided which measure parameters such as water depth, water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved chloride, conductivity, oxidation-reduction potential and water turbidity. A suitable sensor for measuring each of these parameters is manufactured by the Hydro Lab Corporation of Austin, Texas. An integrated unit, known as the “Sonde”, contains the sensors for each of the above mentioned parameters. However, it will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that other suitable sensors are available, and many other water quality, or physical variables can be measured.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition to the stack <b>20</b>, which houses the sensors the sled <b>10</b> has mounted on it a lamp <b>22</b> and video camera <b>24</b>, which both face in generally forward direction. Preferably, the lamp illuminates an ark of around <b>120</b> degrees and produces illumination of sufficient intensity to produce a visibility of <b>6</b> meters or more at a water depth of <b>50</b> meters.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Additionally, a section of hose <b>19</b> or pipe is mounted adjacent to the stack. The hose <b>19</b> has a valve <b>19</b>B at its bottom end and a connection means <b>19</b>A at its top end. In the use, the hose segment <b>19</b> is connected to a pump and filter system via a main hose or conduit (not shown), and can be used to pump water to the surface from adjacent the sensors, in order to take water samples.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> which shows an exemplary embodiment of a system including a sled <b>10</b> as described above, adapted to take measurements and/or generate multi-variable maps of a body of surface water.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The system <b>200</b> is comprised of two portions. The first, or on board portions <b>210</b> comprises all necessary equipment required to record and track data produced by the sensors, collect water samples, and allow practical operation of the system. The so called “on board” portion <b>210</b> of the system <b>200</b> is thus named as it is generally mounted on board a vessel such as a boat, or barge, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The second portion, termed the “under water portion” <b>220</b> is comprised of the sled, sensors and monitoring equipment mounted thereon, as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Turning now to the on board portion, <b>210</b> of the system <b>200</b>. The on board components <b>210</b> include the following equipment:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0084">A boom winch <b>230</b>. The boom winch <b>230</b> is used to raise and lower the sled <b>220</b> as required. Preferably, the boom winch is adapted to lift the sled entirely clear of the water and on board the tow vessel, where the sled can be securely stowed.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0085">Winch drive <b>235</b>. The winch drive <b>235</b> is of a commonly known type and acts to reel in the sled via the boom <b>230</b>.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0086">A data acquisition system <b>240</b>. The data acquisition system collects and records data from the sensors mounted on the sled, and additionally stores navigation information such as the tow boat's position and other appropriate parameters such as the time a reading is taken. The data acquisition system <b>240</b> will in general be a computer including a central processing unit and data storage device.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0087">A video monitor <b>250</b>. The video monitor <b>250</b> displays images captured by the camera mounted on the sled <b>220</b>. The images displayed on the monitor are used by the system operator to ensure that the sled does not collide with any objects in its path and to ensure that the sled is maintained at a suitable separation from the floor of the body of surface water being mapped. Additionally, the images captured by the camera can be recorded for later visual analysis of the floor of the body of surface water being mapped if required.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0088">Navigation DGPS <b>260</b>. A differential global positioning system (DGPS) and antenna is mounted on the tow vehicle to provide accurate monitoring of the path of the tow vehicle. The data from the navigation DGPS <b>260</b> is sent to the data acquisition system and recorded along side simultaneously taken measurements of one or more water quality variables to generate a data set.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0089">Pump <b>270</b> and filter <b>275</b>. The pump <b>270</b> and filter <b>275</b> are used to obtain samples of water from a position along side the sled. The pump <b>270</b> is kept in fluid communication with the sled via a conduit hose <b>272</b>. In order to obtain a sample the pump is activated and water is pumped from the sampling site. Prior to collection as a sample the water is filtered to remove any large particles using filter <b>275</b>. In order to avoid having to prime the pump before each sample is taken a foot valve is located on the bottom most end of pipe <b>272</b> to maintain a column of water within the pipe <b>272</b>.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0090">Generators <b>280</b> and <b>282</b>. Generators <b>280</b> and <b>282</b> provide the required electrical power for the various on board components and under water components of the system <b>200</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> two separate generators <b>280</b>, <b>282</b> are shown, first being a 240 volt AC generator <b>282</b> for suppling power to the data acquisition system and video monitor, and the second being a twelve volt DC generator <b>280</b> for suppling power to the boom winch <b>230</b> and the pump <b>270</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0091">The operation of a system of the type disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in a process for taking a series of measurements of one or more water quality variables, and the creation of a map plotting such water quality variable will now be described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0092">In a first step <b>310</b> of the method <b>300</b> the tow craft is maneuvered to a suitable position on the body of water to be mapped, to begin collecting data of the physical variable of interest. The tow craft will typically be a speedboat or barge, or the like, and will have mounted on it the “on board” components <b>210</b> of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Initially the tow craft additionally carries the sled <b>220</b> and associated sensors and monitoring devices as described above. Once the tow craft is in position the sled <b>220</b> can be lowered, in step <b>320</b>, into the water using boom winch <b>230</b> to a position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The sled <b>220</b> is in communication with the data acquisition <b>240</b> and video monitor <b>260</b> of the system <b>200</b> via data cables, <b>273</b>, <b>274</b> respectively. Fluid communication with pump <b>270</b> is maintained via conduit <b>272</b> so that water samples can be taken as required.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0093">In most applications a predetermined vertical position in the lake will be chosen, at which to take measurements of the variable of interest. For example, if the chosen vertical position is a this may be at a particular depth, say ten meters, the results obtained and map produced will show a horizontal cross-section of a variable in the lake at the chosen depth. Alternatively, the vertical positioning of the sled may be determined with reference to the bottom of the body of water for example measurements can be taken adjacent the bottom of the body of water. In such a situation, the sled <b>220</b> is lowered until it is adjacent to, but not touching the bottom of the body of water. It has been found that measurements of the concentration of various substances or physical variable at the bottom of a body water can be measured by maintaining a separation of approximately one meter between the sled and the bottom of the body of water.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0094">Once the sled <b>220</b> is submerged to the desired depth the data collection process <b>330</b> can be begun. The data collection process <b>330</b> includes three processes, which are preformed substantially simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0095">In the data collection process <b>330</b> the sled <b>220</b> is towed beneath the tow craft, such that the predetermined vertical position of the sled is maintained (step <b>350</b>). If measurements are to be taken at a particular depth no adjustment of the depth of the sled will be required, unless an obstacle is encountered during the measurement run. However, if the sled is to be maintained a set distance, say one meter, above the floor of the body of the water the boom winch (<b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is used to raise and lower the sled <b>220</b> such that the desired separation between the sled and the floor of the body of water is maintained. In order to allow the sled <b>220</b> to be maintained at the correct vertical position using the boom winch, (<b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) video images from a camera mounted on sled <b>220</b> are displayed on a monitor <b>250</b>. The person operating the winch drive <b>235</b> is able to view the region of the body of water adjacent to the sled <b>10</b> and operate the boom winch to raise the sled <b>220</b> clear of any obstacles in its path, or lower the sled so that the desired separation between the sled and the floor of the body of water is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0096">It should be noted that the fixed rudder (feature <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>) acts to orientate the sled <b>220</b> such that the front of the sled <b>220</b> always points in an “upstream” direction, that is in the direction of travel of the sled and tow craft, if no current is present, or into the perceived water flow, if a cross current acts on the sled. By ensuring correct orientation of the sled, the video camera mounted on the sled always points in the direction of motion of the sled, thereby allowing the driver of the boom winch to see any obstacles as the sled approaches them.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0097">In order to allow the winch driver sufficient time to lift the sled clear of any obstacles in its way, the tow craft should tow the sled at a suitable speed. If the tow speed is too high there is a danger that the boom winch will not be able to raise the sled quickly enough in order to clear any obstacles in its path. If the tow speed is too low a non-optimal amount of data will be collected during a tow run. Additional parameters which affect the optimal speed at which to tow the sled include, the time required for the sensors mounted on the sled <b>220</b> to reach equilibrium with the surrounding water, and the need to maintain a sufficient correlation between the position of the sled and the towing craft. If a high tow speed is used the sled will lag behind the tow craft by a greater distance and the position of the boat determined by the DGPS system will not be representative of the position of the sled <b>220</b>. By adding ballast to the sled <b>10</b> the distance the sled lags behind the tow craft towed can be reduced. Thus in areas of high current ballast can be added to the sled ensure that the sled <b>10</b> is not swept too far away from the tow-craft. If the current is relatively slow unnecessary ballast can be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0098">As will also be appreciated by a person skilled in the art the sled should be towed slowly enough for its sensors to come into equilibrium with the surrounding water before making each measurement, otherwise accurate measurements of water quality variable will not be achieved. Typically a speed of around 2 km/h is suitable for taking measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0099">With the sled being towed at the desired depth, measurements of water quality can be taken (step <b>360</b>.) Preferably, measurements of more than one water quality variable are taken simultaneously. In step <b>340</b> the position of the tow craft is determined using the global positioning system, thus producing a data set representing the measurement location and one or more water quality variable. This process can be repeated, thereby building up a data set of water quality measurements and corresponding position readings.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0100">At any particular point of interest the tow craft may be stopped (step <b>370</b>) and water samples taken from the site. The water samples are taken by using pump <b>272</b> to pump water up conduit <b>272</b> and through a filter, prior to collection. Advantageously conduit <b>272</b> attaches to a length of hose (e.g. <b>19</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) on the sled which is fitted with a foot valve <b>19</b>B, thereby allowing a column of water to be maintained in the conduit <b>272</b>, and removing the need to prime pump <b>272</b> before taking each water sample. Once a water sample is taken (step <b>365</b>) the tow craft and sled can be repositioned and further water samples taken (step <b>375</b>.) This process may be repeated either during the measurement run (process <b>330</b>) or separately.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0101">Once all measurements are taken the sled <b>380</b> can be lifted out of the water and back into, a stowed position on the tow craft (step <b>380</b>.)</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0102">At this point all of the data has been collected and a map can be generated (step <b>390</b>) using suitable computer software. Preferably, a topographic map is overlain onto the region being surveyed. Typically a map of the area which has been surveyed has overlayed on to it, in contrasting colours, additional contours or regions shaded to depict the concentration, intensity or variation in the measured physical or chemical variable. It is preferable that the topographic information is derived from water depth readings from the measurement means. However other sources such as the towing boat's depth finder or even available hydrographic charts can be used to obtain the necessary topographical information.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0103">As discussed above a system and method according to the present invention, can accumulate data along the bottom of a body of water, at intermediate depth in the body of water, or along lines of constant bearing. Existing software programs are available (such as “Surfer”) which are adapted to translate data so collected into contour maps, cross-section maps, three dimensional maps or correlation graphs of two or more of the measured variable. Maps and graphs may also be prepared based on the analysis of water samples taken during a sampling run.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref> show exemplary maps, which can be produced using a system, and method as described above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> show portions of Lake Temagami, which is a lake of around 70 kilometers in length located in northern Ontario, Canada. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a portion of Cross Bay, which is located on Lake Temagami.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0105">Turning firstly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> which shows bottom depth contours verses dissolved oxygen contours for a segment of Lake Temagami around Temagami Island. In this map <b>400</b> (and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) the horizontal axis <b>410</b> represents longitude in degrees west, and the vertical axes <b>420</b> represents latitude in degrees north. The line of crosses <b>401</b> represents the path taken by the tow vehicle whilst the sled is taking measurements of the water quality variable. Each cross eg. <b>402</b> represents a measurement point along the path of the tow craft. The total length of the track shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is around 15 kilometers.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0106">The depth contours of the body of water are shown by the lines e.g. <b>403</b> and <b>404</b> with the 20, 40, 50, 60 and 80 foot depth contours being labelled eg. <b>421</b>, <b>440</b>, <b>450</b> and <b>460</b> respectively. Land masses, such as the lake shore and islands eg. Temagami Island <b>475</b> are shown as white regions without topographical contours.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0107">The shading from light to dark grey which is overlayed onto this topographical information of the lake bottom represents dissolved oxygen as a percentage of saturation with air. Scale <b>409</b> shows the percentage saturation which each shade of grey represents. In an alternative embodiment the shades of grey can be represented in colour or as a second set of contours overlain on the topographic contour information.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0108">The dissolved oxygen contours between the adjacent measurement paths are interpolated values calculated by mapping software. In parts of the map in which only a single path is present the dissolved oxygen contours are only accurate in the immediate vicinity of the path as the measurements taken by the sled are only representative of the variable values at the point at which the measurement is taken rather than over some larger volume. Thus, in places of interest such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> a large number of measurements are taken in a small area to build up an accurate picture of the measured physical or chemical variable(s) in the region of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0109">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> which shows a close up view <b>500</b> of a small dissolved oxygen anomaly <b>499</b> located at latitude 46.96° and longitude 80.03° in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0110">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the points at which measurements were taken using the measuring device are marked with crosses <b>501</b> and the dissolved oxygen contours are mapped over the topographical contours eg. <b>510</b>, <b>520</b> as previously described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> it can be determined that a correlation exists in this position between depth and dissolved oxygen. This suggests that ground water is erupting in the deepest part of the lake in this immediate area.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a similar map to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a segment of Cross Bay, and plots topographic contours, against conductivity contours measured in millisiemens. Again the horizontal axis <b>610</b> represents longitude in degrees west, and the vertical axes <b>620</b> represents latitude in degrees north. The line of crosses <b>601</b> represents the path taken by the tow vehicle whilst the sled is taking measurements of the water quality variable. Each cross eg. <b>602</b> represents a measurement point along the path of the tow craft. Depth contours of the body of water are shown by the lines eg. <b>603</b> and <b>604</b> with the 50 and 100 foot depth contours being labelled eg. <b>650</b> and <b>651</b> respectively. However, the land masses, such as the lake shore and islands are shown as white regions with topographical contours in this example.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0112">The scale <b>630</b> shows the correlation between shading and conductivity. This map <b>600</b> shows that there is not a strong correlation between depth and conductivity in this lake.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0113">As will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art various analyses can be performed using graphs of different water quality variables or measures of physical variables. For example, from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> it may be ascertained that in this part of the lake there is an erupting ground water supply with lower concentration of dissolved oxygen than in the surrounding lake water.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0114">Embodiments of the present invention can be used to take measurements and create maps of bodies of standing surface water such as lakes, ponds, lagoons, harbours, tidal estuaries and, with various modifications the continental shelf Within such bodies of water the invention can be used to identity such occurrences as sources of erupting ground water, sources of contaminants or pollutants, and trace their spread in three dimensions throughout the body of water; identify chemical reactions produced by such contaminants introduced into the water. Embodiments of the invention can be used to identify circulation patterns in the standing body of water; the flow rate and volume of contaminants introduced into the body of water and locate sources of contaminants in the water.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0115">Embodiments of the system and method as described above is particularly useful in environmental assessment monitoring and surveying. In large bodies of water such a system and method may be used to determine water quality over the entire body in a quick and efficient manner. Furthermore, such a system may be advantageously employed in mineral exploration. For example, ground water traversing an unknown ore deposit will pick up a distinct chemical signature which may be identified, and the source detected through subsequent ground water discharge into a standing body of water. In combination with geological surveying and other operations the location of the ore deposit can be determined. An embodiment of the system and method could also be used to located sources of fresh ground-water erupting from the continental shelf Such sources of ground-water may then be tapped to supply fresh water to remote costal communities near-by. will be understood that the invention disclosed and defined herein extends to all alternative combinations of two or more of the individual features mentioned or evident from the text or drawings. All of these different combinations constitute various alternative aspects of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0116">The foregoing describes embodiments of the present invention and modifications, obvious to those skilled in the art can be made thereto, without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
