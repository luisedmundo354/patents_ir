<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0002">The present invention relates to a radiation sensitive resin composition comprising a specific siloxane resin and a specific fluorine-containing resin suitable for microprocessing using various types of radiation such as deep ultraviolet radiation, electron beams, and X-rays.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0003">2. Description of Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0004">A recent strong demand for high density and highly integrated LSIs accelerates miniaturization of wiring patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0005">Using short wave rays in a lithographic process is one method for miniaturizing wiring patterns. In recent years, deep ultraviolet rays typified by a KrF excimer laser (wavelength: 248 nm), an ArF excimer laser (wavelength: 193 nm), or an F<sub>2 </sub>excimer laser (wavelength: 157 nm), electron beams, X rays, and the like are being used in place of ultraviolet rays such as g-line (wavelength: 436 nm) and i-line (wavelength: 365 nm).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0006">Novolac resins, poly(vinylphenol) resins, and the like have been conventionally used in resist compositions. However, because these resins exhibit strong absorbance at a wavelength of 193 nm due to inclusion of aromatic rings in the structure, a lithographic process by an ArF excimer laser, for example, using these resins cannot provide high accuracy corresponding to high photosensitivity, high resolution, and a high aspect ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0007">Therefore, a resin material for use in a resist, transparent to a wavelength of 193 nm or less, particularly to an ArF excimer laser (wavelength: 193 nm) or an F<sub>2 </sub>excimer laser (wavelength: 157 nm), and exhibiting excellent dry etching resistance equivalent to or better than aromatic rings has been desired. A polysiloxane is one such polymer. R. R. Kunz et al. of the MIT have reported their research results showing excellent transparency of a siloxane polymer at a wavelength of 193 nm or less, particularly at 157 nm, commenting on superiority of this polymer as a resist material in a lithographic process using radiation with a wavelength of 193 nm or less (e.g. J. Photopolym. Sci. Technol., Vol. 12, No. 4, 1999, P. 561-570, SPIE, Vol. 3678 (1999), P. 13-23). Moreover, polysiloxane polymers are known to exhibit excellent dry etching properties. In particular, a resist containing polyorganosilsesquioxane having a ladder structure is known to possess high plasma resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0008">Several chemically amplified resist compositions using a siloxane polymer have also been reported. A radiation-sensitive resin composition comprising a polysiloxane having an acid-dissociable group such as a carboxylic acid ester group, phenol ether group, etc., on the side chain, bonded to a silicon atom via one or more carbon atoms has been disclosed (e.g. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 323611/1993). However, this polysiloxane cannot provide high resolution if the acid-dissociable carboxylic acid groups on the side chain do not efficiently dissociate. If a large number of acid-dissociable groups dissociate, on the other hand, the curing shrinkage stress of the resist film increases, causing cracks and peels in the resist film.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0009">A positive tone resist using a polymer in which the carboxyl group of poly(2-carboxyethylsiloxane) is protected with an acid-dissociable group such as a t-butyl group has also been disclosed (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 160623/1996). Since this resist protects the carboxyl groups only insufficiently, it is difficult to develop the resist containing a large amount of carboxylic acid components remaining in the non-exposed area using a common alkaline developing solution.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0010">A resist resin composition containing a polyorganosilsesquioxane having an acid-dissociable ester group has also been disclosed (e.g. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 60733/1999). This polyorganosilsesquioxane is prepared by the addition reaction of an acid-dissociable group-containing (meth)acryl monomer to a condensation product of vinyl trialkoxysilane, γ-methacryloxypropyltrialkoxysilane, or the like. The resin has a problem of insufficient transparency to light with a wavelength of 193 nm or less due to unsaturated groups originating from a (meth)acrylic monomer remaining on the polymer side chains. The patent specification also describes a resist resin composition containing a polymer made by the esterification of polyhydroxycarbonylethylsilsesquioxane with t-butyl alcohol. This polymer also has the same problem as a resist as encountered by the polymer disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 160623/1996 due to a low degree of carboxyl group protection.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0011">More recently, Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. 2000-221685 and No. 2000-221686 have disclosed chemically amplified resists in which the resin component contains a siloxane-based resin or silicon-containing resin and a silicon-free resin, such as a resist containing a silsesquioxane polymer and a copolymer of 2-methyl-2-adamantyl methacrylate and mevalonic methacrylate or a resist containing a copolymer of p-hydroxystyrene and tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl methacrylate and a copolymer of p-hydroxystyrene and t-butyl methacrylate. The inventors of these patent applications claim that these chemically amplified resists excel in sensitivity, resolution, pattern-forming properties, dry etching resistance, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0012">Most recently, due to progress of miniaturization of resist patterns LER (line-edge roughness) is being highlighted as an important property of chemically amplified resists, including the chemically amplified resist containing a siloxane polymer. A technology for decreasing the LER is strongly desired.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0013">An object of the present invention is to provide a radiation-sensitive resin composition suitable for use particularly as a chemically-amplified resist exhibiting high transparency at a wavelength of 193 nm or less and excellent LER properties.</p>

<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Formation of Resist Pattern</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0233">In the radiation-sensitive resin composition of the present invention, an acid is generated from the acid generator upon exposure to radiation. The acid-dissociable groups in the siloxane resin (A) or the fluorine-containing resin (B) dissociate by the action of the acid and generate a carboxyl group or hydroxyl group. As a result, solubility of the exposed part of the resist in an alkaline developer increases, whereby the exposed part is dissolved in an alkaline developer and removed to produce a positive-tone resist pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0234">A resist pattern is formed from the radiation-sensitive resin composition of the present invention by applying the composition solution to, for example, substrates such as a silicon wafer and a wafer coated with aluminum or substrates on which an under layer film has been formed in advance, using an appropriate application method such as rotational coating, cast coating, and roll coating to form a resist film. The resist film is then optionally pre-baked (hereinafter called “PB”) and exposed to radiation to form a predetermined resist pattern. Deep ultraviolet rays such as F<sub>2 </sub>excimer laser (wavelength: 157 nm), ArF excimer laser (wavelength: 193 nm), electron beams, X-rays, and the like are preferable as radiation used for exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0235">In the present invention, it is preferable to perform post-exposure bake (hereinafter called “PEB”). PEB ensures smooth dissociation of the acid-dissociable group in the siloxane resin (A) or fluorine-containing resin (B). The heating temperature for PEB is usually 30-200° C., and preferably 50-170° C., although the heating conditions vary depending on the composition of the resist. In order to bring out maximum potentiality of the radiation-sensitive resin composition of the present invention, an organic or inorganic under layer film may be formed on a substrate (Japanese Patent Publication 6-12452, for example). Moreover, a protection film may be formed on the resist film in order to prevent the effects of basic impurities and the like in an environmental atmosphere (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 5-188598, for example). These techniques may be employed in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0236">The exposed resist film is then developed to form a specific resist pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0237">As examples of the developer used for development, alkaline aqueous solutions prepared by dissolving at least one of alkaline compounds such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium silicate, sodium metasilicate, aqueous ammonia, ethylamine, n-propylamine, diethylamine, di-n-propylamine, triethylamine, methyldiethylamine, ethyldimethylamine, triethanolamine, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, pyrrole, piperidine, choline, 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]-7-undecene, and 1,5-diazabicyclo-[4.3.0]-5-nonene are preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0238">The concentration of the alkaline aqueous solution is usually 10 wt % or less. If the concentration of the alkaline aqueous solution exceeds 10 wt %, an unexposed part may be dissolved in the developer.</p>

<p id="p-0244" num="0241">These organic solvents may be used either individually or in combination of two or more.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0242">The amount of the organic solvent to be used is preferably 100 vol % or less of the alkaline aqueous solution. The amount of the organic solvent exceeding 100 vol % may decrease developability, giving rise to a larger undeveloped portion in the exposed area.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0243">In addition, surfactants or the like may be added to the alkaline aqueous solution developer in an appropriate amount.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0244">After development using the alkaline aqueous solution developer, the resist film is generally washed with water and dried.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0245">The radiation-sensitive resin composition of the present invention containing a siloxane resin (A) and a fluorine-containing resin (B) is particularly excellent in LER and exhibits high sensitivity. The resin composition is very useful as a chemically-amplified resist for microprocessing using radiation such as deep ultraviolet radiation, electron beams, and X-rays.</p>

The resist films were developed using a 2.38 wt % tetramethylammonium hydroxide aqueous solution at 23° C. for 60 minutes, washed with water, and dried to form a positive-tone resist pattern. An optimum dose (Eop) at which a line-and-space (1L1S) pattern with a line width of 100 nm was formed was taken as sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0268">The LER when forming the line-and-space (1L1S) pattern with a line width of 100 nm at an optimum dose was measured using a Scanning Electron Microscope S9220 (manufactured by Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation). During this measurement, an image was taken at a magnification of 150,000, accelerating voltage of 300V, probe current of 8.0 pA, and frame rate of 32. Then, the image was processed in a 100 nm line automatic measuring mode, and variations in the 32 mean value obtained by an edge roughness measurement algorithm were calculated using a three-sigma method to obtain the LER measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0269">The evaluation results are shown in Table 1.</p>
