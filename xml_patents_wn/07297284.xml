<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates in general to a liquid separation devices and, more particularly, to a device for separating oils and/or grease from water.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In several industries, and in particular the food industry, there is a need to separate liquid greases, fats and oils from waste water prior to passing the water to the sewage system. The waste water could be, for example, discharge from a washing device for cleaning dinnerware and cooking utensils. If the greases and fats solidify in the sewage system, a blockage can occur which is expensive to remediate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, there is a movement in many localities to recycle grease and oils.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A commercially available separation device of the type described in European Patent EP 890381 B1 is shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>illustrates an exterior perspective view of the separation device <b>10</b>. Effluent (containing two or more immiscible liquids of different densities, typically water entrained with oil, grease dissolved fats and other particles) is received at inlet <b>12</b> providing a passage into housing <b>14</b> (including removable lid <b>15</b>). Effluent is heated using a probe-type heater <b>16</b>, which is coupled to an electrical connection. As described below, the immiscible liquids separate within housing <b>14</b>, and the less dense material (e.g., grease and oils) empties into container <b>18</b>. The more dense liquid (e.g., water) is discharged from water outlet <b>20</b>. Silt may accumulate at the bottom of housing <b>14</b>. The silt may be periodically discharged through silt outlet <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Operation of the separation device <b>10</b> is described in greater detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>illustrates a cross-sectional side view of the separation device <b>10</b>. A coarse filtration chamber <b>24</b> is defined between the housing <b>14</b> and control plate <b>25</b>, which extends the full width of the housing. As effluent enters the coarse filtration chamber <b>24</b> through inlet <b>12</b>, it passes through a filtering basket <b>26</b> (shown in greater detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), which filters out solid particles, such as undissolved fat and other food particles.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">After passing through the basket <b>26</b>, the effluent enters the separation chamber <b>28</b>, defined by control plate <b>25</b>, control plate <b>30</b> (which extends the full width of the housing), top plate <b>32</b> and the bottom of housing <b>14</b>. There are two exits from the separation chamber: (1) through floating ball valve <b>34</b> and through passage <b>36</b>, disposed between the bottom of control plate <b>30</b> and the bottom of the housing <b>14</b>. Top plate <b>32</b> is angled upward from the bottom portion of control plate <b>25</b> towards control plate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Weir plate <b>38</b>, which extends the full width of the housing, defines a water (high density liquid) release chamber <b>40</b>, along with control plate <b>30</b> and the housing <b>14</b>. Outlet <b>20</b> is disposed through the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In operation, as the effluent enters the separation chamber <b>28</b>, the lower density liquid (grease/oil) rises. The flow through the separation chamber <b>28</b> is set at a rate that allows the lower density liquid to separate from the water and float upwards to the surface of the water, where it is contained below the sloping top plate <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The sloping top plate <b>32</b> forces the lower density liquid to accumulate at the entry to floating ball valve <b>34</b>. Floating ball valve <b>34</b> is shown in greater detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Floating ball valve <b>34</b> uses a ball that floats at the interface between the high density liquid and the low density liquid. When the high density liquid reaches a predetermined height, the ball rises to a height which stops flow from the separation chamber <b>28</b> to the container <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As the water flows through the separator <b>10</b>, it must rise above the top of weir <b>38</b> in order to exit. Accordingly, the water in separation chamber <b>28</b> attempts to rise to approximately the same height. Since the top of the separation chamber <b>28</b> is below the top of weir plate <b>38</b>, the hydrostatic pressure of the upward force of the water will push the separated grease/oil at the top of the separation chamber <b>28</b> through valve <b>34</b>. The water, however, cannot pass through the valve <b>34</b>, because the floating valve will stop its passage. Hence, once all the separated grease/oil is forced out of the separation chamber, the valve will remain closed until more grease/oil accumulates.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The separated water passes through passage <b>36</b>, over weir plate <b>38</b> and out outlet <b>20</b>. Silt in the water tends to accumulate at the bottom of housing <b>14</b>, unable to rise over weir plate <b>38</b>. Silt valve <b>22</b>, located at the bottom of housing <b>14</b>, can be opened periodically, and the flow of water out of the valve will flush out the silt.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In many fields of use for the separator <b>10</b>, and in particular the food industry, it can be assumed that the employees who will operate and maintain the separator will be relatively transient between employers. Accordingly, aspects of the operation and maintenance of the separator must allow for unfamiliarity with details. Matters such as periodic cleaning of various components of the separator, such as the floating ball valve, if performed incorrectly, can lead to unwanted consequences, such as allowing water to exit into the oil/grease container or oil/grease flowing out of the outlet <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Also, it would be beneficial to improve the flow of liquids through the separation chamber, since oil and grease are by their nature sticky and tend to accumulate on hard surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly, there is a need in the industry for an improved separator.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one aspect of the present invention, a separator includes a tank having an inlet, an inlet chamber, a separation chamber and an outlet chamber, with the inlet feeding effluent into the inlet chamber, the inlet chamber being in communication with the separation chamber through a first passage and the separation chamber in being communication with the outlet chamber through a second passage. A basket having at least one tapered side disposed in the inlet chamber below the inlet, such that the one tapered side is disposed at an angle relative to an adjacent sidewall of the inlet chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another aspect of the present invention a baffle directs effluent into the basket with greater force.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another aspect of the present invention, an asymmetrical flange prevents mis-orientation the basket and baffle.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another aspect of the present invention the continuous seating and continuous flange on the basket prevents floatable solids bypassing the basket and floating up with the oil to interfere with the oil valve ball seating.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another aspect of the present invention a self closing silt valve eliminates the chance of the silt valve being left open, which may cause the heater to overheat, burn out and cause smoking of the oil.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The present invention is best understood in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-11</figref> of the drawings, like numerals being used for like elements of the various drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a prior art filtration basket <b>26</b>. The basket has a front side (facing the housing at inlet <b>12</b>) and a back side (facing control plate <b>25</b>) that is perforated with holes <b>50</b>, as is the bottom of the basket. Since the front side is relatively flush with housing <b>14</b> and the back side is relatively flush with control plate <b>25</b>, and the ends are not perforated, almost all of the effluent flow is through the holes in the bottom of the basket. Over time, food particles will accumulate on the bottom of the basket <b>26</b>, severely limiting flow into the separation chamber <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Other problems concern removal and replacement of the basket <b>26</b>. The prior art uses a handle <b>52</b> which terminates through holes on either side of the basket. The basket <b>26</b> has flanges <b>54</b> on either side; flanges <b>54</b> normally rest on support clips <b>56</b> formed on either side of the housing in the coarse filtration chamber <b>24</b>. In order to accommodate the exposed ends of the handle <b>52</b> when the basket is removed or replaced, slots <b>58</b> are formed in support clips <b>56</b> through which the ends of the handle may pass.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">During operation, the slots <b>58</b> prevent a complete seal between flanges <b>54</b> and support clips <b>56</b>. Some of food particle in the effluent may pass through the slots <b>58</b>, bypassing basket <b>26</b>. Food particles may also pass through the narrow gap between the front edge of the basket and the outer body <b>14</b> and the rear edge of the basket and the control plate <b>25</b>. Excessive food particles entering the separation chamber <b>28</b> can clog the floating ball valve <b>34</b>, resulting in water passing into the oil collection chamber <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>through <b>3</b><i>d </i>illustrate perspective, top, cross-sectional front and cross-sectional side views of an improved basket <b>60</b>. The improved basket increases efficient effluent flow, eliminates solid particles in the effluent from bypassing the filtration mechanism of the basket, and enhances effluent separation in the separation chamber <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As distinguished from the vertical sides of basket <b>26</b>, tapered basket <b>60</b> has tapered sides that angle away from housing <b>14</b> and control plate <b>25</b>. Further, all four sides are perforated. Accordingly, a larger surface area of the basket is separated from a constricting wall for more efficient flow through the basket <b>60</b>. Since there is more area for holes <b>62</b>, the holes <b>62</b> can have a smaller diameter, without affecting flow of effluent through the basket. In the prior art, holes <b>50</b> had a diameter of approximately 11/64 inches, while holes <b>62</b> can have a diameter of approximately 1/16 inches (0.15875 cm). This allows smaller particles to be trapped by the basket <b>60</b> for more effective coarse filtering. Further, more debris may be collected before the basket needs to be emptied, since the basket will continue to efficiently filter the effluent even when the bottom is covered.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">An additional improvement is the addition of inclined baffle plate <b>64</b> to the basket <b>60</b>. Baffle plate <b>64</b> deflects water from inlet <b>12</b> towards the bottom of the basket <b>60</b>. A cut-out <b>64</b><i>a </i>in the baffle plate <b>64</b> faces inlet <b>12</b>. As effluent enters the coarse filtering chamber <b>24</b>, the baffle directs the effluent downwards to help drive oils and grease under the control plate <b>25</b>. Further, as effluent-hits the baffle plate <b>64</b>, it is driven through a layer of oil, which helps to saturate the chemical emulsions, causing the emulsions to release the oil.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The handle <b>68</b> of basket <b>60</b> is attached to the top of the baffle plate <b>64</b>. Because the handle does not protrude from the sides of the basket <b>60</b>, the slots <b>58</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are no longer necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With the addition of the baffle plate <b>64</b>, it is important that the basket <b>60</b> is oriented correctly (such that the baffle plate deflects effluent downward, not upward). A careless replacement of the basket <b>60</b> could thus cause problems with the operation of the separator <b>10</b>. To prevent an errant replacement, the basket <b>60</b> has asymmetric flanges <b>54</b><i>a </i>and <b>54</b><i>b</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, flange <b>54</b><i>a </i>is wider than <b>54</b><i>b</i>, and support clip <b>56</b><i>a </i>is wider than <b>56</b><i>b</i>. If the basket <b>60</b> is replaced in the reverse orientation, the mismatch between the support clips <b>56</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and flanges <b>54</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>will not allow the basket to seat properly (and the lid will not be able to close). This will notify the operator that the basket needs to be reversed. Front and back flanges <b>54</b><i>c </i>and <b>54</b><i>d </i>provide an integral lip that completely surrounds the basket <b>60</b> for a complete seal.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a type of floating ball valve <b>34</b> used in the prior art. Floating ball valve <b>34</b> includes a ball <b>70</b> within housing <b>72</b>. Ball <b>70</b> is held within housing <b>72</b> by a grid <b>74</b>. Insert <b>76</b> includes a mating portion <b>78</b> for mating with the housing <b>72</b> above the ball <b>70</b> and an outlet portion <b>79</b> for communicating with the oil/grease container <b>18</b>. A passage <b>80</b> is formed in insert <b>76</b> through the mating portion <b>78</b> and outlet portion <b>79</b>, with a tapered opening <b>82</b> at the end of the passage <b>80</b>. Passage <b>80</b> is coupled to outlet <b>84</b>. O-ring <b>86</b> seals mating portion <b>78</b> and housing <b>72</b>. As described above, the ball <b>70</b> is designed to float at the interface between two immiscible liquids (e.g., water and oil/grease). As the water rises, the oil/grease is pushed into passage <b>80</b>, where it exits to the oil/grease container <b>18</b> via outlet <b>84</b>. Once all of the lower density liquid (oil/grease) has been pushed into the passage <b>80</b>, the ball <b>70</b> presses against the tapered opening <b>82</b>, thereby closing the passage. In this way, only the lower density liquid can pass through the passage <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Since the oils and grease will pass through the passages <b>80</b> and <b>84</b> to the oil/grease container <b>18</b>, the passages <b>80</b> and <b>84</b> need to be cleaned periodically to remove congealed substances. To do so, a brush is inserted into the passage <b>80</b> from above or passage <b>84</b> from the side and an up and down scrubbing motion is used to dislodge the congealed oil/grease within the passage <b>80</b>. During the cleaning process, the mating portion <b>78</b> can easily become dislodged from the housing <b>72</b>, causing failure of the valve <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>illustrates a cross-sectional side view of an improved floating ball valve <b>90</b>, which can be used in place of floating ball valve <b>34</b>. Floating ball valve <b>90</b> includes a mating portion <b>78</b>, with two protruding locking pins <b>92</b>. Housing <b>72</b> includes two vertical channels <b>94</b> forming L-shapes with respective horizontal channels <b>96</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>) to accept pins <b>92</b>. The mating portion <b>78</b> is engaged within housing <b>72</b> by aligning the pin <b>92</b> with vertical channel <b>94</b>, inserting the mating portion <b>78</b> into the housing <b>72</b> until pin <b>92</b> reaches the end of the vertical channel <b>94</b>, then rotating the pin within the horizontal channel <b>96</b> to lock the mating portion within the housing <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>shows a perspective view of housing <b>72</b>, illustrating the vertical channel <b>94</b> and horizontal channel <b>96</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c </i>illustrates the insert <b>76</b> in a locked position within housing <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Another problem associated with floating ball valve <b>34</b> is the problems which can occur if the ball <b>70</b> sticks to the mating portion <b>82</b>. This is possible because of the oil/grease that will coat both surfaces during normal operation of the separator <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>illustrates a schematic of an alternative embodiment of a valve which can be used to eliminate the need for a floating ball. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, a sensor <b>100</b> senses the location of the interface between the two immiscible liquids. When the interface has reached a predetermined level, the sensor sets a control signal to actuator <b>102</b>. Responsive to the control signal, the actuator closes a valve <b>104</b> which controls flow between an oil/grease inlet <b>106</b> and an oil/grease outlet <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>b </i>through <b>6</b><i>d </i>illustrate three types of valves that could used implement valve <b>104</b> (other valve types could be used as well). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>illustrates a cross-sectional side view of a butterfly valve <b>110</b>. The butterfly valve operates by rotating a disk <b>114</b> within cylindrical housing <b>112</b>. When surface the disk <b>114</b> is aligned parallel to the axis of the cylindrical housing, the valve <b>110</b> is in an open state; when the surface of the disk <b>114</b> is perpendicular to the axis of the cylindrical housing <b>112</b>, the valve <b>110</b> is in a closed state.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>c </i>illustrates a cross-sectional side view of a gate valve <b>120</b>. In a gate valve, a gate <b>122</b> is positioned within tube <b>124</b> to prevent flow and withdrawn from tube <b>124</b> to allow flow.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>d </i>illustrates a cross-sectional side view of a ball valve <b>130</b> (not to be confused with the floating ball valve <b>34</b>). The ball valve incorporates a sphere <b>132</b> with a cylindrical bore <b>134</b> disposed through the center of the sphere. When the bore is aligned with the inlet <b>136</b> and outlet <b>138</b>, liquid can pass from inlet to outlet. When the bore <b>134</b> is rotated to a position where it does not communicate between inlet <b>136</b> and outlet <b>138</b>, liquid can no longer pass through the valve.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The ball valve <b>130</b> is a preferred embodiment for the present invention, because the operation of the valve rotating between opened and closed positions tends to scrape away congealed oil/grease at the inlet and outlet. Therefore, this valve is somewhat self-cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a </i>illustrates improvements made to the separator <b>10</b> to improve flow of the liquids (and silt) inside the separation chamber for improved operation. First, the inside of housing <b>14</b> and surfaces of control plate <b>25</b>, top plate <b>32</b>, control plate <b>30</b> and weir <b>38</b> can be coated with a Teflon layer <b>39</b>, or another non-stick coating layer <b>39</b>, in improve flow and reduce friction and adhesion between the oil/grease/silt and these surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a </i>illustrates improvements made to heating of the liquids, particularly in the separation chamber <b>28</b>. In the prior art, a probe-type heating element has been used. This presents several problems. First, the heater is mounted to the outside of the unit, where it can be inadvertently hit by employees, and knocked loose. Second, the surface area of the heater is relatively small and, therefore, the heat is localized.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>, several alternatives are shown for heating the liquids in the separation chamber <b>28</b>. These alternatives could be used separately or combined. The first alternative uses a heating blanket <b>140</b> disposed on the bottom of housing <b>14</b>. This eliminates any protruding housing for the heater and heats a larger surface area, keeping the temperatures relative constant across the separation chamber <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A second alternative uses induction heating to heat the top plate <b>32</b> and/or valve <b>34</b>. Since the top plate <b>32</b> and valve <b>34</b> are in nearly constant contact with the oil/grease, these elements can be heated by induction to most effectively provide heat for keeping the oil/grease as liquid as possible. The induction heating of the top plate <b>32</b> and/or valve <b>34</b> could be used in conjunction with the heat blanket <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Additionally, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>, a self-closing valve <b>147</b> is used as the silt valve. The valve <b>147</b> is held open manually long enough (generally about ten seconds) for the silt to be forced out by the pressure of water in the chamber and will close immediately the operator's hand is removed from the valve handle. This protects the device from being operated with the silt valve open, which could allow effluent to pass directly out the silt valve; this could cause the heater to overheat and to burn out and/or cause the oil to overheat and smoke.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>and <b>7</b><i>c </i>illustrate top and bottom seals used in the improved separator. A top seal <b>142</b> is formed on the perimeter of the housing <b>14</b> and on the tops of control plates <b>25</b> and <b>30</b>, providing a continuous seal. In the preferred embodiment, the seal <b>142</b> is mechanically attached to the housing <b>14</b> and control plates in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c</i>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c</i>, the seal material, preferably in the form of a hollow neoprene tube or similar flexible hollow tubing, is affixed to an edge of the housing <b>14</b> and control plates <b>25</b> and <b>30</b> using a mechanical gripping mechanism <b>144</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the mechanical gripping mechanism includes teeth <b>146</b> which, when pushed onto the housing edges, will grab the edges to form a strong mechanical bond. Any gaps between strips of materials should be filled with a sealing compound.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In operation, the top seal <b>142</b> can withstand considerable water pressure with just the weight of the lid <b>15</b> maintaining contact with the seal <b>142</b>. Thus, if an surge of water is received through inlet <b>20</b>, water is maintained within the housing <b>14</b>, and is kept from overflowing from either the coarse filtration chamber <b>24</b> or the water release chamber <b>40</b> into the interior chamber <b>148</b> of the housing <b>14</b>, where it can become rancid.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Prior art mechanisms use a compressive foam that is affixed to the lower edge of the lid by means of a self adhesive strip, and a seal is created by the use of lid clamps to hold the lid to the body. The claims make the user access to the unit difficult. Also, the clamped lid discourages the operators from properly maintaining the unit.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">An additional bottom seal <b>149</b> is affixed around the bottom edge of the housing <b>14</b>. Once again, the bottom seal <b>149</b> is preferably in the form of a hollow neoprene tube affixed to the edges of the housing <b>14</b> using a mechanical gripping mechanism <b>144</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Prior art methods for sealing the separator to a floor, such as by caulking, have adhesion problems, particularly in the grout lines. Since units will often be retrofit to existing restaurants, the grease embedded in the grout resists adhesion, allowing water from floor cleaning to seep under the unit. Also, caulking complicates moving of the unit. Placing the unit on legs such that the floor can be cleaned under the unit can add height to the unit, reducing the positive fall of the effluent from sink and dishwasher drains.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The bottom seal <b>149</b> has been shown to effectively seal the unit to the floor, and is particularly effective in sealing the grout lines, since the weight of the unit holds the bottom seal <b>149</b> firmly within the grout lines.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a separator <b>150</b> which has the advantage that it can be used in an in-ground embodiment. For illustration purposes, separator <b>150</b> is shown with the prior art heater <b>16</b> and floating ball valve <b>34</b>, it being understood that the other improvements described herein could be used in the place of these elements.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, basket <b>60</b> performs coarse filtering on effluent received through inlet <b>12</b>. Control plate <b>25</b> has an angled portion <b>152</b> to provide an improved flow through basket <b>60</b> (this improvement can be used in other configurations as well). A downward sloping bottom control plate <b>154</b> has a V-shape (or channel) to catch silt, and is preferably Teflon coated. The V-shape bottom control plate transitions into weir <b>156</b>, maintaining a V-shape which is slanted upwards to the desired predetermined height to provide hydrostatic pressure on the separated oil at valve <b>34</b>. Control plate <b>158</b>, is coupled to the top of housing <b>14</b> and provides a channel <b>160</b> through which the separated water flows. Control plate <b>158</b> includes an enlarged portion <b>162</b>. Heater <b>16</b> is disposed through top plate <b>32</b>, within compartment <b>164</b>. Apart from compartment <b>164</b>, the area above top plate <b>32</b> can be used as a sump <b>166</b> to store oil/grease from oil/grease valve <b>34</b>, preferably in a removable container. Access to the tapered basket <b>60</b>, sump <b>166</b>, compartment <b>164</b> and oil valve <b>34</b> can be made by removing one or more lids (not shown) on the top of housing <b>14</b>. If silt is to be separate from the water, a water outlet <b>168</b> is placed above a silt valve <b>170</b>. Alternatively, a single outlet can be provided, which disposes of both water and silt. A mesh screen <b>172</b> is positioned in front of water outlet <b>168</b> to filter out silt.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In operation, silt from the effluent will gather at the bottom plate <b>154</b>, and will be drawn towards the lowest portion of the “V” shaped plate <b>154</b> at the interface with the weir <b>156</b>. The flow of water through channel <b>160</b> will push the silt up the channel <b>160</b>. The enlarged portion <b>162</b> of the channel will create turbulence and additional suction to pull silt up and over the top of weir <b>156</b>. Silt will fall to silt valve <b>170</b>, which can be periodically opened to a silt outlet or collected separately in a container coupled to the silt valve <b>170</b>. The remainder of the water flows out of water outlet <b>168</b> into the sewage system.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Over time, some silt may collect on weir <b>156</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a scraper which matches the profile of weir <b>156</b> to remove this silt.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Preferably, all inside surfaces of separator <b>150</b> are Teflon coated to decrease resistance and improve flow.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a diagram of a separator with a large grease container for containing both grease/oil separated from the effluent and for containing used grease/oil from operations, such as from frying machines. In this embodiment, an underground separator <b>150</b> (an above ground separator of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>could also be used) is coupled to a storage tank <b>170</b> which is large enough to hold all the discard oil/grease from effluent and operations. Pipe <b>173</b> couples the valve <b>34</b> to the storage tank <b>170</b>. Opening <b>174</b> allows workers to pour the oil/grease into the storage tank from an oil caddy, for example. Alternatively, the oil/grease from operations could be pumped directly to the tank <b>170</b>. Heater <b>176</b> heats the contained oil so that it does not solidify. Valve <b>178</b>, typically a quick disconnect valve, provides a suitable connection to an oil pump used to pump oil/grease from the tank <b>170</b> for reclamation. Pipe <b>180</b> is disposed between valve <b>178</b> and the bottom of the tank <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In operation, the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> allows a business to consolidate all oil/grease waste for removal by a collection company, typically an outside contractor or municipality. The unified design allows the collection company to collect all of the used oil/grease from a restaurant. By using the underground configuration, oil drums/dumpsters could be eliminated from the back of the restaurant, or other business.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an embodiment for an above-ground bidirectional separator <b>182</b> (with lid <b>15</b> removed), i.e., the valve <b>34</b> and heater <b>16</b> can be located on either side of the housing <b>14</b>. The housing <b>14</b> includes two oil valve housings <b>72</b>, one of which will receive a valve <b>34</b> and the other of which will have a plug installed. Container <b>18</b> is mounted through opening <b>186</b> on the side of the valve <b>34</b>, the other opening <b>186</b> is closed with a blank. The holes <b>186</b> have slotted holes adjacent to them to enable either the container <b>18</b> or support or blank plate to be mounted. Threaded connections <b>188</b> are made on either side of the housing <b>14</b> for receiving the heater <b>16</b>; the side not receiving the heater is closed with a threaded plug.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> allows the separator <b>182</b> to be installed in either flow direction, which reduces the cost of inventory that must be maintained and allows the most efficient installation within a business. Further, the direction of the separator <b>182</b> can be switched if a kitchen is remodeled (on average, a commercial kitchen is remodeled every five years) to accommodate a change in flow through the pipes.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates an embodiment for eliminating trapped air in the separation chamber <b>28</b>. In certain circumstances, such as startup, a rush of effluent with entrained air bubbles into separation chamber <b>28</b> can cause the ball <b>70</b> to stick against tapered opening <b>82</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>). As the entrained air bubbles separate from the effluent, they can hold the ball <b>70</b> against the tapered opening <b>82</b> causes the valve to remain closed. Daily cleaning of the valve has been found to reduce the problem, but as the entrapped air in the separation chamber <b>28</b> escapes through the valve, it propels the oil/grease in the valve at the person cleaning the valve.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a breather tube <b>190</b> is in communication with the separation chamber <b>28</b> (in the illustrated embodiment, the breather tube <b>190</b> is disposed through the unused valve housing <b>72</b>, however it could be disposed through any suitable part of top plate <b>32</b>). The breather tube <b>190</b> extends to near the lid <b>15</b>, such that hydrostatic pressure cannot force oil/grease out of the breather tube <b>190</b>. Alternatively, the breather tube <b>190</b> could feed into the ball valve, such that any oil/grease emitted from the breather tube <b>190</b> would be fed into the container <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In operation, since the breather tube communicates directly with the separation chamber <b>28</b>, without a ball valve to interrupt communication, air can always pass out of the separation chamber through the breather tube <b>190</b> and therefore, the air will not cause the ball valve to close improperly.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">It should be noted that animal fats may solidify in the breather tube <b>190</b>. Accordingly, the breather tube <b>190</b> should be kept hot by electrical trace and insulation, or by other methods.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>illustrate a cross-sectional side view and a top view, respectively, of an embodiment of a ball valve <b>34</b> with an integral breather tube <b>190</b>. In this embodiment, a breather tube hole <b>191</b> is formed through mating portion <b>78</b>, with the tube <b>190</b> extending upwards from hole <b>191</b> to a level near lid <b>15</b>, or other level that will ensure that hydrostatic pressure will not force oil/grease out of the breather tube <b>190</b>. Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>illustrate outlet <b>84</b> as a trough, rather than a pipe. A trough configuration is generally easier to clean, and uses less material.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates another embodiment of an in-ground separator <b>200</b>. This embodiment is similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, with the container <b>18</b> locate above top plate <b>32</b>, such that it can be accessed by removing lid <b>15</b>. Heater <b>16</b> is located below top plate <b>32</b> and has extended portions <b>16</b><i>a </i>to provide additional surface area for heating the effluent. The operation of the separator <b>200</b> is the same as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">This embodiment provides an in-ground separator that can be used, for example, inside a restaurant work area. The container can be easily accessed and removed for transporting the oil/grease to a storage container.</p>
