<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to an optical pickup apparatus having an optical detection area for compensating for tracking error and, more particularly, to an optical pickup apparatus, which performs focus/tracking servo follow-up on optical disks having different track pitches by compensating for tracking error offset attributable to the optical axis shift of an objective lens using the optical intensity distribution of the optical detection areas of an optical detection unit formed in an optical detection means.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recently, due to the trend toward voluminous data, there have been developed optical disks that allow data to be stored and read in an optical manner, that is, that allow data to be stored by enabling the light transmittance, reflectivity, phase and polarization of a data storage location to be varied, and allow data to be read by enabling the variations of data to be read using light.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">That is, an optical disk stores data on a circular disk, and allows data to be read by the irradiation of focused laser light thereon and the reading of the reflectivity, or the phase or polarization variations of the light at the time of reflection. The optical disk is a storage medium that allows minute pits having a light wavelength size to be formed on a disk and allows digital signals ‘1’ and ‘0’ according to the presence and absence of a pit to be generated, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, in optical disk markets, there are being quickly popularized Digital Versatile Disk (DVD) multimedia systems compatible with optical disks having different track pitches, that is, a DVD-Random Access Memory (RAM) having a track pitch of 1.23 or 1.48 μm and a DVD-Read-Only Memory (ROM)/±R/RW having a track pitch of 0.74 μm. In conjunction with this, an optical pickup apparatus are required to have the compatibility that allows data to be stored in optical disks having different track pitches or data to be read from the optical disks.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The optical pickup apparatuses function to focus light without aberration on optical disks, converge light reflected by the diffractive interference of the pits of the optical disks, and convert the reflected light into electric signals so as to record and reproduce data.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the meantime, the optical pickup apparatuses perform tracking/servo follow-up by a Push-Pull method using one beam or Differential Push-Pull (DPP) method to store data on optical disks or read data stored on optical disks.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Of the above-described tracking/servo follow-up methods, a Push-Pull method uses the difference in the amount of light detected by a four-segmented photo detector shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as a Tracking Error Signal (TES) that is expressed by [(a+c)−(b+d)].</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">That is, when an optical spot formed by a central beam focused on an optical disk through an objective lens and optical spots formed by both side beams accurately follow the signal tracks of the optical disk, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an photo detector detects a tracking error signal for the optical disk using the optical intensity distribution of four segmented areas, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In that case, when an optical beam focused from an objective lens follows the center of a signal track, optical intensity distribution on the optical detector is uniform and a tracking error signal calculated in terms of an electrical signal using [(a+c)−(b+d)] is 0.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, in the case where light is focused from the objective lens OL onto the right side of a signal track, the optical intensity distribution of the photo detector is formed so that a large amount of light is irradiated onto the right side compared to the left side, so that a tracking error signal calculated in terms of an electric signal using [(a+c)−(b+d)] has a (+) value.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In contrast, in the case where light is focused from the objective lens OL onto the left side of a signal track, the optical intensity distribution of the photo detector is formed so that a large amount of light is irradiated onto the left side compared to the left side, so that a tracking error signal calculated in terms of an electric signal using [(a+c)−(b+d)] has a (−) value.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When the tracking error signal is detected by the photo detector as described above, the optical pickup allows a light beam irradiated from the objective lens to follow the center of the signal track by operating an actuator in conjunction with the detected tracking error signal, thus performing tracking servo for the optical disk.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In tracking servo follow-up for the optical disk, an optical spot focused on the track of an optical disk is required to a smaller optical intensity variation with respect to tracking shift attributable to the right and left movement of an objective lens.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, since an optical spot focused on the track of an optical disk, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, has higher optical intensity distribution in the central region of the optical spot and lower optical intensity distribution in the side regions of the optical spot, in the case where an objective lens moves to the right or left due to the eccentricity of the optical disk, a problem arises in that a tracking error offset error occurs, thus making accurate tracking servo follow-up difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the case where diffracted light reflected by an optical disk is filtered by the diameter of an objective lens even though accurate tracking follow-up has been performed on an optical disk, a problem arises in that the balance of the right and left optical intensity distribution of an optical spot is not maintained, and thus a tracking error offset, in which a tracking error signal for the optical disk is output, occurs even though accurate tracking servo follow-up is being performed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the case of a DVD-ROM/±R/RW having a track pitch of 0.74 μm, a diffracted beam having a diffraction angle larger than an incident angle that an objective lens can accommodate is filtered out by the objective lens and only diffracted beams having 0 and ±1-order diffraction coefficients are incident on an optical detection means, thus forming an optical spot having a baseball shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In contrast, in the case of a DVD-RAM having a track pitch of 1.23 or 1.48 μm, the diffracted light is made to have a smaller diffraction angle by a track pitch larger than that of a DVD-ROM/±R/RW, so that the incident diffracted light is not filtered out by the objective lens, but is incident on the optical detection means.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this case, in the case where the objective lens shifts to the right or left, the lightest central beam of an optical spot formed by a diffracted beam reflected after the performance of tracking for an optical disk is moved to the right or left in conjunction with the shift of the objective lens, so that a tracking error offset signal for the optical disk is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">That is, the central beam of the optical spot is moved in conjunction with the right or left shift of the objective lens even though tracking servo for the optical disk has been successfully performed, so that a tracking error offset signal, in which tracking servo has not been successfully performed due to the difference of the balance of optical intensity distribution, occurs, thus preventing accurate tracking servo follow-up from being performed for the optical disk.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For another method for performing tracking/servo follow-up, Korean Unexamined Pat. Publication No. 2001-0098602 discloses a technical concept of detecting a tracking error signal using a DPP method.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In Korean Unexamined Pat. Publication No. 2001-0098602, there is disclosed an optical pickup apparatus <b>1</b> that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, includes a laser source <b>2</b> generating a light beam B, a diffracting means <b>3</b> diffracting the light beam B emitted from the laser source <b>2</b>, a beam splitter <b>4</b> transmitting the light beam B or reflecting the light beam B in a specific direction, a collimator lens <b>5</b> forming the parallel flux of light, an objective lens <b>7</b> focusing the light beam B on the signal surface of an optical disk <b>6</b>, and a photo detector <b>8</b> receiving light returning from the optical disk <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The photo detector <b>8</b> constituting a part of the optical pickup <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, is formed of a main photo detector <b>8</b><i>a </i>and two side photo detectors <b>8</b><i>b</i>. The main photo detector <b>8</b><i>a </i>is segmented into four units lengthwise and breadthwise and receives a main spot MS, and each of the side photo detectors <b>8</b><i>b </i>is segmented into two units breadthwise and receives a side spot SS.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this case, the output signals of the units are indicated by A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H, respectively. A tracking error signal is generated from an output obtained by calculation between the output signals of the photo detectors <b>8</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The main photo detector has four light receiving units lengthwise and breadthwise, and each of the side detectors has two light receiving units breadthwise. Separate push-pull signals are generated by the respective photo detectors, a tracking error signal is generated from an output obtained by calculation between the Push-Pull signals, and DC offset amounts occurring in the Push-Pull signals in the photo detectors are cancelled for the Push-Pull signals. As a result, even though the DC offset amounts of signals SSP<b>1</b> and SSP<b>2</b> are different, it is possible without using a calculation equation to prevent an offset amount from occurring in the Push-Pull signal. Accordingly, it is possible to perform high precision tracking servo, and high-density recording can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">However, the above-described DPP method has disadvantages in that it is difficult to apply the DPP method to optical disks having different sizes because the DPP method requires accuracy to locate an auxiliary beam on the boundary of a track, and it is impossible to perform servo because a tracking error signal is considerably reduced when disks having different track pitches are read.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">That is, when the locations of side beams are adjusted on a single type of disks, the central and side beams of diffracted light, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, are focused on the center of a track, so that it is possible to detect a tracking/focus error signal using a conventional astigmatic detection method or the conventional DPP method.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">However, in the case where disks having different track pitches are read, a problem arises in that it is possible to detect a focus error signal using the conventional astigmatic detection method, but it is impossible to detect a tracking error signal using the conventional DPP method because side beams are not focused on the center of a track.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide an optical pickup apparatus, which is capable of detecting a tracking error for a DVD-RAM by adjusting the angles of auxiliary beams so as to use a conventional DPP method, and detecting a tracking error for a DVD-ROM/±R/RW by compensating for tracking error offset attributable to the optical axis shift of an objective lens using optical intensity distribution formed on the specific optical detection areas of an optical detection unit on which the tracking error signal is not formed.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Reference now should be made to the drawings, in which the same reference numerals are used throughout the different drawings to designate the same or similar components.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An optical pickup apparatus, in which optical detection areas for tracking error offset are formed in accordance with the present invention, detects a tracking/focus error signal using the optical intensity distribution of light reflected and diffracted from an optical disk in the case where the beam incident from an objective lens falls on the center of a track of the optical disk, and detects a tracking/focus error signal by compensating for tracking error offset using the optical intensity distribution of optical detection areas on which the tracking error signal is not formed or that is barely influenced by the tracking error signal in the case where the beam incident from an objective lens does not fall on the center of a track of the optical disk. The optical pickup apparatus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, is constructed to include a light emitting means <b>100</b>, an optical means <b>200</b> and an optical detection means <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In that case, the light emitting means <b>100</b> emits laser light to record and reproduce voice/image data on and from an optical disk <b>400</b> having a specific track pitch and to detect focus/tracking signals so as to accurately read data recorded tracks. For example, the light emitting means <b>100</b> may be a laser diode that emits laser light having a wavelength of 780 or 650 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The optical means <b>200</b> functions to focus laser light irradiated from the light emitting means <b>100</b> on a track of the optical disk <b>400</b>, and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, includes a diffraction plate <b>210</b>, a beam splitter <b>220</b>, a collimator lens <b>230</b>, a wavelength plate <b>240</b> and an objective lens <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The diffraction plate <b>210</b> produces linearly polarized laser light having a specific diffraction coefficient, in particular, a 0, +1 or −1-order diffraction coefficient, by diffracting the laser light irradiated from the light emitting means <b>100</b>, and transmits the linearly polarized laser light to the beam splitter <b>220</b>. In particular, the diffraction plate <b>210</b> is a grating.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The beam splitter <b>220</b> allows linearly polarized laser light, which has a specific diffraction coefficient and is incident from the diffraction plate <b>210</b>, to branch off to the direction of the optical disk <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Furthermore, the beam splitter <b>220</b> also functions to receive laser light reflected by the optical disk, and allows the laser light to branch off to the direction of an optical detection means (will be described later) so as to perform tracking/servo follow-up on the optical disk <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The collimator lens <b>230</b> converts linearly polarized laser light, which has a specific diffraction coefficient, is allowed to branch off by the beam splitter <b>220</b> and is incident from the beam splitter <b>220</b>, into parallel light, and allows the parallel light to be incident on the quarter wave plate <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The quarter wave plate <b>240</b> converts linearly polarized laser light having a specific diffraction coefficient, which is incident parallel to each other from the collimator lens <b>230</b>, into circularly polarized laser light, and allows the circularly polarized laser light to be incident on the objective lens <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The objective lens <b>250</b> focuses laser light, which is incident from the quarter wave plate <b>240</b>, on a track of the optical disk <b>400</b> storing specific image and voice data, in more detail, a DVD-RAM having a track pitch of 1.23 or 1.48 μm or DVD-ROM/±R/RW having a track pitch of 0.74 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The optical detection means <b>300</b> includes first, second and third optical detection units on which a central beam having a 0-order diffraction coefficient and side beams having ±1-order diffraction coefficients are focused, respectively. Each of the optical detection units is divided into a specific number of optical detection regions, and at least one of the optical detection units is provided with an optical detection area on which a tracking error signal, which is used to compensate for tracking error offset attributable to the optical axis shift of an objective lens, is not formed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In this case, when central and side beams of diffracted light incident from the optical means, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, are focused on the center of a track of a DVD-RAM <b>400</b> having a track pitch of 1.23 μm, the optical detection means, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 13</figref>, detects the focus error signal of the optical disk <b>400</b> using a Differential Astigmatic Detection (DAD) method based on the optical intensity distribution of the central and side beams that are focused on first optical detection units <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>′ and <b>310</b>″, second detection units <b>320</b>, <b>320</b>′ and <b>320</b>″ and third optical detection units <b>330</b>, <b>330</b>′ and <b>330</b>″, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The optical detection means <b>300</b> detects the tracking error signal of the optical disk <b>400</b> using a DPP method based on the optical intensity distribution of central and side beams that are focused on the first optical detection units <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>′ and <b>310</b>″, the second detection units <b>320</b>, <b>320</b>′ and <b>320</b>″ and the third optical detection units <b>330</b>, <b>330</b>′ and <b>330</b>″, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When diffracted beams having 0 and ±1 diffraction coefficients, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, are focused on DVD-ROM/±R/RW <b>400</b> having a track pitch of 0.74 μm through the optical means <b>200</b>, the optical detection means <b>300</b> detects the focus error signal of the optical disk using a astigmatic detection method based on the optical intensity distribution of the central beam that is focused on the first optical units <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>′ and <b>310</b>″.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the case where the DVD-ROM/±R/RW <b>400</b> has a relatively narrow track pitch compared to a DVD-RAM, so that a side beam is not located at the central region of a land, and thus a tracking error signal is not detected using a DPP method, the optical detection means <b>300</b> detects the tracking error signal of the optical disk <b>400</b> using a Modified Push-Pull (MPP) method that utilizes the optical intensity distribution of an optical detection area of the first optical detection units <b>310</b>, <b>310</b>′ and <b>310</b>″, the second detection units <b>320</b>, <b>320</b>′ and <b>320</b>″ and the third optical detection units <b>330</b>, <b>330</b>′ and <b>330</b>″, on which a tracking error signal is not formed, to compensate for tracking error offset.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Although the detection of a focus/tracking error signal of an optical disk is being described based on the case where the central and side beams of diffracted light fall on the center of a track of a DVD-RAM but do not fall on the center of a track of a DVD-ROM/±R/RW, the present invention is not limited to this case but is applied to the opposite case.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 13</figref>, a process of detecting the tracking/focus error signals of optical disks having different track pitches using the optical intensity distribution of reflected beams focused on an optical detection pattern having a specific shape formed on the optical detection means is described in detail below.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The optical detection means <b>300</b> is the place on which optical spots formed by the central and side beams of diffracted light having a specific diffraction coefficient are formed. The optical detection means <b>300</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, includes a first detection unit <b>310</b>, a second detection unit <b>320</b> and a third detection unit <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In that case, the first detection unit <b>310</b> is eight-segmented into optical detection areas A<b>1</b>, B<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, B<b>2</b>, D<b>1</b> and C<b>1</b> on which the central beam of diffracted light having a 0-order diffraction coefficient is focused.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The optical detection areas A<b>2</b>, B<b>2</b>, D<b>2</b> and C<b>2</b> formed on the central region of the first detection unit <b>310</b> are optical detection areas on which a tracking error signal is not formed. The optical intensity distribution of the optical detection areas is used to compensate for tracking error offset attributable to the optical axis shift of the objective lens having a track pitch that causes at least one side beam of diffracted light not to be focused on the center of a track.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The second optical detection unit <b>320</b> is formed above the first optical detection unit <b>310</b>, and is four-segmented into optical detection areas E<b>1</b>, E<b>2</b>, F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> on which a side beam having a −1-order diffraction coefficient.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Although in the above-described embodiment, the detection of a focus/tracking error signal of an optical disk has been described based on the case where the central and side beams of diffracted light fall on the center of a track of a DVD-RAM but do not fall on the center of a track of a DVD-ROM/±R/RW, the present invention is not limited to this case but is applied to the opposite case.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As described above, the present invention compensates for tracking error offset attributable to the optical axis offset of an objective lens using the optical intensity distribution of the optical detection areas of an optical detection means (on which the central and side beams of diffracted light incident from an optical disk are focused) on which a tracking error signal is not formed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As a result, the present invention can perform tracking/servo follow-up for optical disks having different track pitches by compensating for tracking error offset attributable to the optical axes shift of the objective lens using the optical intensity distribution of the optical areas on which a tracking error signal is not formed.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.</p>
