<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The following two regular U.S. patent applications (including this one) are being filed concurrently, and the entire disclosure of the other application is incorporated by reference into this application for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">U.S. application Ser. No. 11/143,363; filed Jun. 1, 2005, entitled “Co-Planar Surface and Torsion Device Mirror Structure and Method of Manufacture for Optical Displays”</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. application Ser. No. 11/143,371; filed Jun. 1, 2005, entitled “Method and Device for Fabricating a Release Structure to Facilitate Bonding of Mirror Devices onto a Substrate”</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This present invention relates generally to manufacturing objects. More particularly, the invention relates to a method and structure for fabricating a spatial light modulator with a co-planar surface and torsion device. Merely by way of example, the invention has been applied to the formation of a spatial light modulator having a torsion spring and mirror plate positioned in the same plane. The method and device can be applied to spatial light modulators as well as other devices, for example, micro-electromechanical sensors, detectors, and displays.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) are used in a number of application areas. For example, MEMS have been used in micro-mirror arrays, sensors, and actuators. In some of these applications, a suspended member is supported by a flexible hinge attached to a stationary portion of the mirco-mirror array. Flexibly attached to the hinge, the suspended member is attracted to an electrode upon application of an electrical force and restored to an original position by a restoring force. In this manner, the array of micro-mirrors can be tilted in relation to a light source. In some applications, it is beneficial to have the hinge located beneath the micro-mirror surface in a hidden position, enabling the fill factor of the array to be increased. As the fill factor of the micro-mirror array is increased, the potential quality of two-dimensional images created by optical systems using the array is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As merely an example, some conventional MEMS have utilized various micro-mirror designs, such as micro-mirrors mounted on flexible pedestals coupled to the backside of the micro-mirror surface. In some of these designs, the flexible pedestals extending from the mirror substrate are bonded to a control substrate using a wafer bonding process. However, in these designs, the reliability and repeatability of the process of bonding the flexible posts to the control substrate may be reduced due to the small surface areas joined during the bonding process. Thus, there is a need in the art for methods and apparatus for an improved support structure adapted to couple mirror devices to a control substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the present invention, techniques for manufacturing objects are provided. More particularly, the invention relates to a method and structure for fabricating a spatial light modulator with a co-planar surface and torsion device. Merely by way of example, the invention has been applied to the formation of a spatial light modulator having a torsion spring and mirror plate positioned in the same plane. The method and device can be applied to spatial light modulators as well as other devices, for example, micro-electromechanical sensors, detectors, and displays.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a specific embodiment of the present invention, a spatial light modulator is provided. The spatial light modulator includes a first substrate comprising a plurality of electrically activated electrodes and a bias grid. The spatial light modulator also includes a standoff structure coupled to the first substrate. The standoff structure includes a central portion projecting to a first height above the first substrate and an extension portion projecting to a second height above the first substrate, the second height being less than the first height. The spatial light modulator also includes a mirror plate including a central contact structure integrally formed with the central portion of the standoff structure, a torsion beam coplanar with the central contact structure and free from contact with the standoff structure, and a reflective surface coupled to the torsion beam and free from contact with the standoff structure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another specific embodiment of the present invention, a micro-mirror flexibly supported by a standoff structure is provided. The micro-mirror includes a mirror layer having an upper surface adapted to reflect incident radiation and a lower surface opposite the upper surface. The standoff structure includes a first portion integrally formed with the mirror layer. The first portion includes a first planar interface coupled to the lower surface of the mirror layer, a second planar interface opposite the first planar interface, and a body section extending along a first axis from the first planar interface to the second planar interface.

The second portion includes an upper surface physically separated from the plane of the first planar interface by a first distance, a lower surface coplanar with the second planar interface, and a body section extending along the first axis. The micro-mirror also includes a substrate coupled to the second planar interface of the first portion of the standoff structure and to the lower surface of the second portion of the standoff structure.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an alternative embodiment of the present invention, a method of fabricating a spatial light modulator is provided. The method includes providing a first substrate structure comprising a plurality of layers and forming a standoff structure in a first layer selected from the plurality of layers of the first substrate structure. The method further includes providing a second substrate comprising a bonding surface and a support surface and joining the standoff structure to the bonding surface of the second substrate. The method also includes removing at least a second layer selected from the plurality of layers of the first substrate structure, selectively patterning the first layer of the first substrate structure to form a micro-mirror, and selectively patterning the first layer to remove a portion of the standoff structure and form a torsion spring hinge co-planar with the micro-mirror.</p>

For example, the present technique provides an easy to use process that relies upon conventional technology. In some embodiments, the method provides for a spatial light modulator with an increased fill-factor. Additionally, the method provides a process that is compatible with conventional process technology without substantial modifications to conventional equipment and processes. Preferably, the invention provides for an improved integrated structure including integrated circuits and mirror structures for display applications. Depending upon the embodiment, one or more of these benefits may be achieved. These and other benefits will be described in more throughout the present specification and more particularly below.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the present invention, techniques for manufacturing objects are provided. More particularly, the invention relates to a method and structure for fabricating a spatial light modulator with a co-planar surface and torsion device. Merely by way of example, the invention has been applied to the formation of a spatial light modulator having a torsion spring and mirror plate positioned in the same plane. The method and device can be applied to spatial light modulators as well as other devices, for example, micro-electromechanical sensors, detectors, and displays.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram that illustrates the general architecture of a spatial light modulator (SLM) <b>100</b>. The illustrated embodiment has three layers. The first layer is a mirror array <b>103</b> that has a plurality of deflectable micro-mirrors <b>202</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the micro-mirror array <b>103</b> is fabricated from a first substrate <b>105</b> that is a single material, such as single crystal silicon. An example of one way of forming this SLM is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/378,056, filed Feb. 27, 2003, commonly owned, and hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The second layer is an electrode array <b>104</b> with a plurality of electrodes <b>126</b> for controlling the micro-mirrors <b>202</b>. Each electrode <b>126</b> is associated with a micro-mirror <b>202</b> and controls the deflection of that micro-mirror <b>202</b>. Addressing circuitry allows selection of a single electrode <b>126</b> for control of the particular micro-mirror <b>202</b> associated with that electrode <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The third layer is a layer of control circuitry <b>106</b>. This control circuitry <b>106</b> has addressing circuitry, which allows the control circuitry <b>106</b> to control a voltage applied to selected electrodes <b>126</b>. This allows the control circuitry <b>106</b> to control the deflections of the mirrors <b>202</b> in the mirror array <b>103</b> via the electrodes <b>126</b>. Typically, the control circuitry <b>106</b> also includes a display control <b>108</b>, line memory buffers <b>110</b>, a pulse width modulation array <b>112</b>, and inputs for video signals <b>120</b> and graphics signals <b>122</b>. A microcontroller <b>114</b>, optics control circuitry <b>116</b>, and a flash memory <b>118</b> may be external components connected to the control circuitry <b>106</b>, or may be included in the control circuitry <b>106</b> in some embodiments. In various embodiments, some of the above listed parts of the control circuitry <b>106</b> may be absent, may be on a separate substrate and connected to the control circuitry <b>106</b>, or other additional components may be present as part of the control circuitry <b>106</b> or connected to the control circuitry <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an embodiment according to the present invention, both the second layer <b>104</b> and the third layer <b>106</b> are fabricated using semiconductor fabrication technology on a single second substrate <b>107</b>. That is, the second layer <b>104</b> is not necessarily separate and above the third layer <b>106</b>. Rather, the term “layer” is an aid for conceptualizing different parts of the spatial light modulator <b>100</b>. For example, in one embodiment, both the second layer <b>104</b> of electrodes is fabricated on top of the third layer of control circuitry <b>106</b>, both fabricated on a single second substrate <b>107</b>. That is, the electrodes <b>126</b>, as well as the display control <b>108</b>, line memory buffers <b>110</b>, and the pulse width modulation array <b>112</b> are all fabricated on a single substrate in one embodiment. Integration of several functional components of the control circuitry <b>106</b> on the same substrate provides an advantage of improved data transfer rate over conventional spatial light modulators, which have the display control <b>108</b> line memory buffers <b>110</b>, and the pulse width modulation array <b>112</b> fabricated on a separate substrate. Further, fabricating the second layer of the electrode array <b>104</b> and the third layer of the control circuitry <b>106</b> on a single substrate <b>107</b> provides the advantage of simple and cheap fabrication, and a compact final product. After the layers <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>106</b> are fabricated, they are bonded together to form the SLM <b>100</b>. Additional examples of methods for joining the substrates to form a bonded substrate structure are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/756,923, filed Jan. 13, 2004, commonly owned, and hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the substrate <b>105</b> includes a number of standoff regions extending from a lower portion of the substrate and arranged in an array as a waffle pack grid pattern. The standoff regions are adapted to align with bonding areas located between adjacent electrodes <b>126</b>. Mirrors <b>202</b> are formed in the upper layers of substrate <b>105</b> by a release process in later stages of processing. In some designs, the standoff regions provide mechanical support for the mirror structure and are not moveable. Thus, light reflected from the upper surfaces of the standoff structures reduces the contrast of the optical system incorporating the spatial light modulator. In some designs, an absorbent material may be applied to the upper surfaces of the standoff regions to reduce reflections. However, these approaches reduce the fill factor of the array, potentially degrading system performance.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a simplified exploded perspective view of a micro-mirror fabricated according to one embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a portion of CMOS substrate <b>310</b> includes electrodes <b>312</b>, landing pads <b>314</b>, and bonding surface <b>520</b>. Standoff structure <b>645</b> includes an integrated surface <b>210</b> coupled to the lower surface (not shown) of the mirror layer <b>640</b> and a bonding surface (not shown) opposite the integrated surface <b>210</b>. The standoff structure <b>645</b> also includes centrally located base section <b>650</b> extending from the integrated surface to the bonding surface along a first axis and lateral extension arms <b>642</b> extending from the base section along a second axis orthogonal to the first axis. As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the first axis is aligned with the z-axis and the extension arms extend from the base section along the x-axis. Of course, this arrangement is not required by the present invention. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a torsion beam is defined in the mirror layer <b>640</b> by openings <b>690</b> along with openings <b>682</b><i>a </i>and <b>682</b><i>b</i>. In an embodiment of the present invention, the torsion beam includes two torsion spring arms <b>684</b><i>a </i>and <b>684</b><i>b </i>that extend away from two sides of central base section <b>686</b>. As illustrated, the torsion spring arms are coplanar with the mirror layer <b>640</b> and extend along the x-axis. Each of the torsion spring arms are fixed to the central base section and the mirror plate at the diagonal corners of the mirror plate. Accordingly, the mirror layer <b>640</b> is free to rotate in the y-z plane in response to activation of the electrodes <b>312</b>. As the mirror layer rotates about the x-axis, a restoring torque is present in the torsion beam. Of course, this geometry is only one of a number of geometries provided by embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a simplified perspective view of a mirror substrate according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, mirror layer <b>640</b> has been inverted and electrode substrate <b>310</b> has been omitted, showing the bonding surface <b>220</b> of the standoff structure <b>645</b> and the underside of mirror layer <b>640</b>. As will be described more fully below, the mirror substrate including the mirror layer <b>640</b> and the standoff structure <b>645</b> is wafer bonded to substrate <b>310</b> in a specific embodiment of the present invention. Referring to the illustration provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, bonding surface <b>220</b> extends along the entire face of the standoff structure and is bonded to bonding surface <b>520</b> using techniques described more fully below. Subsequently, mirror layer <b>640</b> and standoff structure <b>645</b> are preferentially etched from the upper side of the mirror layer to form openings <b>690</b> and remove the support provided by standoff structure <b>645</b> for portions of the mirror layer <b>640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> below, a layer of a composite substrate structure is processed to form the standoff structure <b>645</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the standoff structure is fabricated using an etching process that terminates at the underside of layer <b>640</b>. As illustrated, extension arms <b>642</b> extend from opposite sides of central section <b>650</b>. In particular, adjacent arms <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> are separated by openings <b>240</b>. The dimensions of the standoff structure, in particular the height to which the structure extends from layer <b>640</b>, the dimensions of central section <b>650</b>, the width and length of the extension arms, and the spacing <b>240</b> between the arms are predetermined according to embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is a simplified perspective illustration of a standoff structure at an intermediate stage of processing according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the standoff structure includes a release section <b>260</b> that is removed during a release step. Additional details of the fabrication process are discussed below. Initially integrally formed with the mirror layer, the release section <b>260</b> includes portions extending along both sets of extension arms <b>642</b>. The thickness <b>262</b> of the release section is defined during the release step and is typically a function of the etch process used to remove the release section, as described more fully below. In some embodiments, the thickness <b>262</b> is selected to ensure that the mirror plate does not make contact with the extension arms <b>642</b> when the mirror is placed in an activated state. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the upper surface <b>220</b> of the standoff structure, which is an integrated layer coupled to the mirror layer, has a smaller surface area than the lower surface <b>270</b> of the standoff structure, which is bonded to the second substrate as described more fully below. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the lower surface area of the standoff structure is equal to the surface area of the extension arms plus the surface area of the surface <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments the strength of the bond per unit area between the standoff structure and the second substrate is less than the strength of the bond between layer <b>220</b> and the mirror due to the integrated nature of the interface.

Moreover, in an embodiment according to the present invention, the flexible member is a vertical torsion spring, in which the height of the hinge is greater than the width, but this is not required by the present invention.

In embodiments according to the present invention, the height and position of the standoff structure are selected so that the upper surface of the micro-mirror is tilted at a predetermined angle with respect to the horizontal when the micro-mirror is in the activated state.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref> will illustrate one of the benefits provided by embodiments of the present invention. Since the spatial light modulator in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is centrally supported by standoff structure <b>330</b>, rather than a waffle pack grid structure surrounding micro-mirrors <b>320</b>, the fill factor of an array of spatial light modulators fabricated according to embodiments of the present invention, which is a function of the gap between adjacent micro-mirrors, can be higher than in some alternative designs. In embodiments in which the openings <b>680</b><i>a </i>and <b>680</b><i>b </i>are defined using well developed photolithographic processes, the dimensions of the openings are generally well-controlled and may be as small as sub-micron dimensions. Accordingly, high fill factors are available using embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a simplified perspective view of a spatial light modulator including an array of micro-mirrors according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a number of micro-mirrors are arranged in a spatial pattern to form a two-dimensional array. The micro-mirrors, supported by the standoff structures and torsion spring hinges as described above, are laterally separated by air gaps <b>410</b>. For purposes of clarity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> provides an illustration in which portions of the spatial light modulator are omitted as a function of position to illustrate the three-dimensional nature of the spatial light modulator according to embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above, because the air gaps between adjacent mirrors are formed using photolithograph processes, the spacing between adjacent mirrors is a predetermined distance. For example, in an embodiment, the air gap <b>410</b> is 0.8 μm. In other embodiments, the air gap <b>410</b> ranges from about 0.3 μm to about 1.0 μm. Of course, the particular air gap will depend on the particular application and may not be the same on all sides of a particular micro-mirror. The fill-factor of a micro-mirror array, defined as the area of the reflective surfaces divided by the total area of the array, increases as the gap between adjacent micro-mirrors decreases. In display applications, increases in fill-factor typically result in improvement in the image quality produced by the spatial light modulator. Thus, embodiments of the present invention provide photolithographically defined spacings between mirrors and controllable fill-factors.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> are simplified schematic illustrations of a spatial light modulator at various stages of a fabrication process according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates the formation of layer <b>510</b> on substrate <b>310</b>. In an embodiment, the layer <b>510</b> is a dielectric layer suitable for formation of dielectric bond pads <b>520</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> and described below.

Alternative embodiments utilize deposited and patterned layers of silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, spin-on-glass (SOG), low-k dielectrics, or the like. Moreover, dielectric bond pads <b>520</b> may be formed by a combination of such layers.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Preferably, a dielectric layer is deposited by a low temperature process that preserves the integrity of the control circuitry and electrodes fabricated on substrate <b>310</b> in previous processing steps.

Alternative embodiments employ atmospheric or low pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process to form the dielectric layer. The dielectric layer may be planarized after deposition, for example, by using a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process to form a uniform upper dielectric surface for the layer from which the dielectric bond pads are formed.

Openings <b>680</b> separate adjacent mirrors from each other, enabling for mirror rotation as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6G</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6H</figref> are openings <b>682</b><i>a </i>and <b>682</b><i>b </i>formed in layer <b>640</b>. Openings <b>682</b> partially define a torsion spring hinge along section <b>684</b> of micro-mirror <b>670</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, openings <b>680</b> cooperate with openings <b>690</b> to form a torsion beam coupled to mirror layer <b>640</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6H</figref>, the torsion beam, sometimes referred to as a torsion spring hinge, couples the micro-mirrors <b>670</b> to a central portion of standoff structure <b>645</b>. In a specific embodiment, the openings <b>682</b> and <b>690</b> are formed in layer <b>640</b> and selected portions of standoff structures <b>645</b> to release the micro-mirror in a manner to allow for rotation of the mirror around an axis. Referring to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6H</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, portions of the extension arms <b>642</b> initially coupled to the mirror surface at locations <b>690</b> are removed during the release process. In other words, sections <b>690</b> of the mirror layer are removed along with attached sections of the extension arms, exposing surfaces <b>692</b> on the extension arms. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6H</figref>, the width of the torsion spring <b>684</b> measured along a direction (the y-direction) perpendicular to the length of the hinge (the z-direction) is a predetermined distance. In one specific embodiment, the width of the torsion spring hinge is 0.18 μm. In an alternative embodiment, the width ranges from about 0.1 μm to about 0.5 μm. The thickness of the torsion beam, measured in the z-direction, is equal to the thickness of layer <b>640</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As a result of the fabrication process described in relation to this embodiment, the centrally located base section extends to a greater z-height than the extension arms as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Thus, in this embodiment, the mirror layer <b>640</b> and the standoff structure <b>645</b> are in contact at the centrally located base section <b>210</b> while other sections of the upper portion of the standoff structure (namely the extension arms) have been removed. The removal process is performed to provide sufficient clearance between the upper portions <b>692</b> of the standoff structure and the mirror layer <b>640</b> for the mirror to rotate freely under the influence of an applied electric field and placed in an activated state. In the activated state, the torsion force present in the torsion beam provides a restoring force to return the mirror to the unactivated state after removal of the applied electric field. Moreover, because of the spacer (reference numeral <b>240</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> and reference numeral <b>622</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) formed between adjacent extension arms, the majority of section <b>684</b> of the torsion beam is not coupled to the standoff structure, but functions as a torsion spring for mirror <b>670</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The standoff structures employed in embodiments of the present invention provide a mounting surface for the micro-mirror with material properties and dimensions that facilitate bonding of substrates <b>310</b> and <b>610</b>. In some substrate bonding processes, voids are formed at the bond interface, weakening the bond and presenting reliability problems. Embodiments of the present invention reduce the adverse impacts of voids possibly formed at the bond interface. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the interface between the mirror layer <b>640</b> and the standoff structure <b>645</b> is fabricated from a single piece of material in the illustrated embodiment. In a particular embodiment, the interface between the mirror layer <b>640</b> and the standoff structure <b>645</b> is fabricated from a single crystal silicon substrate. Typically, the single crystal silicon substrate is formed as the substrate is cut from a boule or through an epitaxial process, providing a continuous material interface characterized by uniformity at the interface. For this interface, the void density is typically zero as a result of the substrate fabrication processes. Accordingly, the mechanical properties of the material at the interface between the mirror layer and the standoff structure, including the interface strength, are optimal.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring once again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the characteristics of the interface between the standoff structure <b>645</b> and the bond pad <b>520</b> are a function of the substrate bonding process (or processes) used to join the substrates and form the composite substrate structure. Generally, the substrate bonding process is selected to reduce the number of voids formed at the bond interface. However, in embodiments of the present invention, the dimensions of the lower portions of the standoff structure provide a robust bond, even in the presence of some voids. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the outer dimensions of the lower portion of the standoff structure are approximately 14 μm by 2 μm. In particular, the dimensions of the extension arms <b>642</b> are approximately 14 μm by 0.6 μm, providing a bonding surface that is able to tolerate a number of voids without significant impact on interface strength and reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Moreover, the geometry of the standoff structure and torsion spring hinge are not limited to the geometry illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In alternative embodiments of the present invention, the shape and dimensions of the standoff structure and torsion spring hinge are modified as appropriate to other applications. In some embodiments, the width of the extension arms <b>642</b> are increased to provide additional surface area for the substrate bonding process, thereby increasing the reliability of the bond between the standoff structure and the second substrate. In other embodiments, the width and length of the centrally located base section is increased to increase the surface area of the integrated interface between the upper portion of the standoff structure and the mirror layer. Furthermore, the dimensions of the torsion spring hinge are variable and may be selected to achieve system goals such as flexibility and reliability of the hinge.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a simplified flowchart illustrating one method of fabricating a spatial light modulator according to an embodiment of the present invention. Process <b>700</b> includes providing a first substrate having a mirror layer in step <b>710</b>. As described previously, in a specific embodiment, the first substrate is a multi-layer substrate structure, such as a SOI substrate. The dimensions of the layers making up the multi-layer substrate are selected to satisfy various design constraints. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, a silicon layer is provided that is thick enough to form a mirror layer integrated with a standoff structure. The surfaces of the SOI substrate are polished in some embodiments to facilitate substrate bonding processes in subsequent processing steps.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Step <b>712</b> includes forming a standoff structure from the first substrate. In some embodiments, the standoff structure is formed by an etching process. In this embodiment, a surface of the first substrate is masked and etched to form a standoff structure extending from the first substrate. Typically, a mask is generated to define the portion of the first substrate that will be etched to form the standoff structures. Standard techniques, such as photolithography, can be used to generate the mask on the first substrate. As mentioned previously, in an embodiment the micro-mirrors and standoff structures are formed from a single material, such as single crystal silicon. The structures fabricated to create the micro-mirrors and standoff structures are typically larger than the features used in CMOS circuitry, so it is relatively easy to form the micro-mirrors and standoff structures using known techniques for fabricating CMOS circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">After the mask is generated, the first substrate is anisotropically etched in an embodiment to form the standoff structures. Other methods besides an anisotropic etch may also be used to form the standoff structures, such as a wet etch or a plasma etch. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize many variations, modifications, and alternatives. Because the unetched surface of the standoff structure is masked during fabrication, this surface provides a bonding surface for subsequent substrate bonding processes. As mentioned previously, the polished substrate surface, present at the unetched surface of the standoff structure, provides a high quality bonding surface.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A second substrate is provided in step <b>714</b>. Typically, the second substrate is an electrode substrate, e.g. a CMOS substrate, including a number of electrodes and bond pads. In embodiments according to the present invention, the second substrate includes a bonding surface adapted to align with the standoff structures fabricated on the first substrate. In some embodiments, the bonding surface is a dielectric bond pad formed in contact with the second substrate, but this is not required by the present invention. In other embodiments, the bonding surface is a portion of the second substrate. The bonding surface associated with the second substrate is typically polished or otherwise fabricated to provide a smooth surface suitable for substrate bonding processes.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In step <b>716</b>, the bonding surface of the standoff structure is joined to the bonding surface of the second substrate. The first substrate and the second substrate are aligned so that the electrodes on the second substrate are in a proper position to control the deflection of the micro-mirrors formed in subsequent processing steps on the first substrate. In an embodiment, the two substrates are optically aligned using double focusing microscopes by aligning a pattern on the first substrate with a pattern on the second substrate and the two substrates are bonded together by low temperature bonding methods such as anodic or eutectic bonding. There are many possible alternate embodiments to the bonding process illustrated by step <b>716</b>. For example, thermoplastics or dielectric spin glass bonding materials may be used so that that substrates are bonded thermo-mechanically.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">After bonding the first and second substrate together, the surface of the first substrate opposite the standoff structures is thinned to a predetermined thickness in step <b>718</b>. First, the handling layer <b>615</b> is removed, typically by grinding or etching. Then the insulating layer <b>620</b> is removed. Then the device layer <b>630</b> is thinned or polished, if necessary. This thinning is done in an embodiment by mechanically grinding the first substrate to a thickness that is near the desired thickness of the micro-mirror. For example, in this embodiment, the thickness achieved by mechanical grinding is approximately 5 microns. The first substrate is then polished by mechanical fine polishing or chemical mechanical polishing to the thickness desired for the micro-mirror layer. In an embodiment according to the present invention, this desired thickness is less than approximately 1 μm. In a specific embodiment, this desired thickness is 0.3 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In step <b>720</b>, the first substrate is masked and processed to release a portion of the first substrate to form a torsion beam or torsion spring hinge that is coplanar with the micro-mirror layer. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 6H</figref>, in an embodiment, a high-aspect-ratio anisotropic etching process is used to define the mirror plate <b>670</b>, the torsion spring hinge <b>684</b>, and the centrally located base section <b>686</b>. The release step removes a portion <b>682</b> of the mirror layer adjacent to the centrally located base section as well as a portion of the mirror layer <b>690</b> and the portions of the extension arms above surface <b>692</b> of the extension arms. Thus, the centrally located base section provides a connector between the torsion spring hinge coupled to the mirror plate and the standoff structure bonded to the second substrate. Additionally, the release step <b>720</b> includes the separation of adjacent mirrors from each other, represented by openings <b>680</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6G and 6H</figref>. In an embodiment, the width of release section <b>682</b> is 0.2 μm. In alternative embodiments, the width varies from about 0.1 μm to about 1.0 μm. Moreover, in some embodiments, the release sections <b>690</b> extend to about 1 μm from the corner of the mirror.</p>
