<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to the manufacturing and distribution of application specific standard product (ASSP) integrated circuits (ICs) including, but not limited to, the manufacturing and distribution of field programmable gate arrays (FPGA).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">IC fabrication often concludes with the steps of testing, packaging, marking, and dry packing of the IC. Typically, an IC device is tested briefly while still on the wafer. ICs failing this test are discarded. ICs passing the test are packaged (i.e., mounted in plastic or ceramic carriers that protect the IC.) Packaged ICs are then marked (e.g., with product tracking information and other appropriate markings). Packaged ICs that have been marked are then subjected to further tests to determine full functionality and performance. ICs failing these tests are discarded.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Often the fully tested and marked ICs are then dry packed. That is, the ICs are processed to remove residual moisture, usually through baking, and hermetically sealed, typically in vacuum sealed anti-static envelopes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional ASSP ICs are pre-programmed at the factory to perform a specific function. They have fixed capabilities and are homogenous.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In contradistinction thereto, an FPGA is a programmable IC logic device that includes a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBS) embedded in a programmable routing mesh. Thus, an FPGA can be considered a programmable ASSP device and can be programmed after manufacturing. (The device is referred to as an FPGA because the array of CLBs contained on the device can be configured and interconnected in the “field” by the user (as opposed to the manufacturer) by means of special hardware and software.) The combined programming of the CLBs and routing network define the function of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each CLB can provide one or more of the functions provided by an AND gate, OR gate, flip-flop, latch, inverter, NOR gate, exclusive OR gate, as well as combinations of these functions to form more complex functions. The particular function performed by any one CLB is determined by control signals that are applied thereto from a corresponding control logic circuit. The control logic circuit is formed integrally with, and is part of, the integrated circuit on which the CLB is formed. If desired, control information can be stored and/or generated outside of this integrated circuit and transmitted to the CLB. The actual set of control bits provided to each CLB on the IC depends upon the functions that the CLB and, more globally, the IC are to perform.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Each CLB typically has a plurality of input and output pins, and a set of programmable interconnect points (PIPs) for each input and output pin. The general interconnect structure of the FPGA includes a plurality of interconnect segments and a plurality of PIPs, wherein each interconnect segment is connected to one or more other interconnect segments by programming an associated PIP. An FPGA also includes an access PIP that either connects an interconnect segment to an input pin or an output pin of the CLB.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Because the PIPs in the FPGA are programmable, any given output pin of a CLB is connectable to any given input pin of any other desired CLB. Thus, a specific FPGA configuration having a desired function is created by selected generation of control signals to configure the specific function of each CLB in an FPGA, together with selected generation of control signals to configure the various PIPs that interconnect the CLBs within the FPGA. The configuration data may be read from memory (e.g., an external programmable read-only memory (PROM)) or written into the FPGA by an external device. U.S. Pat. No. 6,020,633 to Erickson and U.S. Pat. No. 6,044,025 to Lawman describe the relationship between the PROM and the FPGA and are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An object of the invention is to provide a novel method for manufacturing and distributing programmable ICs.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object of the invention is to provide a novel computerized method for processing an order for programmable ICs.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Yet another object of the invention is to provide a novel method for incorporating security technologies into an IC including an FPGA.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A novel method for manufacturing and distributing ICs that addresses at least one of the above-objects includes the steps of: dry packing a plurality of programmable ICs; placing the dry packed programmable ICs into inventory such that the inventory is re-accessible in an automated manner; unpacking a subset of the inventoried ICs in order to process an order; programming the unpacked ICs; testing the programmed ICs for functionality and/or performance compliance; further labeling the programmed ICs with program (and potentially test results) specific information; and re-packing the programmed ICs for shipment.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another aspect of the invention, the method includes the steps of: storing a plurality of configuration programs; pulling specified volumes of un-programmed ICs from inventory in response to an order from a customer; programming the specified volumes of ICs with a configuration selected by the customer; and packing the programmed ICs for shipment.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Yet another aspect of the invention is the incorporation of methods to encrypt the configuration program for security purposes. In one such embodiment the IC program would be encrypted prior to storage in the IC using keys specific to the configuration. The necessary keys would be stored in the device too, but in an externally WRITE ONLY memory space. Such ICs would initialize, decrypt the program through embedded circuitry using the internally readable keys, and then be configured for its intended application.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Other embodiments featuring even higher security are implemented by leveraging the partial configurability/reconfigurability of FPGAs to utilize a configuration or vendor specific encryption/decryption technique. In such embodiments a separate decryption program would be loaded into the IC in a manner similar to the base program. Such programs would load and run solely for the purpose of decrypting and initializing the primary program in the IC.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the manner described above, the present invention enables intellectual property (IP) solutions to be sold in the form of “silicon” in lieu of software. Consequently, IP based pricing can be enforced. Furthermore, the present invention enables sales of pre-verified working solutions which have the look and feel of custom solutions. Lastly, the present invention enables information on the sales of ICs programmed using a specific configuration program to be tracked and strategically used to attract support from third party IP suppliers and to manage the contractual terms of business relationships.</p>

In step <b>102</b>, programmable ICs which have been assembled, tested, and marked are processed to remove residual moisture and are packed. According to an embodiment of the invention, the programmable ICs are FPGA devices incorporating in-package program memory. The residual moisture is typically removed through a baking process. After the residual moisture has been removed through the baking process, the FPGAs are stored in hermetically sealed containers. In step <b>104</b>, the dry packed ICs are placed into inventory such that the inventory is re-accessible in an automated manner. That is, the dry packed ICs are inventoried such that an arbitrary quantity of devices can be subsequently re-accessed and handled by computer controlled devices (e.g., robots) in an automated manner. The IC inventory is maintained in a ready to use state equivalent to standard production shipments. However, the packaging is designed such that the hermetic seal can be opened by automated equipment. For example, according to an embodiment of the invention, the IC devices are placed in a vacuum sealed “Tupperware™” type container allowing the IC devices to be removed from inventory, programmed, retested, and further labeled prior to packing for shipment.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">All of the handling associated with steps <b>106</b>-<b>114</b> transpires in an environmentally controlled facility such that subsequent production packing meets traditional dry packing standards. In step <b>106</b>, a subset of the inventoried ICs are unpacked in order to process an order. According to an embodiment of the invention, customers issue orders to fabricate specified volumes of FPGA devices having a certified configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In step <b>108</b>, the unpacked ICs are programmed, in step <b>110</b> they may be subjected to additional functional and/or performance testing metrics, in <b>112</b> they may be further labeled with configuration specific and/or test result specific data, and in step <b>114</b> the programmed ICs are then conventionally packed for shipment.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment of the programming step <b>108</b>, an unprogrammed FPGA <b>404</b> is unpacked and placed on a printed circuit board carrier <b>402</b> (see cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>showing the circuit board carrier before the memory device is attached) including contacts <b>408</b>. When the memory device <b>406</b> is attached to the board <b>402</b>, electrical connections to the contacts <b>408</b> include power and ground and all signal connections for programming. A memory device <b>406</b> (e.g., a PROM or other programmable memory device such as an EPROM, EEPROM, NAND flash, or NOR flash) is then used to program the FPGA <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to one embodiment of the invention, the memory device <b>406</b> will be attached to the printed circuit board carrier <b>402</b> during the programming process. The memory device <b>406</b> will require wire bonding to the board carrier <b>402</b> and will have independently programmed itself with a pre-verified configuration selected by the customer through a process similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. By way of example, the FPGA can be programmed to function as a system controller or as a dedicated peripheral co-processor configured to encrypt or decrypt data. According to an alternative embodiment of the invention, the memory device <b>406</b> is a NAND flash flip chip package having die contacts for mounting onto the circuit board carrier <b>402</b>. Unlike wire bonding where the actual area required (footprint) for a chip is greater than the size of the chip, the size of a flip chip footprint is equal to its chip area. Consequently, flip chips provide more flexible end packaging. Moreover, a flip-chip is capable of handling a higher number of I/Os because solder bumps can be arranged in an array on the underside of the chip rather than being restricted to the chip's periphery. Thus, there are a greater number of I/Os available to the FPGA which would normally be required for the memory device. Furthermore, since the I/O pins of a flip chip are inaccessible unless you unbond the chip, the configuration data IP stored on the flip-chip is more secure relative to the same data stored on a standard memory device requiring wire bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to a second alternative embodiment, the memory device <b>406</b> will be un-programmed, attached to the printed circuit board carrier <b>402</b>, and connected serially to the FPGA <b>404</b> prior to the inventorying process (see cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>). According to this embodiment, the FPGA <b>404</b> is partly configured to activate Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) boundary scan features within the FPGA, thus allowing the memory device <b>406</b> to be programmed while it is attached to the FPGA. Such an operation can be accomplished by indicating to the FPGA that the memory device <b>406</b> is downstream in a daisy chain from the FPGA, as is described at pages <b>13</b>-<b>25</b> through <b>13</b>-<b>32</b> of the Xilinx Programmable Logic Data Book published September 1996 which is incorporated herein by reference. When the combination of the FPGA and the memory device <b>406</b> are again powered up, the memory device <b>406</b> configures the FPGA and the combination is ready to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to a third alternative embodiment, the memory device and the FPGA are co-resident on a single die. The memory device can be non-volatile such as a PROM and the FPGA programmed in the same manner as taught in the second alternative embodiment. Alternatively, the memory device can be a one time programmable anti-fuse. That is, the anti-fuse can be programmed by fusing an internal wire structure. Each opened wire (fused) or closed wire (not fused) represents a logical 0 or 1, respectively. Again, the FPGA is programmed in the same manner as taught in the second alternative embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Incorporating the step of programming into the standard manufacturing and distribution of programmable ASSPs devices provides numerous benefits. One benefit is improved distribution efficiencies. Shorter order lead times can be satisfied because the devices can be assembled, tested, and marked prior to receiving an order. Other benefits include reduced channel inventory. Channel inventory can be reduced as a result of this invention, because the invention enables a centralized “Drop Shipment” direct to the customer. That is, devices are pulled from inventory, programmed, and shipped entirely on an as needed basis. Thus, enabling daily servicing of accounts practicing aggressive just-in-time inventory management. In addition, improvements and/or derivations to the configuration programs used to program the programmable ASSP devices can be easily integrated into the manufacturing process. And, over time a large number of revisions is easy to support such that older system qualified legacy configurations are easy to sustain in production.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart illustrating computerized method steps for processing an order for programmable ICs according to a second embodiment of the invention. In step <b>202</b>, computer system <b>501</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) stores a plurality of configuration programs used to program the programmable ICs. The configuration programs are provided by customers. According to an embodiment of the invention, ASSP vendors develop and certify configuration programs. In response to an order from a customer, in step <b>204</b>, the computer system <b>501</b> controls the robotic system <b>525</b> to pull specified volumes of un-programmed ICs from inventory. In step <b>206</b>, the computer system controls the robotic system <b>525</b> to program the specified volumes of ICs with a configuration selected by the customer. The various ways in which the programming is completed is described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b><i>a</i>, and <b>4</b><i>b</i>. In step <b>208</b>, the configuration is tested. One feature of the FPGA, readback, is the ability to read out of the chip the program and also the contents of the internal flip-flops, latches, and memories. During manufacturing, readback allows direct test access to observe and control internal nodes. In step <b>210</b>, the programmed ICs are provided with additional labeling which reflects the function of the programmed ICS and or test related results. According to an embodiment of the invention, the ASSP vendor is identified (e.g., by illustrating a customer's name and/or logo) in conjunction with indicia reflecting the configuration. Lastly, in step <b>212</b>, the computer system controls the robotic system to pack the programmed ICs for shipment.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to an embodiment of the invention, since the FPGAs are programmed with unique configurations under the control of computer system <b>501</b>, sales of the volumes of FPGAs programmed using a specific configuration program can be tracked by computer system <b>501</b>. The tracking of specific device configuration shipments is valuable to IP suppliers because it is a viable basis for royalty tracking for secondary suppliers (i.e., IP suppliers supply component IP to an ASSP supplier who incorporates the component into their ASSPs) and for managing volume discount agreements.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Computer controlled processing of an order for programmable ICs creates a number of unique opportunities. Among other things, companies which have traditionally programmed the FPGA devices after receiving them from a manufacturer can now offer ASSP products. That is, the present invention enables these companies to offer programmed devices having a specific function straight from the factory.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>is a flowchart illustrating a process whereby an encrypted configuration program is loaded into an and decrypted by an on-chip decryptor according to a first embodiment. The XILINX Virtex II Platform FPGA Handbook describes such an on chip decryptor (Virtex-II) and a method for using bitstream encryption and is hereby incorporated by reference. In step <b>302</b><i>a</i>, the configuration program is encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES). Since the algorithm is symmetric, the key to encrypt and decrypt are the same according to this embodiment. The security of the data is kept by keeping the key secret. The invention is not limited to using a symmetric encryption algorithm. Public key systems such as RSA and PGP can also be used to encrypt configuration programs. In step <b>304</b><i>a</i>, the encrypted configuration program is loaded into the IC as a bitstream. In step <b>306</b><i>a</i>, the device is assembled into a customer system (PCB board) at their factory and the decryption keys are stored in a small externally WRITE ONLY memory location that is backed up by a small externally connected battery. In step <b>308</b><i>a</i>, upon in-system initialization, the on-chip decryptor extracts the stored bitstream, decrypts it using the INTERNALLY READABLE keys, and internally recreates the configuration program. Lastly, in step <b>310</b><i>a </i>the IC is initialized for operation with the decrypted program. As the key storage memory is not externally accessible, the keys remain secret and the configuration program IP is secure.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3b</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a process whereby an encrypted configuration program is loaded into an IC according to a second embodiment. The first step of this embodiment is the same as step <b>302</b><i>a </i>described above. In step <b>304</b><i>b</i>, the encrypted configuration program is loaded into the IC. In step <b>306</b><i>b</i>, the decryption keys are loaded co-resident into the IC in an externally WRITE ONLY memory location. In step <b>308</b><i>b</i>, upon in-system initialization, the on-chip decryptor extracts the stored bitstream, decrypts it using the INTERNALLY READABLE keys, and internally recreates the configuration program. Lastly, in step <b>310</b><i>b</i>, the IC is initialized for operation with the decrypted program. This embodiment eliminates the need for battery backup and makes the parts truly standalone.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>c </i>is a flowchart illustrating a process whereby an encrypted configuration program is loaded into an IC and decrypted by an on-chip decryptor according to a third embodiment. In step <b>302</b><i>c</i>, a primary configuration program is encrypted using algorithm A. In step <b>304</b><i>c</i>, the encrypted configuration program is loaded into the IC as a bitstream. In step <b>306</b><i>c</i>, a decryption program A is also loaded into the IC. Algorithm A and decryption program A can be any commercially available encryption algorithm and decryption program or a proprietary encryption system developed by the customer. In step <b>308</b><i>c </i>the device is assembled into a customer system (PCB board) at their factory and the decryption keys are stored in a small externally WRITE ONLY memory location that is backed up by a small externally connected battery. In step <b>310</b><i>c</i>, upon in-system initialization, the decryption program A is executed. In step <b>312</b><i>c</i>, the decryption program A extracts the stored bitstream, decrypts it using the INTERNALLY READABLE keys, and internally recreates the configuration program. Lastly, in step <b>314</b><i>c </i>the IC is initialized for operation with the decrypted program. As the key storage memory is not externally accessible, the keys remain secret and the configuration program IP is secure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>d</i>is a flowchart illustrating a process whereby an encrypted configuration program is loaded into an IC according to a fourth embodiment. The first step of this embodiment is the same as step <b>302</b><i>c </i>described above. In step <b>304</b><i>d</i>, the encrypted primary configuration program is loaded into the IC. In step <b>306</b><i>d</i>, a decryption program A is also loaded into the IC. In step <b>308</b><i>d</i>, decryption keys are loaded co-resident into the IC in an externally WRITE ONLY memory location. In step <b>310</b><i>d</i>, upon in-system initialization, the decryption program A is executed. In step <b>312</b><i>d</i>, the decryption program A extracts the stored bitstream, decrypts it using the INTERNALLY READABLE keys, and internally recreates the configuration program. Lastly, in step <b>314</b><i>d </i>the IC is initialized for operation with the decrypted program. This embodiment eliminates the need for battery backup and makes the parts truly standalone.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">All or a portion of the method steps associated with the second embodiment of the invention and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be conveniently implemented using conventional general purpose computers or microprocessors programmed according to the teachings of the present invention, as will be apparent to those skilled in the computer art.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a computer system <b>501</b> upon which the second embodiment of the present invention may be implemented. Computer system <b>501</b> includes a bus <b>503</b> or other communications mechanism for communicating information, and a processor <b>505</b> coupled with bus <b>503</b> for processing the information. Computer system <b>501</b> also includes a main memory <b>507</b>, such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device (e.g., dynamic RAM (DRAM), static RAM (SRAM), synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), flash RAM), coupled to bus <b>503</b> for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor <b>505</b>. In addition, main memory <b>507</b> may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor <b>505</b>. Computer system <b>501</b> further includes a read only memory (ROM) <b>509</b> or other static storage device (e.g., PROM), erasable PROM (EPROM), and electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM)) coupled to bus <b>503</b> for storing static information and instructions for processor <b>505</b>. A storage device <b>511</b>, such as a magnetic disk or optical disc, is provided and coupled to bus <b>503</b> for storing information and instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The computer system <b>501</b> may also include special purpose logic devices (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)) or configurable logic devices (e.g., generic array of logic (GAL) or reprogrammable FPGAs. Other removable media devices (e.g., a compact disc, a tape, and a removable magneto-optical media) or fixed, high density media drives, may be added to the computer system <b>501</b> using an appropriate device bus (e.g., a small computer system interface (SCSI) bus, an enhanced integrated device electronics (IDE) bus, or an ultra-direct memory access (DMA) bus). The computer system <b>501</b> may additionally include a compact disc reader, a compact disc reader-writer unit, or a compact disc juke box, each of which may be connected to the same device bus or another device bus.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Computer system <b>501</b> may be coupled via bus <b>503</b> to a display <b>513</b> (e.g., a cathode ray tube (CRT)), for displaying information to a computer user. The display <b>513</b> may be controlled by a display or graphics card. The computer system includes input devices, such as a keyboard <b>515</b> and a cursor control <b>517</b>, for communicating information and command selections to processor <b>505</b>. The cursor control <b>517</b>, for example, is a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor <b>505</b> and for controlling cursor movement on the display <b>513</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The computer system <b>501</b> performs a portion or all of the processing steps of the second embodiment of the present invention in response to processor <b>505</b> executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in a memory, such as the main memory <b>507</b>. Such instructions may be read into the main memory <b>507</b> from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device <b>511</b>. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the sequences of instructions contained in main memory <b>507</b>. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions. Thus, embodiments are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As stated above, the system <b>501</b> includes at least one computer readable medium or memory programmed according to the teachings of the invention and for containing data structures, tables, records, or other data described herein such as data reflecting the volumes of sales of each uniquely programmed ASSP device and configuration programs provided by the customers. Stored on any one or on a combination of computer readable media, the present invention includes software for controlling the computer system <b>501</b>, for driving a device or devices, such as the robotic system <b>525</b>, for implementing the invention, and for enabling the computer system <b>501</b> to interact with a human user. Such software may include, but is not limited to, device drivers, operating systems, development tools, and applications software. Such computer readable media further includes the computer program product of the present invention for performing all or a portion (if processing is distributed) of the processing performed in implementing the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The computer code devices of the present invention may be any interpreted or executable code mechanism, including but not limited to scripts, interpreters, dynamic link libraries, Java classes, and complete executable programs. Moreover, parts of the processing of the present invention may be distributed for better performance, reliability, and/or cost.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The term “computer readable medium” as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to processor <b>505</b> for execution. A computer readable medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical, magnetic disks, and magneto-optical disks, such as storage device <b>511</b>. Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory <b>507</b>. Transmission media forming at least a portion of a bus <b>503</b> include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics. Transmission media also may also take the form of air or wave guides for passing acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio wave and infrared data communications.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Common forms of computer readable media include, for example, hard disks, floppy disks, tape, magneto-optical disks, PROMs (EPROM, EEPROM, Flash EPROM), DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, or any other magnetic medium, compact disks (e.g., CD-ROM), or any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, or other physical medium with patterns of holes, a carrier wave (described below), or any other medium from which a computer can read.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying out one or more sequences of one or more instructions by a processor <b>505</b> for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions for implementing all or a portion of the present invention remotely into a dynamic memory and send the instructions over a communications interface (e.g., telephone line using a modem). A modem local to computer system <b>501</b> may receive the data (e.g., configuration programs) on the telephone line and use an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal. An infrared detector coupled to bus <b>503</b> can receive the data carried in the infrared signal and place the data on bus <b>503</b>. Bus <b>503</b> carries the data to main memory <b>507</b>, from which processor <b>505</b> retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory <b>507</b> may optionally be stored on storage device <b>511</b> either before or after execution by processor <b>505</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Computer system <b>501</b> also includes a communications interface <b>519</b> coupled to bus <b>503</b>. Communications interface <b>519</b> provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link <b>521</b> that is connected to a local network. For example, communications interface <b>519</b> may be a network interface card to attach to any packet switched local area network (LAN). As another example, communications interface <b>519</b> may be an asymmetrical digital subscriber line (ADSL) card, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communications interface <b>519</b> sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Network link <b>521</b> typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link <b>521</b> may provide a connection through LAN <b>523</b> to the robotic system <b>525</b> or to data equipment operated by a service provider, which provides data communication services through an Internet Protocol (IP) network <b>527</b> or any other suitable network using any known protocol (e.g., IPX). LAN <b>523</b> and IP network <b>527</b> both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link <b>521</b> and through communications interface <b>519</b>, which carry the digital data to and from computer system <b>501</b>, are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information. Computer system <b>501</b> can transmit notifications and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link <b>521</b> and communications interface <b>519</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.</p>
