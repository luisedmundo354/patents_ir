<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a bottle-shaped synthetic resin container having a circumferential groove extending along the surface of the container body portion.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, bottle-shaped container comprised of a synthetic resin such as polyethyleneterephthalate (“PET”) has a reduced thickness of the body portion. As such, the appearance tends to deteriorate due to the deformation of the body portion into elliptical shape upon internal pressure reduction of the container, besides that the self-standing stability of the container tends to be lowered as a result of deformation of the container. In these respects, as compared to bottle-shaped containers made of glass, aluminum or the like, bottle-shaped synthetic resin container still has a room for further improvement in terms of its applicability to a filling line wherein the containers are transferred by gliding them along the bottom surface, or to an automatic vending machine capable of storing and dispensing a number of bottles.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to eliminate these problems, there is known a technology wherein the body portion of the bottle-shaped synthetic resin container has an outer surface formed with one or more circumferential grooves, which are utilized for allowing a contractive deformation of the bottle in the longitudinal direction of the bottle, so as to enhance the pressure reduction absorption property against the internal pressure reduction of the container, and thereby compensate for the pressure reduction resistance and the buckling strength. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication JP-09-272523 A1 discloses a bottle-shaped synthetic resin container wherein the groove bottom portions of the circumferential groove are arranged into a polygonal shape as seen in a plane perpendicular to the center axis of the container. However, in this instance, the corners of the polygon formed by relatively narrow groove bottom portions function as beams, which not only impede the contractive deformation of the container in the longitudinal direction of the bottle by utilizing the groove portions, but also require a relatively strict manufacturing control upon blow molding or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need for an improved synthetic resin bottle, which does not require a strict manufacturing control, which is formed in the outer surface of the body portion with a circumferential groove of more simplified shape, and which yet effectively suppresses elliptical deformation of the bottle body portion due to the internal pressure reduction of the container, thereby sufficiently exhibiting the required pressure reduction resistance or buckling strength.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a bottle-shaped synthetic resin container satisfying the above-mentioned need.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve such an object, according to the present invention, there is provided a bottle-shaped synthetic resin container comprising a body portion, and a circumferential groove extending along an outer surface of the body portion, said circumferential groove being defined by a groove bottom wall and groove side walls extending from the groove bottom to the outer surface of the body portion, wherein at least one of the groove side walls extends substantially linearly, as seen in a longitudinal-sectional plane including a center axis of the body portion, and forms an angle within a range from 0° to not more than 20° relative to a reference line that is perpendicular to the center axis in said longitudinal-sectional plane.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">With the above-mentioned structure according to the present invention, although the circumferential groove has a simple shape that can be realized by a relatively easy manufacturing control, it is yet possible to fully utilize the circumferential groove, upon the internal pressure reduction due to a cooling after hot filling, etc., so as to cause a smooth contractive deformation of the container in its center axis direction. Moreover, even when the contractive deformation proceeds considerably, there is established a state wherein the upper and lower edges of the circumferential groove are brought into contact with each other so as to prevent a further lowering of the buckling strength from such a state, thereby making it possible to suppress an elliptical deformation of the body portion, to preserve a required buckling strength, and to improve the pressure reduction resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, when the both groove side walls of the circumferential groove are arranged opposite to each other and extend substantially linearly in the longitudinal-sectional plane, it is preferred that the sum of the angles formed by the groove side walls relative to the reference line is not more than 30°.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the present invention, furthermore, it is preferred that the circumferential groove has a groove width which is smaller than the groove depth.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown one embodiment of the present invention that is directed to a bottle-shaped container made of polyethylene-terephthalate (“PET bottle”), and denoted as a whole by reference numeral <b>1</b>. The PET bottle <b>1</b> includes a mouth portion <b>2</b>, a body portion <b>3</b> and a bottom portion <b>4</b>, which are arranged in the stated sequence, and can be maintained in a self-supporting state with its bottom portion <b>4</b> placed on a supporting surface, not shown. The body portion <b>3</b> has a shoulder portion <b>3</b><i>a </i>at its junction with the mouth portion <b>2</b>, and is formed with four circumferential grooves <b>10</b> extending along the outer surface of the body portion <b>3</b> in its circumferential direction. In the illustrated embodiment, these circumferential grooves <b>10</b> are arranged in planes perpendicularly intersecting the center axis A of the bottle <b>1</b> or the body portion <b>3</b>. The body portion <b>3</b> as a whole has a substantially cylindrical body wall.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the illustrated embodiment, as particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>2</b>(<i>b</i>), each circumferential groove <b>10</b> includes a groove bottom wall <b>11</b>, a groove side wall <b>12</b><i>a </i>extending from the groove bottom wall <b>11</b> to the outer surface region of the body portion <b>3</b> (shoulder portion <b>3</b><i>a</i>) on the side of the mouth portion <b>2</b>, and a groove side wall <b>12</b><i>b </i>extending from the groove bottom wall <b>11</b> to the outer surface region of the body portion <b>3</b> on the side of the bottom portion <b>4</b>. The groove bottom wall <b>11</b> defines a substantially circular contour shape as seen in a cross-sectional plane of the bottle <b>1</b>, perpendicularly intersecting the center axis A. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), the groove side walls <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>extend substantially linearly with predetermined angles α, β relative to reference lines L perpendicularly intersecting the center axis A of the bottle <b>1</b> in a longitudinal-sectional plane of the bottle <b>1</b>, which includes the center axis A, wherein the angles α, β are within a range from 0° to 20°, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus, the circumferential groove <b>10</b> shown on the upper side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) has opposite groove side walls <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>which form predetermined angles α (0°&lt;α≦20°) and β (0°&lt;β≦20°) relative to the reference lines L, respectively. On the other hand, the circumferential groove <b>10</b> shown on the lower side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>) has an upper groove side wall <b>12</b><i>a </i>in parallel to the reference line L (β=0°), and a lower groove side wall <b>12</b><i>b </i>which is inclined relative to the reference line L (β&gt;0°). Furthermore, although not shown in the drawings, it is possible to arrange the both groove side walls <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>such that they extend in parallel to the respective reference lines L (α=0°, β=0°).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In other words, as for the angles α, β formed by the groove side walls <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the circumferential grooves <b>10</b>, it is sufficient that at least one of the following conditions are satisfied:

<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>0°≦β≦20°  (2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With such an arrangement, although the circumferential groove <b>10</b> has a simple shape that can be realized by a relatively easy manufacturing control, it is yet possible to utilize the circumferential groove <b>10</b> upon the internal pressure reduction due to a cooling after a hot filling, etc., so as to cause a smooth contractive deformation of the bottle in its center axis direction. Moreover, even when the contractive deformation proceeds considerably, there is established a state wherein the upper and lower edges of the circumferential groove <b>10</b> are brought into contact with each other so as to prevent a further lowering of the buckling strength from such a state, thereby making it possible to suppress an elliptical deformation of the body portion <b>3</b>, to preserve a required buckling strength and to improve the resistance to the pressure reduction.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows another embodiment of the PET bottle <b>1</b> according to the present invention, wherein there are provided three circumferential grooves along the outer surface of the body portion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a still further embodiment of the PET bottle <b>1</b> according to the present invention, wherein there are provided five circumferential grooves along the outer surface of the body portion. In the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the circumferential grooves <b>10</b> are arranged in planes perpendicularly intersecting the bottle center axis, and the body portion <b>3</b> as a whole has a body wall with a substantially circular cross-sectional shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a variation of the PET bottle <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, wherein the body portion <b>3</b> includes a body wall <b>6</b> with a polygonal cross-sectional shape, in a region between the circumferential grooves <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Experiments have been conducted to ascertain functions and effects of the present invention in terms of the resistance to the pressure reduction and the buckling strength. In these experiments, there were used test samples including the PET bottles <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and satisfying all the conditions (1) to (4) explained above, and similarly configured conventional PET bottles (control samples) which do not satisfy the conditions of the present invention. Each test sample has a bottle weight of 23 grams and an average thickness of 0.53 mm at the body portion (shoulder portion).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a front view of the PET bottle <b>20</b> as the control sample, wherein the elements that are the same as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are denoted by the same reference numerals to avoid a duplicative description. This PET bottle <b>20</b> has four circumferential grooves <b>14</b> extending along the outer surface of the body portion <b>3</b>. Each circumferential groove <b>14</b> has a semi-circular cross-sectional shape so that the inner wall extends to the outer surface of the body portion <b>3</b> (shoulder portion <b>3</b><i>a</i>) with a curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The pressure reduction resistance of these samples <b>1</b>, <b>20</b> were measured and compared to each other. It has been revealed that the pressure reduction resistance of the PET bottle <b>1</b> according to the invention was approximately 709.1×133 Pa, whereas the pressure reduction resistance of the PET bottle <b>20</b> according to the control sample was approximately 952.0×133 Pa. This result clearly demonstrates that the present invention is superior in the pressure reduction resistance, as compared to the conventional structure. With respect to the PET bottle <b>1</b> according to the invention, it has been confirmed that even upon the internal pressure reduction after the filling of hot contents at a temperature ranging approximately from 70° C. to 100° C., a significant elliptical deformation of the bottle <b>1</b> does not occur, that the pressure reduction can be effectively absorbed solely by the contractive deformation of the bottle in the longitudinal direction by utilizing the circumferential grooves <b>10</b>, and that the PET bottle <b>1</b> filled with the contents can be stably maintained in a self-standing state without causing buckling, thereby allowing a satisfactory application of the bottle to a filling line or an automatic vending machine. In contrast, it has been confirmed that the PET bottles <b>20</b> of the control samples cannot achieve such marked advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, by comparing the buckling strength of the above-mentioned test samples <b>1</b>, <b>20</b>, it has been revealed that the PET bottle <b>1</b> according to the invention provides a buckling strength of 51.2 kg, whereas the control sample of the PET bottles <b>20</b> provides a buckling strength of 55.5 kg. Although the present invention is slightly lower in the buckling strength as compared to the conventional structure, the buckling strength value achieved by the invention still ensures that the PET bottle <b>1</b> filled with the contents can be stably maintained in a self-standing state without causing buckling, thereby allowing a practical application to a filling line or an automatic vending machine.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It will be appreciated from the foregoing description that the present invention provides an improved synthetic resin bottle, which does not require a strict manufacturing control, which is formed in the outer surface of the body portion with a circumferential groove of less complicated shape, and which yet effectively suppresses elliptical deformation of the bottle body portion due to the internal pressure reduction of the container, thereby sufficiently exhibiting required pressure reduction resistance or buckling strength.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It is needless to mention that the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiments explained above, and various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Thus, for example, it is not necessary for al of the circumferential grooves extending along the outer surface of the body portion <b>3</b>, to satisfy the specific conditions according to the present invention, and there may be included a circumferential groove of the conventional structure such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, the circumferential groove <b>10</b> can be defined by angles α and β relative to the reference lines L perpendicularly intersecting the center axis A of the bottle <b>1</b>, and they are not limited to the grooves that are arranged in a plane perpendicularly intersecting the center axis A of the bottle, as in the illustrated embodiments. The circumferential grooves may be alternatively arranged in a plane intersecting the bottle center axis A at an angle other than 90 degrees, or embodied as wavy grooves undulating upwards and downwards along the bottle center axis A. Finally, the synthetic resin forming the bottle according to the present invention is not limited to polyethyleneterephthalate, allowing use of other suitable resin.</p>
