<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a flexible drive member attachment for connecting a flexible drive member to a driven member.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A flexible drive member, such as a drive chain or a drive tape, is often used to transmit motion in a power operating system. See for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 6,367,864 granted to Lloyd Walker Rogers, Jr. et al. Apr. 9, 2002 which discloses a vehicle having a power operated lift gate that is opened and closed by a power operating system. The Rogers et al. system has two identical drive units each of which use a drive chain or a drive tape that is connected to a driven rod by a follower.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of drive chains or drive tapes in a power operating system of any type raises a need for an attachment for connecting the flexible drive member to a driven member that is pulled by the flexible drive member. Flexible drive members are often endless so that the attachment is preferably capable of being attached to an endless flexible drive member anywhere along its length.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention provides a flexible drive member attachment for connecting a flexible drive member having a plurality of spaced windows to a driven member that is compact and economical.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The flexible drive member attachment comprises a yoke having laterally spaced side walls connected by a bridge wall, a connector attached to the bridge wall, and a coupler disposed between the side walls and attached to the yoke. The coupler has a plurality of spaced teeth extending in a direction away from the bridge wall, and an outer shoe engaging each side wall of the yoke. Each shoe has a forward flange that engages the bridge wall and a rearward flange that engages a rearward edge of the associated side wall. Each rearward flange has at least one finger that extends from the rearward flange through a space between adjacent ones of the spaced teeth of the coupler and into a recess of the other shoe.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Each outer shoe preferably has longitudinally spaced, forward, resilient bows and longitudinally spaced resilient side bows to facilitate sliding of the attachment in a channel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each outer shoe preferably has a recess receiving the associated side wall and each side wall preferably has rearward feet that extend outwardly and that are separated by a slot with the rearward flange of each outer shoe extending through the slot of the associated side wall.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The flexible drive member attachment is preferably used in connection with a drive chain but can be adapted for attachment to other flexible drive members such as a flexible drive belt having spaced windows.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring now to the drawing, a flexible drive member attachment <b>10</b> of the invention is illustrated in connection with a flexible drive member having a plurality of evenly spaced windows, such as, a metal drive chain <b>12</b>. Chain <b>12</b> comprises inner and outer pairs of metal links <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> that are connected end-to end by pivot pins <b>18</b> forming a plurality of evenly spaced windows <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Flexible drive member attachment <b>10</b> comprises a yoke <b>22</b> that has laterally spaced side walls <b>24</b> connected by a bridge wall <b>26</b> at one end. Bridge wall <b>26</b> has a round central hole <b>28</b> and a plurality of smaller square holes <b>30</b> on either side of the round central hole <b>28</b>. Side walls <b>24</b> each have inwardly extending, part spherical dimples <b>31</b> near the bridge wall <b>26</b> to increase the strength and rigidity of yoke <b>22</b>. Each side wall <b>24</b> also has upper and lower feet <b>32</b> that extend outwardly and that are separated by a central slot <b>34</b> at the rearward end of yoke <b>22</b>. Yoke <b>22</b> is preferably of stamped sheet metal construction for economy of manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Flexible drive member attachment <b>10</b> includes a metal ball stud <b>36</b> for connecting flexible drive member attachment <b>10</b> to a driven member, such as socket ended rod <b>37</b>, and a metal coupler <b>38</b> for connecting the flexible drive member attachment <b>10</b> to the drive chain <b>12</b>. Ball stud <b>36</b> is suitably attached to bridge wall <b>26</b>, for example by sticking stud end <b>39</b> in hole <b>28</b> and spin riveting ball stud <b>36</b> to bridge wall <b>26</b>. Coupler <b>38</b> is also suitably attached to bridge wall <b>26</b>, for example by riveting coupler <b>38</b> to bridge wall <b>26</b> as explained below. Coupler <b>38</b> is preferably of stamped sheet metal construction for economy manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">While yoke <b>22</b>, ball stud <b>36</b> and coupler <b>38</b> are preferably three separate metal pieces, these elements can be combined into one or two pieces. Moreover for some applications the yoke <b>22</b>, ball stud <b>36</b> and coupler <b>38</b> can be of molded plastic construction.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Flexible drive member attachment <b>10</b> also includes two shoes <b>40</b> which are preferably of molded plastic construction for economy of manufacture. Each shoe <b>40</b> has a side wall recess <b>42</b> shaped to receive an associated side wall <b>24</b> of yoke <b>22</b> and a forward central flange <b>44</b> that engages bridge wall <b>26</b> around ball stud <b>36</b>. Each shoe <b>40</b> has flexible, forward bows <b>46</b> on either side of the forward flange <b>44</b>. Each shoe <b>40</b> also has flexible side bows <b>48</b> on either side of a rearward flange <b>50</b>. Each rearward flange <b>50</b> has two tapered fingers <b>52</b> that extend toward the other flange with their tips disposed in sockets <b>53</b> of the other flange. Shoes <b>40</b> are attached to yoke <b>22</b> by attaching shoes <b>40</b> to each other by interconnecting fingers <b>52</b> and sockets <b>53</b> so that shoes <b>40</b> lie against the respective side walls <b>24</b> of yoke <b>22</b> with their rearward flanges <b>50</b> extending through respective slots <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Coupler <b>38</b> is disposed between the side walls <b>24</b> of yoke <b>22</b>. Coupler <b>38</b> has a plurality of square studs <b>54</b> extending forward and through the square holes <b>30</b> with their protruding heads headed over to rivet coupler <b>38</b> to bridge wall <b>26</b>. Coupler <b>38</b> also has a plurality of evenly spaced teeth <b>60</b> extending rearward and through respective ones of the windows <b>20</b> of drive chain <b>12</b>. Drive chain <b>12</b> is trapped in yoke <b>22</b> by the tapered fingers <b>52</b> of shoes <b>40</b> which extend through respective spaces between adjacent teeth <b>60</b> of coupler <b>38</b> behind drive chain <b>12</b> and into associated sockets <b>53</b> of the other shoe. Thus attachment <b>10</b> is drivingly attached to drive chain <b>12</b> very securely. Shoes <b>40</b> house yoke <b>22</b> and are preferably equipped with the laterally spaced, resilient, forward bows <b>46</b> and the laterally spaced, resilient, side bows <b>48</b> so that the attachment <b>10</b> can slide easily and without rattling inside a channel such as the channel <b>24</b> shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,367,864 discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, the flexible drive member attachment <b>10</b> has been illustrated in combination with a length of flexible drive chain of the metal link type. However, the flexible drive member attachment <b>10</b> can be used in conjunction with an endless flexible drive chain having its own master link or one which uses the flexible drive member attachment <b>10</b> as the master link. Moreover, the flexible drive member attachment can be used in conjunction with other types of flexible drive members, such as the flexible drive belt <b>112</b> having regularly spaced windows <b>120</b> that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> of U.S. Pat. No. 6,367,864 discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The flexible drive member attachment <b>10</b> of the invention may be used on power operated liftgates or sliding doors of automobiles or minivans as indicated by U.S. Pat. No. 6,387,864. However, the flexible drive member attachment <b>10</b> has many other uses-virtually any application or operating system involving a flexible drive member having spaced windows. In other words, it will be readily understood by those persons skilled in the art that the present invention is susceptible of broad utility and application. Many embodiments and adaptations of the present invention other than those described above, as well as many variations, modifications and equivalent arrangements, will be apparent from or reasonably suggested by the present invention and the foregoing description, without departing from the substance or scope of the present invention. Accordingly, while the present invention has been described herein in detail in relation to its preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that this disclosure is only illustrative and exemplary of the present invention and is made merely for purposes of providing a full and enabling disclosure of the invention. The foregoing disclosure is not intended or to be construed to limit the present invention or otherwise to exclude any such other embodiments, adaptations, variations, modifications and equivalent arrangements, the present invention being limited only by the following claims and the equivalents thereof.</p>
