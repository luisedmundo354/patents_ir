<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to wave-energy conversion devices, particularly to point absorber wave-energy conversion systems, comprising in part an underwater device which derives power from buoyancy variations arising from changes in pressure caused by waves and/or changes in the level on the surface above and which reacts against a platform that changes level in accordance with tidal level changes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The petroleum crisis in the early 1970's was the impetus for significant innovation in wave energy conversion systems. A lack of practical solutions or reasonable prospects of efficient and robust technologies, plus declining oil prices, eventually led to a general disenchantment in the viability of wave-energy conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Research continued at a few largely academic centers and over the past twenty-five years a great deal has been learned. Both theoretical understanding of sea waves and technical expertise in related marine engineering has gained immeasurably from the offshore oil and gas industries during the same period. Growing concern with global climate change has led to an increased sense of urgency in the quest for commercially viable renewable energy sources.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The theoretical potential of wave energy has been recognized for many years. The size of this resource has been estimated to be 219 gigawatts along the coats of the European Union, or more than 180 terawatt hours each year. The wave power off the west coasts of Ireland and Scotland, where the winter resource is approximately twice that available during summer months, ranks with the highest levels per kilometer in the World.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Wave energy is lost by friction with the sea bottom as the sea becomes shallow, with water depths of half a wavelength or less. This is most pronounced where wavelengths tend to be long, as off the NW coast of Europe.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Research and development into wave energy converters (WECs) over the past twenty-five years, plus the knowledge and practical experience gained from the off-shore oil and gas industries, has now reached a stage where robust and effective wave energy converters with installed capacities of one megawatt and greater are being developed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The wave energy resource may be split into three broad categories, based on where the energy from waves may be recovered: 1. in the open sea, i.e. offshore; 2. on or close to the shore line, i.e. on-shore or inshore; 3. outside the normal area of breaking waves but not in the deep ocean, i.e. near shore.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A fourth category, not generally considered in the context of wave energy converters, but which may be of relevance to this present invention, is waves or surges in a liquid contained in vessels and tanks.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The very large number of devices and concepts proposed to date has been classified and described in summary form for the Engineering Committee on Oceanic Resources by the Working Group on Wave Energy Conversion (ECOR draft report, April 1998). This follows a similar classification based on the intended location, i.e. off-shore, near shore to off-shore, and on-shore.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Wave Energy Converters (WECs) may also be classified in different ways according to their operating principle and the ways in which they react with waves. In terms of practical application, only a very few types of device are presently, or in the recent past have been, in use or under test in European waters.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">By way of illustration, two different but overlapping classes will be briefly commented on: the Oscillating Water Column (OWC) devices and Point Absorbers, the latter being the relevant class in the present context.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">OWC devices are typically those where the wave is confined in a vertical tube or a larger chamber and, as it surges back and forth, drives air through a power conversion device. Megawatt-scale OWC devices are now at an advanced stage of development.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">One such device, being built in a rocky gully on the western shore of Pico in the Azores, is a reinforced concrete chamber partly open at one side to the waves, and with two turbines above and behind through which the confined air is forced. These are specially developed Wells turbines (one with variable blade pitch) and on the whole would seem to be the best-developed and perfected conversion system available today. It is, however, unlikely that any one such installation will have an installed capacity greater than two megawatts and the number of suitable sites has to be extremely limited.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Point absorbers may react against the sealed (therefore necessarily sited near-shore), or be floating and self-reacting. Theoretical analysis has greatly increased our understanding of point absorbers.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Point absorbers are usually axi-symmetric about a vertical axis, and by definition their dimensions are small with respect to the wavelength of the predominant wave. The devices usually operate in a vertical mode, often referred to as ‘heave’. As such they are capable of absorbing energy arising from changes in the surface level rather than from forward motion of breaking seas.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The theoretical limit for the energy that can be absorbed by an isolated, heaving, axi-symmetrical device has been shown to depend on the wavelength of the incident waves rather than the cross section of the device, i.e. from the wavelength divided by 2.pi. Thus the wavelength is a critically important criterion, resulting in the attraction of locating the point absorber devices well outside the region of breaking waves, and where they will be open to long wavelength ocean swell or ‘heave’.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A point absorber device may react against the inherent inertia of one of its components, or against the bottom of the sea. Thus, point absorbers may be deployed near-shore in contact with the sea-bed or, in the case of self-reacting devices, near-shore or off-shore.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Small-scale practical point absorbers such as fog horns and navigation buoys, both of which may incorporate OWCs, have been in use for decades. Typically these have a power of a few hundred watts.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">One new point absorber device, now claimed to be capable of generating of the order of a megawatt, has been described. This is based on the buoyancy variations of a submerged, partly air filled, rigid vessel open at the bottom. Initially the device is floating with neutral buoyancy at a certain depth.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">If a wave passes above it the pressure around this vessel increases and water will flow into the vessel, displacing the air or gas inside (which is free to flow to a large reservoir or to similar devices linked by pipelines), decreasing the air volume in it and hence its buoyancy. The upthrust experienced has decreased in proportion to the volume of water displaced, i.e. Archimedes' principle. The partially filled vessel will start to sink. When a trough passes above it the reverse process occurs, and the vessel tends to rise to recover its rest position.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The size of the forces exerted will depend on the extent of the water surface within the vessel, the amplitude of the wave and the frequency of waves. The wave energy transformer is described in terms of two similar containers, horizontally displaced, such that the gas displaced from one container passes to the second. Essentially the gas, being free to move between two or more similar devices remains under constant pressure, as required by the depth below the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">This is a heavily engineered device, one that will not readily flex with the lateral movements of water as found below waves, it is not independent of the seabed and is not independent of tidal changes in mean sea level. The base or center of the device is fixed in its position with respect to the seabed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A common problem with existing devices designed to harvest significant amounts of energy from the sea is their complexity and cost. They are predominantly large structures, with rigid components, placed in a harsh environment. There is little use of well-proven components. Most devices proposed are very demanding in terms of engineering design, deployment and maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Other known devices which are used in the marine environment, although not designed for the conversion of wave energy to usable power include devices designed to pump fluids from the sea-bed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The term “wave motion” as used herein refers to both waves on a surface of a liquid and swell in a body of a liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Ocean waves represent a significant energy resource. It is known to use a Wave Energy Converter to extract power from such waves. Known Wave Energy Converters tend to be expensive, and have limited prospects for survival in extreme conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A variety of devices may be used to provide relatively small amounts of power for use in small devices intended for long life in inaccessible locations. For example, to perform long endurance military missions, small unattended sensors or robots need more electrical power to sense, communicate, or move than they can practically carry in a pre-charged power storage device. This means that they must be able to harvest energy from their environment during the mission to periodically re-charge their power sources.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The small size of the devices typically used in military systems makes it difficult to collect a useful amount of power since natural energy usually occurs as a “flux”, and the amount available for collection depends on the physical capture area.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The amount of energy or power available in waves is enormous and this power is generally recognized by the damage caused. Thus, waves are usually regarded as a hindrance rather than an asset. For example, at Wick Breakwater in Scotland a block of cemented stones weighing 1,350 tons was broken loose and moved bodily by waves. Several years later, a replacement pier weighing 2,600 tons was carried away.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In other instances, a concrete block weighing 20 tons was lifted vertically to a height of 12 feet and deposited on top of a pier 5 feet above the highwater mark; stones weighing up to 7,000 pounds have been thrown over a wall 20 feet high on the southern shore of the English Channel; and on the coast of Oregon, the roof of a lighthouse 91 feet above the water was damaged by a rock weighing 135 pounds.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Heretofore this enormous amount of power available in the world's oceans has been largely ignored. One reason for this lack of utilization of the available energy in the world's oceans is their very power. In other words, most devices which have been designed for capturing or converting the energy of waves to useful work have been destroyed or damaged by that very energy.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">This is at least partly due to the irregularity of waves which can cause jerky or irregular motion of wave energy devices. Moreover, storms frequently occur during which time wave action can become violent, thus destroying installations erected for converting the energy of the waves to useful work.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Other prior art devices are not efficient in operation and convert only a very small portion of the available wave energy. For example, the actual propagation or movement of water particles in a lateral direction is only about one percent of the velocity of travel of waves. Thus, while devices floating on the surface of a body of water may be utilized to extract some of the energy of the waves themselves, these devices are not able to extract energy from the moving water itself.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Prior art devices range from elongate cylinders or like structures bobbing at the surface of the body of water for driving a propeller carried thereby, through so-called air turbines which comprise floating bodies at the surface with open bottom chambers into which waves are permitted to rise and fall for alternately compressing air in chambers to drive a turbine, up to complex bodies specifically configured to obtain rotational movement from the action of waves and moving water particles thereon to drive turbines. These last devices are commonly referred to as Salter's Duck.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">All such prior art devices capture or convert only a small portion of the available power in waves and in many cases are not durable enough to withstand the forces encountered in the ocean's waters or are not cost efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Another device provides a structure which floats at the surface of a body of water and is constructed to convert the rolling or orbital motion of water particles in the waves into a linear flow of water and to then accelerate the linear flow without using any mechanical means or process. The accelerated flow is then utilized, inter alia, to drive a water wheel, turbine or the like for extracting power from the moving body of water.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Another known a device for the conversion of the energy of the gravitational waves, i.e. sea and ocean wind-formed waves, or dead or ground sea swell in which a series of input parallel converters are connected by means of an input collector manifold with a turbogenerator which on its turn is connected by means of an output collector-manifold to a series of parallel output converters which let out the water in the low part of the wave. In such devices, the input and output converters have independent sources of gas under pressure. The device is maintained at a given level by means of a ballast system fitted to the converters and stabilizers.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The disadvantage of this device is the large number of input and output elements which makes this device very complicated. Furthermore, the flow should surmount the local resistances in its inflow in the input and outflow from the output collector or manifold as a result of which there occurs a decrease in the harnessed energy.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another shortcoming of such a known device is that the independent sources of gas under pressure maintain the water in the input and output converters and this can vary over a wide range. When the level is very low, part of the gas can flow out of the converters and this results in a loss of part of the compressed air. Conversely, when we have a high level and a little volume of the gas cushion, the latter is inferior in its role as buffer and energy accumulator.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Furthermore, this device cannot be directed at a specified angle towards the wave front, and in this way an important reserve for increasing its smoothness of operation and improving its efficiency cannot be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the past, research performed on ocean thermodynamics revealed that energy costs would surpass energy production for the then known ocean wave producing energy systems. In one known system, a floating tank is provided with an opening at the top of the tank which leads into a passage extending through the center of the tank where a propeller-like blade is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The action of the ocean waves causes water to flow into the opening at the top of the tank where such water falls onto the blade to rotate it and consequently produce electrical energy. One limitation of this system is that it can utilize only the amount of ocean water that flows into the tank opening to provide the dynamic force on the propeller blade, rather than being able to use the full force of the ocean wave.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Generating technologies for deriving electrical power from the ocean include tidal power, wave power, ocean thermal energy conversion, ocean currents, ocean winds and salinity gradients. Of these, the three most well-developed technologies are tidal power, wave power and ocean thermal energy conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Tidal power requires large tidal differences which, in the U.S., occur only in Maine and Alaska. Ocean thermal energy conversion is limited to tropical regions, such as Hawaii, and to a portion of the Atlantic coast. Wave energy has a more general application, with potential along the California coast. The western coastline has the highest wave potential in the U.S.; in California, the greatest potential is along the northern coast.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Wave energy conversion takes advantage of the ocean waves caused primarily by interaction of winds with the ocean surface. Wave energy is an irregular and oscillating low-frequency energy source that must be converted to a 60-Hertz frequency before it can be added to the electric utility grid.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although many wave energy devices have been invented, only a small proportion have been tested and evaluated. Furthermore, only a few have been tested at sea, in ocean waves, rather than in artificial wave tanks.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As of the mid-1990s, there were more than 12 generic types of wave energy systems. Some systems extract energy from surface waves. Others extract energy from pressure fluctuations below the water surface or from the full wave. Some systems are fixed in position and let waves pass by them, while others follow the waves and move with them. Some systems concentrate and focus waves, which increases their height and their potential for conversion to electrical energy.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A wave energy converter may be placed in the ocean in various possible situations and locations. It may be floating or submerged completely in the sea offshore or it may be located on the shore or on the sea bed in relatively shallow water. A converter on the sea bed may be completely submerged, it may extend above the sea surface, or it may be a converter system placed on an offshore platform. Apart from wave-powered navigation buoys, however, most of the prototypes have been placed at or near the shore.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The visual impact of a wave energy conversion facility depends on the type of device as well as its distance from shore. In general, a floating buoy system or an offshore platform placed many kilometers from land is not likely to have much visual impact (nor will a submerged system). Onshore facilities and offshore platforms in shallow water could, however, change the visual landscape from one of natural scenery to industrial.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The incidence of wave power at deep ocean sites is three to eight times the wave power at adjacent coastal sites. The cost, however, of electricity transmission from deep ocean sites is prohibitively high. Wave power densities in California's coastal waters are sufficient to produce between seven and 17 megawatts (MW) per mile of coastline.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As of 1995, 685 kilowatts (kW) of grid-connected wave generating capacity is operating worldwide. This capacity comes from eight demonstration plants ranging in size from 350 kW to 20 kW. None of these plants are located in California, although economic feasibility studies have been performed for a 30 MW wave converter to be located at Half Moon Bay. Additional smaller projects have been discussed at Fort Bragg, San Francisco and Avila Beach. There are currently no firm plans to deploy any of these projects.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As of the mid-1990s, wave energy conversion was not commercially available in the United States. The technology was in the early stages of development and was not expected to be available within the near future due to limited research and lack of federal funding. Research and development efforts are being sponsored by government agencies in Europe and Scandinavia.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Many research and development goals remain to be accomplished, including cost reduction, efficiency and reliability improvements, identification of suitable sites in California, interconnection with the utility grid, better understanding of the impacts of the technology on marine life and the shoreline. Also essential is a demonstration of the ability of the equipment to survive the salinity and pressure environments of the ocean as well as weather effects over the life of the facility.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Wave energy could easily replace fossil fuel energy in some areas along coasts, cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions and the atmospheric pollution caused by burning fossil fuels. The effects on the environment are generally minor, as the construction of a wave energy plant requires about the same area as a small harbor.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Ocean waves are created by the interaction of winds with the surface of the sea. They contain large amounts of energy stored in the velocity of the water particles and in the height of the mass of seawater in a wave front above the mean level of the sea (E.S.B.I. and E.T.S.U., 1997).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The amount of wind energy that can be transferred to the surface of the ocean to create the waves depends upon the wind speed, the distance over which it interacts-known as the fetch- and the duration for which it blows over the water. Due to the direction of the prevailing winds and the size of the Atlantic Ocean, North Western Europe including Britain and Ireland have one of the largest wave energy resources in the world (E.S.B.I. and E.T.S.U., 1997).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">There are significant differences in seasonal levels of wave energy, but the long term output should be somewhat more predictable than with some other renewable resources (E.S.B.I. and E.T.S.U., 1997).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The principal ways of extracting energy from waves rely either separately or jointly on the surge, heave and pitch of the waves. The frequency of arrival of ocean waves is low (a few per minute). As electrical generators rotate at hundreds of revolutions per minute the conversion mechanism must produce a higher frequency rotation to generate electricity—which is a convenient energy transfer medium. This can be done by hydraulic pumps or pneumatic bags/chambers driving higher speed turbines and generators.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Such conversion mechanisms have been tested by the construction of many varieties of experimental laboratory models and by some small-scale devices in the open sea or large lochs.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Currently there are two types of shoreline device in operation. One is a shoreline or caisson breakwater oscillating water column driving a pneumatic Wells turbine in 10 to 25 metres of water. The second type is a tapered channel device that was developed in Norway. In this type, incoming waves travel up a tapering channel, overflow and fill a higher level reservoir. The enclosed water then drives a Kaplan hydroelectric turbine as it returns to the sea.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A floating offshore device known as the circular clam has been developed by Sea Energy Associates and Coventry University, Britain. The design comprises a floating twelve-sided hollow ring. Each of the twelve sides has a flexible membrane that inflates and deflates with the incoming wave action. The air passes via a central circular manifold through Wells turbines, which drive electrical generators.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the long term, wave conversion devices positioned in deep water offshore may provide the most likely method of large scale energy recovery. Development of shoreline and near shore systems is, however, relatively further advanced although considerable proving work remains to be done if these are to be considered as reliable sources of electricity (E.S.B.I. and E.T.S.U., 1997).</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A wave energy conversion system converts wave energy within a wave medium into electrical energy. The wave energy conversion system includes a base substantially connected to a wave-medium floor, a tidal platform connected to the base and a tidal float connected to the tidal platform. An axle is connected to the tidal platform with an inductive coil positioned within the axle, such that an axis of the inductive coil is parallel to the axle. A magnetic sleeve includes a magnetic sleeve opening, such that the axle passes through the magnetic sleeve opening. A float member is connected to the magnetic sleeve. A wave moving through the wave causes displacement of the float member, causing the magnetic sleeve to move relative to the inductive coil and generate electrical energy within the inductive coil.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers are used to designate like elements throughout the various views, several embodiments of the present invention are further described. The figures are not necessarily drawn to scale, and in some instances the drawings have been exaggerated or simplified for illustrative purposes only. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the many possible applications and variations of the present invention based on the following examples of possible embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a wave energy conversion device <b>100</b> in accordance with the preferred embodiment is shown. The wave energy conversion device <b>100</b> includes a generally vertically positioned central wave displacement axle <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The central wave displacement axle <b>102</b>, in accordance with the preferred embodiment, is a hollow rigid pole. The diameter of the central wave displacement axle will typically be about one inch, although the dimensions of the wave energy conversion device <b>100</b> and the central wave displacement axle will depend primarily on the depth of the wave-producing body of water and the intensity of the waves at the point of implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The central wave displacement axle <b>102</b> may be formed of metal, plastic, composite materials or other substances. Typically, the material used to form the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b> should be sufficiently rigid to maintain its shape under the kinds of forces that may be present in subsurface wave action. Because the environment of a wave-producing body of water, particularly in the ocean with salt-rich sea-water, is particularly harsh, the choice of material will require consideration of several factors, including strength, weight and durability in the medium.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">A buoyant collar float <b>106</b> is attached to an upper end portion of the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b>. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the buoyant collar is a cylindrical float with a hollow interior, such that the buoyant collar <b>106</b> may move along the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b> inserted through the hollow interior of the buoyant collar float <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The buoyant collar <b>106</b> may be designed to have a specific gravity less than the wave medium <b>104</b>, such that the buoyant collar tends to rise when submerged in the wave medium <b>104</b> and float on the wave medium when not subjected to other pressures. Typically, the buoyant collar <b>106</b> is made from a substance that contains significant gas content, such as Styrofoam, or an elastic material like a balloon containing gas. The buoyant collar <b>106</b> may be configured as an inverted milk bucket with holes.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As the wave medium <b>104</b> moves, the buoyant collar <b>106</b> moves vertically on the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b> as the buoyant collar <b>106</b> is subjected to pressures from the moving wave medium <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The buoyant collar <b>106</b> may typically fashioned in a foam-filled container or a gas-filled container. A person having skill in the art will appreciate that the buoyant collar <b>106</b> may be fashioned in a variety of shapes and designs, as well as lending itself to being made from a variety of materials. Choice of the materials will depend on implementation details of the particular embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The buoyant collar <b>106</b> is attached by attachment lines <b>110</b> to a magnetic sleeve <b>112</b>. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the buoyant collar <b>106</b> is attached to the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> by four attachment lines <b>110</b>, each connected at the end points of perpendicular diameters of the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The particular arrangement of the attachment lines <b>110</b> for a given embodiment will depend on the details of the implementation. The attachment lines <b>110</b> may be wires, rods, cords, string, line or any other medium capable of attaching the buoyant collar <b>106</b> to the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In accordance with one embodiment, the attachment lines <b>110</b> are made from a stiff material, such as aluminum or steel, such that when the buoyant collar <b>106</b> descends along the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b>, the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> is pushed down by the attachment lines <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Flexible materials such as cord or line may be used for the attachment lines <b>110</b>, as the weight of the magnetic collar tends to cause the magnetic collar <b>112</b> to descend along the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Magnetic sleeve <b>112</b>, in accordance with the preferred embodiment, is a hollowed cylinder made from a magnetic substance, such as magnetized iron. Typically, the magnetic substance will be a ferromagnetic alloy, although other magnetic materials may be used as appropriate or desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The magnetic substance may be covered with a plastic or other covering to protect the magnetic substance from the wave medium <b>104</b>. The interior diameter of the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> is typically larger than the exterior diameter of the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b>, such that the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> may move freely over the length of the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b> inserted through the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b>. Ball bearings or other forms of lubricative mechanism may be implemented between the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> and the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Within a hollow portion of the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b> is an inductive coil <b>114</b> of electrically conductive wire. The inductive coil <b>114</b> may extend through the hollow portion of the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b> from the lower limit of the magnetic sleeve's motion <b>116</b> and the upper limit of the magnetic sleeve's motion <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">An inductive coil <b>114</b>, typically less than the length of the full range of motion of the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b>, may be used. An inductive coil <b>114</b> more than the length of the full range of motion of the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The type of electrically conductive wire and dimensions of the inductive coil <b>114</b> are determined by the embodiment. In another embodiment, the inductive coil <b>114</b> may be embedded in the material of the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Where the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b> is made of metal, particularly conductive metal, the electrically conductive wire forming the inductive coil <b>114</b> is insulated from conductive contact with the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b>. The inductive coil <b>114</b> is electrically connected to transmission wires <b>118</b>. The transmission wires <b>118</b> provide current to a connector <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The motion of the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> along the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b> is limited at one end by an upper axle collar <b>108</b> and at the other end by a lower axle collar <b>116</b>. The upper axle collar <b>108</b> and the lower axle collar <b>116</b> are typically formed by an expanded portion of the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b>. Other forms of motion limiting may be used, as appropriate to the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b> and the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> passes along the surface of the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b> with the inductive coil <b>114</b> positioned within the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b>, electric current is generated in the inductive coil <b>114</b> by induction. The magnetic field of the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> moves through the inductive coil <b>114</b>, creating an electromagnetic field in the inductive coil <b>114</b>, resulting in a voltage differential and an electrical current, through the wire.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The magnitudes of the voltage differential and electrical current created is determined by the magnetic qualities of the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b>, the details of the inductive coil <b>114</b> and the length and speed of the vertical displacement of the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> along the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As the wave medium <b>104</b>, typically seawater at or near an ocean shore, undulates in depth, the vertical wave motion <b>124</b> creates vertical axle motion <b>126</b> in the buoyant collar <b>106</b>. The attachment of the buoyant collar <b>106</b> to the magnetic sleeve translates the vertical axle motion <b>126</b> of the buoyant collar to vertical sleeve motion <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The vertical sleeve motion <b>128</b> causes the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> to move along the axis of the inductive coil <b>114</b> within the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b>, generating electrical current in the inductive coil <b>114</b>. The electrical energy generated passes through the transmission wire <b>118</b> to output circuits. The generated electrical energy available at the output interface <b>120</b> is fed to an electrical output circuit that captures, stores or otherwise uses the electrical current.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Buoyant collar float <b>106</b> comprises a buoyant member, typically designed to provide variable buoyancy under the surface of the body of liquid <b>104</b>. The buoyant collar float <b>106</b> may contain a constant mass of gas, the volume of which is dependent on the pressure exerted by the body of wave-medium <b>104</b>. A varying pressure will result in a change in volume of the gas, a change in volume of the elastic member and a resultant change in buoyancy of the buoyant collar float <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In accordance with one embodiment, buoyant collar float <b>106</b> may be a balloon type structure, made of, or partly made of, elastic or otherwise flexible material that may change in shape and size according to the pressure exerted on the gas contained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In accordance with one embodiment, the balloon-type buoyant collar float <b>106</b> may be held in a net cage and shaped so as to maximize the point effect, i.e. minimize the diameter of the buoyant collar float <b>106</b> with respect to the wavelength of the over-passing wave in the wave-medium <b>104</b>, from the prevailing wave climate.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Central wave displacement axle <b>102</b> is connected at the bottom to a horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b>. The connection of the central wave displacement axle <b>102</b> and the horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b> may be a solid connection, such as a weld, or a pivoted connection, to allow the central wave displacement axle to move relative to the horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the shown embodiment, the horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b> is hollow to allow transmission wires <b>118</b> to be placed therein. The horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b> may be a pipe, a solid plate, a hollowed plate, a grid of pipes or any other configuration suitable for holding one or more wave energy conversion devices <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a wave energy conversion system <b>200</b> is shown. The wave energy conversion system <b>200</b> is submerged in wave medium <b>104</b>, typically the ocean at or near the shore. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the wave energy conversion system <b>200</b> is anchored to the ocean floor <b>201</b> using anchors <b>202</b>. Anchors <b>202</b> would typically be made from concrete or similar compounds. It may be advantageous to use other anchoring devices or systems to anchor the wave energy conversion system <b>200</b> to the ocean floor <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In other embodiments, with a floating horizontal stabilization platform base, the wave energy conversion system <b>200</b> may not be anchored to the ocean floor <b>201</b>. In this embodiment, the wave energy conversion system <b>200</b> would be attached to floats. The floating wave energy conversion system embodiment would be necessary where the wave energy conversion system <b>200</b> is used in a deep sea environment, where anchoring to the ocean floor <b>201</b> is impractical.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the preferred embodiment, the anchors <b>202</b> are attached to seabed stabilization posts <b>204</b>. The seabed stabilization posts <b>204</b> are typically embedded in concrete forming the anchors <b>202</b>, such that the concrete solidifies on the seabed stabilization posts to form a generally heavy and un-detachable anchor <b>202</b>. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the seabed stabilization posts <b>204</b> are positioned vertically. In other embodiments, the seabed stabilization posts <b>204</b> may be positioned at another angle.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Seabed stabilization posts <b>204</b> act as a motion guide for horizontal stabilization platform horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b>. Seabed stabilization posts <b>204</b> extend through a hole or indentation in the horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b>, such that horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b> may rise or fall vertically along the seabed stabilization posts <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b> is typically a planar surface. Horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b> may be formed of a solid plate of a wave-medium-resistant material. A base may typically be formed of steel, aluminum, plastic, or any other appropriate substance. Horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b> may be formed as a mesh or as a multi-orifice surface.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The vertical motion of the horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b> along the seabed stabilization posts <b>204</b> is typically limited by a lower collar <b>212</b> and an upper collar <b>214</b>. The lower collar <b>212</b> and the upper collar <b>214</b> may be integral with the seabed stabilization posts <b>204</b>, or may be created by adding a piece to the seabed stabilization post <b>204</b>, such that the piece limits the motion of the horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As shown, horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b> is connected at the extremity to tidal displacement corner posts <b>208</b>. In the preferred embodiment, horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b> is formed as a square, with tidal displacement corner posts <b>208</b> situated at the corners of horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b>. It will be apparent to those having skill in the art that other configurations of tidal displacement corner posts <b>208</b> could be used, particularly in other configurations for the base shape.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Tidal displacement corner posts <b>208</b> are connected to tidal displacement floats <b>210</b>. The tidal displacement floats <b>210</b> are typically attached to the tidal displacement corner posts <b>208</b> by a connection device such as rope, or may be fastened in any other appropriate manner.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The tidal displacement floats <b>210</b> are sufficiently buoyant to respond to changes in the wave medium depth by raising or lowering the horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b>. The weight of the horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b>, the tidal displacement corner posts <b>208</b> and the wave energy conversion devices <b>100</b> is sufficiently to keep the horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b> generally stable, adjusting to the tidal changes in the wave-medium <b>104</b> rather than the wave motion.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Wave energy conversion devices <b>100</b> are attached vertically to the base <b>206</b>. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the wave energy conversion devices <b>100</b> are positioned in an array over the surface of the base <b>206</b>. The wave energy conversion devices <b>100</b> can be arranged as densely as free motion permits.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an overhead view of wave energy conversion system <b>200</b> in accordance with the preferred embodiment is shown. This embodiment uses a rectangular horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b> with an array of wave energy conversion devices <b>100</b> attached to the upper surface of the horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The wave energy conversion devices <b>100</b> may be attached to some or all of the adjoining wave energy conversion devices <b>100</b> in the array using connection lines <b>216</b>. The connection lines <b>216</b> may be nylon line or some other form of cord. The interconnection of wave energy conversion devices <b>100</b> using the connection lines <b>216</b> restrict the non-vertical motion of the wave energy conversion devices <b>100</b>, reducing the tendency of the wave energy conversion devices <b>100</b> to shift from their vertical position due to the repetitive forces of the waves. In this embodiment, four tidal displacement floats <b>210</b> are situated at the corners of the horizontal stabilization platform base <b>206</b>. In another embodiment, the wave energy conversion devices <b>100</b> are not connected using connection lines <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a simplified wave energy conversion system <b>200</b> is shown. A median wave-medium level is shown by line <b>402</b>. The first wave energy conversion device <b>100</b><i>a </i>is shown at a reference position, such that the distance between the buoyant collar float <b>106</b> and the median level <b>402</b> is at a determined height h<sub>0</sub>. A wave in the wave-medium is shown at line <b>404</b>, such that the depth of the water is lower than the median wave-medium level above a second wave-energy conversion device <b>100</b><i>b </i>and the depth of the water is higher above a fourth wave-energy conversion device <b>100</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">With reference to the second wave energy conversion device <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the depth of the water above the buoyant collar float <b>106</b> is h<sub>1</sub>, where h<sub>1 </sub>is less than h<sub>0</sub>. Because the water above the buoyant collar float <b>106</b> of the second wave energy conversion device <b>100</b><i>b </i>weighs less than the water above the buoyant collar float <b>106</b> of the first wave energy conversion device <b>100</b><i>a</i>, the buoyant collar float <b>106</b> of the second wave energy conversion device <b>100</b><i>b </i>rises. The buoyancy of the buoyant collar float <b>106</b> is greater than the weight of the water at a depth of h<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">With reference to the fourth wave energy conversion device <b>100</b><i>d</i>, the depth of the water above the buoyant collar float <b>106</b> is h<sub>3</sub>, where h<sub>3 </sub>is greater than h<sub>0</sub>. Because the water above the buoyant collar float <b>106</b> of the fourth wave energy conversion device <b>100</b><i>d </i>weighs more than the water above the buoyant collar float <b>106</b> of the first wave energy conversion device <b>100</b><i>d</i>, the buoyant collar float <b>106</b> of the fourth wave energy conversion device <b>100</b><i>d </i>sinks. The buoyancy of the buoyant collar float <b>106</b> is less than the weight of the water at a depth of h<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">When the surface of the wave medium <b>104</b> is not flat as in <b>404</b>, it is equivalent to the occurrence of waves on a water surface. The wave energy conversion device <b>100</b><i>d </i>is under a crest of a wave <b>404</b>. As a result, the height of water column h<sub>3 </sub>is greater than h<sub>0</sub>. The effect of this is the exertion of more pressure on the quantity of gas. According to Boyle's Law pressure times volume (PV) is constant for constant temperature or, under conditions that will most probably favor adiabatic change, PV<sup>γ</sup> is constant where gamma tends towards 1.4 for air. Hence, as the pressure has increased, the volume of gas within the buoyant collar float <b>106</b> contracts.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The height h<sub>3 </sub>is equivalent to the height of the wave crest plus any downward movement of the buoyant collar float <b>106</b>. Both components of h<sub>3 </sub>act so as to increase the pressure on the elastic member <b>106</b> and cause a reduction in volume of the elastic member. According to Archimedes' Principle, as the volume of the elastic member <b>106</b> decreases and less liquid is displaced, the upthrust corresponding to the mass of water displaced will be lessened.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Wave energy conversion device <b>100</b><i>b </i>is under a trough of a wave <b>404</b>. The height h<sub>1 </sub>is less than h<sub>0</sub>, such that less pressure is being exerted on the gas, with a resultant increase in the volume of the elastic member <b>106</b>. In a similar manner to that described with relation to wave energy conversion device <b>100</b><i>c, h</i><sub>1 </sub>is made up of two components; the depth of the trough and the upward movement of the buoyant collar <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The movement of the buoyant collar float <b>106</b>, which results from using a flexible balloon type arrangement, under the crest and trough adds a dynamic effect to the static effect caused by the passage of the passing wave <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a functional block diagram of the wave-energy conversion system <b>200</b> is shown. Electrical energy is generated by the relative motion <b>128</b> between the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> and the coil <b>114</b>. The magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> is moved in attachment to a combination of buoyant material <b>106</b> and weight <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The buoyant material <b>106</b> tends to cause the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> to rise, while the weight <b>130</b> (including the weight of the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b>) causes the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> to sink. Changes in depth of the wave-medium causes the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> to rise and fall relative to the coil <b>114</b> as the forces on the buoyant material <b>106</b> and the weight <b>130</b> are unbalanced.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The coil <b>114</b> is electrically connected to at least an output <b>250</b>. The circuitry and other devices positioned electrically between the coil <b>114</b> and the output <b>250</b> may vary. Typically, the output of the coil will go to a rectifier <b>218</b>, which creates a positive flow of electricity from the random positive and negative flow generated by the random movements of the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> relative to the coil <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Similarly, a regulator <b>220</b> may be connected to the output of the rectifier <b>218</b>, to regulate the fluctuations in current output. For most uses, the output of the regulator <b>220</b> will be connected to a storage device <b>224</b>, such as a battery. Stored in a storage device <b>224</b>, the electrical energy may be used by any type of electrical device <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a head assembly of the wave energy conversion device <b>100</b> is shown. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> has a diameter sufficient to generate electrical current in the coil <b>114</b>. Relative to the buoyant forces applied by buoyant collar float <b>106</b>, the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> has little weight.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a head assembly of the wave energy conversion device <b>100</b> in accordance with another embodiment is shown. In this embodiment, the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> has a substantially large diameter than in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Relative to the buoyant forces applied by buoyant collar float <b>106</b>, the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> of this embodiment has a weigh approximately equal to the buoyant forces of the buoyant collar float <b>106</b>. This embodiment may be useful in situations where the wave energy has a longer frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a function block diagram of the output portion of a wave energy conversion system <b>200</b> is shown. The circuit representation of the wave-energy conversion device <b>100</b> consists of a magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> and inductive sleeve <b>114</b> represented as a grounded inductor. Resistance in the coil is represented by resistor <b>226</b>. Each wave-energy conversion device <b>100</b> in a wave-energy conversion system <b>200</b> may be represented by an equivalent circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Motion of the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> relative to the coil <b>114</b> generates a voltage across inductor <b>114</b>. The voltages generated by each of the inductive coils <b>114</b> in a plurality of wave energy conversion devices <b>100</b> are each fed to a rectifier <b>218</b>. In one embodiment, the rectifier may be a diode, passing only the positive voltages generated by the wave-energy conversion device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Each of the plurality of rectifiers <b>218</b> outputs to a voltage regulator <b>220</b>. The output voltage of the voltage regulator <b>220</b> may be fed into electrical storage <b>222</b>, such as a battery or any other energy storage mechanism. In some embodiments, the output voltage of the voltage regulator <b>220</b> may be provided directly to an output control <b>224</b> or to an output device <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The electrical storage <b>222</b> may be connected to an output control <b>224</b>, for controlling the use of the output energy. The output of the electrical storage <b>222</b> may be connected directly to an output device <b>225</b>. The output control <b>224</b> may be connected to an output device <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a circuit for the output portion of a wave energy conversion system <b>200</b> in accordance with one embodiment is shown. The wave energy conversion device <b>100</b> outputs a voltage with both positive and negative voltage components, as shown in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The output voltage of the wave-energy conversion device <b>100</b> is connected across a resistance <b>226</b> and the inputs of a rectifier <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The arrangement of diodes in the rectifier <b>228</b> provides alternating paths for positive and negative voltages, such that the output of the rectifier <b>228</b> is only positive voltages. The output of the rectifier <b>228</b> is shunted by a capacitor <b>230</b> and across the terminals of a storage battery <b>232</b>. The electrical energy produced by the wave energy conversion device <b>100</b> is thereby stored in the storage battery <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a graph of a possible voltage output by a wave energy conversion device <b>100</b> is shown. The vertical axis of the graph represents the voltage differential between the outputs of the inductance coil <b>114</b>. A reference line represents a zero voltage, with positive voltages represented above the reference line and negative voltages below the reference line. The horizontal axis represents time.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Movement of the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> relative to the inductance coil <b>114</b> creates voltage at the output of the inductance coil <b>114</b>, such that movement in one direction generates a positive voltage and movement in the opposite direction generates a negative voltage. The polarity of the inductance coil <b>114</b> will determine which direction of movement generates a positive voltage and which direction of movement generates a negative voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Because the forces generated by wave motion, particularly in coastal regions where the average wavelength of the waves in the ocean are very short, are highly chaotic and random, the voltage changes between positive and negative in rapid and relatively unpredictable fashion. The speed of the magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> as it moves past the inductance coil <b>112</b> determines the value of the voltage, such that a magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> moving at a rapid speed past the inductance coil <b>112</b> generates a larger voltage than the same magnetic sleeve <b>112</b> moving at a slower speed past the inductance coil <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The depicted graph represents one possible voltage output, but it should be understood that the voltage output graphs may vary greatly, depending on the embodiment and the nature of the waves provided.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a graph of the same voltage output by a wave energy conversion device <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, at the output of rectifier <b>228</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The vertical axis of the graph represents the voltage differential between the outputs of the rectifier <b>228</b>. A reference line represents a zero voltage, with positive voltages represented above the reference line and negative voltages below the reference line. The horizontal axis represents time. By the configuration of single-directional paths, as embodied in the diodes of the rectifier <b>228</b>, the polarity of the voltage differences are aligned such that all voltage differences are output as positive voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a single wave-energy conversion device <b>100</b> use is shown. In this embodiment, a single wave-energy conversion device <b>100</b> is anchored to the sea-bed. Waves in the wave medium <b>104</b> cause the wave-energy conversion device <b>100</b> to output voltage. Typically, this output voltage is transferred to electrical storage <b>222</b>. The energy is transmitted by wire <b>234</b> to an output device <b>236</b>, such as a light, transmitter or other electrical device.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In the embodiment shown, the output device <b>236</b> is a light on a buoy. The low power requirements of a simple device like a lamp make it feasible to power the device with one or a few wave-energy conversion devices. The output device <b>236</b> may be a transmitter for use in a location system. As shown, without compensation for tidal effects, the wave-energy conversion device <b>100</b> may only provide power during high tide, or may provide significantly different levels of power at different times of the day, depending on the tide. Deeper water reduces the wave forces impacting the wave-energy conversion device.</p>

The electrical equipment <b>238</b> may be a transmitter, sensing devices, receiver, exploration and operation equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Because the wave-energy conversion system <b>200</b> as shown includes tidal compensation, the wave-energy conversion system <b>200</b> would provide fairly consistent energy outputs through the entire tidal cycle.

Waves in the wave medium <b>104</b> generate electrical energy in the wave-energy conversion devices <b>100</b> of the wave energy conversion system <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The electrical energy is output from the wave-energy conversion system via transmission wires <b>234</b> to shore output devices <b>242</b>. The transmission wire <b>234</b> may be an underground cable, a cable through the wave-medium or other forms of energy transmission suitable for transmitting energy from the wave-medium to the shore. The shore output devices <b>242</b> may be connected to more than one wave-energy conversion system <b>200</b>, to collect greater amounts of energy for use.</p>
