<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of electrical connector assemblies and header assemblies and, more particularly to connector systems including improved connector assemblies facilitating the connection of wires thereto and improved header assemblies configured and dimensioned to mate with multiple connector assemblies simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Pin and socket connectors of the type sold under the tradename MATE-N-LOK®, by AMP Incorporated, a Division of Tyco Electronics Corporation, Harrisburg, Pa., have pin or socket contacts therein which are used to terminate wires coaxially crimped thereto. The contacts are situated in cavities through a housing constructed for mated connection with a complementary housing of another connector or header assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Connector assemblies typically include a housing having cavities therethrough which receive the mating portions of respective contacts, and a retainer with passages therethrough which are assembled over respective wires. The retainer is operatively engaged to the rearward face of the housing to retain the contacts therein. Each wire must be electrically connected to the proper corresponding contact of the connector assembly in order to establish the correct electrical connection and not to short-out the system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically each connector assembly mates with a corresponding header assembly. In other words, for each connector assembly there is a corresponding individual complementary header assembly configured and dimensioned to selectively receive and/or mate with the header assembly. As such, numerous header assemblies are employed to accommodate each and every connector assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The need exists for connector assemblies which provided the user with improved visual indication as to which wire is to be electrically connected to a particular contact.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The need also exists for a header assembly configured and dimensioned to selectively mate with and/or accommodate a multiplicity of connector assemblies simultaneously.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure relates generally to the field of electrical connector assemblies and header assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a connector assembly for terminating a plurality of discrete wires and for selective electrical interconnection with a header assembly is provided. The connector assembly includes a front housing defining at least one channel therein; a rear housing operative connected to the front housing, the rear housing including at least one passage formed therein and in operative association with a respective channel of the front housing, each passage terminating a respective discrete wire; and at least one contact disposed at least partially within each channel of the front housing and each corresponding passage of the rear housing. The connector assembly further includes a visual coding system provided on a surface of at least one of the front housing and the rear housing. The visual coding system includes unique indicia for each passage of the rear housing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, the indicia is a set of color codes. Desirably, the visual coding system is provided on a rear surface of the rear housing. The visual coding system includes a label including all of the indicia produced thereon. The label may be affixed to the rear surface of the rear housing.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is envisioned that the passages provided in the rear housing are arranged into an upper row of passages and a lower row of passages. Desirably, the label is affixed between the upper row of passages and the lower row of passages.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The connector assembly may further include a latch arm operatively connected to an upper surface of the rear housing. The latch arm is operatively engagable with a detent provided on a surface of a header assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Desirably, the front housing includes at least one polarization member configured and dimensioned to operatively engage a complementary polarization element provided in a receptacle of the header assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is envisioned that each contact is a tuning fork-type contact. It is further envisioned that the rear housing includes nine passages formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a header assembly for simultaneously selectively receiving and mating with at least one of a front housing of a connector assembly and contact silos of a plug receptacle housing, is provided. The header assembly includes a body portion having a front surface, a rear surface, a top surface and a bottom surface. The body portion includes a first receptacle formed in the front surface of the body portion. The first receptacle is configured and dimensioned to receive the front housing of the contact assembly therein. The first receptacle includes a plurality of electrical contact leads therein, wherein each contact lead includes an end extending from the rear surface of the body portion. The body portion further includes a second receptacle formed in the front surface of the body portion. The second receptacle is configured and dimensioned to receive the contact silos of the plug receptacle housing therein. The second receptacle includes a plurality of electrical contact leads therein, wherein each contact lead includes an end extending from the rear surface of the body portion.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Desirably, the second receptacle includes a plurality of individual receptacles each configured and dimensioned to receive a corresponding contact silo of a plug receptacle housing.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is contemplated that at least one of the first receptacle and the second receptacle includes a polarization element configured and dimensioned to operatively engage a complementary polarization member provided on each of the contact assembly and the plug receptacle housing. Desirably, each individual contact receptacle includes a polarization element.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The individual contact receptacles may be arranged in a pair of rows. Desirably, the second receptacle includes at least a pair of individual receptacles arranged one atop the other. The second receptacle desirably includes no more than twenty-four individual receptacles.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment, the body portion may include at least one detent formed along the upper surface thereof. Desirably, each detent is configured and dimensioned to selectively engage latching arms of each of the connector assembly and the plug receptacle housing. It is envisioned that the body portion may include a first detent extending from an upper surface thereof and in operative association with the first receptacle; and a second detent extending from an upper surface thereof and in operative association with the second receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The body portion may include at least one hold-down extending from the bottom surface thereof. Each hold-down is configured and dimensioned to selectively engage an aperture formed in a printed circuit board. Additionally, the electrical contact leads extending from the rear surface of the body portion are electrically engageable with corresponding electrical terminals provided on the printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For a better understanding of the present disclosure and to show how it may be carried into effect, reference will now be made by way of example to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Embodiments of the presently disclosed connector and header assemblies will now be described in detail with reference to the drawing figures wherein like reference numerals identify similar or identical elements. As used herein and as is traditional, the term “distal” refers to that portion which is furthest from the user while the term “proximal” refers to that portion which is closest to the user. In addition, terms such as “above”, “below”, “forward”, “rearward”, etc. refer to the orientation of the figures or the direction of components and are simply used for convenience of description.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, a connector assembly, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, is generally designated as <b>100</b>.
