<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a probing apparatus, and more particularly to a probing apparatus capable of probing a micro signal from a measured device disposed on an insulated substrate that mounts a plurality of devices spaced apart from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Production of a liquid crystal display includes patterning a plurality of transparent electrodes on a glass substrate and, if necessary, further includes forming circuit elements, such as transistors, diodes, resistors, and capacitors, on the glass substrate. In order to improve productivity, plural liquid crystal display blocks are disposed in a predetermined pattern on the same glass substrate. Forming the plural liquid crystal display blocks are performed as a single process by means of a photolithography technique or the like. For example, a square or rectangular glass substrate having one side exceeding 1 m is used. A total of 100 or more liquid crystal display blocks, each having one side of several cm, are disposed in a predetermined pattern on the glass substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Inspection of a glass substrate mounting liquid crystal display elements thereon is performed with a probing apparatus and a tester, at appropriate timing, during or after production. In this case, a method similar to an IC measurement method which is well known conventionally can be used for inspecting the characteristics of a device formed on a glass substrate. More specifically, device measurement on a glass substrate requires a probing apparatus and an appropriate measuring apparatus connected to the probing apparatus. The probing apparatus includes a stage for supporting and shifting the glass substrate to an arbitrary position, a contact or non-contact probe for inputting or outputting a measurement signal to or from a measurement terminal of each display element on the glass substrate, and a connecting portion that connects the probe to a measuring unit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The measurement performed by the probing apparatus includes, in a simple case, a test for a wiring pattern to be internal opened or internal shorted (open-short circuit test), or, in a complex case, an operation characteristic test for respective transistors and a turn-on operation test for the liquid crystal display. For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 11-65475 discloses a probe apparatus that uses an XY stage for supporting a display panel and measures characteristics of the display panel by means of a probe.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The characteristic measurement of a device on a glass substrate, especially measurement of transistor characteristics on a liquid crystal display or measurement of holding capacitance of each pixel which provides a potential to an ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) electrode in each pixel circuit, is a low-current measurement. Therefore, if large internal (or external) noises are present, sufficient measurement accuracy will not be assured. Hence, shielding a space including both the stage and the probe is used.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, when a large-scale glass substrate is used to form plural devices thereon as described above, a large shielding space is required to cover a moving range, or a shifting range of the stage in addition to the entire area of the glass substrate. For example, when the glass substrate is a square substrate having one side of 1 m, the stage requires a shifting range of extra 1 m in both the X and Y directions. As a whole, a required shielding area is equivalent to a square area having one side of 2 m.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As is understood from the foregoing description, according to a conventional technique, a probing apparatus for a large-scale glass substrate mounting a plurality of devices requires a further larger shielding facility. As a result, both the size and the cost of the probing apparatus inevitably increase.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In view of the above problems, an advantage of the present invention is to provide a probing apparatus that is capable of probing a micro signal from a device on a substrate without requiring a large shielding facility.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A principle of the present invention will first be described.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A probing apparatus of the present invention includes a stage for supporting an insulated substrate mounting a plurality of devices that are spaced apart from each other, and a probe for inputting or outputting a measurement signal to or from a measurement terminal of a measured device on the insulated substrate to measure the characteristics of the measured device. The probing apparatus is generally subjected to various types of noise giving adverse influences to the micro signal measurement of the measured device, which are roughly classified into three kinds: noise coming from neighboring devices; noise coming from the probing apparatus; and ambient or spatial noise coming from above the device to be measured.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The noise coming from neighboring devices to the measured device is dependent on a side surface area of the measured device opposing the neighboring devices. Meanwhile, the ambient noise coming from above is dependent on an upper surface area of the measured device mounted on the insulated substrate. In general, the upper surface of a measured device is sufficiently larger than the side surface of the measured device. Therefore, the noise coming from neighboring devices is very small as compared with the ambient noise and can be neglected.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For example, a glass substrate mounting transistors, pixels, and wiring patterns thereon is used for a liquid crystal display. And for SOI (Silicon On Insulator), an insulated substrate forming semiconductor elements thereon is used. According to a liquid crystal display, a device on a glass substrate has a thickness on the level of several μm and is accordingly very small as compared with one side of an upper rectangular surface of the device. The upper rectangular surface is on the level of several mm or several tens of mm in size of one side.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As one example, it is now supposed that the devices are disposed on a glass substrate and spaced from each other with a clearance of 5 mm. Each device is 3 μm in thickness and has an upper surface measuring 50 mm×40 mm. An area of a side surface of a measured device opposing a neighboring device is 3 μm×(peripheral length of measured device)=3 μm×180 mm. Meanwhile, an upper surface area of the measured device is 50 mm×40 mm. Apparently, the upper surface area of the measured device is very large as compared with the side surface area of the measured device opposing neighboring devices. As described above, according to a general arrangement of a plurality of devices spaced apart from each other and disposed on an insulated substrate, the thickness of each device is negligible, and accordingly the noise coming from neighboring devices to a measured device is very small as compared with the ambient noise coming from above.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Therefore, adverse effects on the micro signal measurement of a measured device can be eliminated by suppressing the noise coming from the probing apparatus and the ambient noise coming from above. To this end, the present invention provides a probing apparatus having the below-described configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">More specifically, in consideration that the noise coming from the probing apparatus comes from a lower side of the stage supporting the insulated substrate, grounding the stage is effective for cutting the noise. Meanwhile, a measured device can be shielded from the ambient noise coming from above by providing a shielding cover that is grounded.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to this configuration, a measured device is interposed between two shielding members. In this case, determining the sizes of the stage and the shielding cover is a key to effectively suppress the noise entering from the gap between two shielding members. The stage and the shielding cover should have wide areas capable of sufficiently covering the measured device.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">To accomplish the above and other related advantages, the present invention provides a probing apparatus for probing a micro signal from a measured device on an insulated substrate that mounts a plurality of devices spaced apart from each other. The probing apparatus of the present invention includes a stage, a probe, and a shielding cover. The stage supports a lower surface of the insulated substrate and is connected to a ground terminal. The probe inputs or outputs a measuring signal to or from a measurement terminal of the measured device. The shielding cover is positioned over an upper surface of the measured device and is connected to the ground terminal. The shielding cover has an opposed area that is not smaller than an area of the measured device on the insulated substrate and not greater than four times the area of the measured device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, according to the probing apparatus of the present invention, the shielding cover is preferably a conductive shielding plate having a flat surface parallel to a flat surface of the stage.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, according to the probing apparatus of the present invention, an electric potential of the ground terminal is preferably identical with an electric potential of a metallic casing that supports a driving unit of the stage.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, according to the probing apparatus of the present invention, the measured device is preferably a device including a transparent electrode disposed on the glass substrate. For example, the transparent electrode is an ITO electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the above-described configuration of the present invention, the stage is maintained at the ground potential. The shielding cover having the ground potential is positioned over an upper surface of the measured device. The size of the shielding cover is not smaller than an area of the measured device and not greater than four times the area of the measured device. In other words, the size of the shielding cover is greater than or equal to an area of the measured device and smaller than or equal to the quadplex area of the measured device.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, the ambient noise entering along the edge of the shielding cover can be effectively suppressed. No substantial effect is imparted to the measured device. One reason why limited to the four times area is as follows. In general, as is known in connection with a micro strip line or a strip line, the shielding cover should have a greater width than the width of the shielded device, and prefereably, the shielding cover should have a grounded area whose width is approximately two times the width of the shielded device. Accordingly, a practical size of the shielding cover is grater than the area of the shielded device, and preferably four times the area of a measured device. So, the size of the shielding cover is not smaller than an area of the measured device and not greater than four times the area of the measured device. In this manner, providing the shielding cover having an area of approximately up to four times large for the area of a measuring device performs sufficient effect for suppressing adverse effects of noises without requiring shielding for the entire body of the insulated substrate. Thus, the present invention enables probing of a micro signal from a device on a substrate without requiring a large-scale shielding facility.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, according to a preferred embodiment, the shielding cover is parallel to an upper surface of the stage. In other words, the stage and the shielding cover cooperatively constitute a shielding structure consisting of parallel flat plates that are connected to the ground terminal. A measured device is disposed in the gap space between parallel flat plates. Therefore, the probing apparatus according to the present invention is of simple configuration and can sufficiently suppress adverse effects of external noises.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, according to the preferred embodiment, an electric potential of the ground terminal is identical with an electric potential of the metallic casing that supports the driving unit of the stage. The shifting mechanism portion and the stage are maintained at the same potential (i.e., ground potential). This is effective in suppressing the noise coming from the shifting mechanism portion to the stage.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, according to the preferred embodiment, the measured device is a device including a transparent electrode disposed on the glass substrate. Thus, the probing apparatus of the present invention can be applied to a liquid crystal display device. For example, a practical transparent electrode is an ITO electrode. Thus, the probing apparatus of the present invention can be applied to a liquid crystal display device having a general configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As described above, the probing apparatus of the present invention enables probing of a micro signal from a device on a substrate without requiring a large-scale shielding facility.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The above and other advantages, features of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of an exemplary embodiment with reference to the attached drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the attached drawings. First of all, a principle of the present invention will be described with reference to the results of modeling tests. Next, a practical configuration of a probing apparatus according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> are views respectively showing a configuration of a modeling test and measured ambient noise. The modeling test is for checking the effect of the ambient noise on a device of an insulated substrate. To perform the modeling test, as shown in the left portions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>, a hard vinyl chloride plate <b>12</b> is disposed on an insulating resin table <b>10</b>. Further, a copper foil <b>14</b> is disposed on the vinyl chloride plate <b>12</b>. The vinyl chloride plate <b>12</b>, having a thickness of 1 mm, is a model of an insulated substrate. The copper foil <b>14</b>, having a size of 5 mm×5 mm, is a model of a device. To measure the noise detectable from the copper foil <b>14</b>, a shield cable, or a coaxial cable, <b>20</b> and a spectrum analyzer <b>26</b> are used. The shield cable <b>20</b> includes a core wire, or a center conductor, <b>16</b> having one end connected to the copper foil <b>14</b> and the other end connected to a measuring portion <b>22</b> of the spectrum analyzer <b>26</b>. The measuring portion <b>22</b> of the spectrum analyzer <b>26</b> is a model of a measuring unit of a tester. A shield braid, or an outer conductor, <b>18</b> of the shield cable <b>20</b> is connected to a casing body of the spectrum analyzer <b>26</b>. The casing body of the spectrum analyzer <b>26</b> is connected to a ground terminal <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A screen of the spectrum analyzer <b>26</b>, shown in the right portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, has an X-axis representing frequency (f) and a Y-axis representing noise level (dBm). The measurement was performed in the frequency range from 0 Hz to 1 MHz. The Y-axis reaches 100 dB at its full scale, in increments of 10 dB/div. As is understood from the measurement result, the noise level that can be detected from the copper foil <b>14</b> is significantly large.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows another example that includes an iron plate <b>30</b> as a model of a metallic stage. The iron plate <b>30</b> is disposed beneath the hard vinyl chloride plate <b>12</b> serving as a model of an insulated substrate that has a thickness of 1 mm. The iron plate <b>30</b> is connected to the ground terminal <b>28</b>. Components identical with those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> are denoted by the same reference numerals. The screen of the spectrum analyzer <b>26</b> shown in the right portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> has the same scale as the screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The measurement result of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows that providing a conductor stage beneath the vinyl chloride plate (i.e. an insulated substrate) and connecting the conductor stage to the ground terminal brings about an effect of reducing the noise level by −20 dB or more.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows a further different example that includes a circuit substrate <b>32</b>. The circuit substrate <b>32</b> has one side plane with an entire copper covering layer. And the copper layer of the circuit substrate <b>32</b> is positioned over to the copper foil <b>14</b>. The copper layer of the circuit substrate <b>32</b> is opposed to the copper foil <b>14</b>. The copper layer serves as a model of a shielding cover. The copper layer is connected to the ground terminal <b>28</b>. The remainder of the configuration is identical with that of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The screen of the spectrum analyzer <b>26</b> shown in the right portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> has the same scale as the screen of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The measurement result of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows that the noise level is further reduced by providing a conductive shielding cover over the copper foil (i.e. a device) and grounding the shielding cover. The noise level in this case is within a range of measurement error or system noise of the measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As is apparent from the foregoing description, the above modeling tests have demonstrated that the noise level that can be detected from a copper foil is significantly large when the copper foil is disposed on a vinyl chloride plate serving as a model of a device disposed on an insulated substrate. On the other hand, when an iron plate serving as a model of a stage is grounded, the noise is greatly reduced. Moreover, when a copper layer of the circuit substrate serving as a model of a shielding cover entirely covers an upper surface of the copper foil and is grounded, the noise is further reduced. In the modeling tests of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>, a large-scale shielding facility capable of covering a whole measurement system, such as a shielding room or a shielding casing, is not required. The members required in this case are limited to a stage being grounded and a plate member having a copper layer entirely covering a copper foil serving as a model of a device. Therefore, the above modeling tests suggest that, a large scale shielding facility is not required for probing and measuring a micro signal or a low level signal.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Next, a practical probing apparatus according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the following description, a measurement object of a micro signal is a liquid crystal display wiring pattern disposed on a glass substrate. Furthermore, the liquid crystal display can include circuit elements. The liquid crystal display of the embodiment is, for example, a sub-assemblied liquid crystal display or a complete-assemblied liquid crystal display. The liquid crystal display is, for example, of a passive type or an active type. Furthermore, the device of the embodiment is not limited to a device formed on a glass substrate, and therefore includes a device disposed on an insulated substrate, such as a device on an LSI wafer or an SOI (Silicon On Insulator) or a similar semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Furthermore, the numerical values representing the frequency, dimensions of a glass substrate and a device, or the like are mere examples. Any other numerical values can be used, so long as the following conditions for realizing a compact shielding cover are satisfied. Furthermore, a probe for inputting or outputting a signal to or from a measurement terminal of a device to measure the characteristics of the device is a contact-type probe having a plurality of probe needles. However, a non-contact-type probe can be also used. For example, high-frequency communications between the probe and the measurement terminal can be employed for the measurement of characteristics. The probe may be equipped with an optical sensor, and a portion performing optical measurement of a device can be used as a measurement terminal for the measurement of characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a practical arrangement of a probing apparatus <b>50</b>. Besides constituent components of the probing apparatus <b>50</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a glass substrate <b>40</b> and a plurality of devices <b>42</b> disposed in a discrete fashion, that are spaced apart from each other, on the glass substrate <b>40</b>, as measurement objects. Each device <b>42</b> has wiring patterns of transparent electrodes that constitute parts of the liquid crystal display.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Furthermore, in addition to the constituent components of the probing apparatus <b>50</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a measuring apparatus <b>80</b> (indicated by a broken line) connected to the probing apparatus <b>50</b>. The measuring apparatus <b>80</b> has the capability of measuring electric characteristics of the device <b>42</b> (i.e., measuring object). The measuring apparatus <b>80</b> consists of a measuring portion <b>82</b> and a casing body <b>84</b>. The measuring portion <b>82</b> includes a measurement control circuit and a measuring circuit. The casing body <b>84</b> of the measuring apparatus <b>80</b> is connected to a ground terminal <b>54</b> via a conductive wire that is sufficiently thick and short. The probing apparatus <b>50</b> has the capability of probing a micro signal from an intended one of the devices <b>42</b> that are spaced apart from each other and disposed on the glass substrate <b>40</b>. The probing apparatus <b>50</b> includes a stage <b>68</b> of a mechanism apparatus <b>60</b>, a shielding cover <b>70</b> provided over the stage <b>68</b>, a probe <b>72</b>, and a signal cable <b>78</b>. The signal cable <b>78</b> includes a connecting terminal <b>77</b> connected to the measuring apparatus <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition to the stage <b>68</b>, the mechanism apparatus <b>60</b> includes a metallic base body <b>62</b>, a vibration absorber <b>64</b> made of stone or the like, and a shifting mechanism <b>66</b>, for moving the stage, mounted on the vibration absorber <b>64</b>. The stage <b>68</b> is attached on the shifting mechanism <b>66</b>. The shifting mechanism <b>66</b> can shift the stage <b>68</b> in both X and Y directions and also rotate the stage <b>68</b> about the Z-axis (referred to as θ rotation). Furthermore, although not shown in the drawings, a control section for controlling the shifting mechanism <b>66</b> is provided. The control section is connected to the measuring apparatus <b>80</b> via a signal line, so that the mechanism apparatus <b>60</b> and the measuring apparatus <b>80</b> can work cooperatively.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The shifting mechanism <b>66</b> has a metallic portion via which the shifting mechanism <b>66</b> is connected to the base body <b>62</b>. The base body <b>62</b> is connected to a ground terminal <b>52</b> via a conductive wire that is sufficiently thick and short. The reason why the shifting mechanism <b>66</b> is connected via the base body <b>62</b> to the ground terminal <b>52</b> is that the base body <b>62</b> is a large metallic block that has very low electric resistance as compared with a conductive wire. If any other means having a smaller electric resistance is available, the shifting mechanism <b>66</b> can be directly connected to the ground terminal <b>52</b> without depending on an electric path including the base body <b>62</b>. Needless to say, the ground terminal <b>54</b> for the measuring apparatus <b>80</b> and the ground terminal <b>52</b> for the mechanism apparatus <b>60</b> can be provided as a common ground terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The stage <b>68</b> of the mechanism apparatus <b>60</b> has the capability of holding or supporting the glass substrate <b>40</b> (i.e., measurement object). The shifting mechanism <b>66</b> operates to cause the glass substrate <b>40</b> mounted on the stage <b>68</b> to shift to an arbitrary position or in an arbitrary direction. The stage <b>68</b> is a flat plate table, having a metallic layer at least provided on a flat upper surface. The metallic layer of the stage <b>68</b> is connected to the base body <b>62</b> via a short and thick wire that allows the stage <b>68</b> to shift freely within a predetermined shift range. In other words, in consideration of the arrangement of the mechanism apparatus <b>60</b>, it is desirable to select an electric path having the lowest electric resistance to connect the stage <b>68</b> to the ground terminal <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The probe <b>72</b>, which is positioned over the stage <b>68</b> of the mechanism apparatus <b>60</b>, has the capability of inputting or outputting a measuring signal to or from the device <b>42</b> with probe needles contacting with measurement terminals of the device <b>42</b>. When the device <b>42</b> has a plurality of measurement terminals, the probe <b>72</b> should have a plurality of probe needles. The probe <b>72</b> is connected to a connecting terminal <b>81</b> of the measuring apparatus <b>80</b> via the signal cable <b>78</b>. The signal cable <b>78</b> has the connecting terminal <b>77</b> connected to the connecting terminal <b>81</b> of the measuring apparatus <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The signal cable <b>78</b> includes a core wire <b>74</b> transmitting a signal, and a shield braid <b>76</b> electromagnetically shielding the core wire <b>74</b>. The core wire <b>74</b> has one end connected to a probe needle of the probe <b>72</b> and the other end connected via a signal line of the connecting terminal <b>77</b> to the measuring portion <b>82</b> of the measuring apparatus <b>80</b>. The shield braid <b>76</b> is connected via a casing of the connecting terminal <b>77</b> to the casing body <b>84</b> of the measuring apparatus <b>80</b>. In other words, the shield braid <b>76</b> is connected to the ground terminal <b>54</b> via the casing body <b>84</b> of the measuring apparatus <b>80</b>. The reason why such an electric path is selected is because the casing body <b>84</b> of the measuring apparatus <b>80</b> is a large metallic casing and accordingly has an electric resistance lower than that of a conductive wire. However, when any other connecting means having a smaller electric resistance is available, the shield braid <b>76</b> can be directly connected to the ground terminal <b>54</b> or the ground terminal <b>52</b> without depending on the electric path including the casing body <b>84</b> of the measuring apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The shielding cover <b>70</b>, positioned over the stage <b>68</b> of the mechanism apparatus <b>60</b> and provided around the probe <b>72</b>, is an electromagnetic shielding plate having the capability of eliminating adverse effect of external noises during measurement for a micro signal of the measured device <b>42</b>. More specifically, the shielding cover <b>70</b> is substantially parallel to an upper surface of the stage <b>68</b>. The glass substrate <b>40</b> mounting the devices <b>42</b> thereon is disposed between the shielding cover <b>70</b> and the stage <b>68</b>. The shielding cover <b>70</b> is constructed from a metallic plate. A lower surface of the shielding cover <b>70</b> is spaced with a predetermined gap from the devices <b>42</b> on the glass substrate <b>40</b>, so that the shielding cover <b>70</b> is not brought into direct contact with the devices <b>42</b>. Alternatively, the shielding cover <b>70</b> can be constructed from a plate member that has a metallic layer provided on a surface opposing the upper surface of the stage <b>68</b>. A metallic portion of the metallic plate or the metallic layer is connected to the shield braid <b>76</b> of the signal cable <b>78</b>. Accordingly, the shielding cover <b>70</b> is connected via the casing body <b>84</b> of the measuring apparatus <b>80</b> to the ground terminal <b>54</b>. Moreover, the metallic portion may be connected directly to the ground terminal <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view showing the probe <b>72</b> and the vicinity thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged view showing a positional relationship between the probe <b>72</b> and the devices <b>42</b>, in which a broken line shows the shielding cover <b>70</b>. As is understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the device <b>42</b> has a plurality of measurement terminals <b>92</b>, and the probe <b>72</b> has corresponding probe needles <b>94</b>. According to an example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the measurement terminals <b>92</b> are shown as a terminal region, because they have smaller dimensions as compared with the main body of the device <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The probe needles <b>94</b> are attached to the main body of the probe <b>72</b> so that distal ends of the respective probe needles <b>94</b> can be brought into contact with the measurement terminals <b>92</b>. The probe needles <b>94</b> are conductive needles that are electrically isolated from each other. For example, the probe needles <b>94</b> can be constructed from a plurality of bent needles attached to the main body of the probe <b>72</b>. Furthermore, the probe needles <b>94</b> can be constructed from a plurality of looped wires having proximal ends embedded in the main body of the probe <b>72</b> and distal ends protruding from the main body of the probe <b>72</b> and configured into needles. As a practical example, a so-called probe card can be used as the probe <b>72</b> equipped with the probe needle <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A flexible substrate <b>90</b> is a flexible insulated substrate having a wiring pattern of a plurality of conductors formed thereon. The flexible substrate <b>90</b> has the capability of interconnecting signals between the probe <b>72</b> and the signal cable <b>78</b>. More specifically, the signal cable <b>78</b> includes a plurality of the core wires <b>74</b>, which are mutually isolated with appropriate insulating material. And the shield braid <b>76</b> of the signal cable, serving as an electromagnetic shielding member, entirely covers the core wires <b>74</b>. Furthermore, an insulating member is used as a sheath of the signal cable <b>78</b>. Thus, the signal cable <b>78</b> is heavy in weight and poor in flexibility. This is the reason why the flexible substrate <b>90</b> is provided between the probe <b>72</b> and the signal cable <b>78</b>. The flexible substrate <b>90</b> allows relatively free movement of the probe <b>72</b> that is brought into contact with the device <b>42</b> or removed from the device <b>42</b>. One end of each conductor pattern on the flexible substrate <b>90</b> is connected to a rear end of one of a plurality of probe needles <b>94</b>. The other end of each conductor pattern on the flexible substrate <b>90</b> is connected to one of a plurality of core wires <b>74</b> of the signal cable <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the devices <b>42</b> disposed in a matrix pattern on the glass substrate <b>40</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a relationship between the size of the shielding cover <b>70</b> and the size of the device <b>42</b>. Each device <b>42</b> has dimensions of L<b>1</b> (lateral direction)×L<b>2</b> (longitudinal direction). Mutually adjacent devices <b>42</b> are spaced with a clearance S<b>1</b> in the lateral direction and a clearance S<b>2</b> in the longitudinal direction. For example, the glass substrate <b>40</b> has dimensions of 1 m (lateral direction)×1.4 m (longitudinal direction). Each device <b>42</b> has dimensions of L<b>1</b>=50 mm and L<b>2</b>=40 mm. The clearances S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are 5 mm (i.e., S<b>1</b>=S<b>2</b>=5 mm). The device <b>42</b> having the above dimensions corresponds to a standard liquid crystal display applicable, for example, to a mobile phone. The thickness of the device <b>42</b> is generally represented by a patterning thickness. A practical value of the thickness is, for example, 3 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The shielding cover <b>70</b> of the probing apparatus <b>50</b> has the following functions.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">First, the relationship between the shielding cover <b>70</b> and the device <b>42</b> for enabling measurement of a micro signal is described. More specifically, the size of the shielding cover <b>70</b> preferable for measurement of the micro signal of the device <b>42</b> having the above-described dimensions and layout will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As described in the principle of the present invention, three kinds of noise give adverse effect to the micro signal measurement of the device <b>42</b>: noise coming from neighboring devices <b>42</b>; noise coming from a driving apparatus of the mechanism apparatus <b>60</b>; and ambient noise coming from above.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to the devices <b>42</b> having the above-described dimensions and thickness, the noise coming from neighboring devices <b>42</b> is sufficiently small as compared with the ambient noise and is accordingly negligible.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, the noise coming from the mechanism apparatus <b>60</b> can be sufficiently suppressed by securely connecting the stage <b>68</b> to the ground terminal <b>52</b>. Therefore, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the stage <b>68</b> is desirably connected via a short wire allowing a shifting movement of the stage <b>68</b> to the base body <b>62</b> connected to the ground terminal <b>52</b>. The ambient noise coming from above can be sufficiently suppressed by securely connecting the shielding cover <b>70</b> to the ground terminal <b>54</b>. In other words, the shielding cover <b>70</b> is desirably maintained at the ground potential.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As described above, the present embodiment is characterized by connecting the shielding cover <b>70</b> to the ground terminal <b>54</b> or to the ground terminal <b>52</b>, forming a shielding gap between parallel flat plates (i.e., between the shielding cover <b>70</b> and the stage <b>68</b>, which are both connected to the ground terminal), and disposing a measured device <b>42</b> in the shielding gap. The configuration of this embodiment enables elimination of an over-side spatial coupling with respect to the measured device <b>42</b> and suppressing adverse effects of the external noises during the micro signal measurement of the device <b>42</b>. In this case, the shielding cover <b>70</b> should have a sufficiently large size so as to be capable of entirely covering the measured device <b>42</b>. Because, an electric line of force is an arc line bending inward at an edge or peripheral opening of the shield structure consisting of parallel flat plates.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">To prevent the above drawbacks, the shielding cover <b>70</b> should have a wider width, as is known in relation to a micro strip line and a strip line. Preferably, the shielding cover <b>70</b> should have a grounded area whose width is approximately two times the width of each device.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a relationship between the size of the device <b>42</b> and the size of the shielding cover <b>70</b>. In a case where the shielding cover <b>70</b> has dimensions of L<b>3</b>×L<b>4</b>, minimum conditions that should be satisfied are L<b>3</b>=L<b>1</b> and L<b>4</b>=L<b>2</b>. In addition, as is known in relation to the micro strip line or the strip line, it is desirable to satisfy the conditions L<b>3</b>=2×L<b>1</b> and L<b>4</b>=2×L<b>2</b>. Furthermore, a positional relationship between the probe <b>72</b> and the shielding cover <b>70</b> should be optimized in consideration of the position of a measuring terminal of the device <b>42</b> so that the positional relationship shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can be realized. When the device <b>42</b> has a shape other than a rectangle, the shielding cover desirably has an opposing area that is preferably 4 times large for the area of a measured device on the insulated substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to the above-described example, the shielding cover <b>70</b> has a size of 100 mm×80 mm or more and the size is accordingly very small as compared with that of the glass substrate <b>40</b>. Therefore, the above-described embodiment enables probing of a micro signal from a device without using a large-scale shielding facility shielding the entire body of the probing apparatus <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As described above, the shielding cover has an area not smaller than the device and preferably 4 times that of the device. The shielding cover and the stage, which are both grounded, cooperatively form a shielding gap consisting of parallel flat plates. The device is disposed in the shielding gap. Thus, the above-described embodiment can suppress adverse effects of external noises during measurement of a micro signal performed for each device on a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Although the present invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiment. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all modifications, equivalent structures, and equivalent functions.
