<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A pressure sensor may convert an amount of pressure into an electrical value. For example, a pressure sensor may use a sensor diaphragm or membrane positioned parallel to a plane of a wafer to convert an amount of pressure into a capacitance value. Note that the overall size of the pressure sensor may be important. For example, the amount of space on a wafer that is occupied by a pressure sensor (referred to as the sensor's “footprint”) might make a device expensive to produce and/or make the sensor impractical for some applications. Thus, it may be important that a pressure sensor does not occupy too large of an area on a wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, increasing the sensitivity of a pressure sensor might require an increase in the sensor's footprint. Moreover, such a change could require that some parts of the sensor are completely re-designed (which can be a difficult and time-consuming process).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to some embodiments, an apparatus includes a substrate that defines a plane. The apparatus also includes a first conducting plate that is substantially normal to the substrate and a second conducting plate that is (i) substantially normal to the substrate and (ii) deformable in response to a pressure.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a capacitive pressure sensor <b>100</b>. The sensor <b>100</b> includes a pair of conducting plates <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> that are positioned substantially parallel to a horizontal plane that is defined by a non-conducting substrate <b>130</b> (e.g., a wafer). Note that in some cases, the plate <b>110</b> could formed as an integral part of the substrate <b>130</b>. One of these plates <b>120</b> is deformable in response to pressure (P). In particular, as shown in the side view of the sensor <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the plate <b>120</b> might be a thin film diaphragm that flexes such that the distance between the two plates <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> will decrease when a pressure P acting on the conducting plates <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Note that the capacitance C between the plates <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> depends in part on the distance between them. In particular, when the two plates <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> are electrically isolated from each other, it can be detected that the amount of capacitance C increases as the plates <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> move together. An increase in the pressure P, therefore, can be measured based on the increased capacitance C, since the increased pressure will push one plate <b>120</b> closer to the other plate <b>110</b>. Instead of capacitance, a resistance associated with a single deformable plate or diaphragm might be used to measure pressure. For example, one or more piezoreistors could be embedded in a diaphragm. In this case, the diaphragm itself might be formed of a non-conducting material.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The plates <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> used for the pressure sensor <b>100</b> sensor might be, for example, several hundred microns wide. Moreover, improving the sensitivity of the sensor <b>100</b> may require even larger plates <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>. The relatively large footprint associated with the sensor <b>100</b> might make the device expensive to produce and/or make the sensor <b>100</b> impractical for some applications. In addition, the large plates <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> could be damaged if too much pressure is applied (e.g., the flexible plate <b>120</b> could detach from a supporting structure).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram of an apparatus <b>300</b> according to some embodiments. The apparatus <b>300</b> may be, for example, a Microelectromechanical System (MEMS) device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As before, a first conducting plate <b>310</b> and a second conducting plate <b>320</b> are provided on a non-conducting substrate <b>330</b>. The plates <b>310</b>, <b>320</b> may be formed, for example, using silicon and the substrate may formed using oxide. As illustrated, the plates <b>310</b>, <b>320</b> are substantially normal to the substrate <b>330</b>. That is, the plates <b>310</b>, <b>320</b> extend vertically from a horizontal plane defined by the substrate <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At least one of the plates <b>310</b>, <b>320</b> is deformable in response to a pressure P. The deformable plate may, for example, flex in a direction substantially in the horizontal plane. Referring to the side view of the apparatus <b>300</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the second plate <b>320</b> may flex such that the distance between the two plates <b>310</b>, <b>320</b> will decrease when the pressure P is increased. Thus, when the two plates <b>310</b>, <b>320</b> are electrically isolated from each other, it can be detected that the capacitance C increases as the pressure P increases. Because the plates <b>310</b>, <b>320</b> extend vertically from the substrate <b>330</b>, the footprint of the apparatus <b>300</b> might be, for example, a few microns in width.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a sealed pressure sensor <b>500</b> according to some embodiments. A first conducting plate <b>510</b> and a second conducting plate <b>520</b> extend vertically from a horizontal plane defined by a substrate <b>530</b>. Note that, as illustrated, both plates <b>510</b>, <b>520</b> are deformable in response to pressure. This capability increases the change in capacitance, and therefore, improves the sensitivity of the sensor <b>500</b>. A cap <b>540</b> has been provided at an end of the plates <b>510</b>, <b>520</b> opposite from the substrate <b>530</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view of the sensor <b>500</b> including the substrate <b>530</b> and cap <b>540</b>. A back wall <b>550</b> and a front wall <b>560</b> (which is shown apart from the sensor <b>500</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> only for the purpose of illustration) are also provided so that a vacuum (V) can be created in the chamber between the two conducting plates <b>510</b>, <b>250</b> (this may also improve the sensitivity of the sensor <b>500</b>). With respect to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the cap <b>540</b> may be formed using a non-conducting material so that the plates are electrically isolated from each other. Note a reference pressure other than a vacuum might be provided in the chamber between the two conducting plates <b>510</b>, <b>520</b>. In this case, the side walls of the chamber may deflect inward. That is, the center of the side walls might flex toward the vacuum while the four edges of each side wall remain fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a side view of an apparatus <b>700</b> according to other embodiments. In this case, two pairs of conducting plates are provided, each pair enclosing a vacuum V therebetween. As used herein, the term “finger” will refer to such a pair of conducting plates (with or without a vacuum). Note that, in this embodiment, two plates within a finger may be electrically coupled to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to this embodiment, the first finger <b>710</b> is electrically isolated from the second finger <b>720</b>. When the ambient pressure increases, the plates on the fingers <b>710</b>, <b>720</b> deform inward. Thus, the capacitance C between one plate of the first finger and another plate of the second finger decreases. An imbalance between the ambient pressure and the pressure between the plates of each finger causes the plates of each finger to bow inwardly and thus away from the nearest plate of the adjacent finger, thereby causing the decrease in the capacitance C.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this way, the capacitance C can be used to sense pressure (e.g., with an increase in C representing a decrease in P). Note that, in this embodiment, air acts as the dielectric of the capacitor (unlike <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, where the vacuum acted as the dielectric). As a result, a change in temperature and/or humidity may also result in a change in the capacitance C. Therefore, in some applications a separate temperature and/or humidity sensor may be provided to account for this effect. Also note that any technique might be used to measure an amount of and/or a change in the capacitance C. For example, a change in capacitance might be converted into a voltage that can be measured and/or approaches using Alternating Current (AC) could be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a top view of a pressure sensor <b>800</b> with a vertical capacitor array according to some embodiments. In particular, the sensor <b>800</b> includes a first comb <b>810</b> with a conducting base and three fingers that extend away from the base (as well as vertically from a substrate not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The sensor <b>800</b> also has a second comb <b>820</b> with a conducting base and three fingers. The combs <b>810</b>, <b>820</b> are positioned such that the fingers of one are interleaved with the fingers of the other. Note that although each comb <b>810</b>, <b>820</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> has three fingers, any number of fingers may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first comb <b>810</b> is electrically isolated from the second comb <b>820</b>. Note that when the ambient pressure increases, the plates on all of the fingers will deform inwardly. Thus, the capacitance C between the fingers will decrease (e.g., because neighboring plates are pushed further apart). Also note that the five capacitance values C associated with this embodiment are connected in parallel. Therefore, the values will add to each other, improving the pressure sensitivity of the sensor <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a side view of the pressure sensor <b>800</b> according to this embodiment. Note that the combs may be provided on a non-conducting layer <b>920</b> (e.g., such that the two combs are electrically isolated from each other). Moreover, the non-conducting layer <b>920</b> may be bonded to another layer <b>910</b> to provide structural support. According to some embodiments, this supporting layer <b>910</b> is a glass wafer (e.g., to reduce parasitic capacitance effects). The support layer <b>910</b> could also be a lightly doped or intrinsic silicon wafer. Note that the characteristics of the pressure sensor <b>800</b> may depend in part on the geometry of the elements, such as the thickness height, and length of the plates as well as the gap between neighboring plates. By way of example only, the thickness of a conducting plate might be from 2 to 15 micrometers (μm), the height of a conducting plate might be from 100 to 500 μm, the gap between conducting plates might be from 2 to 20 μm, and the length of a conducting plate might be 1000 μm. The appropriate dimensions for a particular sensor might depend on, for example, the applications for which that sensor will be used.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thus, some embodiments provide a sensor that is sensitive to changes in pressure while occupying a relatively small area since the sensor is disposed in a vertical relationship to the wafer surface. Such an approach may provide a MEMS sensor that is scalable and inexpensive to produce (e.g., because new fingers may be added without any change in the fabrication process and with only a small increase in the sensor's footprint). Moreover, new pressure sensors may be easy to design by adding fingers as appropriate, and be less likely to be damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow chart of a method to measure pressure according to some embodiments a voltage is provided to one of a first conducting plate and a second conducting plate, the first conducting plate being substantially normal to a substrate defining a plane and the second conducting plate being (i) electrically isolated from the first conducting plate, (ii) substantially normal to the substrate, and (iii) deformable in response to pressure. The first conducting plate may be, for example, associated with a finger of a first comb while the second conducting plate is associated with a finger of a second comb that is electrically isolated from the first comb.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At Step <b>1004</b>, pressure is measured based at least in part on an amount of capacitance that is detected between the two plates. For example, a decrease in capacitance may indicate an increase in the absolute atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is flow chart of a method to create a pressure sensor according to some embodiments. Note that the actions described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may be performed in any order that is practical. At Step <b>1102</b>, a substrate of conducting silicon is provided. In some cases, a backing wafer is bonded to the substrate at Step <b>1104</b> to provide additional support.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At Step <b>1106</b>, vertical trenches are etched into the substrate using an appropriate etch mask. The etch mask may, for example, comprise a layer in which a pattern of oxide defines areas that will not be etched.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to some embodiments, a capping substrate is bonded to the etched structure at Step <b>1108</b>. Note that in this embodiment, the etched substrate and the capping substrate might not need to be electrically isolated from each other. At Step <b>1110</b>, a vacuum or other pressure level is created in a cavity formed by the etched structure and capping substrate. At Step <b>1112</b>, the capping substrate is etched as appropriate to create isolated figures with caps. If desired, a cap wafer may then be attached at Step <b>1114</b> to provide pressure and electrical feed-throughs or vias.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to another embodiment, after the vertical trenches are etched in the substrate at Step <b>1106</b>, a capping structure or wafer with an insulating layer is bonded to the etched structure at Step <b>1116</b>. That is, the capping wafer may be electrically isolated from the etched structure. At Step <b>1118</b>, a vacuum or other pressure level is created in a cavity formed by the etched structure and the capping wafer. At Step <b>1120</b>, the capping wafer is patterned as appropriate to provide pressure and electrical feed-throughs or vias.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">By way of example, consider the wafer <b>1200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The wafer <b>1200</b> may include a base layer <b>1210</b> of non-conducting material, such as an oxide layer. In some embodiments, the base layer <b>1210</b> is bonded onto a backing wafer <b>1240</b>, such as a layer of glass (or lightly doped silicon), that provides structural support for the wafer <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A conducting layer <b>1220</b> is provided on the base layer <b>1210</b>. The conducting layer <b>1220</b> may be, for example, a layer of highly-doped, single-crystal silicon. An etch mask layer <b>1230</b> (e.g., oxide) is then deposited on layer <b>1220</b> and patterned.. Note that the materials used to form these (and other) layers described herein might be selected based at least in part on thermal coefficients of expansion (e.g., to ensure that a device will operate correctly over a range of temperatures). Materials might also be selected in accordance with conductivity characteristics (e.g., to insure that device electrodes remain electrically isolated from each other).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The etch mask layer <b>1230</b> may then be used to etch substantially parallel trenches through the conducting layer <b>1220</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a top view of the wafer <b>1200</b> after the trenches have been etched (with the cross-hatched areas representing the trenches) according to some embodiments. The trenches define a series of substantially parallel, conducting plates. Moreover, the plates are substantially vertical to a horizontal plane defined by the wafer <b>1200</b>, and at least one of the plates is deformable in response to pressure. Note that pairs of plates, or fingers <b>1330</b>, are formed for both a first comb <b>1310</b> and a second comb <b>1320</b>. According to some embodiments, at least one pressure input cavity is also formed while the trenches are etched. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is side view of the wafer <b>1200</b> after trenches have been etched according to some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An additional non-conducting layer may then be bonded onto the wafer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is side view of the wafer <b>1200</b> after the non-conducting layer <b>1250</b> has been added according to some embodiments. This non-conducting layer <b>1250</b> may be an oxide capping structure. Note that vacuums V may now be provided between pairs of vertical plates. For example, some or all of the steps described herein might be performed within a vacuum to create the vacuums V.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A portion of the additional non-conducting layer <b>1250</b> may then be etched away. One potential etching material may include potassium hydroxide. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a side view of the wafer <b>1200</b> after a portion of the top non-conducting layer has been removed according to some embodiments. In particular, the non-conducting layer <b>1250</b> now includes caps over pairs of plates that were formed in the conducting layer <b>1220</b>, resulting a number of sealed fingers <b>1260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to some embodiments, a cap wafer is bonded onto the additional non-conducting layer <b>1250</b>. The cap wafer may include, for example, a ground via (e.g., a hole through which a ground wire may be routed to allow some fingers to be held at a ground voltage level), a voltage via (e.g., to allow some fingers to be at voltage level other than ground), and/or pressure vias.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The following illustrates various additional embodiments of the present invention. These do not constitute a definition of all possible embodiments, and those skilled in the art will understand that the present invention is applicable to many other embodiments. Further, although the following embodiments are briefly described for clarity, those skilled in the art will understand how to make any changes, if necessary, to the above-described apparatus and methods to accommodate these and other embodiments and applications.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Some embodiments have been described herein with respect to an absolute pressure sensor, but embodiments may be used in connection with a gauge or differential pressure sensor. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a differential pressure sensor <b>1700</b> according to some embodiments. As before, some fingers are deformable in response to a first pressure P<b>1</b>. In this case, however, channels are provided so that some or all of the fingers are deformable in response to a second pressure P<b>2</b>. As a result, a change in capacitance may be associated with a difference between the first and second pressures. Note that the vias through the substrate for electrical and pressure connection may be located in either the backing substrate <b>1740</b> or a capping substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">While embodiments have been described with respect to pressure sensors, note that any of the embodiments may be associated with a system that uses a pressure sensor. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a system <b>1800</b> according to some embodiments. The system <b>1800</b> includes a MEMS pressure sensor <b>1810</b> that operates in accordance with any of the embodiments described herein. For example, the MEMS pressure sensor <b>1810</b> might include a substrate that defines a horizontal plane, a first conducting plate substantially vertical to the substrate, and a second conducting plate substantially vertical to the substrate and deformable in response to a pressure (P).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Information from the MEMS pressure sensor <b>1810</b> is provided to a pressure dependent device <b>1820</b> (e.g., via an electrical signal). The pressure dependent device <b>1820</b> might be, for example, associated with a pressure display, an engine or automotive device (e.g., a tire pressure monitor), an ultrasonic transducer, a medical device (e.g., a blood pressure sensor), and/or a barometer.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, although some embodiments have been described with respect to the use of a capacitance value to sense an amount of pressure, embodiments might be associated with other types of displacement sensing techniques. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a pressure sensor <b>1900</b> constructed in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the invention. In this case, a plate <b>1910</b> or diaphragm is provided on a substrate <b>1920</b>. As illustrated, the plate <b>1910</b> extend vertically from a horizontal plane defined by the substrate <b>1920</b>. Moreover, the plate <b>1910</b> is deformable in response to a pressure P. The deformable plate <b>1910</b> may, for example, flex in a direction substantially in the horizontal plane. According to this embodiment, an amount of resistance R associated with the plate <b>1910</b> varies depending on an amount of stress (e.g., a portion of the plate <b>1910</b> may have piezoelectric and/or piezoresistance characteristics or devices having such characteristics may be embedded into or onto the plate <b>1910</b>). As a result, the resistance R may be measured and used to determine a corresponding amount of pressure P. Because the plate <b>1910</b> extends vertically from the substrate <b>1920</b>, the footprint of the sensor <b>1900</b> may be reduced as compared to traditional devices (e.g., having a diaphragm positioned horizontal to the substrate <b>1920</b>). Note that according to this embodiment, the substrate <b>1920</b> may or may not be conductive. Also note that the sensor <b>1900</b> may be constructed using any of the techniques described herein (e.g., by etching trenches into a substrate).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In addition, although particular layouts and manufacturing techniques have been described herein, embodiments may be associated with other layouts and/or manufacturing techniques. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a top view of a die <b>2000</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. In particular, trenches have been etched into the die <b>2000</b> to create a chamber <b>2030</b> that opens into the cavities of a number of fingers <b>2040</b> associated with a first comb <b>2020</b>. Similarly, another chamber <b>2032</b> opens into cavities of fingers <b>2042</b> associated with a second comb <b>2022</b>. A wall <b>2010</b> surrounding the two combs <b>2020</b>, <b>2022</b> may be provided so that a cap can be bonded to the die <b>2000</b>. Note that all of the etching illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> might be performed during a single process step.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a top view of the die of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> after an oxide cap has been placed on the die and portions of the oxide cap have been etched away according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The remaining portion of the layer of oxide <b>2100</b> is illustrated by cross-hatching. The oxide layer <b>2100</b> may include windows through which pressure can reach the chambers <b>2030</b>, <b>2032</b> and, eventually, the otherwise sealed cavities of the fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a perspective view of a cap wafer <b>2200</b> that might be used in connection with the die of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The cap wafer <b>2200</b> includes five vias through which internal portions of the sensor can be reached. In particular, one via is provided for a first pressure P<b>1</b> and two vias are provided for a second pressure P<b>2</b>. Moreover, two electrical vias <b>2202</b> may associated with opposite sides of a capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a perspective view of a pressure sensor package <b>2300</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. In particular, the cap wafer <b>2200</b> has been bonded onto the oxide layer <b>2100</b>. The cap wafer <b>2200</b> might be oriented, for example, such that the vias associated with pressure P<b>2</b> are aligned with the chambers <b>2030</b>, <b>2032</b>. A bottom cap <b>2310</b> might also be provided for the package <b>2300</b>. Pressure ports and electrical ports may be individually interchangeable between front and back side.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The present invention has been described in terms of several embodiments solely for the purpose of illustration.
