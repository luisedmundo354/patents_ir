<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to apparatus for driving fence posts and stakes into the ground and which is supported and transported by a motor driven vehicle. Such apparatus is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,796,747 which issued to applicant and the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. This apparatus incorporates a hydraulically actuated impact hammer or driver, and another form of post driver which uses a hydraulically actuated impact driver is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,117. In such post driving equipment or apparatus, it has been found desirable for the apparatus to be usable for driving long posts, such as eight foot posts of tubular steel as commonly used for a chain link fence and also for driving shorter posts such as five feet or six feet T-type fence posts or wood silt fence posts which commonly range between thirty-two and forty-two inches. It has also been found desirable for the apparatus to incorporate a vertical mast which may be adjusted vertically and which pivotally supports a generally horizontal boom having an outer end portion connected directly to the impact tool or driver so that the driver moves vertically directly with the boom.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">When the impact tool or driver is used for driving long posts into the ground and the driver is located above a person's head, it has been found desirable to control the maximum rate of downward movement of the boom and the impact driver so that the boom and impact driver do not fall freely in the event a post breaks or buckles. When a vehicle supporting the apparatus is transversing along a grade or hill, it is also desirable for the operator of the vehicle to have remote control over rotation of the mast and boom on the axis of the mast so that the suspended impact driver may be vertically aligned over the vertical post to be driven. As used herein, the term post includes posts and stakes of different lengths and different types, such as tubular metal posts, T-type fence posts and wood stakes as commonly used for installing silt fence,</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is directed to improved apparatus for driving a post into the ground and which provides all of the desirable features mentioned above. In addition, one embodiment of the invention provides for quickly attaching and detaching the post driving apparatus to a front end loader vehicle in place of a bucket or to a wheel supported vehicle having a three point hitch. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a fence post driver apparatus or unit includes a frame which supports a vertical mast for rotation on a vertical axis, and the mast is rotated by a double acting fluid or hydraulic cylinder connecting the frame to a radial arm on the mast. A generally horizontal boom is pivotally supported by an upper end portion of the mast for rotation on a horizontal axis, and an outer end portion of the boom supports an impact hammer or post driver connected directly to the boom through a universal joint.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A bottom end portion of the impact driver carries a tubular socket for receiving the upper end portion of a post to be driven into the ground. The boom is pivoted upwardly by a fluid actuated lift cylinder which connects the mast to a channel or bracket supporting the boom, and another fluid cylinder connects the boom to the mast and controls the maximum rate at which the boom and the impact driver pivot downwardly while the impact hammer is driving a post into the ground. Interchangeable rigid link members may be used to connect the universal joint to the impact driver according to the length of the post. In one embodiment, the frame is also provided with a quick attachment device for rigidly connecting the apparatus to the pivotal arms of a front end loader vehicle after the bucket has been removed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description, the accompanying drawings and the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a post driving unit or apparatus <b>10</b> constructed in accordance with the invention and which includes a frame <b>12</b> formed by a horizontal square tubular cross frame member <b>14</b> having end portions welded to a pair of horizontal base beams or members <b>16</b> and to a pair of vertical angle members <b>18</b> which are also rigidly connected by a horizontal angle member <b>22</b>. The frame <b>12</b> also includes a pair of vertical angle members <b>24</b> which are welded to the ends of the base members <b>16</b> and cooperate to form a rack for supporting a supply (not shown) of posts to be driven into the ground. The cross frame member <b>14</b> also supports a vertical cylindrical mast <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 &amp; 3</figref>) which projects into a cylindrical outer mast extension <b>28</b> supported on the mast <b>26</b> by a vertically adjustable annular collar <b>31</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) secured to the mast <b>26</b>. The mast extension <b>28</b> is free to rotate on the mast <b>26</b> and may be adjusted vertically by adjusting the collar <b>31</b> vertically. A horizontal arm <b>34</b> is welded to the mast extension <b>28</b> and is pivotally connected to the piston rod <b>38</b> of a double acting fluid or hydraulic cylinder <b>40</b> which is pivotally connected to an ear <b>42</b> welded to a frame member <b>18</b>. Actuation of the cylinder <b>40</b> is effective to rotate the mast extension <b>28</b> in opposite directions on the supporting mast <b>26</b> and on the collar <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A U-shaped bracket <b>44</b> is welded to the upper end of the mast extension <b>28</b> and receives a cross pin <b>46</b> which pivotally supports both a U-shaped support member or channel <b>48</b> and one end of an elongated tubular boom <b>50</b> which is received within and extends from the support channel <b>48</b>. A double acting fluid or hydraulic cylinder <b>52</b> is pivotally connected to a vertical tab or ear <b>53</b> welded to the mast extension <b>28</b> and has a piston rod <b>54</b> pivotally connected by a pin <b>56</b> to a tab or ear projecting downwardly from the boom support channel <b>48</b>. A single acting fluid or hydraulic cylinder <b>62</b> is pivotally connected by a cross pin <b>63</b> to an arm <b>64</b> welded to the mast extension <b>28</b> and has a piston rod <b>66</b> pivotally connected by a cross pin <b>68</b> to a tab or ear projecting downwardly from the boom <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The outer end portion of the boom <b>50</b> supports a universal coupling or joint <b>72</b> which is connected directly to a fluid or hydraulic actuated impact hammer or driver <b>75</b> by a connecting member <b>77</b>. One form of hydraulic impact hammer or driver <b>75</b> which has provided satisfactory results is manufactured and sold under the trademark FAIRMONT as a sign post driver, as disclosed in above mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,796,747. The impact driver <b>75</b> is provided with an open bottom tubular socket member <b>79</b> for receiving the upper end portion of a post <b>80</b> which is to be driven into the ground. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 &amp; 2</figref>, the post <b>80</b> is in the form of a tubular steel post which is commonly used for installing a chain link fence. Typically, the tubular post <b>80</b> has a length of eight feet and is driven two feet into the ground for supporting a six foot high chain link fence. The universal joint <b>72</b> and the direct connect member <b>77</b> support the depending impact driver <b>75</b> with a vertical axis at all times, and the member <b>77</b> may have any length depending upon the length of the post to be driven into the ground. For example, the connecting member <b>77</b> may provide for attaching the impact driver <b>75</b> directly to and adjacent the universal joint <b>72</b> or may be in the form of an elongated rod or link member, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 &amp; 2</figref>. The link member <b>77</b> is interchangeable with other link members having a different length so that the boom is substantially level or horizontal when a post is driven one-half of the desired depth into the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a quick connect coupling or attachment device or system <b>85</b> is secured to the frame <b>12</b> to provide for quickly attaching the post driving apparatus <b>10</b> to the forwardly projecting and pivotally supported arms of a front loader vehicle, for example, of the type sold under the registered trademark BOBCAT by the Bobcat Company in West Fargo, N. Dak. This vehicle is usually provided with a quick attachment device such as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,672,521, No. 5,098,252 and No. 5,562,397, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. The vehicle provides for a number of different attachments or equipment which can be carried and operated by the front end loader vehicle in place of a tiltable bucket. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the attachment device <b>85</b> includes a generally vertical plate <b>88</b> having opposite end flanges <b>89</b> and a horizontal and inclined upper flange <b>92</b> and a lower flange <b>93</b>. The lower flange <b>93</b> has horizontally spaced recesses or openings <b>94</b> for receiving retractable locking pins or wedges. The attachment system produced by the Bobcat Company is sold under the trademark BOBTACH and provides a convenient system for quickly attaching the post driving apparatus <b>10</b> to the front end of a BOBCAT vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The post driving unit or apparatus <b>10</b> may also be equipped for mounting the apparatus on a wheel supported vehicle or tractor having a three point hitch system. Commonly, the hitch system includes a pair of horizontally spaced lift arms <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and a single stabilizing upper arm <b>104</b>. For attaching the arms <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> to the apparatus <b>10</b>, a modified frame <b>12</b>′ replaces the attachment device <b>85</b> with a pair of spaced vertical angle members <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) which have horizontally aligned holes <b>108</b> for receiving a cross-pin (not shown) extending through an end portion of the stabilizing arm <b>104</b>. A pair of horizontally spaced tabs or ears <b>109</b> are welded to the frame member <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and have horizontally aligned holes for receiving opposing projecting pins which extend through swivel sockets on the end portions of the lift arms <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the single acting cylinder <b>62</b> receives hydraulic fluid through a line connected to a fluid reservoir <b>115</b> and having a one way check valve <b>117</b> and a needle valve <b>119</b> connected in parallel within the line. The post driving apparatus <b>10</b> is shown elevated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by the arms <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> to a level for driving a T-type metal fence post <b>80</b>′ into the ground with the post <b>80</b>′ normally having a length of five or six feet. The boom <b>50</b> is pivoted upwardly from its generally horizontal normal position by the hydraulic cylinder <b>52</b> and the support bracket or channel <b>48</b>. If the post <b>80</b>′ is to be driven into the ground, for example, about two feet, the boom <b>50</b> is pivoted upwardly until the universal joint <b>72</b> is about one foot above a horizontal reference plane extending through the axis of the pivot pin <b>46</b> for the boom <b>50</b>. Thus after the post is driven into the ground, the universal joint will be about one foot below the reference plane. As a result, horizontal movement of the hydraulically actuated impact driver <b>75</b> is minimized through the arcuate travel of the universal joint <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As the boom <b>50</b> is being pivoted upwardly by the cylinder <b>52</b>, hydraulic fluid flows freely from the reservoir <b>115</b> through the check valve <b>117</b> and into the cylinder <b>62</b> so that the cylinder <b>62</b> does not create any significant resistance to raising the boom. After the post <b>80</b>′ is positioned vertically at the location where it is to be driven into the ground and driver <b>75</b> is positioned so that the upper end portion of the post is received within the socket <b>79</b>, the cylinder <b>52</b> is actuated to retract its piston rod <b>54</b> and pivot the boom support bracket or channel <b>48</b> to a downwardly inclined position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The hydraulic impact hammer or driver <b>75</b> is then actuated to drive the post <b>80</b>′ into the ground with repeated impacts. The needle valve <b>119</b> is adjusted so that the boom <b>50</b> pivots downwardly at a controlled rate corresponding generally with the rate at which the post <b>80</b>′ is driven into the ground by the impact hammer or driver <b>75</b>. Thus in the event the post breaks or buckles, the boom <b>50</b> and the impact driver <b>75</b> move downwardly at a slow rate due to the resistance of the cylinder <b>62</b> and do not drop down quickly. This safety feature is especially desirable when driving a post having a substantial length, for example, eight feet, and the impact driver <b>75</b> is located considerably above the head of the operator while driving the post. When it is desired to drive another long post, the cylinder <b>52</b> is actuated to pivot the boom lifting channel <b>48</b> and the boom <b>50</b> upwardly to its starting position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and also to extend the piston rod <b>66</b> of the cylinder <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As mentioned above, another desirable feature of the apparatus <b>10</b> is the attachment device <b>85</b> which permits the apparatus to be quickly attached to a front loader vehicle such as a BOBCAT vehicle in place of the bucket or another attachment. As a result, the operator of the vehicle may always view the location of the impact driver <b>75</b> and operate the lift cylinder <b>52</b> and mast rotation cylinder <b>40</b> in order to locate the impact driver <b>75</b> directly over the vertical post positioned at the location where the post is to be driven into the ground. Also, the three point hitch system illustrated in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> permit the apparatus <b>10</b> to be quickly attached to the arms <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> projecting rearwardly from a tractor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As also mentioned above, the connector or link member <b>77</b> which directly supports the impact driver <b>75</b> in suspended relation, may be interchanged with other link members having different lengths according to the length of the post to be driven. This enables the boom <b>50</b> to operate through an optimum angle substantially equally above and below the horizontal reference plane extending through the pivot pin <b>46</b> and thereby minimizes horizontal movement of the impact driver <b>75</b> while driving a post into the ground. As also disclosed in applicant's above mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,796,747, the impact driver <b>75</b> may be connected to the universal joint <b>72</b> in close relation, and the vertical adjustment of the impact driver <b>75</b> may be obtained by telescopically raising and lowering the mast extension <b>28</b> on the mast <b>26</b>, for example, by adjusting the collar <b>31</b> vertically on the mast <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">While the form of post driving apparatus herein described constitutes a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to this precise form of apparatus, and that changes may be made therein without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
