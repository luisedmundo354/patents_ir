<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a two-way digital communication device and more specifically to a digital communication and identification device, method, and computer program using two-way radio-based technology to communicate with other digital communication devices and to show a list of other known digital communication devices that are available for communication.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Two-way radios have become popular communication tools where land-based telephone or other communication methods are not well-suited. These two-way radios generally allow users to communicate with each other over known radio frequencies within the radio range of the two-way radios. Early two-way radios systems relied on the voice of the user of the two-way radio to alert another two-way radio user. As improvements were made to these systems, other call notification methods became available such as providing an audible tone to a particular two-way radio user. In many instances, these notification methods are ineffective because the sender of the call notification does not receive notification of whether the recipient is within the communication range of the two-way radio.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there exists an unmet need in the art for a two-way radio that notifies the user when another two-way radio is within or outside the radio range of the two-way radio.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One object of the present invention is to provide a digital communication device for identifying and communicating with other digital communication devices within a communication range, the communication device including a transmitter configured to transmit a control signal and a voice signal, a receiver configured to receive the control signal and the voice signal, a user interface unit having a display area, and a computational unit configured to control the transmitter to periodically transmit identifying information as the control signal. The control signal is received as remote identifying information by the other digital communication devices within the communication range. Information corresponding to at least a portion of the remote identifying information is displayed on the display area of each of the digital communication devices receiving the control signal. For example, while the control information may include a serial number and a name, only a portion of the name may be displayed or only a locally stored nickname corresponding to the serial number may be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for identifying and communicating with digital communication devices within a communication range that includes transmitting identifying information as a control signal periodically, receiving the control signal as remote identifying information corresponding to the digital communication devices within the communication range; displaying information corresponding to at least a portion of the remote identifying information on a display area corresponding to the digital communication devices within the communication range, capturing a voice communication via a voice input device (e.g., a microphone) and transmitting the voice communication as a voice signal upon selection of a transmit button by a user; and receiving the voice signal and outputting the voice communication on a speaker upon reception.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a computer program for identifying and communicating with digital communication devices within a communication range that includes a first computer code for transmitting identifying information as a control signal periodically, a second computer code for receiving the control signal as remote identifying information corresponding to the digital communication devices within the communication range, a third computer code for displaying information corresponding to at least a portion of the remote identifying information on a display area corresponding to the digital communication devices within the communication range, a fourth computer code for capturing a voice communication via a voice input device (e.g., a microphone) and transmitting the voice communication as a voice signal upon selection of a transmit button by a user, and a fifth computer code for receiving the voice signal and outputting the voice communication on a speaker upon reception.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is an example of a digital communication device according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the digital communication device <b>100</b> includes an enclosure <b>102</b> having an antenna <b>118</b>, a user interface <b>104</b>, a microphone <b>106</b>, a speaker (not shown), and several controls (<b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>). The digital communication device <b>100</b> performs normal walkie-talkie operations using a digital radio signal in addition to identifying other communication devices within a communication range. For instance, antenna <b>118</b> is used to receive a digital radio signal that is output on a speaker. Also, transmit button <b>110</b> may be configured as a push-to-talk such that the voice of a user is received by a voice input device (e.g., a microphone) <b>106</b> and transmitted, using antenna <b>118</b>, as a digital radio signal while transmit button <b>110</b> is selected. Further, digital communication device <b>100</b> may operate in a free-for-all mode, an emergency mode, or a normal mode. In the free-for-all and emergency modes, the voice communication is transmitted as a digital radio signal, and received and output on all digital communication devices with a communication range. Digital communication device <b>100</b> may also configured to transmit a distress call signal to one or more digital communication devices within a communication range using a distress button (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Additionally, multi-purpose button <b>108</b> may be configured as a wheel to scroll the user interface <b>104</b> or to select one or more user interface <b>104</b> entries. For instance, multi-purpose button <b>108</b> may be configured to perform different operations for scrolling, single-clicking, double-clicking and triple-clicking the multi-purpose button <b>108</b>. Control buttons (<b>112</b>, <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>) provide additional operational functionality.

Additionally, user interface <b>104</b> may optionally be configured as a touch screen user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a block diagram of the digital communication device according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. The digital communication device <b>100</b> includes five major sub units (<b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>). Transmitter <b>142</b> is configured to transmit a digital radio control signal and a voice signal. The digital radio control signal and the voice signal may either be transmitted collectively as a single digital radio transmission or separately as multiple digital radio transmissions. Transmitter <b>142</b> may optionally be configured to transmit a digital radio non-verbal text signal. Receiver <b>144</b> is configured to receive the digital radio control and voice signals. Receiver <b>144</b> may optionally be configured to receive a digital radio non-verbal text signal. The digital communication device utilizes, but is not limited to, a 900 MHz digital radio frequency using spread spectrum (or other frequency hopping) technology to transmit and receive digital radio signals within a communication range of approximately 1 mile.

Computational unit <b>148</b> includes a CPU which may be implemented as any type of processor including commercially available microprocessors from companies such as Intel, AMD, Motorola, Hitachi, NEC, and Microchip.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The transmitter <b>142</b> performs communication with other digital communication devices using a “private, non-commercial network.” As used hereinafter, a “private, non-commercial network” is defined as a network where (1) the transmitter <b>142</b> is dedicated to home or office use and (2) a periodic fee is not paid to a commercial institution for the right to send messages. (The term, however, does not exclude paying a governmental fee for the right to transmit a message, if required.) In a preferred embodiment of the private, non-commercial network, the transmitter <b>142</b> transmits directly to other digital communication devices without utilizing fixed towers to re-transmit the digital radio transmissions. In an alternate embodiment of the private, non-commercial network, the transmitter <b>142</b> transmits to any compatible device including fixed towers within a communication range of the digital communication device <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> and described below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The computational unit <b>148</b> is configured to control the transmitter <b>142</b> to periodically transmit unique identifying information as a control signal to other digital communication devices within a communication range of the digital communication device <b>100</b>. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, several digital communication devices (<b>100</b><i>a</i>-<b>100</b><i>d</i>) are within the communication range <b>178</b> of digital communication device <b>100</b>, while several other digital communication devices (<b>100</b><i>e</i>-<b>100</b><i>g</i>) are outside this communication range <b>178</b>. The computation unit <b>148</b> for each of the digital communication devices (<b>100</b>-<b>100</b><i>g</i>) is configured to periodically transmit identifying information as a control signal. In this case, a control signal transmitted by the digital communication devices (<b>100</b><i>a</i>-<b>100</b><i>d</i>) within the communication range <b>178</b> will be periodically received by digital communication device <b>100</b>. Computation unit <b>148</b> is further configured to control the receiver <b>144</b> to receive these control signals and to control the user interface unit <b>146</b> to display the identifying information received. Identifying information includes at least a unique identifier that uniquely identifies each digital communication device and optionally includes a name or nickname. Status information corresponding to the current status of digital communication devices (<b>100</b>-<b>100</b><i>g</i>) may optionally be included as a part of the identifying information or transmitted separately with a STATUS message as a control signal. The status of the digital communication devices (<b>100</b>-<b>100</b><i>g</i>) may be set automatically by the digital communication devices (<b>100</b>-<b>100</b><i>g</i>) as an indication of a hardware state, or may be set manually by the user. A user may select a status from a selectable list of built-in states of the user interface <b>146</b>. The status may include, but is not limited to, “I'm Busy”, “I'm Sleepy”, “Do Not Disturb”, “I'm Day Dreaming”, and “Hardware Failure”. Storage unit <b>150</b> may include, but is not limited to, any type of storage medium including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, magneto-optical disks, ROMs, RAMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs, flash memory, magnetic or optical cards, or any other storage medium including a database. Storage unit <b>150</b> contains at least a WITHIN_RANGE_LIST <b>152</b> and configuration parameters <b>160</b>. Storage unit <b>150</b> may optionally contain BLOCK_LIST <b>154</b>, BUDDY_LIST <b>156</b> and GROUP_LIST <b>158</b>. Again, it is to be understood that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> illustrates just one of the many possible embodiments of the digital communication device and that numerous variations are possible without departing from the scope of the present invention. For instance, WITHIN_RANGE_LIST <b>152</b>, configuration parameters <b>160</b>, BLOCK_LIST <b>154</b>, BUDDY_LIST <b>156</b> and GROUP_LIST <b>158</b> may optionally be stored as tables in a database contained in storage unit <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, a block diagram of the digital communication device according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention is shown. In this embodiment, the digital communication device <b>103</b> includes, in addition to all of the elements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, eight additional units (<b>162</b>, <b>164</b>, <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>, <b>170</b>, <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> and <b>176</b>) and a CONTACT_LIST <b>177</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Voice processing unit <b>162</b> is configured to process voice communication captured via microphone <b>106</b>. For instance, voice processing unit <b>162</b> may be configured for voice recognition, such that the digital communication device is operated using voice commands. Voice processing unit <b>162</b> may also be configured to digitally store voice communication using storage unit <b>150</b> as a voice recording to be either output on a speaker (not shown) or transmitted at some time in the future. Further, voice processing unit <b>162</b> may be configured to work in conjunction with encryption/decryption unit <b>172</b> to provide an encoded secure transmission between two or more digital communication devices (<b>100</b><i>a</i>-<b>100</b><i>g</i>). In this configuration, encryption/decryption unit <b>172</b> encrypts a communication before the transmission by transmitter <b>142</b> and decrypts the communication upon reception by receiver <b>144</b>. Encryption/decryption unit <b>172</b> may be configured to utilized any standard encryption/decryption technology.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Video processing unit <b>164</b> is configured to process video that may be provided from camera <b>124</b>. For instance, video processing unit <b>164</b> may be configured to digitally store video as a multimedia recording using storage unit <b>150</b>, to be either displayed on user interface <b>104</b> or transmitted at some time in the future. Video processing unit <b>164</b> may also be configured to operate with transmitter <b>142</b> to transmit voice and video simultaneously upon selection of the transmit button <b>110</b> by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Digital communication device <b>103</b> may be equipped with the capability to geographically locate itself, for example, through a Global Positioning System (GPS) capability. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is an example of a radio-based technology that is used to provide an earth based position using orbiting space satellites. GPS receiver <b>168</b> receives radio frequency signals from radio-based transmitters (e.g., GPS satellites or ground stations). These radio frequency signals are used to calculate the current location of the digital communication device <b>103</b>. Compass <b>170</b> is configured to provide directional information to the digital communication device <b>103</b>. For instance, compass <b>170</b> may be configured as a traditional compass to display the current heading relative to magnetic North that the digital communication device <b>103</b> is facing on user interface <b>104</b>. Additionally, compass <b>170</b> may be used to compute a relative direction from the digital communication device <b>103</b> to another digital communication device (<b>100</b><i>a</i>-<b>100</b><i>g</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Other units include a clock <b>166</b>, a run-time engine <b>174</b>, and a security unit <b>176</b>. The clock <b>166</b> is configured to display the current time on user interface <b>104</b>. Run-time engine <b>174</b> is configured to execute a computer program that is written in, but not limited to, Java, C#, Basic, Assembler, C and C++ programming languages. Additional computer programs may be downloaded to expand the capability of the digital communication device <b>103</b>. For instance, a computer game program may be downloaded or preconfigured in the digital communication device <b>103</b>. Security unit <b>176</b> is configured to provide additional security features to the digital communication device <b>103</b>, such as password, voice and fingerprint authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Additionally, storage unit <b>150</b> is configured to maintain a list of contact information in CONTACT_LIST <b>177</b>. For instance, as is well known in the art, contact information may include a name, telephone number, fax number, and address. The contact information in CONTACT_LIST <b>177</b> may be displayed on user interface <b>104</b> or transmitted to another digital communication device (<b>100</b><i>a</i>-<b>100</b><i>g</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1E</figref> show several digital communication devices, <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c </i>and <b>100</b><i>d</i>, which are displayed on user interface <b>146</b> as a selectable collection of names, WARREN, MARK, EDWIN and CHUNG, respectively, on digital communication device <b>100</b>. Each of the digital communication devices (<b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c </i>and <b>100</b><i>d</i>) periodically transmit identifying information that is unique to the digital communication device as a digital control signal, such that digital communication device <b>100</b> can immediately determine which other digital communication devices (<b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c </i>and <b>100</b><i>d</i>) are within a communication range <b>178</b> by receiving identifying information from each of the other digital communication devices (<b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c </i>and <b>100</b><i>d</i>). Whether a digital communication device (<b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c </i>and <b>100</b><i>d</i>) is no longer within the communication range <b>178</b> can also be determined by the absence of periodic identifying information received from that communication device (<b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, <b>100</b><i>c </i>and <b>100</b><i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, an example of several digital communication devices illustrating a communication path across multiple communication ranges according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention is shown. In this alternate embodiment, the effective communication range is extended by utilizing other digital communication devices as a digital communication relay or router. As an example, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, digital communication device <b>100</b> has a communication range <b>180</b> that includes digital communication device <b>100</b><i>b</i>, but does not include digital communication device <b>100</b><i>c</i>. Digital communication device <b>100</b><i>b </i>is within communication ranges <b>180</b> and <b>182</b>. Accordingly, a communication path <b>184</b> is established from digital communication device <b>100</b> to digital communication device <b>100</b><i>b</i>. Digital communication device <b>100</b><i>b </i>acts as a relay or hop to establish a communication path <b>186</b> to digital communication device <b>100</b><i>c</i>. Thus, a control signal and/or voice signal may be transmitted from digital communication device <b>100</b> to digital communication device <b>100</b><i>c </i>using communication paths <b>184</b> and <b>186</b>. Thereby, the effective communication range is extended to the communication range of all digital communication devices (<b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b</i>) within the communication range <b>178</b> of digital communication device <b>100</b>. Any compatible device including fixed towers within the communication range <b>178</b> of digital communication device <b>100</b> may act as a relay.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Whether a digital communication device acts as a relay or utilizes a relay of another digital communication device to extend its effective communication range is configurable by the user. For instance, the relay capability or utilizing a relay may be disable or enabled by the user. Further, the relay capability may be limited to a subset of digital communication devices (<b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b</i>), such as only those users represented in the BUDDY_LIST. Also, the number of hops may be limited by the user. For instance, a digital communication device may be configured to utilize only one relay or hop to extend the effective range.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>, an example of several digital communication devices illustrating advertisers within a communication range according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention is shown. In this alternate embodiment, the receiver <b>144</b> is configured to receive advertisements from advertisers (<b>190</b><i>a </i>and <b>190</b><i>b</i>) within a communication range <b>178</b>. The advertisers (<b>190</b><i>a</i>-<b>190</b><i>c</i>) may operate on the same and/or an alternate digital radio frequency, and are configured to periodically transmit identifying information and/or advertisements as a control signal and/or voice signal. In this case, an advertisement transmitted by the advertisers (<b>190</b><i>a </i>and <b>190</b><i>b</i>) within the communication range <b>178</b> will be periodically received by digital communication device <b>100</b>. Computation unit <b>148</b> is further configured to control the receiver <b>144</b> to receive these advertisements, and to control the user interface unit <b>146</b> to display the advertisements received.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a flowchart illustrating the steps of sending an identification message to another digital communication device within a communication range according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. The computational unit <b>148</b> is configured to control transmitter <b>142</b> to periodically transmit an IDENTIFY message at Block <b>206</b>. The IDENTIFY message contains at least an identifier uniquely identifying the digital communication device from which the IDENTIFY message was sent. The IDENTIFY message may also contain a name arbitrarily assigned by a user of the digital communication device as a configuration parameter <b>160</b>. At Block <b>204</b>, the computation unit sets an internal timer to send a message in T<b>1</b> seconds. For instance, a default time T<b>1</b> of 1 second between IDENTIFY messages may be built into the digital communication device during manufacture or assigned by the user and stored as a configuration parameter <b>160</b>. The time T<b>1</b> between IDENTIFY messages may be changed either dynamically or automatically based on the network load.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a flowchart illustrating the steps of identifying another digital communication device within a communication range according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. The computational unit <b>148</b> is configured to control receiver <b>144</b> to wait for an IDENTIFY message and subsequently receive the IDENTIFY message at Blocks <b>224</b> and <b>226</b>. An IDENTIFY message includes at least a remote identifier (source_id) that uniquely identifies the transmitting digital communication device (<b>100</b><i>a</i>-<b>100</b><i>d</i>) from which the IDENTIFY message was sent. The IDENTIFY message may also include an arbitrary name assigned by the user of the transmitting digital communication device (<b>100</b><i>a</i>-<b>100</b><i>d</i>). WITHIN_RANGE_LIST <b>152</b> is read to determine if the transmitting digital communication device (<b>100</b><i>a</i>-<b>100</b><i>d</i>) has recently sent an IDENTIFY message (Blocks <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> and <b>234</b>), thereby indicating that the transmitting digital communication device (<b>100</b><i>a</i>-<b>100</b><i>d</i>) is within the communication range of the digital communication device <b>100</b>. If the transmitting digital communication device (<b>100</b><i>a</i>-<b>100</b><i>d</i>) has not recently transmitted an IDENTIFY message, then at least a timestamp and a remote identifier (source_id) that uniquely identifies the transmitting digital communication device (<b>100</b><i>a</i>-<b>100</b><i>d</i>) are added to the WITHIN_RANGE_LIST <b>152</b> at Block <b>236</b>. Otherwise, if the transmitting digital communication device (<b>100</b><i>a</i>-<b>100</b><i>d</i>) has recently transmitted an IDENTIFY message, then at least the timestamp is updated at Block <b>232</b>. The user may optionally be notified that an entry is added to the WITHIN_RANGE_LIST <b>152</b> at Block <b>236</b> by means of an audible signal, a visual indication, or a vibration. For instance, the current number of entries contained within the WITHIN_RANGE_LIST <b>152</b> may be visually indicated on user interface <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a flowchart illustrating the steps of removing the identification information of a digital communication device no longer within a communication range according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. The computational unit <b>148</b> is configured to periodically read the WITHIN_RANGE_LIST <b>152</b> to determine if any of the entries have not been updated by an IDENTIFY message recently, shown as steps <b>240</b>. At Block <b>244</b>, the computation unit sets an internal timer to continue in T<b>2</b> seconds. For instance, a default time T<b>2</b> of 30 seconds may be built into the digital communication device during manufacture or assigned by the user and stored as a configuration parameter <b>160</b>. At Block <b>246</b>, an entry from the WITHIN_RANGE_LIST <b>152</b> is read. At Logic Block <b>248</b>, it is determined if the timestamp for this entry has been updated within T<b>3</b> seconds. For instance, a default time T<b>3</b> of 60 seconds may be built into the digital communication device during manufacture or assigned by the user and stored as a configuration parameter <b>160</b>. If the timestamp has not been updated within T<b>3</b> seconds, then the entry is deleted from the WITHIN_RANGE_LIST <b>152</b> at Block <b>250</b>. The user may optionally be notified that an entry is deleted from the WITHIN_RANGE_LIST <b>152</b> at Block <b>250</b> by means of an audible signal, a visual indication, or a vibration. Processing continues and the next entry in the WITHIN_RANGE_LIST is read until the entire WITHIN_RANGE_LIST has been read (Blocks <b>246</b>, <b>248</b>, <b>250</b> and <b>262</b>). It is to be understood that other sleep times T<b>1</b>-T<b>3</b> are possible without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a flowchart illustrating the steps of sending a buddy invitation message to another digital communication device within a communication range according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. At Blocks <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>, the appropriate digital communication device to be added as a buddy is selected. At Block <b>308</b>, the user is optionally prompted to confirm that the correct digital communication device to be added as a buddy has been selected. At Logic Block <b>310</b>, the user confirmation is determined. If the user did not confirm the selection, then processing is ended as shown at Block <b>326</b>. Otherwise, computational unit <b>148</b> is configured to control transmitter <b>142</b> to transmit a BUDDY_INVITATION message at Block <b>312</b>. A BUDDY_INVITATION message includes at least the unique identifier (id) of digital communication device <b>100</b> and a remote identifier (target_id) that uniquely identifies the digital communication device (<b>100</b><i>a</i>-<b>100</b><i>d</i>) to be added as a buddy. The computational unit <b>148</b> is configured to control receiver <b>144</b> to wait for a response message and subsequently receive either a BUDDY_ACCEPT or BUDDY_DENY message as a response at Blocks <b>314</b> and <b>316</b>.
