<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention concerns a mounting assembly for a gas turbine engine on an aircraft, and also an aircraft including such an assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aeroplane engines normally take thrust out into the airframe in two ways. Firstly, via the engine core either into a pylon or via thrust struts to the rear mount plane. Secondly, via a thrust trunnion on the fan case perpendicular to the engine access. With traditional under wing arrangements loads are taken rearwards through the engine or strut to the wing. With engines mounted towards the rear of the aeroplane matters can be more problematic as there is less airframe to receive thrust from the engine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to the present invention there is provided a mounting assembly for mounting a gas turbine engine on an aircraft, the assembly being mounted to an air intake such that thrust loads from the engine are borne by the air intake.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A thrust link is preferably provided between the fan case of the engine and the air intake. The thrust link is preferably configured to permit limited relative movement between the engine fan case and air intake.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The thrust link may be arranged to permit thrust produced by the engine to be measured.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Two or more discrete thrust links are preferably provided connecting between the fan case of the engine and the air intake. The thrust links are preferably substantially equispaced around the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The thrust links may comprise a hydraulic piston and cylinder arrangement, with the cylinder mounted on either one of the engine fan case or air intake, and the free end of a piston rod mounted to the other of the engine fan case or air intake.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The piston rod may include a plurality of pivotally connected parts to permit relative pivotal movement thereof. The piston rod may be pivotally mounted to the piston and/or the other of the engine fan case or air intake.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an alternative arrangement, the thrust link extends circumferentially around the engine fan case and the air intake.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The thrust link may include elastic load spreaders. The thrust link may include a pair of elastic load spreaders with a member connected to either one of the engine fan case and air intake located between the load spreaders, and a member connected to the other of the engine fan case and air intake located on each side of the load spreaders, to provide a sandwich configuration. The load spreaders may comprise pieces of elastomer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The engine fan case and air intake may also be connected by a hinge, which hinge may be elastic. The hinge may extend circumferentially around the engine fan case and air intake.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention also provides an aircraft including one or more engine mounting assemblies according to any of the preceding nine paragraphs.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The air intake is preferably mounted to the airframe, and forms part of the main airframe structure.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> show an engine mounting assembly <b>10</b> mounting a gas turbine engine <b>11</b> on an aircraft. The assembly <b>10</b> mounts the fan case <b>12</b> of the engine to the air intake <b>14</b>. In this instance the air intake is mounted to the airframe structure <b>15</b> (shown cross hatched). The assembly <b>10</b> comprises four thrust links <b>16</b> circumferentially equispaced around the fan case <b>12</b> and intake <b>14</b>, such that only three of the links <b>16</b> can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Each link <b>16</b> comprises a double acting piston and cylinder arrangement <b>18</b> with a hydraulic cylinder <b>20</b> mounted on the intake <b>14</b>. The pistons are hydraulically interconnected so as to evenly distribute the thrust (or pressure) loads. A piston rod <b>22</b> is pivotally mounted to the intake with a spherical bearing <b>24</b>, and extends to a pivotal mounting <b>26</b> on the fan case <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows two of the double acting pistons <b>20</b> which are configured to hydraulically connect all ports marked ‘A’ together, and all ports marked ‘B’ together, in order to evenly distribute the applied thrust load and thus minimize any engine casing distortion.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The main thrust loads are reacted by the larger piston face area (port A side) with the lower reverse thrust loads reacted by the smaller piston face area on the side of port B, to minimize system pressures. In the event of system failure (leakage) the piston would be configured to contact bump stops to limit the axial engine movement.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An alternative would be to use a single acting piston with port A interconnected to react forward thrust loads, and bump stops to react the lower reverse thrust loads.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows part of a similar arrangement <b>29</b> but where the piston rod <b>28</b> is formed of a number, in this instance three, pivotally connected parts <b>30</b>. The assembly <b>10</b> can be used to measure thrust from the engine, and for instance a pressure transducer <b>31</b> could be connected in the circuit A.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In use, the thrust links <b>16</b> transmit axial loads from the engine to the intake <b>14</b> and hence into the airframe. The links <b>16</b> by virtue of the possible movement thereof compensate for movement and variations between the fan case <b>12</b> and intake <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an alternative engine mounting assembly <b>32</b> in the form of a circumferential elastic hinge arrangement. Circumferential extensions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> from respectively the fan case <b>12</b> and intake <b>14</b> converge and are connected by an elastic hinge <b>38</b>. A load spreading arrangement <b>40</b> is provided in the form of an inwardly facing channel <b>42</b> formed by part of the extension <b>36</b>, which channel <b>42</b> locates two rings <b>44</b> of elastomer. A circumferential rim <b>46</b> extending from the fan case <b>12</b> locates between the rings <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In use, the hinge <b>38</b> and load spreading arrangement <b>40</b> permit relative movement between the fan case <b>12</b> and intake <b>14</b> and variations of alignment therebetween. The hinge <b>38</b> transmits side, vertical and torque loads. The load spreading arrangement <b>40</b> transmits thrust loads from the engine. If required a measuring arrangement <b>48</b> can be provided including for instance a part extending between one of the rings <b>44</b> and a side of the channel <b>42</b> to measure the engine thrust.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a third engine mounting assembly <b>50</b>. In this instance an outwardly facing channel <b>52</b> is provided extending circumferentially around the forward end of the fan case <b>12</b>. Located in the channel <b>52</b> are two rings <b>54</b> of elastomer. An inwardly extending rim <b>56</b> on the intake <b>14</b> locates between the rings <b>54</b>. Respective compression or extension of the blocks <b>54</b> will permit limited relative movement or varied alignment between the fan case <b>12</b> and the intake <b>14</b>. In use, the assembly <b>50</b> will transfer thrust loads from the fan case <b>12</b> to the intake <b>14</b>. With such an arrangement it may well be that a separate torque link (not shown) will be provided on the fan case.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">There are thus described engine mounting assemblies which permit thrust from an engine to be transferred via the fan case to the air intake and onto the airframe. This permits engines to be mounted where there is little structure to provide support therefore. The thrust links help prevent any bending moments induced by the thrust loads distorting the core of the engine which would otherwise detrimentally affect performance. This is because the thrust is taken out by the links in an axial symmetric way. The assemblies also permit thrust produced by the engine to readily be measured.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For instance, where there are discrete thrust links, a different number of these could be provided. Whilst the arrangements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> have been described as continuous circumferential arrangements, such arrangements could be provided in a discrete equispaced number of arrangements as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. Other means could be used for spreading the load, such as a toroidal oil filled chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Whilst endeavoring in the foregoing specification to draw attention to those features of the invention believed to be of particular importance it should be understood that the Applicant claims protection in respect of any patent able feature or combination of features hereinbefore referred to and/or shown in the drawings whether or not particular emphasis has been placed thereon.</p>
