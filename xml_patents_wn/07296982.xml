<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an air supply device that is used as, for example, a supercharger for an engine or an air compressor for a fuel cell.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In fluid machinery, sliding portions are generally lubricated with oil in order to prevent seizing or abnormal wear or abrasion. Accordingly, a fluid discharged from the fluid machinery is somewhat mixed with the oil, and it is extremely difficult to remove the oil from the fluid. In view of this, use of bearings such as grease-filled ball bearings for the sliding portions has been suggested to perform lubrication only within the bearings for supply of a clean fluid (see, for example, Patent Document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Document 1: Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model Publication No. 62-59788 (pages 9 and 10, FIG. 1)</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Use of grease-filled bearings is not limited, to fluid machinery, and they are generally used in various fields including the field of autommotive vehicles, the field of medical machinery and the like. Such grease-filled bearings have two sealing materials disposed on respective sides thereof that prevent grease from being mixed with dust or moisture in an atmosphere. If a grease-filled bearing merely supports a rotational motion, grease filled inside would never leak outside the bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in a case of a scroll fluid machine in which an orbital scroll undergoes an orbiting motion relative to a stationary scroll to compress a fluid, the orbiting motion of the orbital scroll is performed with a certain fixed radius and, hence, a centrifugal force acts on bearings mounted on the orbital scroll. Because of this, such a phenomenon occurs that grease filled inside oozes out from an end surface of a sealing material and scatters outside.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, of a plurality of bearings located inside a compressor, some are subject to a pressure difference generated between opposite sides thereof, which sometimes promotes leakage of grease. If leakage of grease occurs, not only is reliability of these bearings reduced, but there is also a good chance that fluid discharged is mixed with the grease.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been developed to overcome the above-described disadvantages.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is accordingly an objective of the present invention to provide an air supply device capable of prolonging life of bearings mounted therein, enhancing reliability of the bearings, and supplying clean air without causing any leakage of grease from the bearings.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accomplishing the above objective, the air supply device according to the present invention includes a compression mechanism section having a stationary scroll and an orbital scroll held in engagement with each other, and a drive section for driving the compression mechanism section, wherein the compression mechanism section and the drive section have a common shaft, by way of which the orbital scroll is caused to undergo an orbiting motion with respect to the stationary scroll to thereby compress air sucked into the compression mechanism section. The air supply device also includes a plurality of rotation constraint members for preventing rotation of the orbital scroll about its own axis, but allowing the orbital scroll to orbit relative to the stationary scroll, a plurality of first grease-filled bearings for rotatably supporting the common shaft, a plurality of second grease-filled bearings for rotatably supporting the orbital scroll, and a plurality of third grease-filled bearings for rotatably supporting each of the rotation constraint members. Each of the second bearings has an outer ring, an inner ring, a plurality of rolling elements interposed between the outer and inner rings, and two sealing materials disposed on respective sides of the plurality of rolling elements. Each of the sealing materials has an inner end held in contact with the inner ring and an outer end held in contact with the outer ring.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, because the bearings employed in the air supply device are of a grease-filled type, no oil is needed for lubrication of sliding portions and, hence, air discharged from the air supply device is mixed with no oil mist, thereby making it possible to supply clean air. Further, because the inner ring and the outer ring of the bearings are assuredly sealed by the sealing materials, even if a centrifugal force acts on grease inside the bearings upon an orbiting motion of the orbital scroll with a fixed radius, scattering of the grease is avoided, thereby making it possible to prolong life of the bearings and enhance reliability of the bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Where each of the sealing materials for the second bearings has an inner bent portion that has been bent towards a low-pressure side from a high-pressure side, and the inner bent portion is held in contact with the inner ring, compressed high-pressure air is further prevented from leaking into a suction chamber via a central portion of the orbital scroll. As to the low-pressure side, even if a temperature or pressure inside the bearings increases during operation, leakage of the grease from inside to outside is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">If one of acrylic rubber, Teflon rubber and fluoro rubber is used for the sealing materials, hardening that may be caused by heat is reduced, thereby enabling a high-speed operation and an increase in an amount of supply air. In addition, an amount of leakage of grease can be further suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each of the rotation constraint members may include a crankpin having an insertion portion inserted into an associated one of the third bearings, wherein the insertion portion has a groove defined in a surface thereof so as to extend parallel to a longitudinal axis thereof. Alternatively, the orbital scroll or a casing may have a plurality of recesses defined therein into each of which one of the third bearings is press fitted, wherein each of the plurality of recesses has a groove defined in an inner surface thereof so as to extend parallel to a longitudinal axis of an associated one of the rotation constraint members. In such case, the groove comes to act as an air escape passageway when the rotation constraint members are assembled with the orbital scroll, thereby causing no closed spaces during assemblage and facilitating assemblage of the rotation constraint members.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">If a width and depth of the groove are both set to a value ranging from 0.1 mm to 1.0 mm, the insertion portion of the crankpin, or a recess into which the insertion portion is engaged, is not deformed by a load applied during operation, and at the same time the groove can satisfactorily achieve its function as an air escape groove.</p>

The orbital scroll <b>21</b> has an orbital scroll wrap <b>21</b>A unitarily formed with an end plate and having a predetermined height, while the stationary scroll <b>22</b> has a stationary scroll wrap <b>22</b>A unitarily formed with an end plate and having a predetermined height. The orbital scroll wrap <b>21</b>A and the stationary scroll wrap <b>22</b>A are positioned so as to engage each other.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A clearance is provided between a side surface of the orbital scroll wrap <b>21</b>A and that of the stationary scroll wrap <b>22</b>A so that they may not be brought into contact with each other. The orbital scroll wrap <b>21</b>A and the stationary scroll wrap <b>22</b>A are each provided at an end surface thereof with a tip seal <b>21</b>B or <b>22</b>B, respectively. Accordingly, the end surface of the orbital scroll wrap <b>21</b>A is held in contact with the stationary scroll <b>22</b> by way of the tip seal <b>21</b>B, while the end surface of the stationary scroll wrap <b>22</b>A is held in contact with the orbital scroll <b>21</b> by way of the tip seal <b>22</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The compression mechanism section <b>20</b> includes a casing <b>31</b> that is made up of a disc-shaped partition plate <b>31</b>A for sealingly partitioning another end of the motor frame <b>11</b> and one end of the compression mechanism section <b>20</b> from each other, and a cylindrical member <b>31</b>B for covering component parts accommodated in the casing <b>31</b>. The partition plate <b>31</b>A has a through-hole <b>33</b> defined therein at a central portion thereof, in which a second bearing <b>72</b> is received to rotatably support another end of the motor shaft <b>41</b>. The cylindrical member <b>31</b>B has a suction port <b>24</b> defined therein, through which air is introduced into the compression mechanism section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The discharge casing section <b>50</b> includes a discharge casing <b>51</b> that in turn includes a disc-shaped plate <b>51</b>A and a cylindrical member <b>51</b>B secured to or otherwise integrally formed with an outer peripheral portion of the plate <b>51</b>A. The plate <b>51</b>A is provided with a third bearing <b>73</b> secured thereto at a central portion thereof. An adapter <b>48</b> is secured to another end of the orbital shaft <b>42</b> and rotatably supported by the third bearing <b>73</b> with a center of the adapter <b>48</b> held in alignment with a rotational center of the motor shaft <b>41</b>. The plate <b>51</b>A has a discharge port <b>25</b> defined therein, through which air compressed by the compression mechanism section <b>20</b> is discharged.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Bearings <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> are first grease-filled bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The rotation constraint members <b>23</b> are operable to prevent the orbital scroll <b>21</b> from rotating about the orbital shaft <b>42</b>, but allow the orbital scroll <b>21</b> to orbit around a longitudinal axis of the motor shaft <b>41</b>. More specifically, each rotation constraint member <b>23</b> includes a crankpin <b>23</b>A interposed between the casing <b>31</b> and the orbital scroll <b>21</b>, and the crankpin <b>23</b>A is provided with bearings <b>23</b>B, <b>23</b>C that rotatably support opposite ends of the crankpin <b>23</b>A, respectively. A grease-filled ball bearing is preferably used as the bearings <b>23</b>B, <b>23</b>C, which are third grease-filled bearings. Plural (for example, three) crankpins <b>23</b>A are interposed between the partition plate <b>31</b>A and the orbital scroll <b>21</b>, and are equally spaced from the orbital shaft <b>42</b> and also from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A rotary shaft <b>40</b> is made up of the motor shaft <b>41</b> and the orbital shaft <b>42</b> unitarily formed with each other and both referred to above. The rotary shaft <b>40</b> is rotatably supported at one end thereof by the first bearing <b>71</b>, at an intermediate portion thereof by the second bearing <b>72</b>, and at another end thereof by the third bearing <b>73</b> via the adapter <b>48</b>. Because the motor shaft <b>41</b> is supported by the first bearing <b>71</b> and the second bearing <b>72</b> and because the orbital shaft <b>42</b> is supported by the second bearing <b>72</b> and the third bearing <b>73</b>, both the motor shaft <b>41</b> and the orbital shaft <b>42</b> are of a construction supported at opposite ends thereof. The rotary shaft <b>40</b> is crank-shaped; that is, the orbital shaft <b>42</b> is eccentric with respect to the motor shaft <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The orbital shaft <b>42</b> is provided with two bearings <b>74</b>, <b>75</b> mounted thereon, by which the orbital scroll <b>21</b> is rotatably supported. The bearing <b>74</b> is located on a root side of the orbital scroll wrap <b>21</b>A, while the bearing <b>75</b> is located on a distal end side of the orbital scroll wrap <b>21</b>A. Bearings <b>74</b> and <b>75</b> are second grease-filled bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The orbital shaft <b>42</b> is also provided with a pre-loading spring <b>44</b> interposed between a balance weight <b>47</b> and the bearing <b>75</b> under a condition in which a compression load is applied thereto. Accordingly, the pre-loading spring <b>44</b> presses an inner ring of the bearing <b>75</b> towards the drive section <b>10</b>, and a load applied to the inner ring is transmitted to an outer ring of the bearing <b>75</b> via balls, thereby pressing the orbital scroll <b>21</b> towards the drive section <b>10</b>. A load applied to the orbital scroll <b>21</b> is received by the crankpins <b>23</b>A to prevent the orbital scroll <b>21</b> from overturning during a low-speed operation, thereby suppressing vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The orbital shaft <b>42</b> is provided with a shaft seal <b>45</b> juxtaposed with the bearing <b>75</b> at a location between the bearing <b>74</b> and the bearing <b>75</b>. The shaft seal <b>45</b> is intended to prevent compressed air from leaking to a side of the bearing <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the air supply device of the above-described construction, where clean air is required, lubrication of sliding portions is of great importance. Use of an oil is advantageous for the lubrication, but air discharged from the air supply device comes to contain an oil mist. Accordingly, a filter is needed to remove such oil mist. Further, because the oil is gradually discharged, periodical oil feed must be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In view of the above, the air supply device according to the present invention employs grease-filled bearings as the first bearing <b>71</b>, the second bearing <b>72</b>, the third bearing <b>73</b>, the bearings <b>74</b>, <b>75</b> and the bearings <b>23</b>B, <b>23</b>C. Use of such bearings confines the sliding portions to only inside the bearings, which is lubricated by grease, thereby making it possible to supply clean air.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A case where ball bearings are employed as the bearings referred to above is discussed hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view taken along a longitudinal axis of the orbital scroll <b>21</b>, and as shown therein, the orbital scroll <b>21</b> is provided with two bearings <b>74</b>, <b>75</b> mounted on the orbital shaft <b>42</b>, and a plurality of bearings <b>23</b>B each constituting a rotation constraint member <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts one of the bearings <b>74</b>, <b>75</b>, <b>23</b>B referred to above, and an internal construction of the bearing, generally identified by <b>80</b>, is explained hereinafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The bearing <b>80</b> is internally filled with grease, on which a centrifugal force acts during operation, which in turn acts to render the grease to leak outside the bearing <b>80</b>. In particular, in applications where a clearance is present between sealing materials <b>81</b>, mounted on respective sides of a plurality of rolling elements <b>84</b> of the bearing <b>80</b>, and an inner ring <b>82</b> or an outer ring <b>83</b> of the bearing <b>80</b>, the grease scatters outside, resulting in a reduction in life of the bearing <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In practice of the present invention, each sealing material <b>81</b> mounted in the bearing <b>80</b> has a generally L-shaped section taken along an axial center of the bearing <b>80</b>, and also has inner and outer ends held in contact with the inner ring <b>82</b> and the outer ring <b>83</b> of the bearing <b>80</b>, respectively. When the sealing material <b>81</b> is held in contact with the inner ring <b>82</b> and the outer ring <b>83</b> of the bearing <b>80</b>, an interior and exterior of the bearing <b>80</b> are partitioned without any gap and, hence, even if a centrifugal force acts on grease inside the bearing <b>80</b>, leakage of the grease is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As can be seen from the general construction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the air supply device according to the present invention, compressed high-pressure air is present around the distal end portion of the orbital scroll <b>21</b>, while intake air of atmospheric pressure is present around the end plate of the orbital scroll <b>21</b>. The high-pressure air flows towards the discharge casing section <b>50</b> and is then discharged outside via the discharge port <b>25</b>. However, part of the high-pressure air flows towards the end plate from the distal end portion after passing through a central portion of the orbital scroll <b>21</b>. In order to prevent leakage of such high-pressure air, the shaft seal <b>45</b> is provided inside the orbital scroll <b>21</b> at a central portion thereof. However, use of the shaft seal <b>45</b> generally requires additional power because the shaft seal <b>45</b> is held in strong contact with the orbital shaft <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In practice of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a sealing material <b>81</b>A intended for external pressure may be used as a high-pressure side sealing material of the bearing <b>80</b>, while a sealing material <b>81</b>B intended for internal pressure may be used as a low-pressure side sealing material of the bearing <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">More specifically, the sealing material <b>81</b>A facing high-pressure air has bent portions formed at inner and outer end portions thereof, which bent portions have been bent towards the low-pressure side so that an end of an inner bent portion may be brought into closer contact with the inner ring <b>82</b> as atmospheric pressure increases. On the other hand, the sealing material <b>81</b>B facing low-pressure air has an inner bent portion that has been bent towards the low-pressure side, contrary to an outer bent portion, so that an end of the inner bent portion may be brought into closer contact with the inner ring <b>82</b> as internal pressure of the bearing <b>80</b> increases.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Because this construction plays a role of the shaft seal <b>45</b>, the shaft seal <b>45</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be removed to eliminate a requirement of additional power, thereby making it possible to increase efficiency. Also, sealing properties increase with an increase in pressure and, hence, leakage of grease within the bearing can be considerably reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the sealing material <b>81</b> is positively brought into contact with the inner ring <b>82</b> to enhance sealing properties, heat is inevitably generated, which in turn reduces life of the sealing material <b>81</b>. Because the sealing material <b>81</b> becomes hard depending on a temperature, it is important to select rubber having a high heat resistance. Accordingly, acrylic rubber, Teflon rubber or fluoro rubber is preferably used for the sealing material <b>81</b>. Although heat resistance increases in the order of acrylic rubber, Teflon rubber and fluoro rubber, it is preferred that a maximum speed be set as one standard for selection.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In applications where all seals mounted in the orbiting scroll <b>21</b> are of a contact type, a difficulty is encountered in assembling rotation constraint member <b>23</b>. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the bearing <b>23</b>B forming a rotation constraint member <b>23</b> is press fitted into a recess formed in a rear surface of the end plate of the orbital scroll <b>21</b>, while the bearing <b>23</b>C similarly forming another rotation constraint member <b>23</b> is press fitted into a recess formed in the partition plate <b>31</b>A and, hence, a rear surface of each bearing <b>23</b>B, <b>23</b>C does not communicate with the outside. If a contact type bearing is employed in the air supply device according to the present invention, air is confined to the inside when the crankpin <b>23</b>A is engaged in the bearing, and an escape port is accordingly needed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In practice of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the crankpin <b>23</b>A has two shafts formed on respective sides thereof for insertion into respective bearings, and each shaft has a groove <b>23</b>L defined in a surface thereof so as to extend parallel to a longitudinal axis thereof. By this construction, when a shaft of the crankpin <b>23</b>A is inserted into an associated bearing, air confined by these members is discharged outside through the groove <b>23</b>L, thus facilitating assemblage of rotation constraint member <b>23</b>. Also, because a space delimited by the shaft of the crankpin <b>23</b>A and the bearing communicates always with outside air, and pressure in the former and pressure of the latter are equalized, even if a temperature change occurs upon operation or stoppage of the air supply device, a pressure change of air confined by the bearing <b>23</b>B and the crankpin <b>23</b>A is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In place of air escape groove <b>23</b>L formed in the shaft (insertion portion) of the crankpin <b>23</b>A, an engagement recess <b>21</b>H formed in the end plate of the orbital scroll <b>21</b> for insertion of the bearing <b>23</b>B thereinto may have a groove <b>21</b>L formed in an inner surface thereof so as to extend parallel to a longitudinal axis of a shaft of the crankpin <b>23</b>A, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, or an engagement recess formed in the casing <b>31</b> (partition plate <b>31</b>A) may similarly have a groove formed in an inner surface thereof so as to extend parallel to the longitudinal axis of the shaft of the crankpin <b>23</b>A. By this construction, air so confined is discharged outside through the groove <b>21</b>L, thus facilitating assemblage of rotation constraint member <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It is preferred that air escape groove <b>21</b>L, <b>23</b>L has a width and a depth both in a range of 0.1 mm to 1.0 mm. If the groove is too large (if the width or depth of the groove exceeds 1.0 mm), there is a possibility that the crankpin <b>23</b>A, the engaging portion <b>21</b>H of the orbital scroll <b>21</b>, or an engaging portion of the casing <b>31</b> is reduced in strength and cannot withstand a load during operation, though such a groove is preferable as an air escape groove. In contrast, if the groove is too small (if the width or depth of the groove is less than 0.1 mm), there is a possibility that the groove cannot achieve a sufficient function as an air escape groove. Accordingly, by setting the width and depth of the air escape groove <b>21</b>L, <b>23</b>L in the range referred to above, it is possible to ensure strength of the crankpin <b>23</b>A, engaging portion <b>21</b>H of the orbital scroll <b>21</b> or the engaging portion of the casing <b>31</b>, and a function as an air escape groove at the same time.</p>
