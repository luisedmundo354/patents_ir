<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention relates to a transmission apparatus (<b>15</b>) including at least one of a dividing unit (<b>6</b>) and a differential planetary gear unit (<b>30</b>), and a joint unit (<b>20</b>). A rotational power, which has been input to the transmission apparatus (<b>15</b>), is transmitted to the joint unit (<b>20</b>) via the dividing unit (<b>6</b>) or the differential planetary gear unit (<b>30</b>). A rotational power to be input to the joint unit (<b>20</b>) is smaller than the rotational power which has been input to the transmission apparatus (<b>15</b>), and the joint unit comprises a fluid coupling.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a transmission apparatus having a dividing unit to which a rotational power from a drive unit is transmitted, a joint unit, and a first differential planetary gear unit, and specifically to a transmission apparatus used to rotate a fluid machinery such as a turbo machinery by a drive unit such as a motor for synchronizing a drive side and a driven side with each other, relieving an impact that occurs at starting/stopping or at changing in a rotational speed, and achieving an efficient transmission of a rotational power.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In a conventional apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, an output shaft C<b>4</b> of an electric motor A<b>1</b> serving as a drive source is connected to an input side of a driven unit A<b>2</b> such as a fluid machinery via a joint A<b>22</b> and an output shaft C<b>7</b>. In this case, transmission of a rotational power from the electric motor A<b>1</b> is limited to a range in which the joint A<b>22</b> can transmit the rotational power.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">At the same time, there is a need to transmit a rotational power beyond the range in which the joint A<b>22</b> can transmit the rotational power.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to meet such a need, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref>, there has been proposed a transmission apparatus A<b>15</b> which distributes or divides a rotational power that is input from a drive source A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the transmission apparatus A<b>15</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref>, the rotational power from the drive source A<b>1</b> is distributed to a power line R<b>1</b> and a power line R<b>2</b> by a dividing unit <b>6</b>, so that the rotational power below the transmission limit of a continuously variable transmission A <b>20</b> is distributed to the power line R<b>1</b> and the residual rotational power is distributed to the power line R<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The rotational powers divided by the dividing unit <b>6</b> are converged by a differential planetary gear unit A<b>30</b> disposed at an output side of the continuously variable transmission A<b>20</b>, so that the converged rotational power is transmitted to a driven unit A<b>2</b> via a single output shaft <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">With this structure, the rotational power beyond the transmission limit of the continuously variable transmission A<b>20</b> can be transmitted to the driven side.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the continuously variable transmission A<b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A and 23B</figref> employs a mechanism of a toroidal-type continuously variable transmission (CVT). Since the toroidal-type CVT is of a contact type, there are limits to a maximum transmission power and a service life. Therefore, it is difficult to apply the toroidal-type CVT to a large equipment which is required to transmit a large power, and to an industrial machinery which is required to have a reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, various kinds of vibrations and impacts, such as pulsation due to power fluctuation, shock vibration at speed change, and torsion vibration of the output shaft, are transmitted or occur to an output side of the toroidal-type CVT. Accordingly, the toroidal-type CVT, which utilizes solid friction, is problematic in output fluctuation and durability because of such vibrations and impacts.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, another type of conventional transmission apparatus has the same problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention has been made in view of the above drawbacks. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a transmission apparatus which can efficiently transmit a rotational power beyond a transmission limit of a joint unit, and can absorb various kinds of vibrations and impacts, such as pulsation, shock vibration at speed change, and torsion vibration of an output shaft, for thereby enabling an increase in service life and power transmission limit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A transmission apparatus according to the present invention comprises: at least one of a dividing unit (<b>6</b>) and a differential planetary gear unit (<b>30</b>); and a joint unit (<b>20</b>); wherein a rotational power to be transmitted via the joint unit (<b>20</b>) is smaller than a rotational power (i.e., a rotational power of a drive unit) which has been input to the transmission apparatus, and the joint unit (<b>20</b>) comprises a fluid coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the transmission apparatus according to the present invention, the rotational power which has been input to the transmission apparatus is transmitted to the dividing unit (<b>6</b>) via a single input shaft and is output to two rotating shafts, one of the two rotating shafts is connected to one of two input shafts of the differential planetary gear unit (<b>30</b>), and the other of the two rotating shafts is connected to the other of the two input shafts of the differential planetary gear unit (<b>30</b>) via the fluid coupling (<b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A through 24D</figref> schematically illustrate the manner in which a power is transmitted from a drive unit A<b>1</b> to a driven unit A<b>2</b>. For, example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>, a power P from the drive unit A<b>1</b> is divided by a dividing unit (distribution gears) <b>6</b>. A power P<b>1</b>, which is one of the divided powers, is transmitted to a differential planetary gear unit A<b>30</b> via a power line R<b>1</b>. A power P<b>2</b>, which is the other of the divided powers, is transmitted to the differential planetary gear unit A<b>30</b> via a continuously variable transmission A<b>20</b> and a power line R<b>2</b>. The power P<b>1</b> and the power P<b>2</b> are joined together again in the differential planetary gear unit A<b>30</b> and then transmitted to the driven unit A<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A and 24B</figref> illustrate the manner of power distribution, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24C and 24D</figref> illustrate the manner of power circulation. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A through 24D</figref>, magnitude of the power flow due to action of the differential planetary gear unit A<b>30</b> is expressed by a width of a white arrow. The power distribution means the manner in which the power from the input side is divided by the distribution gears and the divided powers are transmitted through two paths and then joined together by the differential planetary gear to flow into the output side. The power transmitted through one of two distribution shafts is larger than the power transmitted through the other of the distribution shafts. On the other hand, the power circulation means the manner in which the power from the input side flows only into one of the distribution gears and flows into the output side via the differential planetary gear (hereinafter, a shaft through which the power is transmitted will be referred to as a shaft A). Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24C and 24D</figref>, there exists a power flow circulating in the order of the differential planetary gear→the distribution gears→the continuously variable transmission→the differential planetary gear. In this case, the powers flowing through the shaft A are joined together and the joined power becomes larger than the input power. The power flowing through the other shaft becomes small and its flow direction is reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24B and 24C</figref> schematically illustrate the power transmission manner of the present invention. The magnitude of the power flow of the power line R<b>2</b> passing through the continuously variable transmission A<b>20</b> is smaller than the input power.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Specifically, “the rotational power to be transmitted via the joint unit (<b>20</b>) is smaller than the rotational power which has been input to the transmission apparatus”, which is an essential element of the present invention, means the manner in which the magnitude of the power flow of the power line R<b>2</b> passing through the continuously variable transmission A<b>20</b> is smaller than the input power, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24B and 24C</figref>. The present invention uses a fluid coupling as the continuously variable transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is preferable that the fluid coupling comprises a variable-speed fluid coupling. According to the transmission apparatus of the present invention having such a structure, the rotational power beyond the transmission limit of the joint unit is not input to the joint unit, and hence the rotational power can be transmitted efficiently. Further, the fluid coupling can absorb various kinds of vibrations and impacts, such as pulsation of the input rotational power, shock due to speed change, and torsion vibration of the shaft, thus enabling a smooth transmission of the power.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the transmission apparatus according to the present invention, the rotational power which has been input to the transmission apparatus is transmitted to the dividing unit (<b>6</b>) via a single input shaft (<b>15</b><i>a</i>) and is output to two rotating shafts (<b>4</b>, <b>9</b>), one (<b>9</b>) of the two rotating shafts (<b>4</b>, <b>9</b>) is connected to one (<b>13</b>) of two input shafts (<b>13</b>, <b>5</b>) of the differential planetary gear unit (<b>30</b>), and the other (<b>4</b>) of the two rotating shafts (<b>4</b>, <b>9</b>) is connected to the other (<b>5</b>) of the two input shafts (<b>13</b>, <b>5</b>) of the differential planetary gear unit (<b>30</b>) via the fluid coupling (<b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">With such a structure, even if the power, which is input to the transmission apparatus, exceeds the transmission limit of the joint unit, the input power is divided into two by the dividing unit, so that one of the divided powers, which is below the transmission limit, is distributed to the fluid coupling and the other is directly distributed to the differential planetary gear unit. Accordingly, the transmission apparatus can transmit the power that is beyond the transmission limit of the fluid coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the transmission apparatus according to the present invention, the rotational power which has been input to the transmission apparatus is transmitted to the differential planetary gear unit (<b>30</b>B) via a single input shaft (<b>15</b><i>b</i>) (of the dividing unit) and is transmitted to two output shafts (<b>13</b><i>b</i>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>) of the differential planetary gear unit (<b>30</b>B), one (a direct-coupling shaft <b>13</b><i>b</i>) of the two output shafts of the differential planetary gear unit (<b>30</b>B) is connected to one (<b>9</b><i>b</i>) of two input shafts of a converging unit (<b>6</b>B), and the other (<b>4</b><i>b</i>) of the two output shafts of the differential planetary gear unit (<b>30</b>B) is connected to the other (<b>37</b><i>b</i>) of the two input shafts of the converging unit (<b>6</b>B) via the fluid coupling (<b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the transmission apparatus of the present invention having such a structure, the input power is divided into two by the differential planetary gear unit, so that one of the divided powers, which is below the transmission limit, is distributed to the fluid coupling and the other is directly distributed to the dividing unit. Accordingly, the transmission apparatus can transmit the power that is beyond the transmission limit of the fluid coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is preferable that a gear unit (<b>52</b><i>d</i>, <b>53</b><i>d</i>) having a speed-increasing gear and a speed-decreasing gear is provided on at least one of an input shaft (<b>9</b>, <b>5</b>) and an output shaft (<b>37</b><i>d</i>) of the differential planetary gear unit.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With such a structure, while keeping a rotational speed or a torque that is input to the transmission apparatus constant, the rotational speed or the torque that is output to the driven unit can be freely adjusted to an efficient value.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A transmission apparatus according to the present invention comprises: a dividing unit to which a rotational power from a drive unit is transmitted; a joint unit; and a first differential planetary gear unit; wherein one rotational power to be transmitted via the joint unit is smaller than the other rotational power, and the joint unit comprises an electric motor and a second differential planetary gear unit.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A transmission apparatus according to the present invention comprises: at least one of a dividing unit and a first differential planetary gear unit; and a joint unit; wherein a rotational power from a drive unit is divided into at least two rotational powers by the dividing unit or the first differential planetary gear unit, one of the rotational powers is input to the joint unit, the rotational power to be input to the joint unit is smaller than the other of the rotational powers, and the joint unit comprises an electric motor and a second differential planetary gear unit.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the transmission apparatus according to the present invention, the rotational power from the drive unit is transmitted to the dividing unit via a single input shaft of the dividing unit and is output from the dividing unit to two rotating shafts, one of the two rotating shafts is connected to one of two input shafts of the first differential planetary gear unit, and the other of the two rotating shafts is connected to the other of the two input shafts of the first differential planetary gear unit.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the transmission apparatus according to the present invention, the rotational power from the drive unit is transmitted to a single input shaft of the first differential planetary gear unit, one of two output shafts of the first differential planetary gear unit is connected to one of two input shafts of a converging unit, and the other of the two output shafts of the first differential planetary gear unit is connected to the other of the two input shafts of the converging unit via the second differential planetary gear unit.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the transmission apparatus according to the present invention, the second differential planetary gear unit has a single-pinion-type structure in which one planetary gear is arranged in a radial direction and one or more planetary gears are arranged in a circumferential direction in a region between a sun gear and a ring gear, and each of the drive unit, the electric motor, and a load is directly connected to any one of an input shaft, an output shaft, and a speed-change shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Accordingly, since the power from the drive unit is transmitted to the load without passing through the joint unit, a capacity of the joint unit can be small even in a case of operating a large machinery. Further, since the joint unit comprises the differential planetary gear unit having no frictional part but having a mechanically coupling structure, the long service life can be achieved and the transmission limit can become sufficiently high.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In order to clarify the effect of the present invention, first, there will be illustrated a flow of the rotational power transmitted by a combination of the dividing unit <b>6</b>, a speed-change device, i.e., the joint unit R, and the differential planetary gear unit G, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 through 21</figref>. The dividing unit <b>6</b> is connected to an input shaft I. One of power flows that are output from the dividing unit <b>6</b> is input to a shaft R<b>2</b> of the differential planetary gear unit G through the joint unit R, and the other is input to another shaft R<b>1</b> of the differential planetary gear unit G. The power flows are then output from an output shaft O.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the power flow, which is represented by a reference sign P, of the input shaft I is divided into P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> by the dividing unit <b>6</b>, the power flow of the output shaft is P on the assumption that there is no loss. Magnitude of the power flow is expressed by a width of a white arrow.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is preferable that the power flow passing through the joint unit R is as small as possible, and hence it can be said that the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref> is preferable. Specifically, “the rotational power to be transmitted via the joint unit is smaller than the rotational power which has been input to the transmission apparatus”, which is an essential element of the present invention, means the manner in which the magnitude of the power flow of the power line R<b>2</b> passing through the joint unit R is smaller than the input power, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0158" num="0160">In this example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the output shaft <b>60</b> of the drive unit M is connected to the sun gear <b>64</b> via the output shaft <b>63</b>, and a rotational power of the variable-speed motor <b>70</b> is transmitted to the planetary gears <b>65</b>. Although the ring gear <b>71</b> is connected to the output shaft <b>72</b>, connection arrangement can be made freely.

<p id="p-0168" num="0170">In this example, the clutches <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> are disengaged, and the direct-coupling switch clutch is switched to the speed-increasing side.

When the drive unit M is increased to a predetermined rotational speed, the drive unit M is energized. According to such an operation manner, electric power for the starting can be small.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0171">In the eight through tenth embodiments also, the rotational powers transmitted via the direct-coupling shafts (output shafts) <b>73</b> and <b>81</b> are larger than the rotational powers transmitted via the speed-change shafts <b>72</b> and <b>83</b>, respectively.

<p id="p-0170" num="0172">However, when practicing the present invention, if a negative rotational power is transmitted to the speed-change shafts <b>72</b> and <b>83</b>, i.e., if feedback occurs, the rotational power to be transmitted to the direct-coupling shafts <b>73</b> and <b>81</b> becomes large by the same amount.

<p id="p-0179" num="0181">According to the transmission apparatus of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 through 17</figref>, because the joint unit is constituted by a combination of the second differential planetary gear unit and the variable-speed motor, a smooth speed-change operation can be performed by changing the speed of the variable-speed motor. Further, because the rotational power can be transmitted mainly via the coupling shaft serving as the direct-coupling shaft coupling the first differential planetary gear unit and the dividing unit, the capacity of the second differential planetary gear unit and the variable-speed motor as the joint unit can be small. As a result, it is possible to provide a transmission apparatus which can perform an efficient speed-change operation with small impact.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0180" num="0182">The present invention is suitable for use in a transmission apparatus having at least one of a dividing unit and a differential planetary gear unit and having a joint unit.</p>
