<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a restraining system for a child safety seat that is used in an automobile, and more particularly to a restraining system that is easy to install.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Young children are typically secured in an automobile by way of a safety seat. The safety seat is secured to a seat or bench of the automobile.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a conventional child safety seat <b>10</b> secured to an automobile seat <b>12</b>. The automobile seat <b>12</b> may be a bench style seat located behind the driver and front passenger seats. The safety seat <b>10</b> is secured in place over the automobile seat <b>12</b> by securing to a seat restraint (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). A safety belt <b>14</b> cooperates with the safety seat <b>10</b> to secure a child <b>16</b> therein.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a conventional seat restraint <b>18</b>. Typically, the seat restraint <b>18</b> extends into the center crease <b>20</b> of the automobile seat <b>12</b> proximate a buckle housing <b>22</b>. The seat restraint <b>18</b> generally is not visible to the passenger. Instead, the seat restraint <b>18</b> is located just below the horizontal seat cushion.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a safety seat securing member <b>24</b> secured to the seat restraint <b>18</b>. The safety seat securing member <b>24</b> may be a strap or belt that is secured to the seat restraint <b>18</b> through an eyelet.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an isometric view of a conventional seat restraint <b>18</b> secured to an anchoring rod or tube <b>26</b>. The anchoring tube <b>26</b> is secured underneath the seat (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The seat restraint <b>18</b> is secured to the anchoring tube <b>26</b> through welding <b>28</b> or separate and distinct fasteners (such as screws, bolts, or the like). As such, the manufacturing process uses a separate welding step, or additional fasteners. The welding step takes additional time and effort, as does the process of securing the seat restraint <b>18</b> to the anchoring tube <b>26</b> through the separate fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, a need exists for an improved seat restraint system that is quicker and easier to secure to a bent steel rod or tube.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Certain embodiments of the present invention provide a seat restraint configured to be secured to an anchoring tube. The seat restraint may include at least one anchoring tube engaging member, and at least one fastening member integrally formed with the at least one anchoring tube engaging member. The seat restraint may secure to the anchoring tube without welding or separate fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The anchoring tube engaging member may be a sleeve defining a tube passage, wherein the sleeve is configured to be positioned around at least a portion of an outer circumferential area of the anchoring tube. Optionally, the anchoring tube engaging member may be a restraint tube configured to be positioned around at least a portion of an outer circumferential area of the anchoring tube.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The fastening member may include at least one spring tab configured to snapably engage a reciprocal opening formed in the anchoring tube. Alternatively, the fastening member may include an opening that securely retains a spring tab extending from the anchoring tube. Also, alternatively, the fastening member may include a paw member and at least one spring member.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Certain embodiments of the present invention also provide a restraining system for a safety seat that is configured to be used in an automobile. The retraining system includes an anchoring tube, and a seat restraint secured to the anchoring tube.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Before the embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of “including” and “comprising” and variations thereof is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items and equivalents thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an isometric view of a seat restraint <b>30</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The seat restraint <b>30</b> may be a unitary structure constructed from a single sheet of metal.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The seat restraint <b>30</b> includes two sleeves <b>32</b> separated by a connecting beam <b>34</b>, which is integrally connected to upstanding legs <b>36</b>. The sleeves <b>32</b> may include annular gussets <b>35</b> that provide structural support. Tube passages <b>33</b> are defined through the sleeves <b>32</b>. The upstanding legs <b>36</b> are integrally connected to an engagement beam <b>38</b>. A securing window <b>40</b> is defined between the connecting beam <b>34</b>, the legs <b>36</b>, and the engagement beam <b>38</b>. A safety seat securing member (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), such as a strap or belt, is configured to be positioned through the window <b>40</b>. The safety seat securing member may be looped through the window <b>40</b> in order to secure a safety seat (not show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to the seat restraint <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">While the seat restraint <b>30</b> is shown having two sleeves <b>32</b>, more or less sleeves <b>32</b> may be used. For example, the seat restraint <b>30</b> may include a single sleeve. Additionally, the restraint <b>30</b> may include a single tube, instead of spaced apart sleeves.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Spring tabs <b>42</b> extend from outer surfaces of the sleeves <b>32</b>. Optionally, the spring tabs <b>42</b> may extend from inner surfaces of the sleeves <b>32</b>. The spring tabs <b>42</b> are configured to be securely retained by reciprocal openings formed in an anchoring tube (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Alternatively, the sleeves <b>32</b> may include barbs, clasps, latches, protuberances, or the like that are configured to be retained by the reciprocal openings in the tube. Also, alternatively, the tube may include the tabs or other such protrusions, while the sleeves <b>32</b> include reciprocal openings.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an isometric view of the seat restraint <b>30</b> secured to an anchoring tube <b>44</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. In order to secure the seat restraint <b>30</b> to the anchoring tube <b>44</b>, the tube passages <b>33</b> are aligned with the anchoring tube <b>44</b>. The seat restraint <b>30</b> is then slid over the anchoring tube <b>44</b> in the direction of arrow A until the spring tabs <b>42</b> encounter reciprocal openings <b>46</b> formed through the anchoring tube <b>44</b>. Once the spring tabs <b>42</b> encounter the reciprocal openings <b>46</b>, the spring tabs <b>42</b> spring or snap into the openings <b>46</b>, thereby securing the seat restraint <b>30</b> to the anchoring tube <b>44</b>. As such, the seat restraint <b>30</b> does not slide or rotate relative to the anchoring tube <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Moreover, the cooperation between the spring tabs <b>42</b> and the reciprocal openings <b>46</b> ensures that the seat restraint <b>30</b> is properly positioned and centered. That is, the reciprocal openings <b>46</b> are formed at specific locations on the anchoring tube <b>44</b> to ensure that the seat restraint <b>30</b> secures to the anchoring tube <b>44</b> at the correct position. Also, as shown and described above, the seat restraint <b>30</b> may be secured to the anchoring tube <b>44</b> without welding, or additional fasteners and components.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an isometric view of a seat restraint <b>50</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The seat restraint <b>50</b> includes a paw member <b>52</b> and spring members <b>54</b> integrally connected to a securing member <b>56</b>. The seat restraint <b>50</b> may include more than one paw member <b>52</b>, and more or less than the two spring members <b>54</b> shown. A strap or loop of a safety seat is secured to, through, or around the securing member <b>56</b>, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the spring members <b>54</b> may extend outwardly from the securing member <b>56</b> in a first direction, while the paw member <b>52</b> extends from the securing member <b>56</b> in a second direction. In order to position the seat restraint <b>50</b> on an anchoring tube, the paw member <b>52</b> is placed in a hole located on the anchoring tube. The seat restraint <b>50</b> is then rotated, thereby camming the spring members <b>54</b> into reciprocal holes formed in the anchoring tube. Thus, the seat restraint <b>50</b> may be secured to the anchoring tube without the use of welding or separate fasteners and components.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Thus, embodiments of the present invention provide an improved seat restraint system that is not secured to a fixed structure, such as a bent steel rod, through welds or separate fasteners. The embodiments of the seat restraint shown and described above may be quickly and easily secured to an anchoring tube or rod without an additional welding step, or fastening step. Instead, the embodiments of the seat restraint include integral fasteners that cooperate with structures on the anchoring tube or rod to securely fasten the seat restraint to the anchoring tube. Further, the cooperation of the integral fasteners on the seat restraint and the reciprocal structures of the anchoring tube ensure that the seat restraint is secured to the anchoring tube at a correct position.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The seat restraint may be formed of a single piece of sheet metal. However, the seat restraint and the anchoring tube may be formed of various other materials that are strong and resilient.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While various spatial terms, such as upper, lower, mid, lateral, horizontal, vertical, and the like may used to describe portions of the seat restraint, it is understood that such terms are merely used with respect to the orientations shown in the drawings. The orientations may be inverted, rotated, or otherwise changed, such that an upper portion is a lower portion, and vice versa, horizontal becomes vertical, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Variations and modifications of the foregoing are within the scope of the present invention. It is understood that the invention disclosed and defined herein extends to all alternative combinations of two or more of the individual features mentioned or evident from the text and/or drawings. All of these different combinations constitute various alternative aspects of the present invention. The embodiments described herein explain the best modes known for practicing the invention and will enable others skilled in the art to utilize the invention. The claims are to be construed to include alternative embodiments to the extent permitted by the prior art.</p>
