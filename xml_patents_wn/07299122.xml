<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An integrated system for increasing power output from an internal combustion engine. System facilitates an interface for controlling and conditioning of the amount of intake air into an internal combustion engine. The system interfaces to a controller and provides critical data, an active intercooler, power buffer, and an electrically driven supercharger. An operator interface provides monitoring and control to a controller for expanded operator control. A power buffer relieves host power system from loading during high demand operation. A system of advanced sensors and processing from a controller combine to facilitate maximum power output with reduced risks. Active heat removal enables system operation in a vehicle at rest or in traffic. Active conditioning system flexibility facilitates improved implementation of cold temperature environment starting and operation. A low cost option with commercial non-positive displacement blowers implements affordable enhancements for internal combustion engines.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND-FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to the field of electronically controlled incoming air compressors or boosters with active intercooling or after-cooling for enhancing power from such as internal combustion (compression or sparked combustion) engines (gas or other fuel).</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND-DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The purpose of using compressors or boosters with internal combustion engines is to force a larger amount of air molecules into an engine (then the engine can ingest unaided). The motivation behind this purpose is to produce more power from the same engine. Classical configurations to facilitate boost on internal combustion engines have centered on exhaust driven (turbocharger) and belt driven (supercharger) technologies. These existing devices for improving power output on internal combustion engines suffer from various shortcomings that distract from their purpose, making power. When turbo type technology is used exhaust backpressure is incurred, as is a high level of heat soak. With these conditions the amount of power available is degraded substantially as is system reliability and longevity. Classical supercharging incorporates some type of mechanical drive from an engine's rotating members. This technology incurs larger amounts of parasitics (25% or more) on the engine's rotating members and experiences similar but less significant heat soak. Therefore, reduced power gains are all that is available with these classical drive mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore classic drive schemes require extensive bracketry for physical mounting and custom manifolds for incorporation into an engine input. These brackets, manifolds and plumbing are costly and take up space in already tight engine compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, increases in power from larger boosting values result in considerable temperature increases of the air being inducted into a boosted engine. Two factors contribute to this temperature increase:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">1. Compressing any fluid or gas (in this case air) will increase the gas's temperature directly,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">2. Heat soak will affect air flowing through boosters that are bolted to engines by as much as 100° Fahrenheit over ambient. Superchargers secured (as with bolts) to an engine must be located close to the engine's main mechanical drive (usually the crankshaft). Temperatures in these areas are typically between 160° and 225° Fahrenheit. Turbochargers are bolted into the exhaust pipe as close to exhaust header as possible. Exhaust headers typically operate near 1,000° Fahrenheit.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">The majority of engines are optimized to produce the maximum amount of power given the fuel available, compression ratio, minus emission compromises and a safety margin. Therefore, adding boost to engines increases the temperature inside the cylinders, at some point these additions of charged air will cause heat problems inside the combustion chamber. If this heat is sufficient to raise the cylinder temperature over about 1075° absolute (615° F.) knock or pre-ignition will occur. Although 1075° absolute is affected by many factors including compression, octane, and ambient temperature, it is an arbitrary value that should not be exceeded for safe operation. Knock will result, causing an engine to fail very quickly and not produce expected or required amounts of power. Boosted systems typically begin to experience these temperature problems in the 4 to 7 pounds per square inch (psi) boost range, depending on fuel, compression and valve timing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">Methods for reducing temperature of boosted air involve heat exchangers called intercoolers or after coolers. These devices exchange temperature with radiators acting as heat sinks. There are various technologies employed to dispense the heat collected by intercoolers. Technologies include air-to-air, air-to-water, and thermoelectric exchangers. All intercoolers produce some pressure drop while removing heat from boosted air, many factors, including intercooler length directly increase pressure drops. Designers must balance combustion chamber temperature with boost, technology, and size of an intercooler to achieve the desired results.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">In an effort to address the parasitics problem, electric motor booster adaptations have also been constructed. The challenge confronting designers with these approaches centers on the high speed (measured in revolutions per minute (RPM)) with high torque requirements for the motor necessary to produce the desired performance. Implementations of electric motor driven superchargers and turbochargers have relied on belts, gears and pulleys to obtain the required power and speed. These embodiments suffer from the same complications devices they are attempting to replace. These complications include friction, gear lash, additional heat build up, and shortened life. To date direct drive embodiments were not able to attain the power and speed necessary for performance that off sets the cost of system acquisition and operation. Additionally, the attempts at solving reduced pressure at the reduced speeds have led to compromised supercharger designs in impeller size and shape. These efforts have resulted in systems with shortened life spans and modest performance gains. State of the art bearings have recently made great advances with magnetics and ceramics technologies that can be coupled with advanced motor winding techniques and miniaturized digital signal processors (DSP). These advances are greatly improving the control accuracy and performance of electric motors in both speed (RPM) and torque.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">To date no system has been disclosed that offers internal combustion engines reduced emissions and increased performance without the above described limitations. This deficit is due mostly to the lack of capabilities that follow. No system capable of operating with a controller has been proposed that can provide data for supervisoral and scheduling operations, enhancements, recharging, and facility for system override of an actively chilled electronic supercharger. No controllable conditioner with active temperature enhancement for increased temperature range was available prior to disclosure by present author, Flowing Fluid Conditioner (FFC), Perkins, 10/930,998, 08/31/2004. No warmer type intercooler with active temperature enhancement was available prior to FFC. No system can alternately cool or warm boosted air is available prior to FFC. No electronically controllable booster that would integrate into an on-demand configuration with temperature compensation was available. No system buffer was available that complements a smart controller. No system capable of providing a controller was available without System and Method for Smart Control for Flowing Fluid Conditioners (SSCFFC), Perkins, 60/629,814, dated. Nov. 19, 2004. No system that could provide advanced sensing capabilities for providing data for measurement of critical temperature and combustion signatures was available. No system that was available could provide data for these functions, be compatible with OBD-2 and CAN standards, and through a controller interface them interactively with the host vehicle.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0026">In accordance with the present invention ODBC, affords an integrated system capable of operating with a controller. ODBC in conjunction with the smart controller will raise the amount of air taken into an engine and maintain safe (avoid pre-ignition) “charged” air temperature. ODBC will monitor host vehicle vitals, provide same to a controller and enhance performance as instructed by a controller as required by the operating conditions, system operation, and driver demands.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0027">Accordingly, a summary of objects and advantages of this invention are:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0028">a. A system that will function with a controller that supervises operation, sequencing, and scheduling of ODBC enhancement functions. Data are made available to coordinate temperature management, recharging, and emission reduction. Additionally, ODBC implementing the calculations of a controller will increase performance, override if a problem occurs, and manage a normalized power curve for predictable power availability.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0029">b. A Chiller (active) element that will increase exchanger temperature ranges, reduce response lag, lower emissions, and with reduced size; offer lower pressure drops that lengthy intercooler configurations experience.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0030">c. A warmer (active) element that will preheat in anticipation of starting in cold conditions. The warmer will also improve drivability, and lower emissions in these conditions.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0031">d. A booster (electronically controlled) component that can be mounted to avoid engine heat soak and offer minimal physical size for mounting ease. The booster will interface with a controller and immediately (on demand) deliver to a host engine increases in air volume with less lag and improved performance response. The booster will also offer minimal rotating mass to facilitate speed up and slow down as part of implementing the normalized power curve.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0032">e. A buffer component that offers increased power storage, recharging and expanded operation duration. The buffer will remove parasitics during high demand periods increasing flexibility and efficiency. Power sources may include battery, fuel cell, ultra capacitors (Maxwell BOOSTCAP) http://www.maxwell.com/ultracapacitors/), or small combustion engine.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0006" num="0033">f. A collection of advanced sensors that will keep the smart controller informed of engine status, system conditions, internal and environmental conditions, and operational demands or loading. The advanced sensor family includes thermistors or thermocouple for temperature measurement. A throttle position sensor (TPS) monitor to ascertain driver needs. An advanced piezoelectric diaphragm sandwich configuration sensor to monitor exhaust and/or intake air streams to inform the smart controller how the cylinder combustion signature appears. This sensor's extremely high band width allows sufficient sampling rates for accurate snap shots of engine combustion wavefronts, not average pictures available from existing technologies. These data are sent to a controller that collects and analyzes these data and from waveform analysis can anticipate the engine performance requirements and optimize a combustion solution for efficiency and engine safety.</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0007" num="0034">g. Interface enhancements are available from a controller. These interfaces included the existing standards for vehicles starting with OBD-2 through CAN. These interfaces enable system interaction and interoperability with host vehicle and vital operating information (i.e. TPS, RPM, vehicle speed, barometric pressure, and temperatures. Additional commercial and industrial computer bus standards are also easily facilitated by ODBC.
<br/>
ODBC's processor can calculate the power output from the parameters available from the host vehicle's engine control unit (ECU) and calibrate data entered on initial start up (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) to determine engine performance and operator demands. Approximate horsepower can be calculated. From Newton F=ma. Power=F*speed. Power=mass*acceleration*speed. So a vehicle at 2500 lbs is 2500/32.2=78 slugs. If a 0-60 time for that vehicle is 6 seconds. 60 mph=88 ft/sec

<p id="p-0018" num="0040">On a hot day, or at high altitude, or on a dry day the air is less dense. A reduction in air density reduces the amount of oxygen available for combustion and therefore reduces the engine horsepower and torque. Density altitude is defined as the pressure altitude corrected for the effects of temperature and humidity. Density altitude affects engine horsepower of a normally aspirated engine. A reduction in air density reduces the amount of oxygen available for combustion and therefore reduces the engine horsepower and torque.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0041">Corrections are excellent for accurate comparisons and factual discussions however a predictable amount of power is the goal and a flat power curve is best for controlled driving. ODBC approach centers on building a system with 20% greater capacity (horsepower production) and backing off actual maximum output to target capacity. For example a 150 hp normally aspirated engine with 7 psi boost will get roughly 225 hp. Normal atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psi. Raise the cylinder pressure 50% and you get 50% more mixture in the combustion chamber to ignite (all else being equal). So with a booster capable of say 10 psi the same engine can get to the target 225 hp more quickly and with rapid sampling and calculations the smart controller with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) techniques can “regulate” the output of the engine at 225 hp at lower and higher RPMs (because the booster has a reserve and a conditioner to keep air temperature low). The driver experiences a very responsive engine that will safely produce a uniform amount of power. And enthusiast (the speed freaks) can run it wide open and experience the thrill ride (off road situations).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0042">The majority of performance requirements when driving on streets and highways will be satisfied by short bursts of power on the order of less then thirty seconds. Even drag racing a typical performance vehicle will be staged and complete a quarter mile in 30 seconds or less time. ODBC is ideally suited to be adapted to multiple designs (hybrid, diesel or gas economy, alternative fuel or performance and racing). ODBC can be used as an input to any system that can benefit from increased power with lower input temperatures for situational needs.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>is a perspective frontal view of the preferred embodiment of my invention, the On Demand Boost Conditioner (ODBC) <b>101</b> mounted in a host vehicle. The conditioner <b>101</b> is shown mounted next to the vehicle's radiator, in front of the vehicle firewall. This area of mounting conditioner <b>101</b> avoids heat soak disadvantages when compared to mounting conditioner <b>101</b> in an engine compartment behind firewall. Components of the system are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for system perspective. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>the conditioner <b>101</b> has an output <b>134</b><i>o </i>shown connected with an inlet hose <b>158</b> to a host vehicle engine <b>144</b> at a throttle body <b>150</b>. The vehicle has an exhaust manifold <b>144</b><i>m </i>that is shown with an advanced sensor AS attached. Also shown are a vehicle battery <b>149</b>, an alternator <b>147</b>, an engine control unit (ECU) <b>126</b><i>p </i>connector, a display <b>139</b>, a smart controller <b>133</b>, a power buffer <b>143</b>, and an auxiliary power <b>145</b>. The system configuration is shown for discussion purposes as actual mounting in a vehicle may demand alternative locations when considering existing functions and weight distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>is a front view of the preferred embodiment of conditioner <b>101</b>. An air cleaner <b>104</b> (high flow such as type from K&amp;N filters) filters incoming air to a by-pass housing <b>109</b> or into a turbine housing <b>103</b>. The by-pass <b>109</b> enables air to enter an engine as in a normally aspirated engine. The housing <b>103</b> is the first part of the system that enables conditioner <b>101</b> to provide boosted and thermally conditioned air for combustion. The housing <b>103</b> is shown with turbine housing outlet <b>103</b><i>o </i>connected to a conditioner housing inlet <b>105</b><i>i </i>of a conditioner housing <b>105</b> by a flex hose connector <b>110</b>, made of reinforced silicon sleeve of the appropriate diameter. The hose <b>110</b> is secured with a pair of hose clamps <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b</i>. The housing <b>105</b> has an active conditioner element that is a thermoelectric device (TED) <b>107</b>. The TED <b>107</b> has a fan <b>108</b> for heat transfer while stationary. The fan <b>108</b> is powered over a fan power cable <b>108</b><i>c</i>. This embodiment displays the housings <b>103</b> and <b>105</b> mounted together for compactness; where necessary they could also be mounted separately. Depicting TED <b>107</b> as a singular element is for discussion, multiple TED <b>107</b> elements can be implemented for adjustment of capacity and recharge time as disclosed in my ODBC system. Additionally, various intercooler (or after cooler) configurations and advanced technologies in active elements are also considered part of this ODBC system invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c </i>is a rear view of the preferred embodiment of conditioner <b>101</b>. The housing <b>103</b> is shown with a high-speed, high-torque, DC motor <b>111</b>. The motor <b>111</b> is capable of being controlled by a pulse width modulation (PWM) high current driver. The motor <b>111</b> is powered over a motor drive cable <b>156</b><i>m</i>. The housing <b>105</b> is shown connected to housing <b>103</b> by hose <b>110</b> and clamps <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b</i>. The housing <b>105</b> has a conditioner housing outlet <b>115</b> for release of thermally conditioned air. The outlet <b>115</b> is shown with a conditioner butterfly valve plate <b>121</b>. The plate <b>121</b> is mounted to an actuator shaft <b>117</b>. Also mounted on shaft <b>117</b> is a by-pass butterfly valve plate <b>119</b>. The plate <b>119</b> is configured to control a by-pass outlet <b>113</b> of by-pass <b>109</b>. Also connected to shaft <b>117</b> is an actuator <b>123</b>. The actuator <b>123</b> responds to commands from a controller <b>133</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to rotate shaft <b>117</b>. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, the actuator <b>123</b> feeds back shaft <b>117</b> position information to controller <b>133</b>. The plates <b>119</b> and <b>121</b> are in a normal or orthogonal orientation. This configuration allows controller <b>133</b> to direct actuator <b>123</b> to select or block output from either outlet <b>113</b> or <b>115</b>, where one outlet is closed when the other is open.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>d </i>is an exploded view of the preferred embodiment of conditioner <b>101</b>. The motor <b>111</b> has a threaded hole <b>111</b><i>t </i>(X<b>4</b>) for mounting to a turbine rear housing <b>103</b><i>r</i>. A high-speed bearing <b>116</b> mounted in housing <b>103</b><i>r </i>supports a motor shaft <b>114</b> of motor <b>111</b>. The shaft <b>114</b> has a threaded end <b>114</b><i>t</i>. The housing <b>103</b><i>r </i>has a mounting hole <b>111</b><i>h </i>(X<b>4</b>) for a bolt <b>111</b><i>s </i>(X<b>4</b>) for securing motor <b>111</b> to housing <b>103</b><i>r</i>. A turbine blade <b>125</b> is secured to threads <b>114</b><i>t </i>with a lock nut <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0061">The by-pass <b>109</b> is attached to a turbine front housing <b>103</b><i>f </i>with a mounting plate <b>103</b><i>m </i>and an adapter mounting bolt <b>109</b><i>s </i>(X<b>3</b>). The plate <b>103</b><i>m </i>has a threaded mounting hole <b>103</b><i>n </i>(X<b>3</b>) aligned to a mounting hole <b>103</b><i>b </i>(X<b>3</b>) on housing <b>103</b><i>f</i>. Plate <b>103</b><i>m </i>has an adapter flange <b>109</b><i>b </i>that facilitates mounting of cleaner <b>104</b> by a hose clamp <b>104</b><i>c </i>securing an air cleaner throat <b>104</b><i>t </i>of cleaner <b>104</b> over adapter <b>109</b><i>b</i>. The outlet <b>113</b> connects to a combiner <b>134</b> at combiner by-pass input <b>134</b><i>b</i>. The by-pass <b>109</b> allows air to flow through outlet <b>113</b> into input <b>134</b><i>b </i>of combiner <b>134</b> as if in a normally aspirated vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0062">Assembly of turbine housing <b>103</b> is performed after assembly of components for rear housing <b>103</b><i>r </i>and front housing <b>103</b><i>f </i>have been completed. For housing <b>103</b><i>r</i>, assembly steps are: insert bearing <b>116</b> in conformed recess in <b>103</b><i>r</i>, position shaft <b>114</b> of motor <b>111</b> through bearing <b>116</b>, secure bolt <b>111</b><i>s </i>(X<b>4</b>) through hole <b>111</b><i>h </i>(X<b>4</b>) and into threaded hole <b>111</b><i>t </i>(X<b>4</b>) to secure motor <b>111</b> to housing <b>103</b><i>r</i>, and secure turbine blade <b>125</b> to shaft <b>114</b><i>t </i>with locking nut <b>118</b>. For front housing <b>103</b><i>f</i>, assembly is as described above. Turbine housing <b>103</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>) is then formed by securing turbine front housing <b>103</b><i>f </i>to turbine rear housing <b>103</b><i>r </i>using a pinching brace rear backet <b>102</b><i>r </i>(X<b>2</b>) and a pinching brace front bracket <b>102</b><i>f </i>(X<b>2</b>) on top and bottom of housings <b>103</b><i>r </i>and <b>103</b><i>f</i>. The brace <b>102</b><i>r </i>contains a threaded hole <b>102</b><i>h </i>(X<b>2</b>) aligned with a mounting hole <b>102</b><i>g </i>(X<b>2</b>) in <b>102</b><i>f</i>. A threaded brace bolt <b>102</b><i>b </i>(X<b>4</b>) secures housings <b>103</b><i>r </i>and <b>103</b><i>f </i>by passing through holes <b>102</b><i>g </i>in brace <b>102</b><i>f </i>and seating in holes <b>102</b><i>h </i>in brace <b>102</b><i>r </i>aligned to holes <b>103</b><i>h </i>on housing <b>103</b><i>r </i>and <b>103</b><i>f. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0063">An exchanger <b>128</b> installs into opening <b>105</b><i>o</i>. The exchanger <b>128</b> has an exchanger top plate <b>128</b><i>p </i>that provides a sealing surface for housing <b>105</b><i>f</i>. The plate <b>128</b><i>p </i>has a threaded hole <b>107</b><i>t </i>(X <b>4</b>) for mounting TED <b>107</b>. A cover <b>105</b><i>c </i>with a TED hole <b>128</b><i>h </i>installs over exchanger <b>128</b> overlapping edges of opening <b>105</b><i>o </i>on housing <b>105</b><i>f</i>. The cover <b>105</b><i>c </i>is sealed to housing <b>105</b><i>f </i>with ultrasonic bonding or reinforced epoxy depending on housing <b>105</b><i>f </i>materials. Exchanger front housing <b>105</b><i>f </i>is joined to exchanger rear housing <b>105</b><i>r </i>with a reinforced epoxy lamination along the contours of the opening. When assembled, housing <b>105</b> should be air tight to 16 psi and exhibit minimal external heat transfer with double walled, non-heat-conductive materials. The TED <b>107</b> installs with a screw <b>107</b><i>s </i>(X<b>4</b>) into a hole <b>107</b><i>t </i>(X<b>4</b>) on plate <b>128</b><i>p. </i></p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0064">A fan <b>108</b> is mounted to TED <b>107</b> with a screw <b>108</b><i>s </i>(X<b>4</b>) into a threaded mounting bracket hole <b>108</b><i>h </i>(X<b>4</b>). The controller <b>133</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) will turn on fan <b>108</b> anytime system is on and vehicle speed is below 20 mph. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>d</i>, the shaft <b>117</b> is slid through holes <b>115</b><i>h </i>(X<b>2</b>) and <b>113</b><i>h </i>(X<b>2</b>) and secured to actuator <b>123</b> on the outlet <b>113</b>. The plate <b>119</b> with a mounting hole <b>119</b><i>h </i>(X<b>2</b>) is secured to shaft <b>117</b> with a screw <b>119</b><i>s </i>(X<b>2</b>) into a threaded hole <b>117</b><i>h </i>(X<b>2</b>). The plate <b>121</b> with a mounting hole <b>121</b><i>h </i>(X<b>2</b>) is secured to shaft <b>117</b> when rotated 90° with a screws <b>121</b><i>s </i>(X<b>2</b>) into a threaded hole <b>117</b><i>h </i>(X<b>2</b>). The housing <b>105</b> has an outlet <b>115</b> that connects to combiner <b>134</b> at combiner conditioner input <b>134</b><i>c </i>with hose <b>110</b> and clamps <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>119</b><i>b</i>. Air flowing through combiner <b>134</b> exits through output <b>134</b><i>o</i>. In this configuration, conditioner <b>101</b> can provide thermal exchange to boosted air from housing <b>103</b> that travels through housing <b>105</b> containing exchanger <b>128</b>, through outlet <b>115</b>, and into input <b>134</b><i>c</i>. This process is an alternative to and improvement (air is boosted and thermally conditioned) upon the process of normal engine aspiration that occurs when air flows through by-pass <b>109</b> and outlet <b>113</b> into combiner <b>134</b>. The outlet <b>113</b> is secured to input <b>134</b><i>b </i>with another hose <b>110</b> and clamps <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>e </i>is a blow up of mounting for advanced wavefront sensor AS. The manifold <b>144</b><i>m </i>has a sensor AS mounting hole <b>239</b> for mounting sensor AS. The hole <b>239</b> is positioned on manifold <b>144</b><i>m </i>so a probe <b>251</b> on sensor AS can directly measure wavefronts of exhaust gases. Mounting sensor AS in a curve in the manifold <b>144</b><i>m </i>allows direct wavefront exposure to minimize reflections and resulting noise. An adapter or supplemental machining may be required to establish a flat surface around hole <b>239</b> to enable sealing between manifoldl <b>44</b><i>m </i>and sensor AS mounting. A stainless steel fender washer <b>233</b> (X<b>2</b>) with a mounting tab <b>233</b><i>t </i>(X<b>2</b>) positioned on edges of washer <b>233</b> and opposing each other are provided. The tabs <b>233</b><i>t </i>can be fashioned by welding (heliarc) #12 gauge stainless steel wire to the sides of washer <b>233</b>. Tabs <b>233</b><i>t </i>should be close enough to edge of washer <b>233</b> to allow an insulating ceramic washer <b>235</b> (X<b>2</b>) to seat undisturbed. Tabs <b>233</b><i>t </i>should be large enough to accommodate a stainless steel tie wire <b>237</b> to be threaded through and secured as with safeting (FAA AC43.13-1 B). The wire <b>237</b> should exert enough tension with equal pressure on both sides of washer <b>233</b> to seal sensor AS to manifold <b>144</b><i>m</i>. The Sensor AS is a stacked structure comprised of a piezoelectric transducer in a compressible polymer (such as silicon or urethane) sandwiched within a cover of material such as stainless steel. The sensor AS such as First Look sensor from SenX Technology is of sufficient bandwidth to capture the characteristic frequencies on the leading edge of the engine's combustion gas wave fronts.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a functional side view of conditioner <b>101</b>. (Note<b>1</b>: Hose <b>158</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is not shown in this figure. Note <b>2</b>: In applications where the host engine compartment affords sufficient room, combiner <b>134</b> could be configured to connect directly to throttle body <b>150</b>. In this application, a number of other non-material changes could occur, including: physical dimensions of <b>109</b>, <b>103</b>, <b>105</b> and <b>134</b> be changed to conform to available space, or an air intake hose <b>158</b> be attached on one end to cleaner <b>104</b> and extend to another location to draw in air that has not been heated by the engine compartment.) Lines with arrows depict airflow through conditioner <b>101</b>. The cleaner <b>104</b> filters incoming air. A temperature sensor T<b>1</b> measures the temperature of incoming air. A temperature sensor T<b>2</b> measures the intake temperature of the air in by-pass <b>109</b>. The difference between T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> will typically be very small; however system abnormalities such as backfire can be better characterized with the inclusion of T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> in their respective locations. For air to flow into by-pass <b>109</b> and enter combiner <b>134</b>, actuator <b>123</b> positions shaft <b>117</b> to open plate <b>119</b> and close plate <b>121</b>. A temperature sensor T<b>4</b> measures the temperature of the intake engine air continuing through combiner <b>134</b>. The sensor T<b>4</b> provides data on system performance prior to exiting conditioner <b>101</b>. The inclusion of sensor T<b>4</b> will aide in the analysis of system performance and system problems by isolating temperature zones in the system. The combiner <b>134</b> during normal operation experiences engine vacuum that will pull air into throttle body <b>150</b> and through an intake valve <b>162</b><i>i </i>into the engine's combustion chamber <b>162</b><i>c</i>. Following combustion in chamber <b>162</b><i>c</i>, exhaust gases exit through exhaust valve <b>162</b><i>o </i>and out an exhaust pipe <b>160</b>. A high temperature sensor T<b>5</b> measures the temperature of the exiting exhaust gases in pipe <b>160</b>. Also in pipe <b>160</b> is the wavefront sensor AS that senses fluctuations in exhaust gas wave fronts. Within a typical modern engine management system, a wide-open throttle (WOT) condition is sensed by such as a throttle position sensor (TPS) <b>151</b> when a driver presses the accelerator pedal <b>151</b><i>f </i>beyond 85%. This demand is transmitted by cable, wirelessly, or similarly to a coupling that actuates a butterfly valve <b>150</b><i>b </i>of body <b>150</b>. The controller <b>133</b> monitors host signals from an engine control unit (ECU) <b>127</b>. The controller <b>133</b> is powered by power buffer <b>143</b>. Among its functions, the controller <b>133</b> energizes TED <b>107</b> to condition exchanger <b>128</b> to chill or warm. The controller <b>133</b> monitors exchanger <b>128</b> temperature with a temperature sensor T<b>3</b>. The controller <b>133</b> also controls the motor <b>111</b>. The controller <b>133</b> monitors motor <b>111</b> speed with internal signal processing. When controller <b>133</b> senses WOT true from ECU <b>127</b>, timer<b>1</b> (software) is set to 30 seconds, all critical engine parameters are checked, and, when no abnormal parameters are present, <b>133</b> commands actuator <b>123</b> to move shaft <b>117</b> to open plate <b>121</b> and close plate <b>119</b>. This action closes by-pass <b>109</b> at plate <b>119</b> and opens airflow through housings <b>103</b> and <b>105</b> and into combiner <b>134</b>. The controller <b>133</b> having already conditioned exchanger <b>128</b> through action of TED <b>107</b> will turn off or sequence operation of TED <b>107</b> to minimize current draw during this high demand condition. The blade <b>125</b> is now exposed to incoming air via action of actuator <b>123</b> to open plate <b>121</b>. The controller <b>133</b> commands motor <b>111</b> to “spin-up” blade <b>125</b> to accomplish full boost. Boosted air from housing <b>103</b> travels into housing <b>105</b> containing exchanger <b>128</b>. While proceeding through exchanger <b>128</b>, air is thermally conditioned. During WOT conditions boosted air is “chilled” by the exchanger <b>128</b>. The sensor T<b>3</b> monitors temperature of exchanger <b>128</b>. The controller <b>133</b> monitors sensor T<b>3</b> to determine current needs of TED <b>107</b> to condition exchanger <b>128</b>. Boosted and conditioned air continues past plate <b>119</b> into combiner <b>134</b>. The sensor T<b>4</b> monitors the temperature of air in combiner <b>134</b>. The boosted and chilled air continues into body <b>150</b> (wide open) past valve <b>162</b><i>i </i>and into chamber <b>162</b><i>c </i>for combustion. This boosted and conditioned air is combusted in chamber <b>162</b><i>c </i>and exits past valve <b>162</b><i>o</i>. These exhaust gases are expelled through pipe <b>160</b> where temperature is monitored by sensor T<b>5</b> and combustion wave fronts are sensed by sensor AS.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0067">The controller <b>133</b> will check WOT signal ten times a second. When WOT is no longer true or time out occurs in timer<b>1</b>, typically 30 seconds, controller <b>133</b> will shut motor <b>111</b> down and command actuator <b>123</b> to move shaft <b>117</b> to close plate <b>121</b> and open plate <b>119</b> allowing normal (low demand with no boost or conditioning) operation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0068">Warm start up and operation (cold cycle) air is available when sensor T<b>1</b> tells controller <b>133</b> that ambient air is below 50° F. and ECU <b>127</b> registers engine temperature below normal operating temperature (typically 170° F.). The Cold cycle pre-start is initiated by driver turning on ODBC by pressing rocker switch <b>241</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to on, at which time (following above checks), returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> controller <b>133</b> commands TED <b>107</b> to warm exchanger <b>128</b> to 80° F. When engine start cycle is initiated, controller <b>133</b> turns off TED <b>107</b> to minimize power drain during this high demand situation. (If auxiliary power <b>145</b> is present, controller <b>133</b> commands TED <b>107</b> to continue operation to warm condition <b>128</b>. Absent auxiliary power, controller <b>133</b> will command TED <b>107</b> to warm condition <b>128</b> when engine start is accomplished.) The controller <b>133</b> will command actuator <b>123</b> to position shaft <b>117</b> to close plate <b>119</b> and open plate <b>121</b> to allow air flow through housings <b>103</b> and <b>105</b>. The motor <b>111</b> will be commanded by controller <b>133</b> to spin at a low rpm (typically 30% of full rpm speed) to facilitate airflow through exchanger <b>128</b>. The exchanger <b>128</b>, having been pre-heated, warms air as it flows through exchanger <b>128</b>. Warmed air will continue past open plate <b>121</b> through combiner <b>134</b>, through body <b>150</b>, and into a normal combustion cycle. Once start of engine has been accomplished, controller <b>133</b> will re-enable TED <b>107</b> to condition exchanger <b>128</b> to keep air supply warm until sensor T<b>5</b> registers threshold (typically˜85°) temperature with controller <b>133</b>. Then controller <b>133</b> will shut down TED <b>107</b> and command actuator <b>123</b> to position shaft <b>117</b> for normal operation with plate <b>119</b> open and plate <b>121</b> closed so that air flows through bypass <b>109</b> and into combiner <b>134</b>. (Additionally, when ECU senses lower than normal operation temperature, thermal flap valve <b>122</b> that is normally closed will open. The valve <b>122</b> when open will allow air warmed by pipe <b>160</b> to enter warm air tube <b>124</b> at inlet <b>120</b> and assist in engine warming. This condition can continue until engine normal operational temperature (typically˜170° F.) is reached and valve <b>122</b> is closed.) An engine with this configuration in a cold climate will experience warm air through out cold start and operation cycle. This “conditioned” air will minimize start time and improve combustion during initial cold operation (signal <b>197</b>). In addition to reduced emissions and improved fuel economy, engine wear is reduced. Cold start is the most vulnerable time for an engine as fuel that is not combusted can foul lubrication oil causing chemical breakdown and scratching to moving parts. These conditions contribute to premature wear and failure.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>discloses basics of controller <b>133</b>. The heart of controller <b>133</b> is a DSP processor <b>133</b><i>p</i>. The processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>is a multi-function processor with sensing, processing and controlling capabilities such as a PIC 16 F877 from microchip (www.microchip.com). The processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>monitors system components and receives system data and host vehicle data inputs, and, using software to combine this information with resident tables from known hazardous conditions, previous operations and host vehicle operating specifications, executes system control functions. Operating and hazardous condition data are stored as values in look up tables, allowing processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>to perform rapid compares to current values simplifying identification of or absence of critical values and notification to ECU <b>127</b> when a condition (value) is detected. A real time clock <b>133</b><i>r </i>provides timing and synchronization capabilities. The controller <b>133</b> is housed in rugged plastic enclosure KS 1423 from Rittal company (www.rittal.co.uk). A sensor interface <b>132</b> is provided for amplification and conversion of sensor signals T<b>1</b> through T<b>5</b>. These sensors collect the following data: sensor T<b>1</b> measures ambient air temperature, sensor T<b>2</b> measures by-pass <b>109</b> intake air temperatures, sensor T<b>3</b> measures exchanger <b>128</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) temperature, sensor T<b>4</b> measures output air temperature in combiner <b>134</b>, sensor T<b>5</b> measures exhaust air temperature, and sensor AS monitors integrity of combustion gas wavefronts. Interfacing sensor AS is an analog to digital (A to D) converter front end device with a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processor <b>129</b><i>i</i>. As signal analysis must be accomplished before a cylinder fires again the processor <b>129</b><i>i </i>provides FFT solution in hardware to minimize time for frequency content analysis from sensor AS to processor <b>133</b><i>p</i>. A data cable <b>129</b> provides connection of interface <b>132</b> to T<b>1</b> through T<b>5</b>. A quick release pair of connectors <b>123</b><i>q </i>(X<b>5</b>) are provided for where box icons are indicated at sensors T<b>1</b> through T<b>5</b>. A sensor connector pair <b>129</b><i>t </i>facilitates connection and quick release of cable <b>129</b> to controller <b>133</b>. The controller <b>133</b> monitors system components and receives system data inputs from host ECU <b>127</b> over cable <b>126</b>, and, using software to combine this information with resident tables from previous operations and host vehicle operating specifications, executes system control functions. A coax instrumentation cable <b>129</b><i>a </i>connects sensor AS to processor <b>129</b><i>i</i>. A cable pair connector <b>129</b><i>b </i>connects and facilitates quick release for cable <b>129</b><i>a </i>circuitry. The processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>has a look up table stored in memory with previously quantified signals from engines with anomalies. These anomalies include data on conditions such as, but not limited to: contaminated fuel, excessive spark advance, excessive combustion chamber temperature, and no spark. The quantified signal information processor <b>129</b><i>i </i>analyzes signals from sensor AS and sends quantified data to processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>for comparison to data stored in look up tables. When processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>determines that a condition comparable to an anomalous condition is present an alert signal will be sent to display <b>139</b>. On systems equipped with OBD-2 or CAN, timing can be retarded or advanced as required. Similar adjustment techniques can be taken with intake air boost levels, fuel enrichment, and valve timing. The processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>is capable of sufficient processing speed to evaluate conditions and identify a cylinder in subject engine causing an anomaly before that cylinder fires again. By sensing from sensor AS, processing in processor <b>129</b><i>i</i>, reporting to processor <b>133</b><i>p</i>, reporting to ECU <b>127</b>, and adjusting spark advance, or other values discussed above, controller <b>133</b> can mitigate or avert potentially catastrophic or problematic combustion conditions. The display <b>139</b> provides system interface and control. A data interface display cable <b>140</b> connects display <b>139</b> to processor <b>133</b><i>p</i>. To simplify installation and removal, cable <b>140</b> has connector pair <b>140</b><i>p </i>at processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>and connector pair <b>209</b> at display <b>139</b>. A pair of high current PWM drivers are provided for motor <b>111</b> and TED <b>107</b>. A driver <b>135</b> is configured for operation and control of motor <b>111</b> over a motor drive cable <b>156</b><i>m</i>. A cable connector pair <b>156</b><i>q </i>is provided for installation and quick release of cable <b>156</b><i>m </i>circuitry. A driver <b>137</b> is configured for operation and control of TED <b>107</b> over a drive cable <b>156</b><i>c</i>. A cable connector pair <b>156</b><i>r </i>is provided for installation and quick release of cable <b>156</b><i>c </i>circuitry. The drivers <b>135</b> and <b>137</b> consist of drivers such as contained in “Brushless DC Motor Control Made Easy,” Ward Brown. The driver <b>135</b> receives PWM control signals from processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>and instructs motor <b>111</b> to a specific rpm and monitors back electromagnetic force (BEMF) from motor <b>111</b>. The measured BEMF is transmitted to processor <b>133</b><i>p</i>, and compared to the applied voltage and the specified rotor speed and position can be determined. The effective applied voltage can be varied with PWM and the speed of motor <b>111</b> by timing the commutation phases. A short software routine in processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>will handle PWM and commutation, and a state table will schedule reading peak applied voltage and BEMF voltages at two times per cycle. The driver <b>137</b> receives PWM control signals from processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>and energizes TED <b>107</b> to chill or warm. The sensor T<b>3</b> monitors exchanger <b>128</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) temperature and provides this information over a sensor cable <b>129</b>. Processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>uses sensor T<b>3</b> information to instruct driver <b>137</b> how much effective power should be applied to TED <b>107</b> by PWM to reach, sustain, or change to affect the temperature of exchanger <b>128</b>. A fan motor driver <b>108</b><i>d </i>is provided for control of fan <b>108</b>. The fan <b>108</b> receives power from driver <b>108</b><i>d </i>through cable <b>108</b><i>c</i>. Processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>will activate the fan <b>108</b> whenever conditioner <b>101</b> is on and vehicle speed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>, signal <b>189</b>) is below 20 mph. The actuator <b>123</b> is connected to controller <b>133</b> over actuator drive cable <b>123</b><i>d</i>. A quick release connector signal and actuator <b>123</b> drive pair <b>123</b><i>c </i>at actuator <b>123</b> facilitates connection and quick release of the actuator cable <b>123</b><i>d </i>circuitry. The power buffer <b>143</b> receives and transmits data over a cable <b>138</b> and distributes power to processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>over power cable <b>142</b>. The ECU <b>127</b> is connected over cable <b>126</b> (OBD-2 to RS 232 cable from www.nology.com) to processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>inside controller <b>133</b>.</p>

A signal <b>205</b> provides throttle position from throttle position sensor <b>151</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b </i>signal <b>207</b> supplies battery voltage data. A signal <b>208</b> indicates an on/start command is true.

The controller <b>133</b> collects and monitors the above data signals and compares and tracks values relative to demand indicated by throttle position signal <b>205</b> and relative to the stored values in system memory.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0071">The controller <b>133</b> will evaluate system status from ECU <b>127</b> and control the system state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to implement system action in response to driving demands reported by signal <b>205</b>, the throttle position sensor <b>151</b>.

A connector <b>142</b><i>b </i>(X<b>2</b>) connects cable <b>142</b> to buffer <b>143</b> and controller <b>133</b>. The buffer <b>143</b> can receive auxiliary power <b>145</b> over a power cable <b>146</b>. A power connector <b>142</b><i>b </i>connects cable <b>146</b> to power <b>145</b>. The power <b>145</b> can be any source of storage sufficient to supplement primary system power for TED <b>107</b> and fan <b>108</b> when host vehicle system power must be devoted to non-conditioner <b>101</b> high demand situations such as engine starting and where controller cannot continuously run or sequence actions of TED <b>107</b> and fan <b>108</b> because concurrent conditioner <b>101</b> demands would overload host vehicle power system and controller <b>133</b> must shut down TED <b>107</b> and fan <b>108</b> to protect host vehicle. A typical power <b>145</b> is compatible with 42v standards (ISO 21848) or any efficient storage system that buffer <b>143</b> can utilize while maintaining compatibility with host system power parameters. A host vehicle alternator <b>147</b> is shown for recharging power <b>145</b>. Recharging occurs over a cable <b>148</b> that connects alternator <b>147</b> to buffer <b>143</b> and over cable <b>146</b> that connects buffer <b>143</b> to power <b>145</b>. A power connector <b>142</b><i>p </i>connects cable <b>148</b> to alternator <b>147</b>. The buffer <b>143</b> supplies a voltage step-up to recharge power <b>145</b>. A host vehicle battery <b>149</b> is shown connected to buffer <b>143</b> over a cable <b>141</b>. A connector <b>142</b><i>p </i>connects cable <b>141</b> to battery <b>149</b>. Power cables <b>146</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>141</b> are connected to buffer <b>143</b> at a terminal connector <b>142</b><i>b</i>. The battery <b>149</b> can be 12 volt to 42 volt with proper configuring of buffer <b>143</b>.

<p id="p-0050" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> discloses a time line of conditioner <b>101</b> operation and functional sequencing in graph <b>153</b>. The graph <b>153</b> “y” axis has five signals with the following values or states: signal <b>193</b> (manifold air pressure from ECU <b>127</b>) is displayed with a range of 0 to 10 pounds per square inch (psi), the signal <b>205</b> (throttle position sensor from ECU <b>127</b>) is shown with a range of 0 to 100% actuation to report the position of TPS <b>151</b>, the values of <b>123</b> represent actuator <b>123</b> orientations shown with by-pass (plate <b>119</b> open, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) or conditioner (plate <b>121</b> open, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) selected, returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the T<b>3</b> values report the temperature of conditioner <b>128</b> measures by sensor T<b>3</b> with values ranging from warm to cold. The motor <b>111</b> speeds are displayed at the bottom of the “y” axis showing a range of 0 to 100% RPM.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0073">The graph <b>153</b> “x” axis displays events or operational periods in a time sequence. A period of rest <b>155</b> begins a typical conditioner <b>101</b> cycle. During rest <b>155</b>, signal <b>193</b> is normally at zero psi or no boost. Also during rest <b>155</b>, signal <b>205</b> is normally at 0% actuation. Also during rest <b>155</b>, actuator <b>123</b> normally reflects that conditioner <b>101</b> is set for by-pass Also during rest <b>155</b>, sensor T<b>3</b> normally is at ambient temperature, between warm and cold. Additionally, during rest <b>155</b>, motor <b>111</b> is normally off.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0074">A period of pre-start <b>157</b> follows rest <b>155</b>. The pre-start can be entered by selecting on with switch <b>241</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) or turning host ignition to “on.” And ECU <b>127</b> will signal controller <b>133</b> to enable ODBC. During pre-start <b>157</b> and during normal operation where ambient temperatures exceed 50° F., controller <b>133</b> will direct TED <b>107</b> to pre-chill exchanger <b>128</b> and sensor T<b>3</b> will transition to cold. During pre-start <b>157</b>, other signal and sensor parameters will remain unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0075">A period of start <b>159</b> is shown next. The start <b>159</b> will see signal <b>205</b> changes as driver commands throttle to open to enable combustion. Little or no change in sensor T<b>3</b> should be seen with adequate insulation on housing <b>105</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>d</i>) and plate <b>121</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is closed although TED <b>107</b> is turned off during start <b>159</b> (when auxiliary power is not available). A period of driving normal <b>161</b> is shown next. During normal <b>161</b>, with normal ambient temperatures (over 50° F.) and an engine at normal operating temperature, little is changed. The signal <b>205</b> during normal driving period <b>161</b> will show small and varied demands reflecting small driving variations. The sensor T<b>3</b> will remain chilled during normal driving period <b>161</b> through housing isolation and recharging from driver <b>137</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>) when controller <b>133</b> directs TED <b>107</b> to continue to condition exchanger <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0076">A period of merge <b>163</b> is shown next where high demand is commanded. The period of merge <b>163</b> is initiated when signal <b>205</b> from ECU <b>127</b> indicates high demand on throttle from TPS <b>151</b>. A number of actions occur following signal <b>205</b> approaching 100%. The smart controller <b>133</b> will command motor <b>111</b> to spin up to full rpm.

As motor <b>111</b> spins up, signal <b>193</b> will report movement to full boost. An OBDC <b>101</b> without auxiliary power will shut off TED <b>107</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) during period <b>165</b> (if controller <b>133</b> cannot sequence TED <b>107</b> operations without parasitic effect on host vehicle power), and T<b>3</b> will indicate warming as a greater amount of exchanger <b>128</b> cold reserve is dissipated by transfer to air entering housing <b>105</b>. If auxiliary power <b>145</b> is available, TED <b>107</b> will be continuously charged during merge <b>163</b> and sensor T<b>3</b> will not show as rapid dissipation of exchanger <b>128</b> cold reserve. Upon completion of high demand operation, the following events are reported: TED signal <b>205</b> drops as TPS <b>151</b> reports closing motion of throttle butterfly <b>151</b><i>b</i>, signals <b>193</b> and <b>111</b> drop as signals report motor <b>111</b> shut down, signal for actuator <b>123</b> reports controller <b>133</b> commanding actuator <b>123</b> to close outlet <b>115</b> and open outlet <b>113</b>, and sensor T<b>3</b> reflects higher temperatures resulting from the discharge of thermal energy from conditioner <b>128</b>. A period of resume <b>165</b> is shown where high demand has ended. All values are in a steady state condition with signal <b>205</b> displaying slight variations as in normal driving and sensor T<b>3</b> building up a reserve for the next demand period.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0077">A period of pass <b>167</b> is shown next where high demand is again commanded. The period of pass <b>167</b> initiates with signal <b>205</b> moving towards 100% as ECU <b>127</b> indicates high throttle demand from TPS <b>151</b>. A number of actions occur as signal <b>205</b> approaches 100%. The controller <b>133</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) will command motor <b>111</b> to spin up to full rpm and signal <b>111</b> shows increased RPMs. As motor <b>111</b> spins up, signal <b>193</b> will show increasing boost, as the signal for actuator <b>123</b> shows controller <b>133</b> commanding actuator <b>123</b> to conditioner open state (this will select conditioner outlet <b>115</b> and close by-pass <b>113</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). As in merge <b>163</b>, what sensor T<b>3</b> reports of exchanger <b>128</b> temperature reserve reflects commands of controller <b>133</b> to TED <b>107</b> to continue charging exchanger <b>128</b> to cool, which depend on presence of power <b>145</b>. In the absence of power <b>145</b>, controller <b>133</b> will, consistent with protection of host vehicle power system, either shut down TED <b>107</b> or issue sequenced commands to TED <b>107</b> to recharge exchanger <b>128</b> to cool, with the most rapid sequencing possible sought by controller <b>133</b> in light of input from ECU <b>127</b> reflecting battery <b>149</b> conditions and alternator <b>147</b> conditions. In that case sensor, T<b>3</b> will report more rapidly rising temperatures of exchanger <b>128</b> than would be reported by sensor T<b>3</b> if auxiliary power <b>145</b> were present to enable TED <b>107</b> to continuously recharge exchanger <b>128</b>. When pass <b>167</b> is completed, signal <b>205</b> drops to reflect reduced throttle demand, motor <b>111</b> is shut down, conditioner <b>101</b> reverts back to normal operation with signal <b>123</b> showing bypass selected and conditioner closed, signal <b>193</b> reflects boost drop to zero, and sensor T<b>3</b> reflects a period of recharge. A second resume <b>165</b> will follow pass <b>167</b> (not shown). Signals will normally remain in this configuration until another demand is commanded or system is turned off.</p>

These solutions will not work until the engine has run for a number of minutes. The discussion that follows supplements those systems to address cold start and initial operation impacts on the host vehicle engine.

During pre-start <b>175</b>, sensor T<b>3</b> will reflect a rising temperature of exchanger <b>128</b> during preparation for assisting in improved starting of host engine. The processor <b>133</b> will continue to command TED <b>107</b> to warm sensor T<b>3</b> until start is initiated or system is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0080">A cold start <b>177</b> period follows. During start <b>177</b>, motor <b>111</b> is spun up to low rpm to facilitate airflow through exchanger <b>128</b>. Controller <b>133</b> will command actuator <b>123</b> to set conditioner <b>101</b> for conditioner operation (plate <b>113</b> closed and plate <b>115</b> opened (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>)). The signal <b>193</b> will exhibit about a 20% increase in pressure from motor <b>111</b> spinning turbine blade <b>125</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and the resulting conditioned airflow will give the cold host engine warmer than ambient temperature air to improve combustion and minimize start time and difficulty. During start <b>177</b>, if system does not feature power <b>145</b>, smart controller <b>133</b> will shut down or sequence TED <b>107</b>, consistent with safe operation of host vehicle electrical system and battery <b>149</b>. During start <b>177</b>, sensor T<b>3</b> will report cooling of exchanger <b>128</b> as thermal energy is transferred to air, but less thermal energy will be lost in a system equipped with power <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0081">When engine achieves ignition and reaches idle, a period of cold pre-normal <b>179</b> is entered. All conditions are initially kept as in start <b>177</b> except TED <b>107</b> is re-enabled or run continuously on non-auxiliary powered systems and signal <b>205</b> reflects typical driving requirements. The pre-normal <b>179</b> operation will continue until sensor T<b>5</b> informs processor <b>133</b> that exhaust temperature is sufficiently high (based on host vehicle requirements, frequently over 100° F.) to warm incoming air via operation of valves <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> and pipe <b>124</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). When this occurs a cold-normal <b>181</b> operation period is entered. The cold-normal <b>181</b> period has air warmed by host vehicle's pipe <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and supplemental action by ODBC can cease.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0082">During cold-normal <b>181</b>, the following changes occur: signal <b>193</b> will remain at 0, actuator <b>123</b> will reflect conditioner <b>101</b> in by-pass operation with conditioner closed, motor <b>111</b> signal will report drop to 0, and signal <b>205</b> will reflect normal driving operation of TPS <b>151</b>. Additionally, sensor T<b>3</b> will indicate the transition to cold in preparation for future demand driving. An operation period where traffic demands require additional power, merge <b>183</b> is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0083">A period of cold merge <b>183</b> is shown next where high demand is commanded. The period of merge <b>183</b> shows signal <b>205</b> going to 100% to indicate a full throttle demand situation. A number of actions occur following signal <b>205</b> transitioning to 100%. The controller <b>133</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) will command motor <b>111</b> to spin up to full rpm. The controller <b>133</b> commands actuator <b>123</b> to set valves for conditioner operation. As motor <b>111</b> spins up signal <b>193</b> will approach full boost. A system without auxiliary power will shut off or sequence TED <b>107</b> during this period and a greater amount of sensor T<b>3</b> cold reserve will be dissipated during merge <b>183</b>. If auxiliary power is available TED <b>107</b> will be continuously charged during merge <b>183</b> and sensor T<b>3</b> will reflect less cold reserve dissipation. Upon completion of high demand operation signal <b>205</b> drops and motor <b>111</b> is shut down, conditioner <b>101</b> reverts to normal operation with by-pass selected and conditioner closed, signal <b>193</b> drops to zero, and sensor T<b>3</b> reflects a period of recharge. A period of resume <b>185</b> is shown where high demand has ended. All values are in a steady state condition with signal <b>205</b> displaying slight variations and sensor T<b>3</b> building up a reserve for the next demand period.</p>

The switch <b>241</b> is shown with double poles to enable system power (VCC) from cable <b>140</b> through connector <b>209</b> or back up battery <b>221</b>. The switch <b>243</b> is shown selecting either a chill signal line <b>196</b> or a warm signal line <b>198</b> from VCC to a display controller <b>215</b>. The cable <b>140</b> through connector <b>209</b> also connects to communications interface controller <b>223</b>. The controller <b>223</b> will receive and transmit data and signals to controller <b>215</b> from processor <b>133</b><i>p </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, over cable <b>140</b> and external data over connector <b>255</b>. An enunciator driver <b>231</b> is provided to drive display lamps (LEDs). A current driving resistor R<b>1</b> (X<b>4</b>) is provided for enabling lamps when energized by controller <b>215</b> from VCC through driver <b>231</b>.

In an embodiment, an ODBC may use multiple junctions or advanced technology (such as a nanostructure). TED that utilizes Peltier junctions can be stacked or distributed in series to accomplish required capacities and recharge cycle time. Advanced TED structures such as thermotunneling (CoolChips), superlattice structures (MIT's Lincoln Labs), and TE unicouples (JPL) should be incorporated into ODBC when available. Communications between modules, vehicle and external sources may include but are not limited to radio, magnetic, infrared or combination of these techniques. In some embodiments a remote collection or command scenario may supplement operation. While a positive displacement type of booster is discussed a more modestly priced blower (such as a leaf blower; example Makita UB 181 DZ) may be substituted with lower boost capabilities but distinct price advantages.
