<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a cyclone dust collector of a vacuum cleaner, and more particularly, to a cyclone dust collector for collecting dust and dirt entrained in an air stream (hereinafter, referred to as ‘dust’) by centrifugally separating the same several times in successive, sequential steps.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which is a partially enlarged vertical section of a cyclone dust collector of a conventional vacuum cleaner, the general conventional cyclone dust collector comprises a cyclone body <b>110</b> and a filter <b>130</b> mounted in the cyclone body <b>110</b>. In a device receiving unit <b>10</b> of a cleaner body <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cyclone dust collector <b>100</b> is mounted. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the following elements are disposed at the rear side of the device receiving unit <b>10</b>: an air suction connection port <b>13</b> (shown in phantom) for drawing in air including entrained dust; and an air discharge connection port <b>14</b> for discharging clean air which is filtered in the cyclone dust collector <b>100</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which is disposed within a receptacle <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that can be removably inserted into the vacuum cleaner main body <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The cyclone body <b>110</b> comprises an air suction port <b>113</b> (shown in phantom) and an air discharge port <b>115</b>, and also a dust receptacle <b>120</b> connected to a lower part of the cyclone body <b>110</b>. The air suction port <b>113</b> is formed in a sidewall of the cyclone body <b>110</b> so as to introduce an air stream in a tangential direction, and is connected to the suction connection port <b>13</b> of the main body <b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The air flowing in through the suction connection port <b>13</b> is discharged into the cyclone body <b>110</b> through the air suction port <b>113</b>, and generates a rotating or cyclonic air current. At this time, the dust in the air is separated by the centrifugal force of the rotating air and is collected in the dust receptacle <b>120</b>. Preferably, the dust receptacle <b>120</b> is removably connected to the cyclone body <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The air discharge port <b>115</b> is disposed in a center portion of the upper part of the cyclone body <b>110</b>, and is connected to the discharge connection port <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the cleaner main body <b>3</b>. Accordingly, the air, from which the dust has been centrifugally separated in the cyclone body <b>110</b>, is discharged through the discharge connection port <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, a filter <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is disposed in the dust receptacle <b>120</b> and is in fluid communication with an opening of the air discharge port <b>115</b>. The filter <b>130</b> filters fine dust particles entrained in the air after it has been centrifuged in the cyclone body <b>110</b>. After the dust is removed through the filter <b>130</b>, the clean air is discharged externally through the discharge connection port <b>14</b>. Further, the filter <b>130</b> prevents a reverse current flow of the discharged air.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in the cyclone dust collector <b>100</b> of most conventional vacuum cleaners, dust, which is centrifugally separated and collected in the dust receptacle, is entrained and flows together with the rising air current, thereby generating noise when colliding with the filter <b>130</b>. Further, the floating dust adheres to the surface of the filter <b>130</b>, thereby impeding smooth flow of the air through the filtration section of the vacuum cleaner. In addition, a single filter <b>130</b> of the conventional cyclone dust collector cannot filter satisfactorily when there is a lot of dust in the drawn in air. Therefore, the life span of each filter is significantly reduced, causing the concomitant inconvenience of requiring frequent replacement of filters.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention, considering the above problems, to provide a cyclone dust collector to improve the capability of a vacuum cleaner, by separately collecting dust entrained in drawn in air in sequential steps in decreasing order of the dust particle size.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the present invention is to provide a cyclone dust collector for a vacuum cleaner that decreases noise and prevents adhesion of dust to a filter.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a cyclone dust collector for a vacuum cleaner that is superior in removing dust despite large amounts of dust being entrained in the drawn in air. Preferably, the inventive vacuum cleaner does not need frequent replacement of the filter, and has a long life span.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to achieve the above-described objects of the present invention, there is provided a cyclone dust collector for a vacuum cleaner, comprising a lower cyclone body for initially separating dust entrained in air drawn in through an air suction port, an upper cyclone body for secondary separation of fine dust particles entrained in the air which is initially filtered in the lower cyclone body, and a central air path for guiding the air which has been initially filtered in the upper cyclone body along a center axis line, and discharging the air through an air discharge port disposed in the lower cyclone body.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the lower and upper cyclone bodies respectively comprise air passage holes in contact with respect to a second central air path to supply the air initially filtered in the lower cyclone body to the upper cyclone body.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The central air path comprises an upper air path formed vertically along the center axis of the upper cyclone body, having an air outlet formed in an outer surface thereof, and a lower air path extending in a smooth bend from a center portion of the lower cyclone body toward the air discharge port. Here, it is preferable that a filter is further comprised outside of the upper air path.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Meanwhile, initial separation of the dust from the drawn in air is performed by a grill vertically mounted in the lower cyclone body to filter the air flowing therethrough, after the air passes through the air suction port and the air flow is directed to rotate in an air current and the dust entrained in the air is separated by the centrifugal force of the rotating air current.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, the dust collector may further comprise a removable dust receptacle connected to a lower part of the lower cyclone body to collect the dust which has been centrifugally separated inside the lower cyclone body.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, it is preferable that a dust amount determining unit is further comprised for indicating the amount of the dust which has been separated and collected in the upper cyclone body.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the present invention, there can be provided a cyclone dust collector of a vacuum cleaner which circulates the drawn in air in the lower and upper cyclone bodies, and separately collects the dust in sequence of the size thereof. Therefore, the dust collector according to the present invention efficiently removes dust regardless of the amount and has a longer life span since the filter does not have to be replaced often. Especially, according to the present invention, a noise of the cleaner and the dust adhering to the filter can be reduced.</p>

The upper flange unit <b>63</b> is shaped in an inverse truncated cone extending upwardly from an upper part of the lower grill unit <b>61</b>, and is connected with an inside wall surface of the lower cyclone body <b>40</b>. To provide a secure connection at the lower cyclone body <b>40</b>, an end <b>6</b> of the upper flange unit <b>63</b> is bent downwardly. In addition, at an upper part of an inside surface wall of the lower cyclone body <b>40</b>, a connection rib <b>65</b> is formed for providing a hooking engagement with the bent end <b>64</b> of the upper flange unit <b>63</b>. The lower flange unit <b>67</b> is extended downwardly from the bottom part of the lower grill unit <b>61</b> and preferably takes the form of a bell shape, as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the lower cyclone body <b>40</b>, the drawn in air, which is introduced through the air suction port <b>41</b>, forms a rotating air current centering about the lower grill <b>60</b>. At this time, the dust in the drawn in air is initially separated by the centrifugal force of the air of the rotating air current, and is collected by the action of gravity in the dust receptacle <b>25</b>. The dust receptacle <b>25</b> is removably connected at the lower part of the lower cyclone body <b>40</b>, and therefore, dust collected therein can be easily removed by separating the dust receptacle <b>25</b> from the lower cyclone body <b>40</b> for emptying. Along an upper rim of the dust receptacle <b>25</b>, a connection groove <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is formed in a circumferential direction, and the lower end of the lower cyclone body <b>40</b> provides a protrusion that can be force-fit into the connection groove <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The air, which is initially separated in the lower cyclone body <b>40</b>, is passed through the lower grill <b>60</b> and then is upwardly discharged. Here, since the lower slits <b>62</b> of the lower grill <b>60</b> are of a predetermined size, dust of a relatively large particle size of the discharged air current is blocked, while the air passes through the lower grill <b>60</b>. At this stage, the lower grill <b>60</b> can not block fine dust particles, for example, those under a certain size. Accordingly, the air may still include fine dust particles as it is directed into the upper cyclone body <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an exploded perspective view of an upper cyclone body <b>30</b>. The upper cyclone body <b>30</b> preferably has a cylindrical shape with the top being open, and includes an upper cover <b>39</b> removably connected with the top opening thereof. On a bottom plate <b>31</b> of the upper cyclone body <b>30</b>, a plurality of upper air passage holes <b>36</b> are disposed to permit the air flowing in from the lower cyclone body <b>40</b> and an upper center hole <b>34</b> is provided for discharging the air inside thereof. In addition, an upper air path <b>33</b> projects upwardly and is disposed centrally of the upper air passage hole <b>36</b>, and a plurality of air outlets <b>35</b> are formed circumferentially at an outside of the upper air passage hole <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The upper center hole <b>34</b> and upper air passage holes <b>36</b> of the upper cyclone body <b>30</b> are formed corresponding to the positions of the lower center hole <b>44</b> and the lower air passage holes <b>46</b>, respectively, of the lower cyclone body <b>40</b>. Accordingly, the air in the upper cyclone body <b>30</b> is permitted to flow out through the air outlets <b>35</b>, and then is discharged through the upper center hole <b>34</b>. The upper air path <b>33</b> of the upper cyclone body <b>30</b> and the lower air path <b>45</b> of the lower cyclone body <b>40</b> are in fluid communication to each other, thereby forming a center air path <b>51</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of the cyclone dust collector <b>20</b> according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The air outlets <b>35</b> of the upper air path <b>33</b> can serve as a filter unit, in the same manner as the lower grill <b>60</b>. However, for more effective filtering of the fine dust particles, it is more preferable that a fine particle filter <b>70</b> is mounted circumferentially outside of the air outlets <b>35</b>. Accordingly, after the initial separation of the dust, fine dust particles, which are still entrained in the air, are separated from the air stream by a secondary filtering process. More preferably, a porous filtering member <b>73</b> is mounted outside of the filter <b>70</b>. The porous filtering member <b>73</b> improves dust filtering and collecting efficiency and the life span of the filter <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Here, the bottom plate <b>31</b> of the upper cyclone body <b>30</b> can be formed separately, as specifically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the case of a separate manufacturing process step of the bottom plate <b>31</b>, it is preferable that the upper center hole <b>34</b>, the upper air passage holes <b>36</b>, and the upper air path <b>33</b> are integrally formed by injection molding. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, bottom plate <b>31</b> may be connected to the housing upper cyclone body <b>30</b> by using a plurality of connection members, such as the screws shown.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An upper cover <b>39</b> covers the top of the upper cyclone body <b>30</b>, and an operation knob <b>95</b> projects in a depression to provide a hold for a user. A connection projection <b>96</b> is projected downwardly under the upper cover <b>39</b>, and a locking hole portion <b>97</b> is formed to fit in with and engage the connection projection <b>96</b> on top of the upper air path <b>33</b>. In the locking hole portion <b>97</b>, a long hole <b>98</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is formed extending in one direction, to receive the connection projection <b>96</b> therethrough into the locking hole portion <b>97</b>. The connection projection <b>96</b> inserted into the locking hole portion <b>97</b> is rotatable by the operation knob <b>95</b> for switching between a locked position and an unlocked position by rotation of the operation knob <b>95</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The above-structured cyclone dust collector <b>20</b> of a vacuum cleaner is removably connected to the device receiving chamber <b>10</b> of the main body <b>3</b> of the vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The dust receptacle <b>25</b> is removed or replaced while being connected with the lower cyclone body <b>40</b>, and the upper cyclone body <b>30</b> is connectable with the lower cyclone body <b>40</b>, either integrally or separately. When the lower cyclone body <b>40</b> is received within the chamber <b>10</b>, the air suction port <b>41</b> and the air discharge port <b>42</b> are connected, respectively, to the suction connection port <b>13</b> and the discharge connection port <b>14</b>, which extend from the device receiving chamber <b>10</b>. To securely engage the upper cyclone body <b>30</b> to the upper part of the lower cyclone body <b>40</b>, it is preferable that a seating guide groove is formed in the upper plate <b>40</b>′ of the lower cyclone body <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the device is switched on, the vacuum generating device (not shown) is driven. At this time, the air in which dust and dirt are entrained, is drawn in through the suction brush <b>5</b>, and is discharged to the air suction port <b>41</b> of the lower cyclone body <b>40</b> through the suction connection port <b>13</b>. The discharged air including the entrained dust is directed to produce a rotating air current in the lower cyclone body <b>40</b>, and thereby the dust is first separated by the centrifugal force of the cyclonic air stream. The separated dust is collected in the dust receptacle <b>25</b>. The filtered air passes through the lower grill <b>60</b> and then rises into the upper cyclone body <b>30</b> through the air passage holes <b>46</b>, <b>36</b>. Here, the lower grill <b>60</b> blocks relatively large particles of dust in the air which has been filtered once.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Meanwhile, the air discharged into the upper cyclone body <b>30</b> moves to the upper air path <b>33</b> in which the air outlets <b>35</b> are formed. At this time, the filter <b>70</b> filters fine dust particles entrained in the air in a secondary filtration process. After the air has been filtered, the fine dust particles drop to the bottom of the chamber to be collected in the upper cyclone body <b>30</b>. After the fine dust particles are separated, the air is discharged into the air discharge port <b>42</b> sequentially through the air outlet <b>35</b> of the upper air path <b>33</b> and the lower air path <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the lower and upper cyclone bodies <b>40</b>, <b>30</b>, the amount of dust gradually increases with continued collection thereof. Relatively large dust particles, which are collected in the lower cyclone body <b>40</b>, are removed by separating the dust receptacle <b>25</b> from the lower cyclone body <b>42</b> and emptying it. In order to withdraw the lower cyclone body <b>40</b> and the dust receptacle <b>25</b> from the device receiving chamber <b>10</b>, a withdraw lever <b>28</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is operated. That is, the dust receptacle <b>25</b>, which is hooked in the device receiving chamber <b>10</b>, can be separated by turning the withdraw lever <b>28</b>. To remove the fine dust particles collected in the upper cyclone body <b>30</b>, the upper cyclone body <b>30</b> is withdrawn first, and then the upper cover <b>39</b> is separated therefrom before emptying.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The amount of collected dust is monitored by a dust determining unit <b>80</b>, which is mounted in the upper cyclone body <b>30</b>, to indicate the amount of the collected dust. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a partially enlarged section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, showing in detail the structure of the dust amount determining unit <b>80</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the dust amount determining unit <b>80</b> comprises a casing <b>81</b>, an over dust indicator <b>83</b> to be connected within the casing <b>81</b>, a standard dust indicator <b>85</b> which is movable between a cover position and an exposure position of the over dust indicator <b>83</b>, and a spring <b>87</b> for elastically biasing the standard dust indicator <b>85</b> toward the cover position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The casing <b>81</b> preferably is made of a transparent material, having an outlet <b>82</b> at an end thereof. The over dust indicator <b>83</b> is connected to a lower part of the casing <b>81</b> at the opposite end from outlet <b>82</b>, and has a pressure inlet <b>84</b> on the bottom thereof. The over dust indicator <b>83</b> comprises an indication unit <b>86</b>, which extends upwardly along the casing <b>81</b> in a longitudinal direction. The standard dust indicator <b>85</b> receives the indication unit <b>86</b> of the over dust indicator <b>83</b>, all encompassed within the casing <b>81</b>. Further, the spring <b>87</b> is disposed between the standard dust indicator <b>85</b> and the opening <b>82</b> of the casing <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The dust amount determining unit <b>80</b> preferably is fixed to a front portion of the upper cyclone body <b>30</b>. Brackets <b>91</b>, <b>92</b> are oppositely disposed at the top and bottom of the front portion of the upper cyclone body <b>30</b>. Here, the pressure inlet <b>84</b> of the standard dust indicator <b>85</b> is in fluid communication with the inside of the upper cyclone body <b>30</b>, and the air outlet <b>82</b> of the casing <b>81</b> is in fluid communication with the external air. Additionally, on the front portion of the upper cyclone body <b>30</b>, on which dust amount determining unit <b>80</b> is fixed, there is disposed an observation window <b>37</b> that is open in order to provide visibility to the internal elements of unit <b>80</b>. The user can check the status of the dust amount determining unit <b>80</b> through the observation window <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the above described structure, when the amount of dust in the upper cyclone body <b>30</b> is under a predetermined threshold, the air flows in through the upper air passage hole <b>36</b> and is smoothly discharged through the air discharge port <b>42</b> passing through the filter <b>70</b> and the upper air path <b>33</b>. When the air flow is unimpeded, both the inside and outside of the upper cyclone body <b>30</b> are at the same air pressure so that the dust amount determining unit <b>80</b> is exposed through the observation window <b>37</b>, since the dust indicator <b>85</b> is in a position that blocks the over dust indicator <b>83</b> because of the elastic recovery force of the spring <b>87</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">On the other hand, when the amount of dust is over the predetermined threshold to the extent that the collected dust requires removal, the inside air pressure becomes relatively higher than the outside air pressure, since the airflow of the inside is impeded. Then, the inside air pressure provides a force to the pressure inlet <b>84</b> of the standard dust indicator <b>85</b>, thereby pressing the standard dust indicator <b>85</b>. Accordingly, the standard dust indicator <b>85</b> exposes the over dust indicator <b>83</b>, and the over dust indicator <b>83</b> is seen through the observation window <b>37</b>. As a result, the user becomes aware of excessive dust in the upper cyclone body <b>30</b>, and can withdraw the upper cyclone body <b>30</b> from the device receiving unit <b>10</b> to remove the dust, when it is convenient to do so.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">While the invention has been shown and described with reference to specific preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, alterations and changes in form and detail may be made to the disclosed invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
