<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to end caps for paper tubes, paper tubes having end caps connected thereto, and methods of closing an open end of a paper tube.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Paper tubes are conventionally formed by adhesively bonding two or more continuous strips of paper to each other in overlapping layers around a cylindrical mandrel and then cutting the paper cylinder or tube thus formed to desired length. The open ends of the paper tube can then be closed using a suitable end closure to form a container that is both light and strong.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A variety of end closures are known in the art for closing the open end of a paper tube. A very popular type is known in the industry as a plastic end cap or plug. Conventional plastic plugs include a bottom wall having a substantially circular peripheral edge and a sidewall that extends from the peripheral edge. In most cases, the plastic plug further comprises an annular flange that extends from the sidewall. The outer diameter of the flange is typically larger than the inner diameter of the paper tube and thus the flange acts as a stop or limiting rim that prohibits the plug from being pressed completely into the paper tube. The plug is retained in the end of the paper tube by a friction fit between outer surface of the sidewall and the inner surface of the paper tube. One or more ribs or ridges are sometimes formed on the outer surface of the sidewall to improve contact between the outer surface of the sidewall and the inner surface of the paper tube.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Plastic plugs are relatively simple to manufacture, inexpensive and lightweight. In addition, they can easily be inserted into and removed from an open end of a paper tube by hand. These features make plastic plugs particularly suitable for use forming mailing tubes or other similar shipping containers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are some drawbacks with the use of plastic plugs, however. Plastic plugs can sometimes “pop” out of one or both ends of the paper tube, which then allows the contents of the container to spill out. The plugs can “pop” out when the paper tube is squeezed or when the contents of the container shift during transit and strike the interior side of the bottom wall causing it to become dislodged from the paper tube.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Adhesive tape is sometimes applied over the plastic plug in an effort to insure that the plastic plug remains in the tube. Alternatively, staples are sometimes used to secure the plastic plug to the paper tube. Both of these solutions are disadvantageous because they can cause damage to the paper tube and/or the plastic plug and because they require additional time consuming steps or procedures. Moreover, use of adhesive or staples can damage the tube and/or end cap, which prevents reuse.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides an end cap in combination with a paper tube. The paper tube has one or more inwardly extending flaps at an open end. The end cap has a bottom wall and a sidewall that extends from a peripheral edge of the bottom wall. The end cap receives and engages the inwardly extending flaps when the end cap is disposed in the open end of the paper tube. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the paper tube has a plurality of inwardly extending flaps at the open end and the sidewall of the end cap is provided with a plurality of channels for receiving and engaging the plurality of inwardly extending flaps when the end cap is disposed in the open end of the paper tube.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention also provides a method of closing an open end of a paper tube using an end cap according to the invention. In accordance with the method, an inwardly extending flap is formed at the open end of the paper tube. The end cap is then inserted cap bottom wall first into the open end of the paper tube and then rotated relative to the paper tube until the inwardly extending flaps are received in and engaged by the channel. Preferably, the bottom wall of the end cap further comprises a projection for facilitating rotation of the end plug within the open end of the paper tube.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an alternative embodiment of the method of the invention, the end cap is inserted into the paper tube before the inwardly extending flaps are formed at the open end of the paper tube. When the end cap is inserted into the paper tube bottom wall first, a portion of the sidewall proximal to the peripheral edge of the bottom wall circumferentially contacts the inner surface of the paper tube. The inwardly extending flaps are formed and then the end cap is rotated relative to the paper tube until the inwardly extending flaps are received in and engaged by the channels.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet another embodiment, the end cap is inserted into the paper tube before the inwardly extending flaps are formed at the open end of the paper tube. When the end cap is inserted into the paper tube bottom wall first, a portion of the sidewall proximal to the peripheral edge of the bottom wall circumferentially contacts the inner surface of the paper tube. The inwardly extending flaps are formed and then a wing extending from a top portion of the sidewall is bent downwardly and locked against an outer side of the inwardly extending flap.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The end cap and paper tube combination according to the invention is lightweight and very strong. The end cap can be inserted into the open end of the paper tube and secured thereto without the need for special tools. Furthermore, the end cap is very difficult to accidentally or unintentionally dislodge from the tube. However, it can be easily removed by hand and reused. No fasteners or adhesives need be used.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The foregoing and other features of the invention are hereinafter more fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims, the following description setting forth in detail certain illustrative embodiments of the invention, these being indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the present invention may be employed.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention provides a combination comprising a paper tube and an end cap connected to an open end of the paper tube. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the paper tube <b>10</b> includes at least one and more preferably a plurality of inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> at an open end <b>30</b>. Each inwardly extending flap <b>20</b> has an inner side <b>40</b> that generally faces toward an interior portion <b>50</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> and an outer side <b>60</b> that generally faces away from the interior portion <b>50</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b>. The end cap is pressed into and received within the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> to close and seal the open end <b>30</b>, thereby isolating the interior portion <b>50</b> from the outside of the paper tube <b>10</b>. The end cap includes portions that contact and engage both the inner side <b>40</b> and the outer side <b>60</b> of the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> are preferably formed by pressing and folding a top edge <b>70</b> of the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> inwardly toward the interior portion <b>50</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b>. Depending upon the configuration of the end cap, the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> can either be formed before or after the end cap has been pressed into the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b>. A sizing die or pattern can be used to define the size and location of the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> or, alternatively, the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> can simply be formed using one's fingers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an end view of a paper tube <b>10</b> having a pair of opposing inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> formed at an open end <b>30</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a side view of the paper tube <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as viewed in the direction shown by the arrow III. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an end view of a paper tube <b>10</b> having three inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> formed at an open end <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, applicant has found that the outer side <b>60</b> of the inwardly extending flap <b>20</b> will optimally define an arc of a circle <b>80</b> having a diameter D<b>1</b> that is about one-half of the diameter D<b>2</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b>. The depth D<b>3</b> of the inwardly extending flap <b>20</b> is not per se critical, but is preferably between about one-tenth to about one-sixth of the diameter D<b>2</b> of the paper tube. A depth of about one-eighth of the diameter of the paper tube is presently considered optimal.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As will be shown in greater detail below, the end cap can be configured in various ways. For example, the end cap can comprise a single unit that has no moving parts. Alternatively, the end cap can comprise a single unit that does have moving parts. Or, the end cap can be formed from two or more pieces that are joined together. In all embodiments, however, the end cap includes a bottom wall having a peripheral edge and a sidewall that extends from the peripheral edge. At least a portion of the sidewall or peripheral edge must contact at least a portion of the inner wall of the paper tube. Furthermore, portions of the end cap must contact and engage both the inner side and the outer side of the inwardly extending flaps.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A first embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>. In this embodiment, the end cap <b>90</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, constitutes a single unit that has no moving parts. The end cap <b>90</b> comprises a bottom wall <b>100</b> having a peripheral edge <b>110</b> and a sidewall <b>120</b> that extends from the peripheral edge <b>110</b>. The sidewall <b>120</b> includes a channel <b>130</b> or slit that is configured to receive and engage an inwardly extending flap <b>20</b> when the end cap <b>90</b> is disposed in the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b>. The end cap <b>90</b> further preferably comprises an annular flange <b>140</b> that extends from the sidewall <b>120</b>. The annular flange <b>140</b> has an outer diameter that is larger than the diameter D<b>2</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> and thus operates as a stop or limiting surface that prevents the end cap <b>90</b> from being pressed too far within the paper tube <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> are formed at the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> before the end cap <b>90</b> is pressed into the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b>. The peripheral edge <b>110</b> of the bottom wall <b>100</b> of the end cap <b>90</b> is not circular, but rather it is somewhat hourglass-shaped sufficiently to allow the end cap <b>90</b> to slide into the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> after the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> have been formed. The end cap <b>90</b> is pressed into the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> until the top edge <b>70</b> of the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> contacts the annular flange <b>140</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the end cap <b>90</b> is rotated in the direction of the arrow while disposed within the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> until the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> are received within the channel <b>130</b> and the end cap engages both the inner side <b>40</b> and the outer side <b>60</b> of the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b>. To assist in rotating the end cap <b>90</b>, the bottom wall <b>100</b> includes a projection <b>150</b> that can be gripped using one's fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Once the end cap <b>90</b> is inserted into the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> and rotated, the end cap <b>90</b> is very difficult to dislodge from the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b>. The end cap <b>90</b> is retained in the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> by the friction between the sidewall <b>120</b> and the inner wall of the paper tube <b>10</b> and by the mechanical lock formed between the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> that are trapped and engaged within the channel <b>130</b>. The end cap <b>90</b> can be separated from the paper tube <b>10</b> simply by rotating the end cap <b>90</b> back to the first position and pulling the end cap <b>90</b> from the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, two opposing inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> are formed at the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b>. It is much more difficult to dislodge an end cap <b>90</b> with channels <b>130</b> for receiving and engaging two opposing inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> than it is to dislodge an end cap <b>90</b> having only one channel <b>130</b> for receiving and engaging one inwardly extending flap <b>20</b>. End caps <b>90</b> provided with three channels <b>130</b> for receiving and engaging three inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> are also very difficult to dislodge from the open end <b>30</b> of a paper tube <b>10</b>. Although it is possible, it is somewhat difficult to form four or more inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> at the open end <b>30</b> of a paper tube <b>10</b>. Paper tubes having two or three inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> formed at equally spaced intervals about the open end are therefore most preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In order to improve the aesthetic appearance of the end cap and paper tube combination, the end cap can further optionally comprise a skirt that extends downwardly from the perimeter of the flange. The skirt is configured to contact an outer surface of the paper tube proximal to the open end. The skirt contacts the outer surface of the paper tube and thereby conceals the channels from view when the end cap is attached to the paper tube.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The present invention also provides a first method of closing an open end of a paper tube. The first method of the invention comprises forming an inwardly extending flap at an open end of a paper tube. Once the inwardly extending flap has been formed, an end cap having a bottom wall with a peripheral edge, a sidewall extending from the peripheral edge, and a channel formed in the sidewall is inserted bottom wall first into the open end of the paper tube. The end cap is then rotated relative to the paper tube until the inwardly extending flap is received in and engaged by the channel. More preferably, a plurality of inwardly extending flaps are formed at the open end of the paper tube, and each such inwardly extending flap is received in and engaged by a separate channel formed in the sidewall of the end cap.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an exemplary end cap <b>90</b> for use in a second embodiment of the invention. In the second embodiment of the invention, the end cap <b>90</b> has a bottom wall <b>100</b> with a peripheral edge <b>110</b> that is substantially circular in shape. A sidewall <b>120</b> extends from the peripheral edge <b>110</b>. The outer diameter of the sidewall <b>120</b> proximal to the peripheral edge <b>110</b> of the bottom wall <b>100</b> is equal to or slightly larger than the inner diameter D<b>2</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b>. Thus, at least the portion of the sidewall <b>120</b> that is proximal to the peripheral edge <b>110</b> of the bottom wall <b>100</b> of the end cap <b>90</b> circumferentially contacts and frictionally engages the inner wall of the paper tube <b>10</b> when the end cap <b>90</b> is pressed into and thus disposed in the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> bottom wall <b>100</b> first.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At least one and preferably a plurality of equally spaced recesses <b>160</b> or openings are formed in the sidewall <b>120</b> above the peripheral edge <b>110</b>. The recesses <b>160</b> or openings define where the top edge <b>70</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> should be inwardly pressed in order to form inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b>. The recesses thus serve as forming dies for the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b>. One can form the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> simply by pressing the top edge <b>70</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> inwardly with one's fingers against the recesses <b>160</b>. A channel <b>130</b> or slit is formed in the sidewall <b>120</b> adjacent to each recess <b>160</b>. Once the inwardly extending flap <b>20</b> is formed at the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b>, the end cap <b>90</b> is rotated relative to the paper tube <b>10</b> until the inwardly extending flap <b>20</b> is received and engaged within the corresponding channel <b>130</b> formed in the sidewall <b>120</b>. As in the first embodiment, it is preferable for the end cap to include a plurality of recesses <b>160</b> and corresponding channels <b>130</b> or slits.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present invention thus provides a second method of closing an open end of a paper tube. The second method comprises providing an end cap having a bottom wall having a peripheral edge and a sidewall extending from the peripheral edge. The sidewall must include at least one and preferably a plurality of recessed areas or opening for forming inwardly extending flaps at the open end of the paper tube when the end cap is disposed in the open end of the paper tube bottom wall first, and a t least one and preferably a plurality of channels adjacent to the recessed areas for receiving and engaging inwardly extending flaps. The end cap is inserted bottom wall first into the open end of a paper tube such that at least a portion of the sidewall proximal to the peripheral edge of the bottom wall circumferentially contacts an inner surface of the paper tube. Next, at least one and preferably a plurality of inwardly extending flaps are formed at the open end of the paper tube. The forming step can be accomplished by pressing the top edge of the paper tube into the recessed areas or openings. Next, the end cap is rotated relative to the paper tube until each inwardly extending flap is received in and engaged within the channel adjacent to the recessed area.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an exemplary end cap <b>90</b> for use in a third embodiment of the invention. In the third embodiment of the invention, the end cap <b>90</b> is a unitary structure that comprises a hinged wing <b>170</b> that extends from a top portion <b>180</b> of the sidewall <b>120</b>. The hinged wing <b>170</b> is movable from a first position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) where the hinged wing <b>170</b> does not contact the outer side <b>60</b> of the inwardly extending flap <b>20</b> to a second position where at least a portion of the hinged wing <b>170</b> does contact and engage the outer side <b>60</b> of the inwardly extending flap. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a sectional view of the end cap <b>90</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> disposed in the open end <b>30</b> of a paper tube <b>10</b> with the hinged wings <b>170</b> in a first position. The inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> were formed at the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> before the end cap <b>90</b> was pressed into the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>, the peripheral edge <b>110</b> of the bottom wall <b>100</b> of the end cap <b>90</b> is not circular, but rather it is somewhat hourglass-shaped sufficiently to allow the end cap <b>90</b> to slide into the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> after the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> have been formed. The end cap <b>90</b> is pressed into the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> until the top edge <b>70</b> of the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> contacts the annular flange <b>140</b>. The end cap <b>90</b> has been rotated relative to the paper tube <b>10</b> such as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> until the inner sides <b>40</b> of the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> are positioned above and in contact with a ledge <b>190</b> or base portion. Once the end cap <b>90</b> is inserted into the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> and rotated, the hinged wings <b>170</b> are moved to the second position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, without the paper tube) where the hinged wings <b>170</b> press against the outer sides <b>60</b> of the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b>. The hinged wings <b>170</b> can be retained in the second position using a snap-fit locking barb <b>200</b> and corresponding opening <b>210</b> in the sidewall <b>120</b> of the end cap <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It will be appreciated that an end cap <b>90</b> such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref> can alternatively have a peripheral edge <b>110</b> that contacts the inner surface of the paper tube, such as was previously described with respect to the second embodiment of the invention. However, when the peripheral edge <b>110</b> of the end cap <b>90</b> contacts the inner surface of the paper tube, the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> cannot be formed until after the end cap <b>90</b> has been pressed into the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b>. In such a configuration, the area below the hinged wings <b>170</b> and the ledge <b>190</b> serve as the recessed area <b>160</b> for use in forming the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b>. An end cap <b>90</b> having a peripheral edge that contacts the inner surface of the paper tube is inserted before the inwardly extending flaps are formed, and thus does not need to be rotated before the hinged wings <b>170</b> are moved from the first position to the second position, where the hinged wings <b>170</b> press against the outer sides <b>60</b> of the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b>. For this reason, paper tubes having shapes that are not circular in cross-section (e.g., tubes that are oval or triangular-shaped in cross-section) can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The present invention thus provides third and fourth methods of closing an open end of a paper tube. In the third method, an end cap is pressed bottom wall first into an open end of a paper tube that has at least one and preferably a plurality of inwardly extending flaps formed at the open end. The end cap is rotated until the inner side of the inwardly extending flap contacts (or is positioned above and thus contactable with) a ledge formed in the sidewall of the end cap. Next, a hinged wing extending from a top portion of the sidewall is moved from a first position where the hinged wing does not contact the outer side of the inwardly extending flap to a second position where at least a portion of the hinged wing does contact and engage the outer side of the inwardly extending flap.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the fourth method of the invention, the end cap is pressed bottom wall first into the open end of the paper tube before any inwardly extending flaps have been formed. Once the end cap has been inserted into the open end of the paper tube, at least one and preferably a plurality of inwardly extending flaps are formed by pressing the top edge of the paper tube inwardly against the ledge formed in the end cap. Once an inwardly extending flap has been formed, a hinged wing extending from the top portion of the sidewall of the end cap is moved from a first position where the hinged wing does not contact the outer side of the inwardly extending flap to a second position where at least a portion of the hinged wing does contact and engage the outer side of the inwardly extending flap.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a fourth embodiment of an end cap according to the invention. In this embodiment, the end cap comprises a first piece <b>220</b> and a second piece <b>230</b> that are joined together. The first piece <b>220</b> includes a bottom wall <b>100</b> having a substantially circular peripheral edge <b>110</b> and a sidewall <b>120</b> that extends from the peripheral edge <b>110</b>. Two or more recesses <b>160</b> or openings are formed in the sidewall <b>120</b>. Each recess <b>160</b> or opening includes a ledge <b>190</b> or base portion for contacting an inner side <b>40</b> of an inwardly extending flap <b>20</b> formed at an open end <b>30</b> of a paper tube <b>10</b>. Each recess <b>160</b> also includes an angular top wall <b>240</b> positioned above the ledge <b>190</b>. The second piece <b>230</b> includes a plurality of tangs <b>250</b> that are configured for snap-fit engagement in the plurality of recesses <b>160</b> or openings in the first piece <b>220</b>. The first piece is preferably formed of plastic. The second piece <b>230</b> can be formed of plastic, but more preferably, is formed of metal.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this embodiment of the invention, the first piece <b>220</b> is pressed into the open end <b>30</b> of a paper tube <b>10</b> before any inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> have been formed at the open end <b>30</b>. Once the first piece <b>220</b> has been pressed into the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b>, at least two inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> are formed at the open end <b>30</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> by pressing a top edge <b>70</b> of the paper tube <b>10</b> inwardly at the recesses <b>160</b>. The ledges <b>190</b> operate as forming dies for the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b>. The inner sides <b>40</b> of the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> are pressed into contact with the ledges <b>190</b>. Next, the second piece <b>230</b> is disposed into contact with the first piece <b>220</b> such that the tangs <b>250</b> are pressed into the recesses <b>160</b>, thereby capturing and engaging the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> between the tangs <b>250</b> and the ledges <b>190</b>. The tangs <b>250</b> contact the outer sides <b>60</b> of the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b> and the ledges <b>190</b> contact the inner sides <b>40</b> of the inwardly extending flaps <b>20</b>. The tangs <b>250</b> also contact the angular top wall <b>240</b>, which prevents the second piece <b>230</b> from being unintentionally removed from the first piece <b>220</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a close up sectional view of the engagement of the first piece <b>220</b>, second piece <b>230</b> and inwardly extending flap <b>20</b> of a paper tube <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Thus the present invention provides end caps, combinations of end caps and paper tubes, methods of closing the open ends of paper tubes and paper tubes having end caps joined to the open end. The present invention is particularly useful for forming mailing tubes. The end caps of mailing tubes can be attached quickly and securely without the need for adhesives or staples, and can be removed and reused with relative ease.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">End caps of mailing tubes formed in accordance with the invention are significantly more difficult to dislodge from the paper tubes. This is a substantial advantage during the shipment of goods. Conventional plastic plugs tend to “pop” out of paper tubes when a force of five or less pounds is applied (either pushing or pulling) against the plastic plug. End caps according to the invention, however, will not “pop” out until a force of about fifty pounds is applied against the plastic plug. Thus, end caps according to the invention are typically ten times more difficult to dislodge from paper tubes than conventional plastic plugs.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and illustrative examples shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
