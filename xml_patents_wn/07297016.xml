<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention relates to a thermocouple connector arrangement. The present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. It is to be appreciated that the various drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale from one figure to another nor inside a given figure, and in particular that the size of the components are arbitrarily drawn for facilitating the understanding of the drawings. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It may be evident, however, that the present invention can be practiced without these specific details.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An example thermocouple system <b>10</b> that utilizes a thermocouple connector arrangement <b>12</b> in accordance with one aspect of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Within the thermocouple system <b>10</b>, the connector arrangement <b>12</b> is utilized to connect a thermocouple probe or sensor member <b>14</b> to other portions of the system. In the shown example, the probe member <b>14</b> is elongate and rigid. However, it is contemplated that other configurations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A first connector <b>16</b> of the connection arrangement <b>12</b> is interconnected with the probe member <b>14</b>. Specifically, the first connector <b>16</b> is configured to have a thermocouple probe lead <b>18</b> extending therefrom, and the first connector has an interior configured to receive an electrical connection terminus of the thermocouple probe lead. A second connector <b>20</b> of the connection arrangement <b>12</b> is connected to an electrical connection lead <b>22</b>, such an elongate wire cable. Further, the second connector <b>20</b> is configured to have the electrical connection lead extending therefrom, and the second connector has an interior configured to receive a terminus of the electrical connection lead. It is to be appreciated that the designations of first and second for the connectors are merely for ease of identification.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the shown example system <b>10</b>, the wire cable <b>22</b> extends to a strip panel <b>26</b>. In turn, the strip panel <b>26</b> is operatively connected via cable or the like to one or more instruments <b>28</b>. It is to be appreciated that the shown example system <b>10</b> may have different components, structure, etc., and these aspects of the system <b>10</b> are not specific limitations upon the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first and second connectors <b>16</b> and <b>20</b> include electrically conductive mating parts that, when mated, provide an electrical conduction path between the thermocouple probe lead <b>18</b> and the wire cable (electrical connection lead) <b>22</b>. The electrically conductive mating parts are described further below. However, it is to be appreciated that the specifics of the electrically conductive mating parts may not be a limitation on the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with one aspect, at least one of the first and second connectors <b>16</b>, <b>20</b> includes housing parts that mate in a snap-lock arrangement to secure the housing parts together and to enclose the respective interior. Also in accordance with one another aspect, at least one of the first and second connectors <b>16</b>, <b>20</b> includes structure that engages the respective terminus and secures the respective terminus against removal without the use of a threaded fastener As a further aspect, the one of the housing parts engages the respective terminus and secures the respective terminus against removal by shrouding an end of the respective conductive mating part and pressing the respective terminus into electrical contact with the respective conductive mating part during the mating of the housing parts. As yet another aspect, the engagement and securing accomplished without the use of a threaded fastener occurs during the mating of the housing parts.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of an example of a connector as used in the arrangement <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The illustrated connector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a plug connector and the second connector <b>20</b> in the shown example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It is to be appreciated that at least some of the structural features shown for the second connector <b>20</b> may be applicable for the first connector <b>16</b>. The second connector <b>20</b> includes one housing part that is a body <b>32</b> from which two electrically conductive prongs <b>34</b> extend. Another housing part of the connector <b>20</b> is a cap <b>38</b> that snap-fits with the body <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exploded view of the plug connector <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Specifically, the body <b>32</b> has two body sections <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, which will be referred to here in as upper body section <b>40</b> and lower body section <b>42</b> for ease of reference only. The upper and lower body sections <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> can be made of a thermoplastic or the like and are coupled together and secured by any known or to be determined means. Alternatively, other construction techniques for the body, such as a mold-over technique, can be used. In the shown example, the upper body section <b>40</b> includes one or more recesses (not shown) and one or more projections <b>48</b>, and the lower body section <b>42</b> includes one or more projections <b>50</b> and one or more recesses <b>52</b> to correspond with the one or more recesses and projections <b>48</b> in the upper body section <b>40</b>, respectively. The respective projections and the recesses mate when the upper and lower body sections <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are coupled together. It is to be noted that in one example, the projections <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> have structure that aid in securing the upper and lower body sections <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> together. For example, the structure may be raised material, e.g., in an elongate pyramidal shape, which flows upon occurrence of an ultrasonic welding procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As can be appreciated by viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the upper and lower body sections <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are configured to receive the prongs <b>34</b> at an interior portion of the body <b>32</b>. Specifically, the upper and lower body sections <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> include recesses <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>, respectively, in which segments of the prongs <b>34</b> lie. It should be noted that the prongs <b>34</b> have portions that mate with portions of at least one of the body sections <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>. In the shown example, each prong <b>34</b> has an offset <b>64</b> (e.g., a U bend). The lower body section <b>42</b> has a corresponding low segment <b>66</b> within each of the recesses <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>. When the two body sections <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are mated and secured together, the prongs <b>34</b> are retained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The portion of the connector body <b>32</b> that retains the prongs <b>34</b> can be considered to be a first or front portion <b>72</b> of the body, and the end from which the prongs prominently extend can be considered to be the front end of the body. Such a front portion <b>72</b> would include the entire upper section <b>40</b> and the front of the lower section <b>42</b>. A portion <b>74</b> of the lower section <b>42</b> does extend to the rear and could naturally be considered a rear portion <b>74</b> of the body <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a substantial portion of each prong <b>34</b> extends from the front end of the body <b>32</b> for connection to the other connector <b>16</b>. However, a rear end portion <b>76</b> of each prong <b>34</b> extends rearward from the front portion <b>72</b> of the body <b>32</b>. The rear end portion <b>76</b> of each prong <b>34</b> is located at a respective side of the rear portion <b>74</b> of the body <b>32</b> (i.e., the rear of the lower body section). These prong end portions <b>76</b> are provided for electrical connection to wires of the wire cable <b>22</b>, which will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Turning to the rear portion <b>74</b> of the body <b>32</b>, it provides two functions. First, the rear portion <b>74</b> is configured to receive a crimp adapter <b>80</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) utilized in connecting the wire cable (the electrical connection lead) <b>22</b> to the connector <b>20</b>. In the shown example, the rear portion <b>74</b> has a recess <b>82</b> that is configured in size and shape to mate with the crimp adapter <b>80</b> to cradle and retain the crimp adapter. As can be appreciated upon viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the crimp adapter <b>80</b>, with a polygonal (e.g., square, hexagonal, etc.) portion, fits snugly into the recess <b>82</b>, which is specifically shaped to retain the crimp adaptor <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Within the shown example, wire cable <b>22</b> is elongate and flexible, and the wire cable has two wires <b>84</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). It should be noted that the connector could accommodate a wire cable, and included wires, of various size. The crimp adapter <b>80</b> may have structure and/or dimensions for different cable parameters. Further, different crimp adapters can be used for the different cable parameters, and the connector <b>20</b> is configured to accommodate such different crimp adapters. For instance, the connector <b>20</b> can be used with relatively thick wire cable having relatively thick wires and an associated crimp connector with structure and dimensions to accommodate the thickness. Likewise, the connector <b>20</b> can be used with a relatively thinner wire cable with associated thinner wires and a suitable crimp adapter. It is to be appreciated that the present invention permits the use of the varying thickness cables, wires, and associated crimp connector adaptors to address these varying thicknesses.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Turning back to the second function of the rear portion <b>74</b>, the portion is configured to provide one half of a snap-lock interconnection between the body <b>32</b> and the cap <b>38</b>. The snap-lock connection is described further below. However, it is to be noted that the rear portion <b>74</b> includes at least one (e.g., two) sloped surface <b>88</b> and at least one (e.g., two) drop-off shoulder <b>90</b>. Each sloped surface <b>88</b> tapers upward as the sloped surface extends toward the front of the body <b>32</b>. Each shoulder <b>90</b> is located near the front-most terminus of the respective sloped surface <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The shown example of the cap <b>38</b> of the connector <b>20</b> is made of two sections <b>98</b> and <b>100</b>. These sections <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> can be made of thermoplastic and are secured together in a manner similar to the manner used for the body <b>32</b>. As noted above, various techniques can be used. For ease of reference, these sections <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> are referred to as upper and lower sections, respectively. The upper section <b>98</b> includes at least one projection and at least one recess, and the lower section <b>100</b> includes at least one corresponding projection and at least one corresponding recess. When the upper and lower sections <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> are mated together, each respective projection and recess pair is mated together. It is to be noted that in one example, the projections have structure that aid in securing the upper and lower sections <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> together. For example, the structure may be raised material, e.g., in an elongate pyramidal shape, which flows upon occurrence of an ultrasonic welding procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The cap <b>38</b> has an interior <b>110</b> that is bounded by the two sections <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> and that provides multiple functions. First, the rear portion <b>74</b> of the body <b>32</b> is located within the interior <b>110</b> (e.g., shrouded within) when the body <b>32</b> and the cap <b>38</b> are connected together. Second, the interior <b>110</b> of the cap <b>38</b> is also configured to hole the wire cable (electrical connector lead) <b>22</b> in electrical contact with at least one (e.g., both) of the prongs <b>34</b>. More specifically, at least one of the upper and lower portions of the cap <b>38</b> include one or more projections <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to help retain the wires <b>84</b> in contact with the prongs <b>34</b>. Thus, one of the housing parts engages the respective terminus and secures the respective terminus against removal by shrouding an end of the respective conductive mating part and pressing the respective terminus into electrical contact with the respective conductive mating part during the mating of the housing parts.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although not illustrated, the upper section <b>98</b> of the cap <b>38</b> has at least one (e.g., two) projection that provides a second half of the snap-fit interconnection. Specifically, the projections are located and configured such that the projections will cooperate with the sloped surfaces <b>88</b> and the shoulders <b>90</b> of the rear portion <b>74</b> of the body <b>32</b> to snap-lock the cap <b>38</b> onto the body. During the mating of the cap <b>38</b> onto the body <b>32</b>, the projections engage and ride along the sloped surfaces <b>88</b>. As the cap <b>38</b> is moved toward a final position mated with the body <b>32</b>, the sloped surfaces <b>88</b> deflect the projections and thus part of the cap outward. However, as the cap <b>38</b> reaches the final position, the projections arrive at the edge of the shoulders <b>90</b>. Subsequently, the projections drop off of the shoulders <b>90</b> with a snapping action (i.e., the deflected portion of the cap snaps back). Thus, the projections rest against the shoulders <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be noted that the snap interlock mating could be accomplished by any other suitable snap interlock structure. This sort of snap interlock is commonly referred to as a one-way connection. It is to be noted that additional snap-lock structures may be utilized. For example, a tapered tip that has a recess can be located on the lower section of the cap <b>38</b>. The tapered tip and the recess can interact with a pin-like projection on the outer side of the lower body section <b>42</b>. The tapered tip is configured to slide over the pin-like projection and the pin-like projection snaps into the recess as the cap <b>38</b> is moved toward a final position mated with the body <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning to the connection of the wire cable <b>22</b> to the shown example connector <b>20</b>, it is to be noted that the terminus of the wire cable <b>22</b> is extended through the cap <b>38</b> and the crimp adapter <b>80</b>. As such, the terminus of the wire cable <b>22</b> can be thought of as an end portion of the wire cable. Of course, it is to be appreciated that some other aspect, e.g., only an end portion of one wire <b>84</b>, can be thought of as a terminus. For example, a bared portion of the one wire <b>84</b> could be thought of as a terminus.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In preparation for connecting the terminus of the wire cable <b>22</b> to the connector <b>20</b>, an end portion of any protective cable covering is removed (e.g., stripped) to expose the wires <b>84</b> contained therein. Further, any coverings on the two wires <b>84</b> are removed (e.g., stripped) at the terminus ends to expose the bare wires. Next, the bare wire ends are bent to the outer sides at a substantially 90-degree angle relative to the wire cable <b>22</b>. Next, the bared wires <b>84</b> are positioned within slots <b>120</b> formed within the end portion <b>76</b> of the prongs <b>34</b> and slots <b>122</b> formed within the rear portion <b>74</b> of the lower body section <b>42</b> of the body <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the wire tips are then generally bent forward to lie adjacent the prongs <b>34</b>. When the cap <b>38</b> is attached to the body <b>32</b> (e.g., via relative movement to complete the snap interlock), the projections <b>118</b> in the cap <b>38</b> will engage and ride over the rear end portions <b>76</b> of the prongs <b>34</b>, thereby squeezing the wires into pressing contact with the respective prongs <b>34</b>. Thus, between the engagement of the wires <b>84</b> within the slots <b>120</b> of the prongs <b>34</b> and the pressing engagement of the wires <b>84</b> with the prongs <b>34</b> via the projections <b>118</b> formed in the cap <b>38</b>, electrical connection is established between each respective wire <b>84</b> and prong <b>34</b>. No springs, screws, or additional components are needed to establish this electrical connection. Again, it is to be appreciated that the connector <b>20</b> thus has structure to retain (e.g., grasp) the wire cable.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is to be appreciated that a portion of the body <b>32</b> does extend into the hollow interior <b>110</b> of the cap <b>38</b>. This may be further appreciated upon viewing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which shows the hollow aspect of the cap <b>38</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which shows the final assembly. In general, the connection of the wires <b>84</b> to the prongs <b>34</b> is considered to occur within the interior of the connector <b>20</b>. Thus, the snap-lock interconnection not only secures the housing parts (e.g., the body and the cap) <b>32</b> and <b>38</b> together, but also encloses the interior.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Some of the features of the present invention should now be apparent. First, the two parts (e.g., the body and the cap) <b>32</b> and <b>38</b> of the connector <b>20</b> were connected without the use of any threaded fasteners, such as a screw, a bolt, or the like. Second, the terminus ends of the wires <b>84</b> are connected to the prongs <b>34</b> without the use of any springs or threaded fasteners, such as a screw, a bolt, or the like, or any additional components. Also, enhanced connection of the wires <b>84</b> to the prongs <b>34</b> occurs simultaneously with the connection of the cap <b>38</b> to the body <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate the prongs <b>34</b> in greater detail in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the prong <b>34</b> associated with a negative electrical connection and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the prong <b>34</b> associated with a positive electrical connection. The prongs <b>34</b> are formed of a metal or any other suitable conductive material.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a view of the first connector <b>16</b> shown within the plug connector <b>20</b>. Specifically, the first connector <b>16</b> is a mate component to the plug connector <b>20</b> and can be referred to as a jack connector <b>16</b>. The jack connector <b>16</b> contains many similar features and construction techniques as discussed above. Structures unique to the jack connector <b>16</b> can include metallic jack springs and inserts (not shown). The springs and inserts interact with the prongs <b>34</b> upon insertion of the prongs into the jack connector <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is to be also noted that either the plug connector or the jack connector may be utilized with a cable or may be utilized with some other components such as a probe extension. Specifically, the connectors are not limited to the shown example uses, and it is contemplated that the plug connector or the jack connector may be reversed with regard to connections to the wire cable <b>22</b> and the thermocouple probe <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a modification that has some similarity to the plug connector <b>20</b>. As such, reference numerals that have an added prime (“′”) are utilized to identify similar or even identical structure. Focusing on the modification features, the prongs <b>34</b>′ are different such that the prongs may be utilized to engage a corresponding round receptacle. Specifically, free ends (i.e., extending out from the connector body) of the prongs are twisted into a helix form. The edges of the twisted prong would then engage a round opening of a mating connector. It is contemplated that the connectors for which such a helix-prong configuration may have some of the same structural and functional features presented for the connectors <b>16</b> and <b>20</b>. For example, one or both of the associated connectors may include housing parts that mate in a snap-lock arrangement to secure the housing parts together and to enclose the respective interior. Also one or both of the associated connectors may include structure that engages an electrical connection terminus and secures the terminus against removal without the use of a threaded fastener. As a further aspect, the engagement and securing without the use of a threaded fastener may occur during the mating of the housing parts.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">What has been described above includes exemplary implementations of the present invention. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies for purposes of describing the present invention, but one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many further combinations and permutations of the present invention are possible. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to embrace all such alterations, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the embodiments described herein.</p>
