<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This invention relates generally to the field of wireless communications. More particularly, this invention relates to wireless communications methods and systems for wireless personal communication devices and for interconnecting these wireless personal communication devices over a linking frequency using a remote, self-contained communications antenna unit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Wireless communication networks comprise one or more cell sites that assign radio channels for connecting a wireless personal communication device, such as, for example, a cellular telephone, to another telephone (wireless or wired) through a cellular switch connected to a terrestrial telephone network. Wireless communication networks typically include a plurality of interconnected (wireless or wired) cell sites that are coupled with a centrally located cellular switch, called a Mobile Telephone Switching Office (MTSO), and that connect to a communications network. Cell sites are essentially buildings that house equipment for transmitting, receiving, and processing wireless communications to the communications network. There are typically fifty to one hundred cell sites in large cities, fifteen to fifty cell sites in smaller cities, and very few cell sites or none in rural areas. Depending on capacity constraints, cell sites may be located one-half to twenty miles from each other. Further, each cell site generally comprises one or more stationary antennas mounted on a triangular platform that is placed on a tower or atop a tall building preferably sixty to three hundred feet above the surrounding terrain.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Conventional installation of a new cell site requires placement of one or more antennas and construction of a cable transmission path for a wired connection (e.g., use of a T1) of the cell site to a switching system. The cost associated with installing a new cell site is very substantial and ranges on the average from several hundred thousand to half a million dollars. Additionally, actual siting may not be available for a variety of reasons, such as unavailability of the sector for the physical plant that contains the cell site, terrain restraints, regulatory restraints, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the wired connection is lost to a conventional cell site, the cell site is disconnected and goes “off the air.” Wireless personal communication devices serviced by the disconnected cell site cannot transmit or receive signals (i.e., a customer cannot place or receive a telephone call). Depending on the nature of the trouble, the cell site could be off the air for an extended period of time. Loss of revenue to the cellular provider and customer inconvenience result until the wired connection is repaired and restored. While there are techniques known in the art that provide emergency means in case of a line fault, they: (1) are bulky and difficult to readily implement; (2) are expensive; and (3) have a limit in the number of applicable connections and in the applicable status of a connection.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, replacement methods and systems are needed to provide easy, affordable, and flexible remote wireless communications with wireless personal communication devices communicating with a disconnected cell site and to connect these devices with a communications network.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This invention provides wireless communications using a remote, self-contained communications antenna unit coupled to a disconnected cell site to communicate with a cellular system connected to a communications network. As used herein, a “disconnected” cell site includes remote cell sites, such as, for example, a cell on wheels (COW) and also includes conventional cell sites (i.e., buildings with cellular transceiving equipment) that have lost connection with a cellular switch (e.g., the T1 is cut or there is another line fault) and are “off the air.” As used herein, the term “transceive” includes transmitting, receiving, and processing communication signals. Further, as used herein, a “communications network” includes terrestrial communications networks, such as, for example, the public switch telephone network, as well as celestial communications networks. When the remote, self-contained communications antenna unit is coupled (e.g., wired or wireless connection) to a disconnected cell site, it has the appearance of a operational cell site to the communications network. This invention provides a rapid, inexpensive, and efficient method and system to transceive wireless communication signals (e.g., the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) Band frequencies, such as, 2.4-2.5 GHz, cellular telephone frequencies, such as, 806-960 MHz, 1710-1855 MHz, and 2500-2690 MHz, paging frequencies, digital processing frequencies, and any other frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum) from wireless personal communication devices communicating with a disconnected cell site and to connect these wireless personal communication devices with the communications network. Further, this invention is easily positioned at a variety of locations because of the highly mobile platforms that carry the remote, self-contained communications antenna unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The remote, self-contained communications antenna unit is coupled with a disconnected cell site to provide remote communications with wireless personal devices. The wireless personal devices transceive radio frequencies to the disconnected cell site, and these signals are communicated to the remote, self-contained communications antenna unit. The remote, self-contained communications unit transceives these signals to the communications network. In one embodiment, the remote, self-contained communications antenna unit may be hard-wired using a T-1 connection to a local service provider's crossbox junction point that connects to a cellular switch, such as, for example, a MTSO. In a second embodiment, the remote, self-contained communications antenna unit transceives these signals using a microwave frequency link to an operational cell site. The operational cell site connects these signals to the MTSO and the communications network. In a third embodiment, the remote, self-contained communications antenna unit transceives these signals to a second remote, self-contained communications antenna unit that is connected to an operational cell site. The second remote, self-contained communications antenna unit may be used as an alternative to a direct connection with an operational cell site when there are obstacles (e.g., terrain obstruction) between the remote, self-contained communications antenna unit coupled with the disconnected cell site and the operational cell site.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The remote, self-contained communications antenna unit includes a power source, backup power source, transceiving equipment, a signal processor, network communications equipment, antenna, and an antenna mast for transmitting and receiving wireless communications at various heights. Further, the remote, self-contained communications antenna unit may be mounted upon a transportation vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a preferred embodiment, the remote, self-contained communications antenna unit is a trailer that transports and carries a generator for power, backup batteries, transceiving equipment, a digital signal processor (DSX), a network interface unit (NIU), an air conditioner, an antenna, and an extendible mast that supports the antenna. The remote, self-contained communications antenna unit also includes a power charging unit, such as a battery charger.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">This invention is useful for restoring cell site functionality, for providing emergency service, for increasing cellular capacity, and for adding a remote, self-contained communications antenna unit coupled with a disconnected cell site. For instance, this invention provides cellular service where a line fault has disconnected the conventional cell site and caused it to go “off the air” (e.g., the T1 connection to the terrestrial telephone network has been cut). It provides service to a location out of range of cell sites, such as service to a rural location. This invention is also useful for temporarily increasing cellular capacity, such as, for example, providing cellular coverage to customers attending large events like the SuperBowl and the Olympics. Further, this invention is useful for adding a permanent cell site when laying a transmission path to a switching system is difficult or impossible or when adding a permanent cell site is too costly.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">These uses may be accomplished singularly, or in combination, in one or more of the embodiments of the this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additional uses, objects, advantages, and novel features of the invention are set forth in the detailed description that follows and will become more apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or by practice of the invention.</p>
