<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to concurrently filed application, U.S. Ser. No. 11/193,668, entitled “Vision System And Method Incorporating Graphics Symbology For Use In A Tanker Refueling System”.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to refueling systems used in tanker aircraft for providing airborne refueling to a receiver aircraft, and more particularly to a vision system and method incorporating a two dimensional graphics symbology set for assisting a boom operator in aligning a refueling boom with a refueling receptacle on a receiver aircraft.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Present tanker aircraft typically rely on three dimensional (3D) visual or stereo vision systems that are used by the boom operator to judge distance and closure rates between the receiver aircraft and the refueling boom and/or refueling hose/drogue. Creating an observation window for real vision or implementing a stereo vision system to provide sufficient depth perception, such as a 3D vision system, can be expensive. Three dimensional vision systems require complex, multiple cameras and video processing systems. While some systems have proven effective for their intended use, it would nevertheless be desirable to provide a system that does not require the use of multiple camera, but instead a system that can be implemented using a single camera that provides a two dimensional picture of the receiver aircraft to the boom operator.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It would further be desirable if some graphical system could be employed in connection with a two dimensional image of the receiver aircraft and refueling boom to better enable a boom operator to judge the position and closing speed of the receiver aircraft during an airborne refueling operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is directed to a vision system for use on an airborne refueling tanker vehicle that does not require multiple cameras to provide a stereo vision image for a boom operator performing a refueling operation on a receiver vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one preferred form the system of the present invention makes use of a sensor system that provides information on the position of the refueling boom, as well as the position of a fuel receptacle on a receiver vehicle, to a processing system. A single (i.e., mono) camera is used to image the receiver vehicle during the refueling operation. The processing system also generates, from the sensor system, a graphics symbol set that is displayed on a display system used by the boom operator. The same display system may be used for displaying the image generated by the camera on the tanker vehicle. The graphics symbol set includes a graphics symbol representing the boom, a graphic symbol representing a receiver vehicle, and a graphic symbol representing a desired contact zone within which coupling of the boom tip and the fuel receptacle on the receiver vehicle can be achieved. The information on the position of the boom and the position of the receiver vehicle is monitored by the sensor system and information is generated in real time so that the display of the graphics symbol set essentially provides a real time indication of the position of the boom relative to the refueling receptacle on the receiver vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one preferred embodiment the graphics symbol set comprises a contact zone graphic, a foundation graphic representing lead-in areas to the contact zone, a refueling boom graphic and a receiver vehicle graphic. In one preferred implementation the contact zone graphic and the refueling boom and receiver vehicle graphics are longitudinally aligned along a common line or axis. Information from the camera system is processed and the positions of the refueling boom graphic and the receiver vehicle graphic are updated to indicate the changing relative positions of these components relative to the contact zone graphic. When the receiver vehicle graphic moves within the contact zone graphic, then the receiver boom can be telescopically extended into the contact zone to couple to the refueling receptacle of the receiver vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one preferred implementation different colors are used for the contact zone graphic, the receiver graphic and the boom graphic. Optionally, the receiver graphic can be made to flash repeatedly in the event the sensing system detects that the receiver vehicle is approaching the contact zone at an excessive closure rate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another preferred implementation a receiver elevation lead-in graphic is generated and displayed on the display system adjacent to the receiver graphic symbol. When the receiver vehicle is at the proper elevation relative to the refueling vehicle, the lead-in graphic will be contacting the receiver graphic. But if the receiver vehicle is above the predetermined optimum elevation for contact between the boom and the refueling receptacle to occur, then the receiver graphic will be positioned above the elevation lead-in graphic. Conversely, if the receiver vehicle is below the elevation at which the vehicle needs to be at for proper contact to be made, then the elevation lead-in graphic will be positioned somewhere above a lower edge portion of the receiver graphic. In this manner the boom operator can visually discern, at a glance, the position of the receiver vehicle relative to the predetermined elevation at which contact needs to be made between the boom and the refueling receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another preferred implementation a color is used with the receiver graphic to designate when the refueling receptacle of the receiver vehicle is in contact with the tip of the refueling boom, but where the refueling receptacle is positioned either excessively forwardly or excessively rearwardly of the contact zone. In this manner the boom operator can inform the operator of the receiver vehicle by RF communications that either greater or lesser separation between the receiver and tanker vehicles needs to be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In still another preferred implementation of the present invention a boom aim point graphics symbol can be provided on the display system to provide the boom operator with an indication of where the tip of the boom would contact on the refueling vehicle if the boom was to be telescoped to its fully extended length. The boom aim point symbol is projected over the image of the receiver vehicle being provided by the camera. The operator controls the boom to maintain the boom aim point graphic symbol directly over the refueling receptacle on the receiver vehicle while the boom is being fully telescoped.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The features, functions, and advantages can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present inventions or may be combined in yet other embodiments.</p>

The vision system <b>10</b> is used to enable the operator to control a telescoping refueling boom <b>14</b> to make contact with a refueling receptacle on an airborne receiver vehicle (i.e., aircraft) <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> and its associated refueling receptacle <b>18</b> can be seen relative to the boom <b>14</b>. Dashed line <b>20</b> represents a “contact zone” having an elevation <b>22</b> and a distance <b>24</b> within which contact between a tip <b>26</b> of boom <b>14</b> needs to be made. The boom <b>14</b> can be seen to include a conventional ice shield <b>28</b> and a pair of conventional ruddervators <b>30</b> for assisting the boom operator in aiming the boom <b>14</b>. A telescoping fuel tube <b>32</b> is housed within the boom <b>14</b>. The boom <b>14</b> also includes sensors (not shown) that are associated with a sensor system carried onboard the tanker aircraft <b>12</b> for providing information on the position of the boom <b>14</b> relative to the tanker aircraft <b>12</b>. In essence, the refueling receptacle <b>18</b> forms a “virtual target” which the boom operator aims the boom tip <b>26</b> toward while extending the telescoping fuel tube <b>32</b> that supplies fuel through the boom <b>14</b> to the boom tip <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a boom sensor subsystem <b>34</b> disposed adjacent the boom <b>14</b> is used for sensing the relative location of the tip <b>26</b> of the boom (including both the elevation and azimuth planes) relative to the tanker aircraft <b>12</b>. A camera system <b>36</b>, which in one preferred implementation is a digital camera system, provides a real time image to the boom operator using the system <b>10</b> to assist the boom operator in visualizing the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> and the refueling receptacle <b>18</b> during the refueling operation. The camera system <b>36</b> image also helps the boom operator to sense the distance between the boom tip <b>26</b> and the refueling receptacle <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the system <b>10</b> of the present invention is shown in greater detail. The system incorporates the camera system <b>36</b> together with the boom position sensor subsystem <b>34</b> and a conventional receiver aircraft A/R (aircraft refueling) data subsystem <b>38</b>. The A/R data subsystem <b>38</b> provides information on the specific type of aircraft being refueled (e.g., size, fuel capacity, etc.). Each of components <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> feeds signals into a processing system <b>40</b> having a graphics generator <b>42</b>. The processing system <b>40</b> includes video processing componentry and pixel count/position algorithms, in accordance with Boeing-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,752,357, incorporated by reference herein, to derive distance and position information from the camera system <b>36</b> and the boom sensor subsystem <b>34</b>, and to provide a graphics symbology set <b>44</b> that can be displayed on a display system <b>46</b> of a computer <b>48</b>. The camera system <b>36</b> provides a real time image of the receiver vehicle <b>16</b> and its refueling receptacle <b>18</b> on the display system <b>46</b>. The display system <b>46</b> may comprise an LCD display or a CRT display, or any other display system suitable for displaying both graphics symbols as well as real time video images.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A suitable digital camera system for use with the present invention is commercially available from Dalsa Corp. of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. The boom position sensor subsystem <b>34</b> comprises a plurality of sensors that are used to detect the position of the boom <b>14</b> relative to the tanker aircraft <b>12</b>. Suitable boom position sensor systems are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,651,933 and 6,837,462, owned by the Boeing Co. and hereby incorporated by reference into the present application. Various suitable boom position sensors (e.g., LVDT/RVDT transducers) and sensing subsystems are also widely commercially available. Additional U.S. patents owned by the Boeing Co., which relate to various components of refueling booms and/or tanker refueling systems, and which are all hereby incorporated by reference into the present application, are: U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,586,683; 4,298,176; 5,996,939; 5,785,276; 4,792,107; 4,633,376; 4,519,560; 4,264,044; 4,231,536; 4,160,534; 4,158,885; 4,129,270; 4,095,761; 4,072,283; and 4,025,193.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The processing system <b>40</b> may comprise any suitable processor capable of processing the information from the position sensor subsystem <b>34</b> and the digital camera system <b>36</b> to provide real time information that the graphics generator <b>42</b> can use to generate the graphics symbology set <b>44</b> that is displayed on the display system <b>46</b>. The computer <b>48</b> may comprise a personal computer or any other suitable form of computer having a suitable video card and processing power able to display the real time images generated by the digital camera system <b>36</b> and the graphics symbology set <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the graphics symbology set <b>44</b> is illustrated overlayed on an image of the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> on the display system <b>46</b>. Optionally, but preferably, the boom position sensor subsystem <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) provides information relating to the telescoped length of the boom <b>14</b> in the form of a scaled, linear graph <b>50</b>. Graph <b>50</b> and indicator arrow head <b>51</b> shows the boom operator the length that the boom tip <b>26</b> is telescoped to at any given time during the refueling operation. Optionally, but preferably, an elevation bar graph <b>52</b> is also provided that informs the boom operator of the elevation of the boom <b>14</b> horizontal axis relative to the tanker aircraft <b>12</b>. In this example the optimum contact point elevation is designated by the diamond graphic <b>54</b> (indicating an elevation of about 32 degrees relative to the tanker aircraft <b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the camera system <b>36</b> also provides boom tip <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) position information to the processing system <b>40</b> that enables the processing system to generate a horizontal, linear graph <b>58</b> that assists the boom operator in determining the lateral displacement of the boom <b>14</b> relative to a center line of the tanker aircraft <b>12</b>. Indicator <b>60</b> indicates the present position of the boom <b>14</b> while the “0” position on the graph <b>58</b> indicates the center line position of the refueling boom <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In each of the graphs <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>58</b>, colors may be employed to assist the operator in aligning the boom <b>14</b>. The color green indicates normal operating limits of the boom <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the graphics symbology set <b>44</b> will now be described. The graphics symbology set <b>44</b> also preferably makes use of colors to assist the boom operator in quickly visually determining the position of the boom tip <b>26</b>, as well as the position of the receiver aircraft <b>16</b>. The graphics symbology set <b>44</b> is formed by a foundation graphic symbol <b>62</b> that represents the depth of the contact zone <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) (i.e., distance <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), plus “lead-in” areas <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b</i>, to provide contrast for a receiver aircraft symbol <b>64</b> and a tanker aircraft symbol <b>66</b>. The fixed foundation graphic symbol <b>62</b> has an interior area which in this example is represented by the color black, and is outlined in green. The contact zone <b>20</b> is defined by a graphic contact zone rectangle <b>68</b>, which in this example is colored green, but outlined by parallel white strips <b>70</b>. The black areas above and below the contact zone rectangle <b>68</b> thus represent the lead-in areas <b>62</b><i>a </i>and <b>62</b><i>b</i>, which, in practice, represent only the last several feet (e.g., 10 feet-20 feet; 3.05 m-6.1 m) of the receiver aircraft's <b>16</b> closure to the contact zone <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The receiver aircraft symbol <b>64</b> is preferably also colored with a unique color, in this example grey, and is preferably outlined in a different color, for example a yellow band <b>72</b>. A horizontal dashed line <b>74</b> is also provided that represents an “receiver elevation lead-in” line for indicating an optimum receiver aircraft elevation as the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> moves forward and aft within the refueling region at the rear of the tanker aircraft <b>12</b>. The elevation line <b>74</b> will move up and down relative to the receiver symbol <b>64</b> to indicate the position of the refueling receptacle <b>18</b> lead-in relative to the optimum contact point elevation within the contact zone <b>20</b>. The lower edge of the receiver symbol <b>64</b> touching the elevation lead-in line <b>74</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, indicates the correct receiver aircraft <b>16</b> elevation relative to the optimum contact point in the contact zone <b>20</b>. If the receiver symbol <b>64</b> is displayed above the elevation lead-in line <b>74</b>, it represents a receiver refueling receptacle being above the optimum elevation; if the receiver symbol <b>64</b> crosses the elevation lead-in line <b>74</b>, it represents the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> being at too low an elevation for contact to occur between the boom tip <b>26</b> and the refueling receptacle <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5H</figref>, the graphics symbology set <b>44</b> can be seen to provide an immediate visual indication to the boom operator of various conditions and positions of the boom tip <b>26</b> and the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> during the refueling operation. When the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> is moving forward toward the contact zone <b>20</b>, the processing system <b>40</b> derives the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> distance to the contact zone <b>20</b> by information supplied from the camera system <b>36</b>. The closure rate of the receiver symbol <b>64</b> towards the contact zone rectangle <b>68</b> is scaled in accordance with this distance information. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates the receiver aircraft symbol <b>64</b> (i.e., representing receiver aircraft <b>16</b>) moving toward the contact zone rectangle <b>68</b>, but at an elevation that is above the elevation lead-in line <b>74</b>. This indicates that the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> needs to reduce its elevation before contact between the boom tip <b>26</b> and its refueling receptacle <b>18</b> can be made in the contact zone <b>20</b>. The boom symbol <b>66</b> is shown having a length only about halfway to the contact zone rectangle <b>68</b>, indicating that the fuel tube <b>32</b> has not been telescoped yet to reach the contact zone <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> indicates the receiver aircraft symbol <b>64</b> with its lower end just touching the elevation lead-in line <b>74</b> indicating that the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> is at the optimum elevation for contact to be made between the boom tip <b>26</b> and the refueling receptacle <b>18</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> indicates the boom symbol <b>66</b> being the same height as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, thus indicating that the boom fuel tube <b>32</b> has not yet been telescoped into the contact zone rectangle <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the receiver symbol <b>64</b> is illustrated as a flashing yellow, vertically oriented rectangle indicating that the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> is closing to the contact zone rectangle <b>68</b> at a rate of speed that exceeds a predetermined safe closing rate (e.g., 10 ft/sec; 3.04 meters/sec). The frequency of the flashing of the receiver symbol <b>64</b> can be varied but in one preferred form it is approximately ten cycles per second. This also provides an instantaneous visual cue to the boom operator so the boom operator can inform the pilot of the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> to adjust his/her speed accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the receiver symbol <b>64</b> is indicated with its lower end inside the contact zone rectangle <b>68</b>. At this point the boom <b>14</b> can be fully telescoped into the contact zone <b>20</b> to make contact between the boom tip <b>26</b> and the refueling receptacle <b>18</b>. The distance indicated as “shadow gap” in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> represents the shadow that often appears on the receiver aircraft <b>16</b>, under certain lighting conditions, that the boom operator sees when viewing the receiver aircraft <b>16</b>. This shadow has traditionally been helpful to the boom operator in gauging the distance between the boom tip <b>26</b> and the receiver refueling receptacle <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> illustrates the boom symbol <b>66</b> having been elongated to reach the contact zone rectangle <b>68</b> so that the boom tip <b>26</b> is engaged with the refueling receptacle <b>18</b>. Boom symbol <b>66</b> is increased in length in accordance with the telescoping movement of the boom <b>14</b>, and scaled to the distance that the boom <b>14</b> covers to the contact zone <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>, if contact between the boom tip <b>26</b> and the refueling receptacle <b>18</b> has been made, and then the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> moves forwardly past the contact zone rectangle <b>68</b>, the portion <b>64</b><i>a </i>of the receiver symbol <b>64</b> extending forwardly of the contact zone rectangle <b>68</b> is turned to a different color, in this example red. This provides an immediate visual cue to the boom operator that the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> needs to move back in the aft direction relative to the refueling aircraft <b>12</b> to position its refueling receptacle <b>18</b> at a point where contact can be safely maintained with the boom tip <b>26</b>. The length of portion <b>64</b><i>a </i>is also scaled to give the boom operator an immediate visual cue as to the distance by which the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> needs to move in the aft direction.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5G</figref> shows the receiver symbol <b>64</b> with lower portion <b>64</b><i>a </i>thereof in a different color, in this example red, indicating that the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> is in contact with the boom tip <b>26</b> but too far aft of the limit of extension of the boom <b>14</b>. In this condition there is a risk of the boom tip <b>26</b> being pulled out of the refueling receptacle <b>18</b>. The height of lower portion <b>64</b><i>a </i>is scaled to indicate the approximate distance by which the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> needs to move forwardly to be at the optimum distance, relative to the tanker aircraft <b>12</b>, while the boom tip <b>26</b> is engaged with the refueling receptacle <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5H</figref> illustrates the receiver symbol <b>64</b> having a leading edge positioned below the contact zone rectangle <b>68</b>, with lower portion <b>64</b><i>a </i>thereof being in a different color, in this example red. An upper end of the boom symbol <b>66</b> is not in contact with the lower edge of portion <b>64</b><i>a</i>, thus indicating that the boom tip <b>26</b> is not in contact with the refueling receptacle <b>18</b>. However, in this example the lower portion <b>64</b><i>a </i>indicates that the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> is dangerously forward of the contact zone <b>20</b> (i.e., too close to the refueling aircraft <b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5H</figref> a “boom aim point” graphic symbol <b>76</b> can also be used and overlayed on the image being projected on the display system <b>46</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). Boom aim point graphic symbol <b>76</b> indicates the point on the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> that the boom tip <b>26</b> is presently being aimed at. Traditionally, this task has been performed successfully for many years in tanker aircraft equipped with a direct view window. However, in a stereoscopic video system equipped with a remote aerial refueling operator (RARO) station, the possibility of the failure of one camera or video circuit raises the possibility of the operation being conducted under monoscopic conditions. Such a condition would suppress the boom operator's natural ability to detect the relative distance separating two objects. This depth sense helps the operator to gauge the point upon the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> that the boom tip <b>26</b> would contact if the boom refueling tube <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) were to be telescoped at any given time during the refueling operation while the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> is within the lead-in areas <b>62</b><i>a</i>, <b>62</b><i>b</i>. To avoid inadvertently striking the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> at any other point other than the refueling receptacle <b>18</b>, the boom operator controls the boom <b>14</b> as needed to ensure that the boom aim point graphic <b>76</b> is held over the image of the refueling receptacle <b>18</b> on the display system <b>46</b> whenever the boom tip <b>26</b> is perceived to be near the receiver aircraft <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">While the graphics symbology set <b>44</b> has been illustrated as a plurality of rectangular symbols aligned along a vertical axis, it will be appreciated that the symbols used could vary widely in size and shape. Any symbols that enable an immediate visual representation to be provided as to the position of the receiver aircraft <b>16</b>, the lead-in areas leading to the contact zone <b>20</b>, and the contact zone <b>20</b> itself, can be used. The use of various colors also aids the boom operator by providing immediate visual cues of undesired or dangerous conditions developing during the refueling operation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It will also be appreciated that the sensors needed for sensing the distance of the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> relative to the contact zone <b>20</b>, could be provided by a variety of systems. For example, distance sensing between the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> and the contact zone <b>20</b> can be accomplished by information gleaned from the camera system <b>36</b>, as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Alternatively, laser or radio frequency separation measurement equipment could be employed to determine this distance. In any event, this information is used to provide a real time indication as to the distance separating the refueling receptacle <b>18</b> on the receiver aircraft <b>16</b> and the optimum point in space (i.e., within the contact zone <b>20</b>) behind the tanker aircraft <b>12</b> for boom tip <b>26</b> contact to occur with the refueling receptacle <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With specific regard to the boom <b>14</b> separation distance from the refueling receptacle <b>18</b>, one alternative enhancement would be the use of a boom extension distance sensor signal which would be processed to show, on display system <b>46</b>, an absolute distance between the boom tip <b>26</b> and the optimum contact point in the contact zone <b>20</b> behind the refueling tanker <b>12</b> for boom contact to occur with the refueling receptacle <b>18</b>. Still further, another alternative enhancement could be using the boom symbol <b>66</b> to display a number inside of it that represents an actual distance between the boom tip <b>26</b> and the nearest point on the surface of the receiver aircraft <b>16</b>. In this instance the actual boom <b>14</b> extension distance would be implied by its contact with the refueling receptacle <b>18</b>. In the absence of a refueling receiver <b>18</b> in position to receive the boom tip <b>26</b>, the boom symbol <b>66</b> would not be used to judge the boom extension length relative to the optimum contact point. In this case boom <b>14</b> extension distance would be monitored via reference to a telescoping distance scale as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5H</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The system and method of the present invention thus provides a means for providing a boom operator with a graphics symbology set that enables a plurality of important conditions to be presented in an easy to comprehend visual format, to thus aid the boom operator during a refueling operation. The graphics symbology set <b>44</b> also can be used to provide various warnings, in different colors, to instantly alert the boom operator that an undesired condition has developed, as well as what corrective action needs to be taken either by the boom operator or by the pilot of the receiver vehicle <b>16</b>. The system and method of the present invention can be integrated for use with a variety of refueling tankers and with a relatively small number of independent components, and in some instances may even use existing sensor systems already present on a refueling tanker.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">While various preferred embodiments have been described, those skilled in the art will recognize modifications or variations which might be made without departing from the inventive concept. The examples illustrate the invention and are not intended to limit it.
