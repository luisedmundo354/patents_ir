<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to data networks. In particular this invention relates to a method and apparatus for providing a pathway through a multi-protocol label-switching (MPLS) network over which messages, which act to trigger the re-routing of data onto an alternate pathway, can be carried.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a new technology that combines OSI layer <b>2</b> switching technologies and OSI layer <b>3</b> routing technologies. The advantages of MPLS over other technologies include the flexible networking fabric that provides increased performance and scalability. This includes Internet traffic engineering aspects that include Quality of Service (QoS)/Class of Service (COS) and facilitate the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defines MPLS as a standards-based approach to applying label switching technology to large-scale networks. The IETF is defining MPLS in response to numerous interrelated problems that need immediate attention. These problems include, scaling IP networks to meet the growing demands of Internet traffic, enabling differentiated levels of IP-based services to be provisioned, merging disparate traffic types onto a single IP network, and improving operational efficiency in a competitive environment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The key concept in MPLS is identifying and marking IP packets with labels and forwarding them to a modified switch or router, which then uses the labels to switch the packets through the network. The labels are created and assigned to IP packets based upon the information gathered from existing IP routing protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The label stack is represented as a sequence of “label stack entries”. Each label stack entry is represented by 4 octets.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001">
<img id="EMI-C00001" he="25.74mm" wi="75.10mm" file="US07298693-20071120-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The label stack entries appear after the data link layer headers, but before any network layer headers. The top of the label stack appears earliest in the packet, and the bottom appears latest. The network layer packet immediately follows the label stack entry which has the S bit set.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) networks are typically comprised of several packet-based switching systems interconnected by a variety of media (e.g., coaxial or fiber optic cable, unshielded twisted pair or even point-to-point microwave wireless) in a mesh-topology network similar to the public switched telephone network. In such a network, there might be several paths through the network between any two endpoints. MPLS networks carry data as packets wherein each packet includes a label on identifying a switched path through the network. The data label is appended to data packets so as to define a pathway through the network over which the data packets are to be routed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A problem with any data network, including an MPLS network, is the amount of time required to recover from either a link failure or a switch failure. Empirical data shows that the time required to recover from a network failure can take several seconds to several minutes, an unacceptably long time. A method and apparatus by which the recovery time for a link or switch failure can be reduced to perhaps less than a few hundred milliseconds would be a significant improvement over the prior art fault recovery mechanisms used on MPLS networks to date. A method and apparatus by which a switch over from a working path to a protection path would facilitate MPLS network reliability.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an MPLS data network comprised of various transmission media linking various types of switching systems, network fault recovery time is reduced by using a reverse-directed status message that is generated by a data switch that is down-stream from a switching system from which data is received. The reverse-directed or upstream status message is sent over a pre-determined pathway (i.e. through pre-determined switches and/or over pre-determined data links) which originates from a destination switch or node in an MPLS network to upstream switching systems. This so-called reverse notification tree carries a message or messages that are used to indicate the functionality (or non-functionality) of the downstream switch, switches or links of the MPLS network. As long as an upstream MPLS switching system continues to receive the reverse-directed status message from a downstream switch via the reverse notification tree, the switching systems that receive such a message consider the downstream switch and pathways to be in intact. Accordingly, data packets continue to be sent downstream for subsequent routing and/or processing. If the reverse-directed status message is lost or discontinued, either because of a switch failure or a link failure, the upstream switching system considers the downstream switch or link to have failed and thereafter begins executing a procedure by which data is rerouted over an alternate data path through the network. In the preferred embodiment, the alternate data path over which downstream information ins sent is a pre-established protection path and is known to a protection switch in advance, thereby minimizing data loss attributable to the time it might take to calculate a dynamic alternate protection path.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Switches in the network and their interconnections can be modeled using a directed acyclical graph by which a downstream switch knows the identity of the upstream switch to which the failure notice should be sent. In the preferred embodiment, at least one upstream switch routing the MPLS data re-directs data onto a protection path through the network between the same two endpoints by using the reverse notification tree. By way of the reverse notification tree, data loss caused by either a link or switch failure can be minimized by the prompt rerouting of the data through an alternate or recovery data path through the network.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a simplified block diagram of a packetized-data switching network <b>100</b>. Each of the squares shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> including boxes represented by reference numerals <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> represent one or more types of asynchronous switching systems that asynchronously receive data in e.g., packets, cells or frames from an “upstream” switch and route, direct, couple or otherwise send the data onward to another “downstream” switch logically closer to the ultimate destination for the data. By way of example, these switching systems might be internet protocol (IP) routers, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches, frame relays switches or other types of packetized-data switching systems implemented to receive packetized data over a transmission line and reroute the data onto one or more output ports to which are connected transmission media coupled to other switching systems.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, switching system number <b>1</b>, (identified by reference numeral <b>102</b>) is coupled to another switching system, no. <b>2</b>, (represented by reference numeral <b>104</b>) and switching system no. <b>5</b> (represented by reference numeral <b>120</b>) via links L<sub>12 </sub>and P<sub>25 </sub>respectively. Switching system no. <b>2</b> and no. <b>5</b> are “downstream” from no. <b>1</b>; no. <b>1</b> is considered to be “upstream” from switch no. <b>2</b> and no. <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Similarly switching system no. <b>3</b>, (represented by reference numeral <b>106</b>) is coupled to switching systems <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>9</b> (represented by reference numerals <b>104</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>116</b> respectively) via transmission links L<sub>23</sub>, L<sub>34</sub>, and L<sub>93 </sub>respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In routing data between switch no. <b>1</b> (represented by reference numeral <b>102</b>) and switch no. <b>7</b> (represented by reference numeral <b>112</b>) data might be routed between these two endpoints through a “primary” path that is comprised of links that logically or physically couple switches <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> (identified by reference numerals <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> respectively). The physical or logical links of the primary path between the endpoints which is <b>1</b> and <b>7</b> are represented by the vectors designated L<sub>12</sub>, L<sub>23</sub>, L<sub>34</sub>, L<sub>46 </sub>and L<sub>67</sub>. This path is known in the art as the working or primary path through the network. The links of the various paths shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (represented by the vectors L<sub>12</sub>, L<sub>23</sub>, L<sub>34</sub>, L<sub>46 </sub>and L<sub>67</sub>), and therefore the paths themselves, might be constructed of direct pathways (e.g., fiber optic cable, coaxial cable, unshielded twisted pairs of copper wires, or microwave radio) between the various switches. Alternate embodiments of the paths or links between switches of the network of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> would also include using direct pathways, and intermediate switches or switch networks, (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but still part of the path or link coupling one or more switching systems to another). By way of example and not of limitation, the data switches shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> might be IP switches but such IP switches could be linked together using one or more ATM switches or ATM networks.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">The MPLS Protection Path</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an MPLS network, there is almost always a “protection” path, which is an alternate path through the network linking two endpoints. The protection path entry and exit points are usually accessible to only protection switches. A protection switch is a switch that can re-route traffic onto a protection pathway. Like the other links described above, a protection pathway can be comprised of direct data paths, but also switches or switching systems, by which data can be sent through a network between two or more endpoints.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an MPLS network, a protection path is set up using at least one protection switch element so as to be able to carry data from a source to a destination in the event the primary path or switch thereof fails for one reason or another. The operation of a protection switch is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by way of example.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a working path between switch <b>1</b> and <b>7</b> exists through switches <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> and the links between the switches. A protection path for the portion of the working path that runs through switches <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> is the path designated by links P<sub>25 </sub>and P<sub>27 </sub>and which runs through switch <b>5</b>, (identified by reference numeral <b>120</b>). The protection path extends between endpoint switches <b>1</b> and <b>7</b> but through only switch <b>5</b> (identified by reference numeral <b>120</b>). Alternate embodiments of a protection path might extend through multiple switches. In the network <b>100</b>, either a link or switch loss between switch <b>1</b> and <b>7</b> can be overcome by re-routing traffic for switch <b>2</b> through switch <b>5</b> instead. Switch <b>5</b> then routes the data to switch <b>7</b>. Switch <b>1</b> (identified by reference numeral <b>102</b>) is considered to be a protection switch element.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another working path between switch <b>8</b> and switch <b>7</b> of the network <b>100</b> (identified by reference numerals <b>114</b> and <b>112</b> respectively) exists through switches <b>9</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> &amp; <b>7</b> (identified by reference numerals <b>116</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> respectively) and the links between them. A protection path for data from switch <b>8</b> (reference numeral <b>114</b>) to switch <b>7</b> (reference numeral <b>112</b>) through the network <b>100</b> exists via switch <b>10</b>, (reference numeral <b>118</b>) such that if data traffic from switch <b>8</b> (reference numeral <b>114</b>) is lost somewhere between switch <b>9</b> (reference numeral <b>116</b>) and switch <b>7</b> (reference numeral <b>112</b>), switch <b>9</b> can re-route such data traffic to switch <b>10</b> (reference numeral <b>118</b>). Switch <b>10</b> can then route such data to switch <b>7</b>. Switch <b>9</b> is therefore considered to be a protection switch element.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">If an alternate data path, i.e. a protection path, is pre-determined, i.e. set up or established in advance, data loss attributable to a switch or link failure can be minimized. If a protection switch is pre-programmed to re-route data upon its receipt of an appropriate command or signal, the protection switch element can almost immediately start sending data to the proper destination via the protection path.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">The Liveness Message</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the event of a pathway failure, such as either a switch failure or a link failure, anywhere along a primary or working path, a protection switch element (PSL), such as switch no. <b>1</b> (identified by reference numeral <b>102</b>) can re-route data traffic through the protection path so as to have the data for the endpoint switch no. <b>7</b> delivered as quickly as possible to the endpoint at switch no. <b>7</b> (identified by reference numeral <b>112</b>). The ability to re-route data to a protection path is made considerably more valuable if the decision to switch over to a protection path is based upon an affirmative notice that a switch over is needed. This affirmative notice is in the form of an upstream liveness message, the loss of which indicates a pathway failure. As long as a liveness message is received at an upstream switch from a downstream switch, the upstream switch can assume that the pathway between the two switches is intact and that the downstream switch is functional.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the event of a switch or link failure anywhere between the path endpoint switches <b>1</b> and <b>7</b>, data re-routing is accomplished faster by using a reverse-directed status message that is sent backward or upstream toward the protection switch element no. <b>1</b> (reference numeral <b>102</b>) by one or more of the switches <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> or <b>7</b> (reference numerals <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> or <b>112</b>) of the primary pathway, links L<sub>12</sub>, L<sub>23</sub>, L<sub>34</sub>, L<sub>46</sub>, L<sub>67</sub>. In the preferred embodiment this reverse direction data message is known as a “liveness message” the format of which is a design choice and dependent upon nature of the switches of the network <b>100</b>, but the function of which is to indicate to upstream switches that the data traffic sent to the downstream switch arrived intact and on time.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The structure of a liveness message will vary depending upon whether the network switches are ATM, IP, Ethernet or other types of switches, as those skilled in the art will recognize. Unlike known fault detection methods, the liveness message is not a copy, or loop-back of the downstream data. The salient aspect of the liveness message is that it is an informational or status message, preferably sent at periodic intervals between adjacent nodes, indicating the operational condition of the switch from which it was sent. Alternate embodiments include sending a liveness message aperiodically. The fact that the liveness message is received at an upstream switch (with respect to the downstream data) is evidence that the link between the switches, over which downstream data would be sent, is intact and that the switch that generated the liveness message is at least somewhat functional.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">While the preferred embodiment contemplates that the liveness message is sent upstream from a switch, directly to the switch that sent the downstream data, alternate embodiments of the invention contemplate that the liveness message could be sent between other nodes, or from one switch to an intermediate transfer point, which for purposes of claim construction are considered to be equivalent embodiments. By way of example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, switch no. <b>4</b> (identified by reference numeral <b>108</b>) will send a liveness message, upstream to switch no. <b>3</b> (reference numeral <b>106</b>) in response to data sent downstream from switch no. <b>3</b> to switch no. <b>4</b>. If the liveness message from switch no. <b>4</b> is lost by or not received by switch no. <b>3</b>, switch no. <b>3</b> immediately knows that either the link L<sub>34 </sub>between the two switches failed, or switch no. <b>4</b> failed. If switch no. <b>3</b> was carrying data from switch no. <b>9</b> (reference no. <b>116</b>) and which is a protection switch element having access to a protection path, switch no. <b>3</b> would need to inhibit its liveness message to switch no. <b>9</b> or generate an error message to switch no. <b>9</b>, thereby instructing switch no. <b>9</b> to re-route traffic from switch no. <b>3</b>, to the protection path through switch no. <b>10</b> (reference numeral <b>118</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As for data routed through switch no. <b>3</b> that comes from switch no. <b>2</b> (reference numeral <b>104</b>), a liveness message loss from switch no. <b>4</b> will require switch no. <b>3</b> to inhibit the liveness message to switch no. <b>2</b>, or send an error message to switch no. <b>2</b>. This procedure is then repeated to switch no. <b>1</b>, instructing switch no. <b>1</b> to make a protection switch through switch no. <b>5</b> (reference no. <b>120</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Whenever the liveness message is lost, its failure is considered to be indicative of a path failure of either a link or a switch. Still other embodiments of the invention contemplate sending a downstream liveness message, sent from an upstream switch to a downstream switch thereby indicating to a downstream switch that the upstream switch and link are functional.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As set forth above, the format of a liveness message will depend upon the type of switching systems used in the network. IP switches and ATM switches will need to comply with their respective protocols. Alternative embodiments of the invention would certainly contemplate other sorts of liveness messages having different formats with the salient feature of the message being that the message indicates to an upstream switch that downstream directed data messages were received by a downstream switch intact.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the links over which reverse notification status messages (i.e. the liveness messages) are sent, are designated by the reverse directed vectors, one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (and identified by reference numeral R<sub>76</sub>). By way of example if link L<sub>67 </sub>should fail causing a data loss to the endpoint switch no. <b>7</b>, the corresponding loss of the liveness message ordinarily sent from switch <b>7</b> to switch <b>6</b> would provide an indication to switch no. <b>6</b> that either the link or the switch <b>7</b> failed whereupon switch no. <b>6</b> would begin notifying the protection switch (switch no. <b>1</b>) upstream from it by way of a reverse notification message R<sub>64 </sub>that would be sent to switch no. <b>4</b>, (represented by reference numeral <b>108</b>). Similarly, switch no. <b>4</b> would thereafter return a reverse notification message R<sub>43 </sub>to switch no. <b>3</b>. Switch no. <b>3</b> returns another reverse notification message R<sub>32 </sub>to switch <b>2</b> which then returns a reverse notification message R<sub>21 </sub>to the origination node <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The ultimate destination of the upstream message, and in this case the reverse notification message, is a switching node (i.e. a switch or switching system) that is capable of re-routing downstream traffic, data or messages onto a different path, i.e., a protection path, usually comprised of at least a different transmission route, possibly including a different transmission media as well (coax to fiber; fiber to microwave etc.). Whether the upstream message goes through another switch on its way to the switching node (which has the capability of re-routing data to the protection path) or is directly sent to the switching node from a downstream switch around an intermediate switch (for example, sending a liveness message directly from switch <b>6</b> to switch <b>1</b>) would still provide equal functionality in that the switching node will eventually receive notification that it needs to re-route traffic, data or message onto the protection path. Sending the aliveness message directly to the protection switch or routing the aliveness message via intervening switches are considered to be equivalent embodiments for purposes of claim construction.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Inasmuch as switch no. <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is designated as a “protection switch element” meaning that it is coupled to and capable of routing data onto a protection path P<sub>25</sub>, the protection switch element <b>1</b> (identified by reference numeral <b>102</b>) reroutes traffic to switch no. <b>7</b> via a protection path designated by P<sub>25 </sub>and P<sub>57 </sub>and that runs through switch no. <b>5</b> (identified by reference numeral <b>120</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the preferred embodiment, the switches of the network maintain tables of network switches upon which incoming data is received and a table of network switches to which outgoing data is routed. By keeping a record of where outgoing data from a switch originates from, it is possible for a switch of the network <b>100</b> to promptly notify an upstream switch of a downstream link or switch failure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the process described above, each of the switches of the network sequentially notifies at least one switch upstream from it. Alternate (and for purposes of claim construction, equivalent) embodiments of the invention could certainly provide upstream notification messages directly from any downstream switch to every other upstream switch in a pathway. In such an embodiment, switch no. <b>6</b> might send a reverse notification message directly to the protection switch element <b>1</b> via a direct link thereby notifying the protection switch to immediately reroute data to the protection path P<sub>27 </sub>and P<sub>57 </sub>via switch no. <b>5</b>. Switch no. <b>6</b> might also send a reverse notification (liveness) message to the other switching systems of the network as well.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">The Reverse Notification Tree</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The implementation of the upstream notification message, and its conveyance upstream to a protection switch element, is enabled by using an upstream pathway denominated herein as a reverse notification tree or “RNT.” The RNT is an “upstream” signal pathway that allows messages from a protection path end point to be sent “upstream” to one or more protection path (and working path) starting point switches, nodes or starting points. In the preferred embodiment, the RNT passes through the same switches and over or through the links that comprise the working path (albeit over different transmission media) and for claim construction purposes the RNT can be considered to be “coincident” with the working path. Alternate embodiments of the invention would include a reverse notification tree that runs through one or more switches or nodes that are not part of the working path, or which are only partly “coincident.” For claim construction purposes, a “coincident” RNT includes RNTs in MPLS networks wherein the working path is a so-called point to multipoint network (in which case the coincident RNT would be a multipoint to point pathway) as well as RNTs in MPLS networks wherein the working path is a multi point to point network, in which case the coincident RNT would be a multi point to point network.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For purposes of claim construction, in this disclosure, the notification messages as well as the so-called liveness messages are both carried on the reverse notification tree and are both considered herein to be a “first message” as well as a “first data message.”</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, node <b>7</b>, identified by reference numeral <b>112</b>, is the RNT starting point or head end. Nodes <b>1</b> and <b>9</b>, which are identified by reference numerals <b>102</b> and <b>116</b>, are the end points of the RNT and to which upstream protection switch messages would be sent from any node or switch between nodes <b>1</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>7</b>. Intervening nodes <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>, identified by reference numerals <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> respectively, are constituent elements or parts of the RNT.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The RNT can be established in association with the working path(s) simply by making each switching system along a working path “remember” its upstream neighbor (or the collection of upstream neighbors whose working paths converge at a network switching element and exit as one). A table or other data structure stored in memory (such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, or disk) of the switches of the paths can be configured to store data identifying switches coupled to a switching system in, or part of a working path as well as a protection path.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With respect to the network shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, Table 1 below shows that incoming or “Ingress” RNT messages to switch no. <b>3</b> from switch <b>4</b> are labeled “N<b>43</b>” (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and that these messages arrive at switch no. <b>3</b> from switch <b>4</b> at an inbound or “Ingress” interface I<b>34</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Because switch no. <b>3</b> receives downstream messages from two (2) different switches, (i.e. switch <b>2</b> and switch <b>9</b>) both of these two upstream switches must be sent an upstream notification therefore requiring two separate upstream messages from switch <b>3</b>. Upstream RNT messages to switch <b>2</b> are labeled “N<b>32</b>” and appear or are sent from interface I<b>23</b>.

A fault on the link between switch <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> in the downstream direction can be detected at a downstream node, switch <b>4</b> perhaps, via either a path failure (PF) or path defect (PD) condition being detected via Link Failure (LF) or Link Defect (LD) signals being propagated to an upstream switch. The downstream node will then periodically transmit fault indication signal (FIS) messages to its upstream neighbor (via the uplink R<sub>43</sub>), which will propagate these further upstream (using its inverse cross-connect table) until they eventually reach the appropriate Protection Switch Element, which will perform the protection switch. From Table 1, messages received at switch no. <b>3</b> are labeled “N<b>43</b>.” Therefore, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, if link L<b>34</b> has a fault, switch <b>3</b> will detect the fault via the lost liveness message from switch no. <b>4</b> and start transmitting an FIS packet back to switch <b>2</b> link L<sub>23 </sub>as represented by the message R<sub>32</sub>. From Tables 1 and 2, there are two egress messages and interfaces from switch no. <b>3</b>, which identify the upstream switches that are to be “notified” of a failure downstream from switch no. <b>3</b>. (The traffic in the queues of switch <b>3</b> will continue to be serviced.) By using similar tables, switch <b>2</b> in turn will propagate the FIS over the RNT back to switch <b>1</b>. The actual protection switch will be performed by switch <b>1</b>, after the receipt of the first FIS. Switch <b>3</b> will stop transmitting FIS messages “t” time units after the transmission of the first FIS message.
</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the preferred embodiment, only one RNT is required for all the working paths that merge (either physically or virtually) to form the multipoint-to-point “forward” or “downstream” path. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows that at least two (2) working paths (one path of which is comprised of switch elements <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> that are identified by reference numerals <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>; a second path of which is comprised of switch elements <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>3</b> that are identified by reference numerals <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and <b>106</b>) converge at switch element <b>3</b> (identified by reference numeral <b>106</b>). Alternate (and for purposes of claim construction, equivalent) embodiments would include using multiple RNTs for a single working path that has multiple paths that converge at a single node (switches of each path that converges might form different RNTs) as well as using multiple RNTs for a single working path.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The RNT is rooted at an appropriately chosen label switched router (“LSR”), (which hereafter is referred to as an MPLS network switch element) along the common segment of the merged working paths and is terminated at the protection switch elements (PSLs). Intermediate network switching elements on the converged working paths typically share the same RNT reducing signaling overhead associated with recovery. Unlike schemes that treat each network switch element independently, and require signaling between a protection switch element and a destination switch individually for each network switch element, the RNT allows for only one (or a small number of) signaling messages on the shared segments of the label switch paths (LSPs).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The RNT can be implemented either at Layer 3 or at Layer 2 of the OSI, 7-layer protocol stack. In either case, delay along the RNT needs to be carefully controlled. This may be accomplished by giving the highest priority to the fault and repair notification packets, which travel along the RNT. We can therefore have a situation where different protection domains share a common RNT.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A protection “domain” is considered to be the switches and links of both a working path and protection path. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the protection domain bounded by network switch element <b>1</b> and network switch element <b>7</b>, is denoted by {1-2-3-4-6-7, 1-5-7}.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When different protection domains have different RNTs, two cases may arise, depending on whether or not any portions of the two domains overlap, that is, have nodes or links in common. If the protection domains do not overlap, the protection domains are considered to be independent. By virtue of the RNTs in the two domains being different, neither of the working paths nor the RNTs of the two domains can overlap. In other words, failures in one domain do not interact with failures in the other domain. For example, the protection domain defined by {9-3-4-6-7, 9-10-7} is completely independent of the domain defined by {11-13-5-15, 11-13-14-15}. As a result, as long as faults occur in independent domains, the network shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can tolerate multiple faults (for example, simultaneous failures on the working path in each domain). If protection domains with disjoint RNTs overlap, it implies that the protection path of one intersects the working path of the other. Therefore, although failures on the working paths of the two domains do not affect one another, failures on the protection path of one may affect the working path of the other and visa versa. For example, the protection domain defined by {1-2-3-4-6-7, 1-5-7} is not independent of the domain defined by {11-13-5-15, 11-13-14-15} since LSR <b>5</b> lies on the protection path in the former domain and on the working path in the latter domain. When protection domains have the same RNT, different failures along the working paths may affect both paths differently. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, working paths <b>1</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>3</b>-<b>4</b>-<b>5</b>-<b>7</b> and <b>9</b>-<b>3</b>-<b>4</b>-<b>6</b>-<b>7</b> share the same RNT. As a result, for a failure on some segments of the working path, both domains will be affected, resulting in a protection switch in both (for example, the segment <b>3</b>-<b>4</b>-<b>6</b>-<b>7</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Likewise, for failures on other segments of the working path, only one domain may be affected (for example, failure on segment <b>2</b>-<b>3</b> affects only the first working path <b>1</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>3</b>-<b>4</b>-<b>6</b>-<b>7</b>, where as failure on the segment <b>9</b>-<b>3</b> affects only the second working path <b>9</b>-<b>3</b>-<b>4</b>-<b>6</b>-<b>7</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">There are a number of ways to establish a protection domain, i.e., a working path and a protection path through an MPLS network. Establishing a protection path first requires the identification of the working path (embodied as some series of switches and path links through the MPLS network from a sending node to a destination node). In most cases, the working path and its corresponding recovery path are specified during a network switch path or connection setup procedure, either via a path selection algorithm (running at a centralized location or at an ingress network switch element) or via an administrative configuration (e.g. a manual specification of switches that comprise the protection path).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The specification of either a protection or working path, does not, strictly speaking, require the entire path to be explicitly specified. Rather, it requires only that the head end node or switching node and end or destination switch or node (of the respective paths) be specified. In the absence of a destination switch/node specification, the path egress points out of the MPLS network or domain need to be specified, with the segments between them being—“loosely” determined or routed. In other words, a working path would be established between the two nodes at the boundaries of a protection domain via (possibly loose) explicit (or source) routing using LDP/RSVP [label distribution protocol/reservation protocol] signaling (alternatively, via constraint-based routing, or using manual configuration), as set forth more fully below.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts message flows between four (4) different switches of an MPLS network that employs the path protection techniques disclosed herein. Vertical axes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, identified by reference numerals <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>, represent switching elements (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of an MPLS network from which and to which various types of messages are received and sent respectively. Switch <b>202</b> is upstream from switches <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>. Switch <b>204</b> is upstream from switch <b>206</b> as switch <b>206</b> is upstream from switch <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Protection Path Establishment</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Protection Domain Path is established by the identification of a protection switch or node and an end point switch or node in the MPLS network. The protection switch element (“PSL”) initiates the working network switch elements and the recovery network switch element. It is also responsible for storing information about which network switch elements or portions thereof have protection enabled, and for maintaining a binding between outgoing labels specifying the working path and the protection/recovery path. The latter enables the switchover to the recovery path upon the receipt of a protection switch trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A “label distribution protocol” is a set of procedures by which one LSR (i.e., a network switch element) informs another of the label bindings it has made. “Label binding” is a process by which a message to be sent from a source to a destination is associated with various labels between the nodes that lie along the way, between the source and destination. By way of example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a message to be sent from switch <b>1</b> to switch <b>7</b> is associated or bound to travel to switch <b>7</b> through switch <b>2</b> by, or using, the label L<sub>12 </sub>that is first associated with the message at, or by, switch <b>1</b>. Switch <b>2</b> in turn associates messages labeled L<sub>12 </sub>as bound for switch <b>3</b> and re-labels them as L<sub>23</sub>. Re-labeling messages (e.g. re-labeling a message received at switch <b>2</b> on L<sub>12</sub>, as the same message that is output from switch <b>2</b> but on L<sub>23 </sub>and which is received at switch <b>3</b>, to be re-labeled by switch <b>3</b> and output again as L<sub>34</sub>) is known as “label binding.” Two or more LSRs, (network switch elements) which use a label distribution protocol to exchange label binding information are known as “label distribution peers” with respect to the binding information they exchange.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The label distribution protocol also encompasses any negotiations in which two, label distribution peers, need to engage in order to learn of each other's MPLS capabilities. This label distribution protocol is referred to as path establishment signaling. MPLS defines two methods for label distribution. These two methods are: Label Distribution Protocol (LDP/CR-LDP) and ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Both LDP/CR-LDP and RSVP allow a path to be setup loosely (wherein each node determines it's next hop) or explicitly (wherein each node has been given it's next hop). These two protocols can be extended, as disclosed herein and by equivalents thereof, to provide a novel mechanism by which protection path establishment can be signaled and created. Accordingly, a “Protection” field can be defined, and added as an extension to the existing label request messages in LDP/CR-LDP, and path message in RSVP protocols. The destination or end point node in the MPLS network participates in setting up a recovery path as a merging network switch element. The destination or end point node learns, during a signaling or working/protection path configuration process, which working and protection paths are merged to the same outgoing network switch element.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Hosts and routers that support both RSVP and Multi-Protocol Label Switching can associate labels with RSVP flows. When MPLS and RSVP are combined, the definition of a flow can be made more flexible. Once a label switched path (LSP) is established, the traffic through the path is defined by the label applied at the ingress node of the LSP (label switched path). The mapping of a label to traffic can be accomplished using a number of different criteria. The set of packets that are assigned the same label value by a specific node are said to belong to the same forwarding equivalence class (FEC) and effectively define the “RSVP flow.” When traffic is mapped onto a label-switched path in this way, we call the LSP an “LSP Tunnel”. When labels are associated with traffic flows, it becomes possible for a router to identify the appropriate reservation state for a packet based on the packet's label value.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A Path message travels from a sender to receiver(s) along the same path(s) used by the data packets. The IP source address of a Path message must be an address of the sender it describes, while the destination address must be the DestAddress for the session. These addresses assure that the message will be correctly routed through a non-RSVP cloud.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0070">Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is defined for distribution of labels inside one MPLS domain. One of the most important services that may be offered using MPLS in general, and LDP in particular, is support for constraint-based routing of traffic across the routed network. Constraint-based routing offers the opportunity to extend the information used to setup paths beyond what is available for the routing protocol. For instance, an LSP can be setup based on explicit route constraints, QoS constraints, and other constraints.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0071">Constraint-based routing (CR) is a mechanism used to meet Traffic Engineering. These requirements may be met by extending LDP for support of constraint-based routed label switched paths (CR-LSPs).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0072">The Path Vector TLV is used with the Hop Count TLV in Label Request and Label Mapping messages to implement the optional LDP loop detection mechanism. Its use in the Label Request message records the path of LSRs the request has traversed. Its use in the Label Mapping message records the path of LSRs a label advertisement has traversed to setup an LSP.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0079">Since the switching systems used in the network <b>100</b> are unidirectional, and pathway fault recovery requires the notification of faults to a protection switch, such as switch no. <b>1</b> or switch no. <b>9</b>, responsible for a switchover to a recovery path, a mechanism is provided for the fault indication and the fault recovery notification to travel from a point of occurrence of the fault back to the protection switch. The ability to propagate a fault notice upstream however is complicated when two or more data streams merge in a single switch such as the streams from switches <b>9</b> and <b>2</b> merging at switch <b>3</b>. When two or more data streams merge at a switch, e.g. switch <b>9</b>, a fault anywhere downstream from switch <b>9</b> will require that a fault notice be sent to multiple source switches, i.e. switches <b>9</b> and <b>2</b>. The fault indication and recovery notification should be able to travel along a reverse path of the working paths to all the protection switch elements that might be affected by the fault. The path is provided by the reverse notification tree.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0080">The MPLS protection switch message sequence begins with the establishment of the particular working paths and protection paths through the network. The establishment of the working path and protection path is accomplished by the transmission of a Protection Switch Domain (PSD) initialization message <b>210</b> from a switch <b>202</b> to switches <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>. A PSD confirmation message <b>212</b> is propagated from the downstream switch <b>208</b> upstream to switch <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0081">The Reverse Notification Tree or RNT, is established by the downstream switch, <b>208</b>, sending an RNT initialization message <b>214</b>, upstream to switches <b>206</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>202</b>. Confirmation of the RNT setup is accomplished by the RNT Confirmation message <b>216</b> that originates from switch <b>202</b>. Upon the establishment of the working and protection paths, and the reverse notification tree, data <b>218</b> can be sent through the network.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0082">Two “aliveness” messages <b>220</b> and <b>222</b>, which provide notification of the working path status, are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to depict the fact that the aliveness message described above can be sent periodically, regardless of whether downstream data <b>218</b> was sent. As shown further, downstream data transmissions, such as transmissions <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> are not conditioned upon receipt of an aliveness message in any fixed way. An aliveness message <b>230</b> sent upstream is then followed by yet another data transmission <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that the sequence of aliveness messages and data transmissions do not need to follow any sort of predetermined or fixed order. For network reliability purposes, the aliveness messages are preferably sent periodically, so that their absence can be detected if they do not arrive on time. Alternate embodiments include sending liveness messages aperiodically.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0084">Those skilled in the art will recognize that re-routing data on a either the failure of a link or a switch in a network such as that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> need not be performed by a protection switch. In the event that switch <b>4</b> fails for example switch no. <b>3</b> might reroute data from switch <b>2</b> that is destined for switch <b>7</b>, through another protection switch element <b>9</b>, identified by reference numeral <b>116</b>. Switch <b>9</b> might then reroute data from switch <b>2</b> that is addressed to switch <b>7</b> over a protection path designed as P<sub>9,10 </sub>and P<sub>10,7 </sub>through switch <b>10</b>, identified as reference numeral <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0085">In the preferred embodiment, the media over which data message are carried might be twisted copper wires, coax cable, fiber optic cable or even a radio frequency data link. As set forth above, each of the switching systems might accommodate a variety of packetized data messages including but not limited to Ethernet, internet protocol, ATM, frame relay or other types of transmission switching systems.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0086">By continuously sending an upstream message indicating that downstream traffic arrives at its destination, recovery time required to recover from the fault of a media link or a switching system can be minimized. If the switch status message used to indicate a functionality of a switch or a link is sent promptly enough, and to the appropriate node in a mesh network such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the time required to reroute data messages between first and second endpoint switches over an alternate data path can be minimized. In the preferred embodiment, the alternate or so called protection path is preferably set up in advance and maintained in a stand by mode such that it is immediately available when required by the protection switch that will reroute data over the protection path.</p>
