<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to novel cationic amphiphiles containing cyclic head group. The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising said cationic amphiphiles, useful for the delivery of biologically active therapeutic molecules into body cells/tissues of mammals and humans.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Although many defective genes associated with numerous genetic diseases have been identified and characterized, because of the selective permeability of biological cell membranes, delivering required amounts of therapeutically important genes into the target body cells is often a daunting challenge.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus, success of gene therapy approach in treating genetic diseases depends, in a major way, on the development of efficient and safe gene delivery reagents that will facilitate the intracellular delivery of therapeutic genes into the particular body cells of a patient. Accordingly, development of safe and efficient gene delivery reagents and methods that can facilitate entry of functional genes into body cells are of great medical importance. Amphiphilic molecules containing both polar and non-polar regions in their molecular architecture have been used in delivering therapeutically important molecules into cells. This makes sense given the existence of both polar and non-polar segments in biological cell membranes. Cationic amphiphiles are the particularly important class of amphiphilic compounds used most extensively for enhancing intracellular delivery of many biologically active therapeutic compounds. Broadly speaking, at physiological pH the polar segment of cationic amphiphile interacts with the therapeutically important molecules including polyanionic macromolecular DNA, RNA, proteins etc. while the non-polar region of the cationic amphiphiles facilitate the passage of the therapeutic compounds through the non-polar part of the cell membranes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following references are examples of cationic amphiphiles that are known in the art to be useful for enhancing the intracellular delivery of therapeutically important molecules. In addition to the molecular structures, these prior arts contain useful information and discussion on the properties of the cationic amphiphiles those are believed to be responsible for their carrier properties.</p>

<ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0122">(1) The presence of hydrophobic groups which are directly linked to the positively charged nitrogen atom;</li>

        <li id="ul0015-0003" num="0124">(3) Unlike many other commercially available glycerol-backbone based cationic amphiphiles used in delivering genes into cells, the presently disclosed cationic lipids do not have any glycerol-backbone in their molecular architectures. It is believed that these unique structural features contribute significantly to the increased gene delivery efficiencies of the cationic amphiphiles disclosed herein.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0125">According to the practice of the present invention, “cationic” means the positive charge is either on quaternized nitrogen and/or on a protonated substituent of the cyclic head group. The cationic characters of the present amphiphiles may contribute to the enhanced interaction of the amphiphiles with biologically active molecules such as nucleic acids and/or with cell constituents such as plasma membrane glycoproteins. Such enhanced interaction between the cationic amphiphiles and therapeutically active biological macromolecules and/or cell membrane constituents may play a key role in successfully transporting the therapeutic molecules into the cells.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0126">The invention cationic lipids have a lipophilic domain that facilitates the formation of lipid complexes or aggregates in aqueous solutions. The lipophilicity of the hydrophobic domains and the hydrophilicity of the polar head group domains are such that when the cationic lipids are confronted with aqueous solutions, lipid aggregates are formed in the presence or absence of a second compound. Exemplary lipophilic R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>groups include (1) saturated C<sub>8</sub>-C<sub>22 </sub>alkyl groups and (2) unsaturated C<sub>8</sub>-C<sub>22 </sub>alkyl groups containing one to three unsaturation.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0127">In one preferred embodiment of the presently disclosed cationic lipids where n=1, both R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>are selected from C<sub>8</sub>-C<sub>22 </sub>saturated alkyl groups, both R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>are independently represented in any combination of groups selected from hydrogen, hydroxyl, hydroxy alkyl, amino or primary amine and X<sup>−</sup> is selected from chloride or bromide ions.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0130">Both the primary hydroxyl groups of the starting alcohol is first converted to their tosyl derivative by reacting them with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in presence of pyridine as a base. The resulting di-tosyl derivative (the intermediate II in Scheme I) is then subjected to reaction with the appropriate secondary amine in polar aprotic solvent like N.N-dimethyl formamide to form the cationic amphiphile (III), a tosylate counterion containing analog of the present cationic lipids. A final treatment of the intermediate III with chloride ion-exchange resins affords the target cationic amphiphile (I) of the present invention. As shown in Scheme I, to synthesize cationic lipids with two hydroxyl functionalities in the cyclic head group, protecting the secondary hydroxyl group of the starting material is not necessary. However, to prepare cationic amphiphiles with two amino functionalities in the cyclic head group, execution of Scheme I requires protection of both the primary amino group of the starting material and a later deprotection step.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Formulations</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0131">The invention also provides novel therapeutic formulation comprising therapeutically effective amounts of the cationic amphiphilic compounds disclosed herein, biologically active molecules and co-lipids. One or more additional physiologically acceptable substances may be included in the pharmaceutical formulation of the invention to stabilize the formulation for storage or to facilitate successful intracellular delivery of the biologically active molecules. Co-lipids according to the practice of the present invention are useful in mixing with one or more cationic amphiphiles. Cholesterol is an excellent co-lipid for use in combination with the presently described cationic lipids to facilitate successful intracellular delivery of the biologically active molecules. A preferred range of molar ratio of cationic amphiphile to co-lipid is 1:0 to 1:2.5. As such, it is within the art to vary the said range to a considerably wide extent.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0132">Biologically active molecules that can be administered intracellularly in therapeutic amounts using the cationic amphiphilic compound of the present invention include ribosomal RNA, antisense polynucleotide of RNA or DNA, polynucleotide of genomic DNA, cDNA or mRNA that encodes for a therapeutically important protein. The cationic amphiphiles of the present invention may be blended such that one or more of the representatives thereof are used in a combination to facilitate entry of the said biologically active molecules into cells/tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0133">According to the present invention, the amphiphiles are used either in pure form or in combination with other lipids or helper lipids such as cholesterol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, etc. The said therapeutic formulation can be stored at 0° C.-4° C. until complexed with the biologically active therapeutic molecules. Agents that prevent bacterial growth and increase the shelf life may be included along with reagents that stabilize the preparation, e.g., low concentrations of glycerol. It is specifically warned that freezing and thawing cycles could cause loss in efficiency of the formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0134">The present invention also provides for various formulations that facilitate intracellular delivery of biologically active molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0135">The present invention also provides for a formulation of cationic amphiphiles and nucleic acid may be administered intravenously besides other routes such as intramuscular and intra peritonial. Further, the said formulation of amphiphiles may be administered to cells at a ratio of 0.1-0.5 microgram of DNA to 50,000 cells in an in vitro system. The amount of amphiphile could be varied from a lipid to DNA charge ratio of 0.1 to 10, considering one positive charge for one amphiphile molecule to one negative charge of a nucleotide base.</p>

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Cellular Cytotoxicities of the Amphiphiles Disclosed in the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0138">The viabilities of cells in presence of various cationic amphiphiles disclosed herein were checked according to the standard protocol described in “Animal Cell Culture, 2<sup>nd </sup>Edition. Ed. I. R. L. Press, Oxford University Press (1977)”. The transfection efficiencies of the cationic lipids were studied in the range of 0-10 nmole and within this limit, the cell cytotoxicities were observed to be minimal and the cell viabilities were determined to be more than 80%. The cationic amphiphiles were used with varying mole ratios of lipid to DNA using cholesterol as the neutral co-lipid.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Applications</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0139">The process of the present invention can be exploited for preparing cationic transfection lipids with polar cyclic head groups. The invention lipids are useful for delivering polyanions, polypeptides or nucleopolymers into cells. The cationic lipids disclosed herein can be used to deliver an expression vector into a cell for manufacturing or therapeutic use. The expression vectors can be used in gene therapy protocols to deliver a therapeutically useful protein to a cell or for delivering nucleic acids encoding therapeutically useful protein molecules that can generate an immune response in a host for vaccine or other immunomodulatory purposes according to the known methods. The vector-transformed cell can be used to produce commercially useful cell lines, such as a cell line for producing therapeutic proteins or enzymes (e.g. erythropoietin), growth factors (e.g. human growth hormone, G-CSF or interleukins) or other proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0140">The invention lipid-nucleic acid complexes can be used to construct cell lines for gene therapy applications in subjects such as humans or other species including murine, feline, bovine, equine, ovine or non-human primate species. The invention lipids can be used in presence of serum and will thus deliver polyanions into cells in tissue culture medium containing serum in vitro or in animal in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0141">The invention lipids complexed with nucleopolymers can be used in antisense inhibition of gene expression in a cell by delivering an antisense oligonucleotide into the cell. A cell that is blocked for expression of a specific gene(s) is useful for manufacturing and therapeutic applications. Exemplary manufacturing uses include inhibiting protease synthesis in a cell to increase production (i.e., reduce target protein degradation caused by the protease) of a protein for a therapeutic or diagnostic application. Exemplary therapeutic applications include inhibiting synthesis of cell surface antigens (histocompatibility antigens, such as MHC class II genes, and the like) to reduce rejection and/or to induce immunologic tolerance of the cell after it is implanted into a subject or when the cell is transfected in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0142">The invention lipids can be formulated with anionic, zwitterionic and lipophilic therapeutic agents including anticancer agents such as doxorubicin, a lipophilic compound, to obtain complexes comprising the invention lipids and a therapeutic agent(s). The invention lipids can be formulated with known antiviral agents such as HPMPC (9-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxy)propyl)cytosine), PMEA(9-(2-phosphonylmethoxy)ethyl)adenine), PMEG PMEA (9-(2-phosphonylmethoxy)ethyl)guanine), PMPA (9-(2-phosphonylmethoxy)propyl)adenine), AZT, 3TC, and their derivatives to obtain lipid complexes with antiviral agents. The invention lipids can be formulated with polyene antibiotics such as amphotericin B. Such formulations are useful for delivering the therapeutic agents into the cytoplasm of cells in vitro or in vivo. Complexes consisting of an invention cationic lipid and an anti-influenza agent can be used to deliver the antiviral agent to the lung, the primary site of infection. These complexes can be prepared by any of the techniques now known or subsequently developed for preparing lipid complexes containing therapeutic agents.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0168">Cell Transfection. COS-1 cells were seeded at a density of 15,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate eighteen hours before the transfection. 0.15 μg of plasmid DNA was complexed with varying amount of lipid (0.05-4.3 nmoles) in 13 μl of plain DMEM medium for 30 min. The charge ratios were varied from 0.1:1 to 9:1 (+/−) over this range of the lipid. The complex was diluted to 100 μl with plain DMEM and added to the wells. After 3 h of incubation, 100 μl of DMEM with 10% FCS was added to the cells. The medium was changed to 10% complete medium after 24 h and the reporter gene activity was estimated after 48 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (0.25 M Tris.HCl, pH 8.0 and 0.5% NP40). Care was taken to ensure complete lysis. The β-galactosidase activity per well was estimated by adding 50 μl of 2× substrate solution (1.33 mg/ml of ONPG, 0.2 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.15 and 2 mM magnesium chloride) to the lysate in a 96-well plate. Absorption at 405 nm was converted to β-galactosidase units by using calibration curve constructed with pure commercial β-galactosidase enzyme. The values of β-galactosidase units in replicate plates assayed on the same day varied by less than 30%. The transfection efficiency values reported were average values from four replicate transfection plates assayed on the same day. Each transfection experiment was repeated three times on three different days and the day-to-day variation in average transfection efficiency values for identically treated replicate transfection plates was 2-3 fold and was dependent on the cell density and conditions of the cells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows representative transfection results obtained with cationic lipids 1-5. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the in vitro transfection efficiency of cationic lipid 2 is comparable to or better than that of DMRIE, one of the most extensively used commercially available cationic transfection lipids used in in vitro gene delivery.</p>

<p id="p-0125" num="0169">Lipid:DNA Interactions Assay. Intercalation-induced fluorescence increase and competition with cationic lipids to bind to DNA has made Ethidium Bromide (EtBr) an excellent tool to study cationic lipid-DNA interactions. To assess the representative lipid:DNA interactions for the cationic lipids of the present invention, we have titrated the EtBr:pCMV β-gal complex with increasing amounts of cationic lipids 1-5.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0170">The extent of Et.Br binding to the DNA was monitored by the changes in the fluorescence. EtBr fluorescence was monitored in Hitachi 4500 fluorimeter by setting the excitation wavelength at 518 nm and emission wavelength at 585 nm. To one ml of TE buffer (pH 8.0), 0.78 nmoles of DNA and 2.5 nmoles of EtBr were added. The change in fluorescence was monitored after adding small volumes of lipids 1-5 to the EtBr:DNA complex. Arbitrary fluorescence values were recorded after allowing sufficient time for equilibration. The order of addition of EtBr or lipid to DNA did not alter the final values indicating that the equilibrium does not depend on the order of addition and reaches in minutes. Percent fluorescence was calculated considering the fluorescence value in the absence of lipid as 100.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0171">The data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that lipids 1, 4 and 5 interact poorly with DNA as seen by their relatively poor ability to exclude ethidium bromide from DNA. Lipids 2 and 3 interact with DNA equally well up to lipid:DNA ratio of 1.25 or so (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The decrease in EtBr fluorescence at charge ratios of 3:1 was greater than 80% with all the lipids 1-5. Taken together the transfection results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the lipid:DNA interaction profiles shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it seems that strong lipid:DNA interactions for the presently described cationic lipids results into better intracellular gene delivery.</p>

An MTT based viability assay was performed to assess the cytotoxicity of lipids 1-5 at various lipid:DNA charge ratios with COS-1 cells as described previously (Banerjee, R. et al. 1999). Except lipid 1, all the other lipids (2-5) showed least cytotoxicity even at a 9:1 lipid:DNA charge ratio (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). For lipids 1, 4 and 5 at a 3:1 charge ratio the toxicity varied from 15-25% of the treated cells. The toxicity of lipid 2 (with shorter alkyl chains) may originate from its probable detergent-like cell-lysing activity. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the cellular toxicity profiles of lipids 2-5 of the present invention are better than those of several commercially available cationic transfection lipids including lipofectin, lipofectAmine and DMRIE.</p>
