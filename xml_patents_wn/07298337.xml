<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 to an application entitled “Antenna Device for a Mobile Phone” filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Dec. 17, 2004 and assigned Serial No. 2004-107872, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an antenna device with a sub-antenna device configured to be electrically connected to or separated from a sliding up-type mobile phone, sliding up or down along the mobile phone.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The term “portable communication device” typically refers to a device that allows a user to wirelessly communicate with an other party, while being convenient to carry. Portable communication devices include HHPs (Hand Held Phones), CT-2 (Cordless Telephones-2), cellular phones, digital phones, PCS (Personal Communications Service) phones, and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants). The devices are classified into a plurality of types according to their appearance. For example, mobile phones are classified into a bar type, a flip type, a folder type, a sliding type, and a sliding-up type. The mobile phones each are provided with an antenna device, a data input/output device, and a data transmitter and receiver. An LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is usually adopted as a visual data output device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A keypad is typically provided for data input, basically as an array of keys. These keys include a Send (SND) key, a Cancel key, a Clear (CLR) key, an End key, a Power (PWR) key, alphanumerical keys, and other function keys.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A recent soaring increase in the number of mobile users indicates that mobile phones are becoming a necessity. Beyond the original function of making phone calls, the mobile phones can now be additionally used to listen to the radio, listen to MP3 music, and view moving pictures, and used as a remote control device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also, mobile phones have been developed to have a camera and support high-speed data communication. This implies that many devices are mounted into the mobile phone to satisfy various user demands. As these devices are used, they occupy various areas within the phone, and the area for installing a built-in antenna is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To allow the mobile phone to perform the above-described voice and other wireless functions, an antenna device is located at a proper position of a mobile phone to transmit and receive signals. The antenna device typically takes the form of a whip antenna or a helical antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The helical antenna is more common in that it boasts of a decreased antenna height in an installed state. Unlike an extendable rod antenna, the helical antenna is detachably fixed to an upper end of a main body, having a portion extended upward in the mobile phone. The protruded configuration of the helical antenna limits the design options of mobile phones that use a helical antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">To overcome the drawback of the helical antenna, a built-in antenna device has become widespread in mobile phones.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, a sliding up-type mobile phone <b>10</b> includes a body housing <b>20</b>, a sliding housing <b>30</b> disposed above the body housing <b>20</b>, for sliding up/down to recede from/approach the body housing <b>20</b>, and a sliding module <b>40</b> for connecting the sliding housing <b>30</b> to the body housing <b>20</b> in the manner that allows the sliding housing <b>30</b> to slide up/down. The body housing <b>20</b> has a display <b>21</b>, an array of keys <b>22</b>, and a microphone <b>23</b>. The sliding housing <b>30</b> is provided with a speaker <b>31</b> and a main antenna device <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The conventional antenna device in the sliding up-type mobile phone is built on an inner surface of the sliding housing, to slide lengthwise. This configuration changes the impedance of the antenna device as the sliding housing slides up or down. Because the radiation performance of the mobile phone depends on impedance matching, an inappropriately matched impedance results in insufficient antenna orientation and gain, and makes it difficult to achieve maximum radiation performance.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An object of the present invention is to substantially solve at least the above problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages below. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an antenna device with a sub-antenna device configured to be electrically connected to or separated from a sliding up-type mobile phone, sliding up or down along the mobile phone, in order to improve the antenna performance of the mobile phone.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another object of the present invention is to provide an antenna device with a sub-antenna device configured to be electrically connected to or separated from a sliding up-type mobile phone, sliding up or down along the mobile phone, in order to improve the antenna performance of the mobile phone by minimizing the variation of antenna impedance through interaction between the sub-antenna device and an existing main antenna device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The above objects are achieved through the provision of an antenna device for a mobile phone having a body housing, a sliding housing for sliding up or down lengthwise along the body housing, a sliding module for connecting the sliding housing to the body housing in the manner that allows the sliding housing to slide up or down lengthwise, and a main antenna device in the sliding housing. At least one sub-antenna device is installed lengthwise facing the sliding module and is electrically connected to or separated from the body housing, slidingly approaching or receding from the body housing along with the sliding module, and at least one connection unit electrically connects the sub-antenna device to the body housing for signal transmission between the sub-antenna device and the body housing.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> show the sliding module <b>40</b> having been slid up with the sliding housing <b>30</b> to recede from the body housing <b>20</b> in the lengthwise direction. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the sub-antenna devices <b>200</b> slide up along with the sliding module <b>40</b> and are electrically connected to the connectors <b>302</b> in the body housing <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Specifically, the connectors <b>301</b> of the sub-antenna devices <b>200</b> are brought into contact with the connection portions <b>302</b><i>b </i>of the connectors <b>302</b>. The connection portions <b>302</b><i>b </i>are extended and exposed through the connector holes <b>24</b><i>d </i>in the body housing <b>20</b>. In this state, the connection portions <b>302</b><i>b </i>are connected to the connectors <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Thus, the sub-antenna devices <b>200</b> and the main antenna device <b>32</b> are used as an antenna, increasing the reception sensitivity of the antenna and improving impedance matching.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, since one or more antenna engagement portions <b>24</b><i>a </i>are provided on the PCB <b>24</b> within the body housing <b>20</b> to be electrically engaged with the screw engagement portions <b>302</b><i>a</i>, the connectors <b>302</b> are electrically connected to the PCB <b>24</b> by means of the antenna engagement portions <b>24</b><i>a</i>. The connection line <b>24</b><i>b </i>runs between and electrically connects the antenna engagement portions <b>24</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, as the sliding module <b>40</b> slides down with the sliding housing <b>30</b> to approach the body housing <b>20</b> in the lengthwise direction, the connection terminals <b>301</b> of the sub-antenna devices <b>200</b> are separated from the connection portions <b>302</b><i>b </i>of the connectors <b>302</b>, sliding down along with the sliding module <b>40</b>. In this state, only the main antenna device <b>32</b> within the sliding housing <b>30</b> acts as the antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In accordance with the present invention as described above, a sub-antenna device is configured to electrically connect to or separate from a sliding up-type mobile phone, sliding up or down along the mobile phone. Therefore, antenna radiation performance can be improved by minimizing the variation of antenna impedance through interaction between the sub-antenna device and an existing main antenna device.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a certain preferred embodiment thereof, it is a mere exemplary application. For example, the present invention is applicable to any portable terminal. Thus, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
