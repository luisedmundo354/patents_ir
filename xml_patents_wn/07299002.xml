<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A fixer (heater) includes a heat roller and a pressure roller pressing each other. The fixer heats a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where the heat roller and the pressure roller meet. The fixer further includes an external heat roller heating the pressure roller from outside the pressure roller. A transit time taken for any given point on the heated material to pass through the press region is less than or equal to 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec. The surface temperature, T<b>1</b> (° C.), of the heat roller and the surface temperature, T<b>2</b> (° C.), of the pressure roller satisfy T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦100 (° C.), and preferably satisfy T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.). The load on the heat roller is reduced, and so is the power consumption.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to heaters heating a medium under heat and pressure, as well as image forming apparatuses and heating methods incorporating such a heater.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When used as a fixer fixing an developing agent on a recording medium in copying machines, printers, and other electrophotographic image forming apparatuses, heaters heating a medium (heated material) under heat and pressure are typically arranged to operate according to heat roller fixing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A fixer arranged to operate according to heat roller fixing has a pair of rollers (heat and pressure rollers) disposed to press each other. Inside the roller (heat roller) in contact with the toner image side of a recording medium (recording paper) is provided heating means, such as a halogen heater.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The heat roller is heated to a predetermined temperature (fixing temperature) by the heating means. Then, a recording medium carrying an unfixed toner image is passed through a pressure application section (fix nip section) of the heat and pressure rollers where the toner image is fixed under heat and pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A disadvantage of heat roller fixing is that it takes a long time (warm-up time) for the heat roller to reach the fixing temperature after the onset of its heating. For convenience, the heat roller needs to be pre-heated when in standby. Power consumption in warm-up and standby is considerable.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To address the problems, fixers have been proposed recently which implement thin heat roller fixing. Japanese unexamined patent application 9-244448 (Tokukaihei 9-244448/1997; published on Sep. 19, 1997), for example, discloses such a fixer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The thin-heat-roller-fixing fixer includes a heat roller with core metal having a reduced thickness for a reduced thermal capacity. The warm-up time is thus reduced, which reduces the warm-up and standby power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, in thin heat roller fixing, the heat roller can be reduced in thickness relatively easily in low-to-medium speed apparatuses (e.g., capable of making less than 50 A4 copies per minute when the recording paper is fed in landscape orientation), but only with difficulty in high speed apparatuses (e.g., capable of making 50 or more A4 copies per minute when the recording paper is fed in landscape orientation).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These are reasons why high speed apparatuses have longer warm-up time (typically 3 minutes or longer) and greater power consumption. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the following will describe difficulties in incorporating a thin heat roller in high speed apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a graph showing relationships between a nip transit time, a heat roller temperature (roller temperatures), and a pressure applied to recording paper in the fix nip section (surface pressures) in conventional low-to-medium and high speed apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The nip transit time is also called the duel time. It is the width of the fix nip section divided by the fixing rate (transport speed of recording paper) and represents the time taken for any given point on recording paper to pass through the fix nip section. A greater copy rate normally means a shorter nip transit time.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It would be understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> that the low-to-medium speed apparatus uses higher fix roller temperatures to achieve a greater copy rate, i.e., to compensate for a shorter nip transit time and by doing so, applies an adequate quantity of heat to the recording paper to ensure sufficient fixing performance. The surface pressure is therefore substantially constant regardless of nip transit time.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The high speed apparatus must work at a greater fixing rate than the low-to-medium speed apparatus, resulting in a nip transit time of 23 ms (2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec.) or less. Meanwhile, the always-on temperature for the heat roller is limited (for example, to 200° C.) in an ordinary situation. In view of heat resistance issues of the heat roller, the heat roller temperature cannot be raised exceeding the limit temperature. The high speed apparatus therefore ensures sufficient fixing performance by means of a high surface pressure while maintaining a constant heat roller temperature (at the limit temperature).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">This places a heavy load on the heat roller, which unlike in the low-to-medium speed apparatus inhibits the provision of a thin heat roller in the high speed apparatus. Thus, the warm-up time is difficult to reduce. A result is great power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, the heavy load on the heat roller causes the heat roller to creep and suffers from a shortened lifetime, as well as causes the recording paper to crease and curl up.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, the difficulties in reducing the heat roller thickness invite increases in size of the apparatus. In addition, the heat roller will have an increased drive torque which in turn entails increased power consumption and shortened driver components lifetime.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">To address the aforementioned large warm-up and standby power consumption problems, fixers implementing external roller heating (hereinafter, “external roller heating fixers”) have also been proposed recently. Japanese unexamined patent application 2000-338818 (Tokukai 2000-338818; published on Dec. 8, 2000), for example, discloses such a fixer.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An external roller heating fixer incorporates an external heat roller into the fixer implementing heat roller fixing. The external heat roller is an auxiliary heating means for the pressure roller. It contacts the pressure roller to externally heat the surface of the pressure roller.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">This raises the surface temperature of the pressure roller and unlike in the fixer for heat roller fixing, enables the pressure roller to actively supply thermal energy to the recording paper. The warm-up time is thus reduce, and so is the pre-heating of the heat roller in standby, enabling reductions in power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, the pressure roller actively supplying additional thermal energy to the recording paper allows reductions in the fixing load to the recording paper. This prevents the recording paper passing through the fix nip section from curling up.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, the reduced fixing load opens up possibilities that the fixer may be used in high speed apparatus generally regarded as requiring a heavy fixing load (e.g., 55 or more A4 copies [sheets] per minute when the recording paper is fed in landscape orientation, or a 23 millisecond or less transit time taken for any given point on recording paper to pass through the fix nip section). Thanks to the reduced fixing load, the external roller heating fixer allows the use of a heat roller which is reduced in thickness and/or diameter, hence in thermal capacity. The fixer thereby shortens the warm-up time and accordingly reduces power consumption. For these reasons, the fixer is suitably applied in the high speed apparatus field.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The pressure roller in the external roller heating fixer has however a higher surface temperature and thus dissipates more heat from the surface than the counterpart in the fixer for heat roller fixing. The external heat roller also dissipates heat from the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Therefore, under some structural and physical conditions of the external heat roller, such as its diameter, thickness, the load it exerts to the pressure roller, and its surface temperature, the fixer dissipates too much heat, which possibly causes poor heat efficiency, higher internal temperature, and like problems. An outcome may be the opposite of what is intended in the first place: greater power consumption than the fixer for heat roller fixing.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention has a first objective to provide a power saving heater with a heat roller receiving less load, and an image forming apparatus and heating method incorporating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">To achieve the first objective, a heater in accordance with the present invention includes a first heating member and a second heating member pressing each other, heats a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where the first heating member and the second heating member meet, and is characterized in that the heater includes an external heating member heating the second heating member from outside the second heating member, wherein: a transit time taken for any given point on the heated material to pass through the press region is less than or equal to 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec.; and a surface temperature, T<b>1</b> (° C.), of the first heating member and a surface temperature, T<b>2</b> (° C.), of the second heating member satisfy T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦100 (° C.) and preferably satisfy T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the arrangement, the surface temperature, T<b>1</b> (° C.), of the first heating member and the surface temperature, T<b>2</b> (° C.), of the second heating member satisfy either T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦100 (° C.) or T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.). This eliminates the need for an increase in surface pressure in the press region even in a high speed apparatus for which the transit time taken for any given point on the heated material to pass through the press region is less than or equal to 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec. In other words, the arrangement allows for a smaller load being applied to the heating members.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">This allows for construction of thinner and smaller thermal capacity heating members, and hence reduces the warm-up time of the heater. Therefore, pre-heating of the heating members becomes unnecessary. Power consumption in warm-up and standby is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The less load on the heating- members, for example, prevents the heating members from creeping and extends the heating members' lifetime.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Further, the reduced thickness of the heating members allows for construction of a more compact heater. The reduced drive torque of the heating members allows for lower power consumption and extends lifetime of driver components.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">To achieve the first objective, a heater in accordance with the present invention includes a first heating member and a second heating member pressing each other, heats a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where the first heating member and the second heating member meet, and is characterized in that: a transit time taken for any given point on the heated material to pass through the press region is less than or equal to 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec.; and a quantity, Q<b>1</b>, of heat transferred from the first heating member to the heated material while the heated material is passing through the press region and a quantity, Q<b>2</b>, of heat transferred from the second heating member to the heated material while the heated material is passing through the press region satisfy Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>)≧0.25, and preferably satisfy Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>)≧0.3.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, when the material composing the second heating member has extremely poor heat conductivity, the second heating member in some cases transfers only an insufficient quantity of heat to the heated material, failing to provide sufficient heating, even if the surface of the second heating member is maintained at a high temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">However, the arrangement specifies the quantity of heat transferred to the heated material, not the temperature of the heating members. Regardless of from what material the heating members are made, similar effects are achieved to a case where the aforementioned surface temperature, T<b>1</b>, of the first heating member and surface temperature, T<b>2</b>, of the second heating member are determined to satisfy T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In other words, the arrangement allows the load on the heating members to be reduced and enables lower power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To achieve the first objective, an image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention is characterized in that it includes: an image transfer device forming an image of an unfixed toner on the heated material; and the heater described above fixing the unfixed toner on the heated material.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The arrangement provides a low power consumption image forming apparatus. In addition, for example, the heater can be used as a fixer. This enables reductions in power consumption through the smaller load, while securing toner's fixing performance, and prevents recording paper which is a heated material from creasing and curling up.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The arrangement also provides image forming apparatus containing a heater made up of long-life heating members and driver components.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">To achieve the first objective, a heating method in accordance with the present invention is a method of heating a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where a first heating member and a second heating member meet so that any given point on the heated material passes through the press region in 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec., and is characterized in that the method involves the step of heating the second heating member by an external heating member from outside the second heating member so that a surface temperature, T<b>1</b> (° C.), of the first heating member and a surface temperature, T<b>2</b> (° C.), of the second heating member satisfy T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦100 (° C.), and preferably satisfy T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to the method, the surface temperature, T<b>1</b> (° C.), of the first heating member and the surface temperature, T<b>2</b> (° C.), of the second heating member satisfy either T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦100 (° C.) or T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.). This eliminates the need for an increase in surface pressure in the press region even in a high speed apparatus for which the transit time taken for any given point on the heated material to pass through the press region is less than or equal to 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec. In other words, the method allows for a smaller load being applied to the heating members.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This allows for construction of thinner and smaller thermal capacity heating members, and hence reduces the warm-up time of the heater implementing the heating method. Therefore, pre-heating of the heating members becomes unnecessary. Power consumption in warm-up and standby is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To achieve the first objective, a heating method in accordance with the present invention is a method of heating a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where a first heating member and a second heating member meet so that any given point on the heated material passes through the press region in 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec., and is characterized in that the method involves the step of controlling so that a quantity, Q<b>1</b>, of heat transferred from the first heating member to the heated material while the heated material is passing through the press region and a quantity, Q<b>2</b>, of heat transferred from the second heating member to the heated material while the heated material is passing through the press region satisfy Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>)≧0.25, and preferably satisfy Q<b>2</b>(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>)≧0.3.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The method specifies the quantity of heat transferred to the heated material, not the temperature of the heating members. Regardless of from what material the heating members are made, similar effects are achieved to a case where the aforementioned surface temperature, T<b>1</b>, of the first heating member and surface temperature, T<b>2</b>, of the second heating member are determined to satisfy T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.). In other words, the method allows the load on the heating members to be reduced and enables lower power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The present invention has a second objective to provide a power saving and/or heat efficiency improving heater, an image forming apparatus incorporating the heater, and a heating method, even if there is provided an external heating member heating the heating members so that the heating members heating heated material have predetermined temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">To achieve the second objective, a heater in accordance with the present invention includes a first heating member and a second heating member pressing each other, heats a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where the first heating member and the second heating member meet, and is characterized in that the heater includes an external heating member rotating with the second heating member in contact with the second heating member and heating the second heating member so that the second heating member has a predetermined surface temperature, wherein a heating nip transit time taken for any given point on the second heating member in rotation to pass through a heating nip region where the second heating member contacts the external heating member is determined based on a material and thermal capacity of the external heating member, a power consumption in the heater while the heated material is passing through the press region, and a surface temperature of the external heating member while the heated material is passing through the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to the arrangement, the heating nip transit time can be determined in accordance with the material and thermal capacity of the external heating member so that, for example, the power consumption in the heater (first, second, and external heating members) while the heated material is passing through the press region is smaller than that in a heater without an external heating member and the surface temperature of the external heating member while the heated material is passing through the press region does not exceed a predetermined temperature (for example, heat resistance temperature).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Therefore, power consumption can be lowered by arranging the heater so as to achieve the determined heating nip transit time in this manner, although the external heating member is included.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">To achieve the second objective, a heater in accordance with the present invention includes a first heating member and a second heating member pressing each other, heats a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where the first heating member and the second heating member meet, and is characterized in that the heater includes an external heating member heating the second heating member so that the second heating member has a predetermined surface temperature, wherein the heated material passes through the press region between the first heating member and the second heating member either upward or downward.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to the arrangement, the direction in which the heated material passes through the press region (transport direction for the heated material) is substantially vertical. A region is therefore downward with respect to the first and second heating members. This lowers heat dissipation by convection from the first and second heating members.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The air heated in the heater remain in the lower space than the first and second heating members, heating the second heating member. The heat efficiency of the heater is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">To achieve the second objective, an image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention is characterized in that it includes: an image transfer device forming an image of an unfixed toner on the heated material; and the heater described above fixing the unfixed toner on the heated material.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to the arrangement, the heater can be used as a fixer. The arrangement provides a low power consumption image forming apparatus. In addition, for example, when the heater is applied to a high speed image forming apparatus, the heater enables reductions in power consumption through the smaller load even in a high speed apparatus, while securing toner's fixing performance, and prevents recording paper (recording medium) which is a heated material from creasing and curling up.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition, the arrangement provides a heat efficient image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">To achieve the second objective, a heating method in accordance with the present invention is a method of heating a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where a first heating member and a second heating member meet, and is characterized in that the method involves the step of determining a heating nip transit time for any given point on the second heating member in rotation to pass through a heating nip region where the second heating member and the external heating member contact each other, based on a material and thermal capacity of an external heating member rotating with the second heating member in contact with the second heating member and heating the second heating member so that the second heating member has a predetermined surface temperature, power consumptions by the first heating member, the second heating member, and the external heating member, and a surface temperature of the external heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the method, the heating nip transit time can be determined in accordance with the material and thermal capacity of the external heating member so that, for example, the power consumption in the heater (first, second, and external heating members) while the heated material is passing through the press region is smaller than that in a heater without an external heating member and the surface temperature of the external heating member while the heated material is passing through the press region does not exceed a predetermined temperature (for example, heat resistance temperature).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The method therefore heats the heated material on low power consumption by arranging the heater so as to achieve the determined heating nip transit time in this manner, although the external heating member is included.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Additional objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> and <b>8</b> to <b>15</b>, the following will describe an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the structure of a major part of a fixer (heater) <b>23</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to the figure, the fixer <b>23</b> includes a heat roller (first heating member) <b>231</b>, a pressure roller (second heating member) <b>232</b>, an external heat roller (external heating member) <b>233</b>, and a cleaning roller <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The structure described here is an example based an assumption that the fixer <b>23</b> is mounted to an electrophotographic copying machine. The fixer <b>23</b> applies heat and pressure to recording paper P carrying on it an image made of unfixed toner T in order to fix the toner T onto the recording paper P.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the heat roller <b>231</b> is rotatable in the direction indicated by arrow A. The roller <b>231</b> is provided to heat the recording paper P while transiting a fix nip section Y where the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b> (detailed later) touch the recording paper P to fix the toner T onto the recording paper P. See a later description for details about the section. The heat roller <b>231</b> is made up of a cylindrical core metal <b>231</b><i>a </i>and a releasing layer <b>231</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The core metal <b>231</b><i>a </i>forms the main body of the heat roller <b>231</b> and has a hollow cylindrical structure. The core metal <b>231</b><i>a </i>is preferably iron, aluminum, copper, or an alloy of these metals. Specifically, the metal <b>231</b><i>a </i>is, for example, stainless steel or carbon steel. Here, the core metal <b>231</b><i>a </i>is iron (STKM (carbon steel)) and has a diameter of 40 mm and a thickness of 0.4 mm to give it low thermal capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The releasing layer <b>231</b><i>b </i>is provided on the outer surface of the core metal <b>231</b><i>a </i>to prevent the toner T on the recording paper P from offsetting. The releasing layer <b>231</b><i>b </i>is suitably made of a fluororesin, such as PFA (perfluoroalcoxyalkane; a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoroalkylvinylether) or PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene); a silicone rubber; a fluororubber; or a similar material. Here, the releasing layer <b>231</b><i>b </i>is made by applying and baking a mixture of PFA and PTFE to a thickness of 25 μm on the core metal <b>231</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Inside the core metal <b>231</b><i>a </i>of the heat roller <b>231</b> are there provided heater lamps <b>234</b>, <b>235</b> (heat sources) made from halogen heaters. When fed with electric current by a control circuit (not shown), the heater lamps <b>234</b>, <b>235</b> emit light at the infrared wavelengths with a predetermined heat distribution. The inner surface of the heat roller <b>231</b> is thus heated.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The heater lamps <b>234</b>, <b>235</b> up to a predetermined temperature (here, 200° C.) heat the heat roller <b>231</b> which in turn heats the recording paper P with an unfixed toner image passing through the fix nip section (press region) Y. The heat melts and fixes the toner T on the recording paper P. Here, the heater lamps <b>234</b>, <b>235</b> have a combined power rating of 700 W.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Slightly above the outer surface of the heat roller <b>231</b> in the downstream vicinity of the fix nip section Y is there provided a guide section <b>238</b> guiding the recording paper P with the fixed toner T off the heat roller <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The pressure roller <b>232</b> is rotatable in the direction indicated by arrow B in the figure. The roller <b>232</b> is pressed to the heat roller <b>231</b> by a spring or other pressure member (not shown) with a force of, for example, 274 N. Thus, the fix nip section Y, about 7 mm wide, is formed between the pressure roller <b>232</b> and the heat roller <b>231</b>. The pressure roller <b>232</b> is made up of a core metal <b>232</b><i>a</i>, a heat resistant elastic layer <b>232</b><i>b</i>, and a releasing layer <b>232</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The core metal <b>232</b><i>a </i>is the main body of the pressure roller <b>232</b> and has a hollow cylindrical structure. The core metal <b>232</b><i>a </i>is preferably iron, aluminum, or an alloy of these metals. Specifically, the metal <b>232</b><i>a </i>is, for example, stainless steel or carbon steel. Here, the core metal <b>232</b><i>a </i>is stainless (stainless steel (SUS)) and has a diameter of 28 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The heat resistant elastic layer <b>232</b><i>b </i>is formed of 6 mm thick silicone rubber foam (rubber hardness: JIS-A at 50° C.) on the outer surface of the core metal <b>232</b><i>a </i>. The heat resistant elastic layer <b>232</b><i>b </i>is given such elasticity as to deform itself under pressure from the pressure member and resistance to heat from the external heat roller <b>233</b> (detailed later).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The releasing layer <b>232</b><i>c </i>is formed of, for example, a 50 μm thick PFA (fluororesin) tube on the surface of the heat resistant elastic layer <b>232</b><i>b </i>. The releasing layer <b>232</b><i>c </i>has a releasing property.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The external heat roller <b>233</b> has in it a heater lamp (heat source body) <b>239</b> to heat the pressure roller <b>232</b>. The heater lamp <b>239</b> is structured similarly to the heater lamps <b>234</b>, <b>235</b>, and here has a power rating of 300 W. The external heat roller <b>233</b> is disposed upstream to the fix nip section Y and presses the pressure roller <b>232</b> with a predetermined push force.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The external heat roller <b>233</b> pressing the pressure roller <b>232</b> with a predetermined push force forms a heating nip section (heating nip region) Z between the external heat roller <b>233</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b>. Here, the heating nip section Z is 3 mm wide (as measured in the direction indicated by arrow B in the figure).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The external heat roller <b>233</b> is made up of a core metal (external heating member) <b>233</b><i>a </i>and a heat resistant releasing layer (heat resistant resin) <b>233</b><i>b </i>. The core metal <b>233</b><i>a </i>is the main body of the external heat roller <b>233</b>, and preferably iron, aluminum, copper, or an alloy of these metals. Specifically, the metal <b>233</b><i>a </i>is, for example, stainless steel or carbon steel. The core metal <b>233</b><i>a </i>is an aluminum cylinder shaft measuring 15 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The heat resistant releasing layer <b>233</b><i>b </i>is made of a synthetic resin material with excellent heat resistance and releasing properties. Examples of such materials include elastomers, such as silicone rubber or fluororubber, or fluororesins, such as PFA or PEFE. Here, the heat resistant releasing layer <b>233</b><i>b </i>is made by applying and baking a mixture of PFA and PEFE to a thickness of 25 μm on the core metal <b>233</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Slightly above the outer surface of the heat roller <b>231</b> is there provided a temperature sensor (temperature sensing means or temperature sensing section) <b>237</b> sensing the surface temperature of the heat roller <b>231</b>. Based on the result of the sensing by the temperature sensor <b>237</b>, a control circuit (control means or control section; not shown in the figure) controls electric current feed to the heater lamps <b>234</b>, <b>235</b> so that the heat roller <b>231</b> has a predetermined surface temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Slightly above the outer surface of the pressure roller <b>232</b> is there provided a temperature sensor (temperature sensing means) <b>242</b> sensing the surface temperature of the pressure roller <b>232</b>. Slightly above the outer surface of the external heat roller <b>233</b> is there provided a temperature sensor (temperature sensing means) <b>236</b> sensing the surface temperature of the external heat roller <b>233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Based on the surface temperature of the pressure roller <b>232</b> as sensed by the temperature sensor <b>242</b> and the surface temperature of the external heat roller <b>233</b> as sensed by the temperature sensor <b>236</b>, the control circuit (control means; not shown in the figure) controls current feed to the heater lamp <b>239</b> so that the external heat roller <b>233</b> has a predetermined surface temperature. The control of the electric current feed to the heater lamp <b>239</b> controls the surface temperature of the pressure roller <b>232</b> and the surface temperature of the external heat roller <b>233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The temperature sensor <b>242</b> may be omitted if, for example, the temperature of the external heat roller <b>233</b> is controlled based on such predetermined conditions as to the temperature of the external heat roller <b>233</b> that the surface temperature of the heat roller <b>231</b> differs from the surface temperature of the pressure roller <b>232</b> by a desired value.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">A cleaning roller <b>240</b> is provided upstream to the external heat roller <b>233</b> near the outer surface of the pressure roller <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The heat roller -<b>231</b>, the pressure roller <b>232</b>, and the external heat roller <b>233</b> are not limited in any special manner to the aforementioned structural and physical features (e.g., composition, dimensions, and shape).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The cleaning roller <b>240</b> is provided to remove toner, paper particles, etc. from the pressure roller <b>232</b>, preventing smearing of the external heat roller <b>233</b>. The cleaning roller <b>240</b> is disposed upstream to the heating nip section Z and presses the pressure roller <b>232</b> with a predetermined push force.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Supported at the axis, the cleaning roller <b>240</b> is rotated by the rotation of the pressure roller <b>232</b>. The cleaning roller <b>240</b> is a cylindrical core material made of aluminum, stainless steel, or a like metal. Here, the cleaning roller <b>240</b> is made of stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The heat roller <b>231</b>, the pressure roller <b>232</b>, the external heat roller <b>233</b>, and the cleaning roller <b>240</b> are not limited in any special manner to the aforementioned structural and physical features (e.g., composition, dimensions, and shape).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Now, the fixer <b>23</b> will be further described in terms of its operation. Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the recording paper P carrying an image formed by unfixed toner T is transported in the direction indicated by arrow C in the figure. The recording paper P is heated to a predetermined temperature by the external heat roller <b>233</b> and the heat roller <b>231</b> heated to 200° C. by the heater lamps <b>234</b>, <b>235</b>. The paper P is then passed between the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b> which is being pressed by the roller <b>231</b>, that is, through the fix nip section Y.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">While passing through the section Y, the unfixed toner T melts and firmly adheres onto the recording paper P under heat and pressure from the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>. Hence, the fixer <b>23</b> arranged as above is capable of fixing the toner T onto the recording paper P passing between the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The nip transit time in the present embodiment is preferably 23 milliseconds or less. The nip transit time is defined as a time taken for any given point on the recording paper P to pass through the fix nip section Y, that is, the width (mm) of the fix nip section Y divided by the transport speed (fixing rate) (mm/sec.) of the recording paper P. In other words, the fixer <b>23</b> is applicable to high speed apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">A typical copying machine operates in copy mode, warm-up mode, standby mode, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Warm-up mode is the mode in which the copying machine operates immediately after its power supply is turned on. In that mode, the copying machine first feeds current to the heater lamps <b>234</b>, <b>235</b> to heat up the heat roller <b>231</b> to a predetermined temperature (here, 200° C.). As the heat roller <b>231</b> reaches the predetermined temperature, the machine turns on the drive motor, driving the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b> to rotate at a peripheral speed (fixing rate) of 36.5 mm/sec. and simultaneously with the driving, feeds electric current to the heater lamp <b>239</b>. The external heat roller <b>233</b> is continuously heated until it reaches a predetermined temperature (here, 170° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In copy mode, the copying machine forms an image on the recording paper P moving at a predetermined speed. It is in this mode that the fixer <b>23</b> fixes toner onto the recording paper P. In copy mode, the electric current feeds to the heater lamps <b>234</b>, <b>235</b>, <b>239</b> are controlled so as to maintain the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b> at predetermined temperatures (here, 200° C. and 135° C. respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Specifically, the heater lamp <b>239</b> in the external heat roller <b>233</b> is so controlled as to maintain the external heat roller <b>233</b> at a temperature (here, 170° C.) required to maintain the surface of the pressure roller <b>232</b> at a predetermined temperature (here, 135° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In standby mode, electric consumption is maintained at such a level that the copying machine can enter copy mode immediately in response to a print request. After copying is finished, the copying machines is in standby mode for some time before entering low power mode.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Fixing toner T onto the recording paper P requires some amount of surface pressure between the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b> in the fix nip section Y. In other words, some load needs to be applied to the recording paper P while transiting the fix nip section Y, to fix toner T.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Next, referring to Table 1, relationship will be described between the load necessary to fix toner T (hereinafter, “required fixing load”), the surface temperature, T<b>1</b>, of the heat roller <b>231</b>, and the surface temperature, T<b>2</b>, of the pressure roller <b>232</b>. The surface temperature, T<b>1</b>, of the heat roller <b>231</b> was 200° C. Required surface pressure (kPa) is defined as the required fixing load (N) divided by the area of the fix nip section Y where toner T is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In arrangements (I), (II), and (III) of the fixer <b>23</b>, the surface temperature, T<b>2</b>, of the pressure roller <b>232</b> was respectively set to 105° C., 130° C., and 135° C.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In comparative examples (I), (II), there was provided no external heat roller <b>233</b> heating the pressure roller <b>232</b>. In comparative example (III), a heater lamp heating the heat roller <b>231</b> was provided inside the pressure roller <b>232</b>, replacing the external heat roller <b>233</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In comparative examples (II), (III), and arrangement (I) to (III), the nip transit time was 19.2 milliseconds (ms) (the copy rate was 65 copies per minute if A4 recording paper. P was fed in landscape orientation), and the fix nip section Y was 7 mm wide (“fix nip width” as measured in the direction indicated by arrow A in the figure). In comparative example (I), the nip transit time was 17.8 milliseconds, and the fix nip width was 6.5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Table 1 shows that a very high surface pressure (360 kPa or greater) is necessary in comparative examples (I), (II) where the pressure roller <b>232</b> is not heated.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">This is because the nip transit time is too short to transfer sufficient thermal energy from the heat roller <b>231</b> to the recording paper P for the toner to melt, despite the fact that the surface temperature, T<b>1</b>, of the heat roller <b>231</b> is controlled at the limit temperature, 200° C. Another reason is the missing heat source (for example, the external heat roller <b>233</b>, the heater lamp, or similar heating means) in the pressure roller <b>232</b>: without the heat source, the surface temperature, T<b>2</b>, of the pressure roller <b>232</b> falls to or below 100° C. (hence, T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≧100° C. (deg.)), where sufficient thermal energy is not transferred from the pressure roller <b>232</b> to the recording paper P; very high fixing load becomes necessary to compensate for the insufficient thermal energy transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">On the other hand, by maintaining the surface temperature, T<b>2</b>, of the pressure roller <b>232</b> at a high value (hence, T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦100° C. (deg.)) by means of the provision of the heating means (the external heat roller <b>233</b> or the heater lamp) heating the pressure roller <b>233</b> as in comparative example (III) and arrangements (I) to (III), an increased amount of thermal energy is transferred from the pressure roller <b>232</b> to the recording paper P. The required fixing load is therefore reduced-to or below 300 kPa.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Now see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for a graphical representation of the relationship between the required surface pressure (kPa) and the difference, T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b> (° C.), between the surface temperature, T<b>1</b>, of the heat roller <b>231</b> and the surface temperature, T<b>2</b>, of the pressure roller <b>232</b>, all data taken from Table 1.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As shown in the figure, approximating, by the least squares method, the relationship between the required surface pressure P (kPa) and the difference, T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b> (° C.), in temperature between the heat roller <b>231</b> and pressure roller <b>232</b> based on comparative examples (I) to (III) and arrangements (I) to (III), we obtain T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>=30×ln(P)−72.5.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As mentioned earlier, a smaller difference, T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b> (° C.), in temperature between the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b> allows more thermal energy transfer from the pressure roller <b>232</b> to the recording paper P, and hence a less required fixing load. Taking these facts into account, it is preferred if the relationship between the required surface pressure P (kPa) and the difference, T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b> (° C.), in temperature between the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b> is given by equation (1):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>T</i>1<i>−T</i>2≦30<i>×ln</i>(<i>P</i>)−72.5   (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The above description demonstrates that sufficient fixing performance is secured by heating the pressure roller <b>232</b> at a constant temperature using the external heat roller <b>233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As in the foregoing, the fixer <b>23</b> includes the mutually pressing heat roller <b>231</b> and pressure roller <b>232</b>. The recording paper P is heated while transiting the fix nip section Y (press region) where the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b> meet. The toner T on the recording paper P is thereby fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The external heat roller <b>233</b> heats up the pressure roller <b>232</b> from the outside. The transit time in which any given point on the recording paper P can pass through the fix nip section Y is 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec. So, the fixer <b>23</b> is applicable to high speed apparatuses. Here, “T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦100 (° C.)” holds where T<b>1</b> is the surface temperature of the heat roller <b>231</b> in degrees Celsius, and T<b>2</b> is the surface temperature of the pressure roller <b>232</b> in degrees Celsius. It is preferable if T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.) holds.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Employing one of the above arrangements, the surface pressure in the fix nip section Y does not need to be increased in high speed apparatuses. The load applied to the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Therefore, rollers, especially, the heat roller <b>231</b> can be reduced in thickness, hence in thermal capacity, which in turn reduces the warm-up time of the fixer <b>23</b>. As a result, pre-heating of the fixer <b>23</b> becomes unnecessary. Power consumption in warm-up and standby is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Further, the reduced load on the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b> prevents the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b> from creeping and extends the rollers' lifetime.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The reduced thicknesses of the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b> allow for a more compact fixer <b>23</b>. The reduced drive torques of the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b> allow for lower power consumption and extends lifetime of driver components.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The difference between the surface temperature of the heat roller <b>231</b> and the surface temperature of the pressure roller <b>232</b> is controlled by the external heat roller <b>233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Specifically, the fixer <b>23</b> includes the temperature sensor <b>236</b> sensing the surface temperature of the external heat roller <b>233</b> and the control means (not shown) controlling the surface temperature of the external heat roller <b>233</b> based on the result of the sensing.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Thus, the surface temperature of the heat roller <b>231</b> and the surface temperature of the pressure roller <b>232</b> are controllable using a simple arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">On the other hand, the surface temperature of the heat roller <b>231</b> is controlled at a substantially constant value.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Thus, the difference between the surface temperature of the heat roller <b>231</b> and the surface temperature of the pressure roller <b>232</b> is controllable by the external heat roller <b>233</b> through the control of only the surface temperature of the pressure roller <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">It is preferred if the fixer <b>23</b> satisfies the equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>T</i>1<i>−T</i>2≦30<i>×ln</i>(<i>P</i>)−72.5<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where P is a surface pressure (kPa) on the recording paper P in the fix nip section Y, T<b>1</b> is the surface temperature (° C.) of the heat roller <b>231</b>, and T<b>2</b> is the surface temperature (° C.) of the pressure roller <b>232</b>.
</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Thus, T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b> can be reduced, and an increased quantity of heat can be transferred to the recording paper P. Therefore, the load on the pressure roller <b>232</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Now, referring to Table 2, the warm-up time and energy consumption efficiency are compared among the aforementioned comparative example (III) and arrangements (I) to (III). In arrangements (I) to (III), the thickness of the core metal <b>231</b><i>a </i>of the heat roller <b>231</b> was determined for each required fixing load so that the heat roller <b>231</b> did not warp exceeding the allowable amount.</p>

<p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graphical representation of the relationship between the warm-up time, energy consumption efficiency, and difference, T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b> (° C.), in temperature between the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b>, all data taken from Table 2.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Table 2 shows that in comparative example (III) where the pressure roller <b>232</b> is heated by the heater lamp from the inside (which is not the case in arrangements (I) to (III)), the warm-up time is 424 seconds, much longer than in arrangements (I) to (III).</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">This is because it takes a very long time to heat the surface of the pressure roller <b>232</b> to a predetermined temperature (here, 130° C.) due to the large thermal capacity of the pressure roller <b>232</b> and the poor heat conductance of the heat resistant elastic layer <b>232</b><i>b </i>made of silicone rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">These results show that the pressure roller <b>232</b> is preferably heated externally using, for example, the external heat roller <b>233</b>, rather than internally using, for example, the heater lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Table 2 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> demonstrate also that although arrangements (I) to (III) all employ an external heating approach, they do differ in energy consumption efficiency (power consumption per hour (Wh/h)): arrangements (II), (III) in which the pressure roller <b>232</b> is heated so that T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.) lowers the energy consumption efficiency further than arrangement (I).</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">This is because when T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.), the warm-up time (time taken for the heat roller to reach a predetermined fixing temperature) can be reduced to 30 seconds or less, and therefore the OFF mode can be started in 15 minutes or less of the shift time (standby mode) to the low power mode. Here, the standby mode is supposed to last for 6 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Now, move on to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a graphical representation of the relationship between the warm-up time (sec.) and the thermal capacity per unit length (J/m·° C.) of the heat roller <b>231</b> in the axis direction for arrangements (I) to (III), all data taken from Table 2.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The figure shows that to make the warm-up time 30 seconds or less, the thermal capacity per unit length of the heat roller <b>231</b> in the axis direction should be 200 (J/m·° C.) or less.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Incidentally, as mentioned earlier, a sufficient quantity of heat may not be transferred in some cases from the pressure roller <b>232</b> to the recording paper P, causing defects in the fixing of toner T. This can happen when, for example, the pressure roller <b>232</b> is made of a material with extremely poor heat conductivity even if the surface temperature, T<b>2</b>, of the pressure roller <b>232</b> is maintained at a high temperature state (hence, T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦100 (° C.) or T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.)).</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Accordingly, the following will examine relationship between the thermal energy transferred from the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b> to the recording paper P and the required fixing load (N) (required surface pressure (kPa).).</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The thermal energy, Q<b>1</b>, transferred from the heat roller <b>231</b> to a sheet of recording paper P and the thermal energy, Q<b>2</b>, transferred from the pressure roller <b>232</b> to a sheet of recording paper P were calculated by two dimensional heat transmission simulation for comparative examples (I) to (III) and arrangements (I) to (III). Table 3 shows the thermal energies Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b>, ratio of the energies Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b>, required fixing load (N), required surface pressure (kPa), warm-up time, and energy consumption efficiency.</p>

<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Table 3 shows that in comparative examples (I), (II) from which the heating means was missing, the thermal energy, Q<b>2</b>, transferred from the pressure roller <b>232</b> to the recording paper P approximately accounted a mere 22% of the total heat quantity (total thermal energy), Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>, transferred to the recording paper P. These examples therefore require a very high fixing load (surface pressure of 350 kPa or greater).</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">On the other hand, comparative example (III) and arrangements (I) to (III) incorporate the heating means heating the pressure roller <b>232</b>; the thermal energy, Q<b>2</b>, transferred from the pressure roller <b>232</b> to the recording paper P accounts for 25% or more. The required surface pressure drops to or below 300 kPa, allowing for a reduced required fixing load.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graphical representation of the relationship between the required surface pressure P (kPa) and the ratio, Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>), of the heat quantity, Q<b>2</b>, transferred from the pressure roller <b>232</b> to the recording paper P to the total heat quantity Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>, all data taken from Table 3.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">As shown in the figure, approximating, by least squares method, the relationship between the required surface pressure P (kPa) and the ratio, Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>), of the heat quantity Q<b>2</b> to the total heat quantity Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b> based on comparative examples (I) to (III) and arrangements (I) to (III), we obtain Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>)=−0.078×ln(P)+0.7.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">As mentioned earlier, a larger Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>) results in a greater amount of thermal energy being transferred from the pressure roller <b>232</b> to the recording paper P, and allows for a reduced required fixing load. Taking these facts into account, it is preferred if the relationship between the required surface pressure P (kPa) and the ratio, Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>), of the heat quantity Q<b>2</b> to the total heat quantity Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b> is given by equation (2):

</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The above description demonstrates that the external heat roller <b>233</b> heating the pressure roller <b>232</b> at a constant temperature increases Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>), the ratio of the heat quantity Q<b>2</b> transferred from the pressure roller <b>232</b> to the recording paper P, and lowers the required fixing load. Therefore, power consumption can be lowered. Sufficient fixing performance is secured for the toner T on the recording paper P.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Next, in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, arrangements (I) to (III) listed in Table 3 are compared regarding the warm-up time and the energy consumption efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graphical representation of the relationship between the warm-up time, the energy consumption efficiency, and the ratio, Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>), of the heat quantity Q<b>2</b> to the total heat quantity Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>, all data taken from Table 3.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Table 3 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows that Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>)≧0.313 holds in arrangements (II), (III), which means that the energy consumption efficiency is much lower than in arrangement (I).</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">This is because when Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>)≧0.313 (0.3), the warm-up time can be reduced to 30 seconds or less, and therefore the OFF mode can be started in 15 minutes or less of the shift time (standby mode) to the low power mode. Here, the standby mode is supposed to last for 6 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">The rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b> are not limited in any special manner to the aforementioned shape or composition.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The foregoing description took the fixer (heater) <b>23</b> as an example of a device including the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>. The arrangement including the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b> is not limited to this example, but also preferably applicable to, for example, a dryer device in a wet electrophotographic image forming apparatus, a dryer device in an inkjet printer, and a rewriteable medium eraser device.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The following will describe an example in which the aforementioned fixer <b>23</b> is applied to a dry electrophotographic image forming apparatus in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 15</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0182" num="0181">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>, the image forming apparatus includes an original image capture device <b>11</b>, an image recording device <b>12</b>, a recording material feeder device <b>13</b>, a post-processing device <b>14</b>, and an external recording material -feeder device <b>15</b>. The fixer <b>23</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) is included in the image recording device <b>12</b> (detailed later).</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an image forming apparatus main body, such as a digital printer, is composed of the image recording device (image forming section) <b>12</b>, the recording material feeder device (recording material feeder section) <b>13</b>, and a transport section <b>17</b> transporting the recording material (recording paper P) from the recording material feeder device <b>13</b> via the image recording device <b>12</b> to a recording material eject section <b>16</b>. The main body, if further including the original image capture device (image capture device) <b>11</b>, forms a digital copying machine or facsimile machine.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The following will describe the operation of the image forming apparatus main body.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">First, the original image capture device <b>11</b> captures an image data of an original and supplies the image data to the image recording device <b>12</b> where the input image data is subjected to a suitable image process.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Meanwhile, the recording material feeder device <b>13</b> delivers print paper, OHP (Over Head Projector) sheets, or like recording material sheets, a sheet at a time, to the image recording device <b>12</b> via a first transport path in the transport section <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">The image recording device <b>12</b> prints or otherwise forms an image represented by the image data on the recording material. The recording material carrying a printed image is transported via a second transport path in the transport section <b>17</b> to the recording material eject section <b>16</b> where the material is ejected out of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the original image capture device <b>11</b> is provided with an original document tray <b>18</b> acting as an original document feeder section or original document receiving section.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">The original document tray <b>18</b> as an original document feeder section is capable of successively feeding multiple pages of an original document placed on it to the image capture section a page at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">On the other hand, the original document tray <b>18</b> as an original document receiving section is capable of receiving and holding in it the original pages successively ejected after an image capturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">For example, if printed recording material is ejected to the recording material eject section <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> when two or more sets of the original is to be printed after image capturing, recording material sheets on which the same page is printed are successively ejected or otherwise mixed; the user therefore must separate the recording material after printing.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">The post-processing device <b>14</b> is provided to the image forming apparatus main body to address the problem. The device <b>14</b>, for example, separates the recording material so that it is ejected to a set of eject trays, preventing multiple pages from being mixed up. The image forming apparatus main body is positioned at a predetermined distance from the post-processing device <b>14</b>. There is a space between the image forming apparatus main body and the post-processing device <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The image forming apparatus main body is connected to the post-processing device <b>14</b> through an external transport section <b>19</b>. The recording material carrying a printed image is transported from the transport section <b>17</b> via the external transport section <b>19</b> to the post-processing device <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">There is demand for a double-sided print function for savings in energy and cost related to print paper and other recording material. The function is realized by a double-sided printing transport section <b>21</b>. The section <b>21</b> turns over recording material carrying a printed image on one side and transports it again to the image recording device <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The recording material carrying a printed image on one side is transported again to the image recording device <b>12</b> not to the recording material eject section <b>16</b> or the post-processing device <b>14</b>, after turned over in the double-sided printing transport section <b>21</b>. The image recording device <b>12</b> then prints an image on the blank side, completing double-sided printing.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">When recording material of types or quantities exceeding the capacity of the recording material feeder device <b>13</b> is to be fed, the external recording material feeder device <b>15</b> as a peripheral providing an expanded function is connected to the image forming apparatus main body. Recording material of desired types and quantities can be fed as being put in the external recording material feeder device <b>15</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0234" num="0233">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>7</b>, the following will describe another embodiment of the present invention. Here, for convenience, members of the present embodiment that have the same function as members of embodiment 1, and that are mentioned in that embodiment are indicated by the same reference numerals and description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">The fixer in accordance with the present embodiment includes an induction heating coil (external heating member) <b>241</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as heating means in place of the external heat roller <b>233</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The induction heating coil <b>241</b> is connected a drive power supply (not shown). The cleaning roller is omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">A pressure roller <b>232</b> in accordance with the present embodiment constructed of four layers: a core metal <b>232</b><i>a</i>, a heat resistant elastic material layer <b>232</b><i>b </i>formed of, for example, a silicone rubber on the core metal <b>232</b><i>a</i>, a heating layer <b>232</b><i>d </i>on the layer <b>232</b><i>b</i>, and a releasing layer <b>232</b><i>c </i>as the outermost layer.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">The core metal <b>232</b><i>a </i>is iron, stainless steel, aluminum, or a like metal and measures 28 mm in diameter. The heat resistant elastic layer <b>232</b><i>b </i>is formed of a 6-mm thick silicone rubber foam on the core metal <b>232</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">The core metal <b>232</b><i>a </i>is preferably aluminum for the purpose of preventing induction heating.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">The heating layer <b>232</b><i>d </i>is a member which heats up by induction heating. Its thickness is reduced to 40 μm to 50 μm to cut down on the rise time of the surface temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Since the heating layer <b>232</b><i>d </i>needs to heat up by induction heating (heated by current generated by electromagnetic induction), the layer <b>232</b><i>d </i>is made of iron, SUS430 stainless steel, or any other electrically conductive, magnetic material. Especially preferred materials are those with high specific permeability (for example, 1 or greater), including a silicon steel board, an electromagnetic steel board, and nickel steel.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">Non-magnetic materials, such as SUS304 stainless, which shows high resistivity (for example, 9.8×10<sup>−6 </sup>ohm centimeters or greater) may also be used, because such materials heat up by induction heating. The base of the roller <b>232</b> may be non-magnetic (for example, ceramics) provided that the layer <b>232</b><i>d </i>exhibits sufficient conductance and high specific permeability. Here, the heating layer <b>232</b><i>d </i>is made of 40-μm thick nickel by electroforming. The heating layer <b>232</b><i>d </i>maybe made up of multiple sublayers of different materials for increased heating.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">The releasing layer <b>232</b><i>c </i>is formed on the (outer) surface of the heating layer <b>232</b><i>d </i>to prevent the toner T from, when heated in the fix nip section Y, sticking to the heat roller <b>231</b> due to reduced viscosity. The layer <b>232</b><i>c </i>is made of a fluororesin, such as PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) and PFA (a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoroalkylvinylether); elastic materials, such as a silicone rubber, fluororubber, and fluorosilicon rubber; or sublayers each made of one of these materials.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">The pressure roller <b>232</b> is pressed to the heat roller <b>231</b> by a spring or other pressure member (not shown) with a force of 274 N. Thus, the fix nip section Y, about 7 mm wide, is formed between the pressure roller <b>232</b> and the heat roller <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">The induction heating coil <b>241</b> provides a means of heating the pressure roller <b>232</b> as shown in the figure. The coil <b>241</b> is structured to surround the outer rim of the pressure roller <b>232</b>. The structure gives a curvature to the induction heating coil <b>241</b>, which in turn develops a concentration of magnetic flux inside the induction heating coil <b>241</b> and hence increases the magnitude of eddy current. This works in favor of quickly increasing the surface temperature of the pressure roller <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">Here, the induction heating coil <b>241</b> is made of a single aluminum wire (coated with a surface insulating layer, for example, oxidation film) for better heat resistance. Alternatively, the coil <b>241</b> may be made of a copper wire, a copper-based composite wire, or a litz wire (for example, multistranded enameled wire). No matter which material is used, the total resistance of the induction heating coil <b>241</b> should be 0.5 Ω or less, preferably 0.1 Ω or less, in order to restrain the Joule loss in the induction heating coil <b>241</b>, Two or more induction heating coils <b>241</b> may be provided depending on the size of the recording paper P to which toner T is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">The pressure roller <b>232</b> is induction heated by an alternating magnetic field generated by high-frequency current supplied from an excitation circuit (not shown) to the induction heating coil <b>241</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Around the pressure roller <b>232</b> is there provided a thermistor (temperature line sensor) <b>249</b> as temperature sensing means to sense the surface temperature of the pressure roller <b>232</b>. Temperature control means (control means; not shown) controls the electric current feed to the induction heating coil <b>241</b> on the basis of obtained temperature data, so as to maintain the surface of the pressure roller <b>232</b> at a predetermined temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Now, see Table 4 showing the heating efficiency (equal to the heat transfer to the pressure roller <b>232</b> divided by the power consumption by the power source) and average power consumption for 20 page copying under two sets of conditions for comparison. Arrangement (IV) employed the induction heating coil <b>241</b> (the induction heating method) as the heating means for the pressure roller <b>232</b>, whilst arrangement (II) employed the aforementioned external heat roller <b>233</b> (the heat roller method) in embodiment 1 .</p>

<p id="p-0250" num="0249">As shown in Table 4, by the heat roller method, heat is transferred from the heat roller <b>231</b> to the pressure roller <b>233</b> by conductance due to difference in temperature. The induction heating method, whereby the direct pressure roller <b>232</b> heats up by itself, achieves better heating efficiency than the heat roller method.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">In the induction heating method, the induction heating coil <b>241</b> itself hardly heats up; therefore little heat dissipates into the air like in the heat roller method. The average power consumption while paper is in transit in the induction heating method is 37% that in the heat roller method. The method therefore allows for reduction in power consumption.</p>

<p id="p-0252" num="0251">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>7</b>, the following will describe another embodiment of the present invention. Here, for convenience, members of the present embodiment that have the same function as members of embodiment 1, and that are mentioned in that embodiment are indicated by the same reference numerals and description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">In the fixer (heater) <b>23</b> in accordance with the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the core metal <b>231</b><i>a </i>is iron (STKM (carbon steel)) and has a diameter of 40 mm and a thickness of 1.3 mm to give it low thermal capacity. The combined power rating of the heater lamps <b>234</b>, <b>235</b> is 800 W.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">The pressure roller <b>232</b> is rotatable in the direction indicated by arrow B in the figure. The roller <b>232</b> is pressed to the heat roller <b>231</b> by a spring or other pressure member (not shown) with a force of 745N (76 kgf). Thus, the fix nip section Y, about 6 mm wide, is formed between the pressure roller <b>232</b> and the heat roller <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">The external heat roller <b>233</b> has a heater lamp <b>239</b> in it to heat the pressure roller <b>232</b>. The heater lamp <b>239</b>, rated at 400 W, is similarly constructed to the aforementioned heater lamps <b>234</b>, <b>235</b>. The core metal <b>233</b><i>a </i>is an aluminum cylinder shaft measuring 15 mm in diameter and 1.0 mm in thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">To sufficiently fix toner T onto the recording paper P, it is preferred to raise the surface temperature of the external heat roller <b>233</b> and the temperature of the pressure roller <b>232</b>. Nevertheless, raising the temperature of the rollers <b>233</b>, <b>232</b> increases the power consumption in the fixer <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">The following will examine optimal structural conditions of the external heat roller <b>233</b> in view of toner fixing performance and power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">First, we prepared six external heat rollers <b>233</b> of which the core metal was aluminum. They are identical in thermal capacity (34.4 J/° C.), and hence in warm-up conditions. The six rollers however differed in roller diameter (core metal diameter) and roller thickness (core metal thickness).</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">For each external heat roller, the load applied to it was determined so that the maximum warpage of the roller equaled 0.1 mm which was the upper limit of the range within which the warpage causes no problems in practice. Under these settings, the width (the length in the direction indicated by -arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) was measured of the heating nip section Z formed between the external heat roller and the pressure roller.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">Table 5 below shows the roller diameter (mm), roller thickness (mm), thermal capacity (roller thermal capacity) J/° C.), load (N), maximum warpage (roller maximum warpage) (mm), and width (heating nip width) of the heating nip section Z (mm) of each of the six external heat rollers. Each roller had an aluminum core.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">The aluminum composing the core metal of the external heat roller had a Young modulus of 7200 (kgf/mm<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<p id="p-0265" num="0264">The recording paper transit speed (hereinafter, “paper transit speed (transit speed (copies per minute))) in Table 6 indicates how many A4 sheets of recording paper P in landscape orientation are loaded into the fixer, hence, pass a point in the fix nip section Y, per minute. The fixing rate (transit speed (mm/sec.)) indicates the speed at which a point on the sheet of recording paper P passes through the fix nip section Y. The paper transit speed and the fixing rate are interrelated.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">Relationships between the external heat roller temperature (roller temperature) (° C.), the power consumption (W) during paper transit, and the heating nip transit time (ms) which is the time taken for a point on the external heat roller to pass through the heating nip section Z (i.e., the width of the heating nip section Z divided by the fixing rate) are shown Which are results of the 40 sheets being passed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows the relationships under the set of conditions 1, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> under the set of conditions 2, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> under the set of conditions 3.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 19</figref>, the relationship between the external heat roller temperature (roller temperature) (° C.) and the heating nip transit time (ms) is indicated by squares, whilst the relationship between the power consumption (W) during paper transit and the heating nip transit time (ms) is indicated by circles.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 19</figref>, a longer heating nip transit time, hence a greater width of the heating nip section Z, improves fixing of toner T even at low external heat roller temperatures. On the other hand, a longer heating nip transit time results in a greater power consumption during paper transit. Reasons will be examined in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">To increase the width of the heating nip section Z, the diameter of the external heat roller needs to be increased. Here, as shown in Table 5, the external heat rollers are varied only in thickness, disregarding their diameters, to give them equal thermal capacity. While all the rollers do have an equal thermal capacity (34.4 J/° C.), a greater diameter of the external heat roller gives the roller a greater surface area, which results in increased thermal radiation and convection, and hence heat loss from the rollers. The increase in heat loss presumably exceeds the reduction in heat consumption realized by the lowered surface temperature of the external heat roller. The result is an increased total power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 19</figref> also show as a comparative example the relationship, in for a fixer having no external heat roller, between the heating nip transit time and the power consumption during paper transit under the conditions. The fixer for the comparative example is identical in structure to the fixer <b>23</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except that the external heat roller <b>233</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">The structure of the comparative example fixer is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Specifically, the comparative example fixer <b>53</b> includes a heat roller <b>531</b>, a pressure roller <b>532</b>, a cleaning roller <b>540</b>, heater lamps <b>534</b>, <b>535</b>, a temperature sensor <b>537</b>, and a guide section <b>538</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">The heat roller <b>531</b> is equivalent to the heat roller <b>231</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the pressure roller <b>532</b> to the pressure roller <b>232</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the cleaning roller <b>540</b> to the cleaning roller <b>240</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the heater lamps <b>534</b>, <b>535</b> to the heater lamp <b>234</b>, <b>234</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the temperature sensor <b>537</b> to the temperature sensor (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and the guide section <b>538</b> to the guide section <b>238</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). These members in the fixer <b>53</b> have the same structure as the respective equivalent members in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The fixer <b>53</b> has the identical structure as the fixer <b>23</b> except the missing external heat roller <b>233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">The following description will focus on the distinctions of the fixer <b>53</b> over the fixer <b>23</b>. Description on common features will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">As with the core metal <b>231</b><i>a </i>of the heat roller <b>231</b>, the core metal <b>531</b><i>a </i>of the heat roller <b>531</b> in the fixer <b>53</b> is carbon steel (STKM). The core metal <b>531</b><i>a </i>however measures 55 mm in diameter and 1.3 mm in thickness. The heater lamps <b>534</b>, <b>535</b> have a combined power rating of 1200 W.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">As with the core metal <b>232</b><i>a </i>of the pressure roller <b>232</b>, the core metal <b>532</b><i>a </i>of the pressure roller <b>532</b> in the fixer <b>53</b> is stainless steel. The core metal <b>532</b><i>a </i>however measures 43 mm in diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">The pressure roller <b>532</b> is pressed to the heat roller <b>531</b> by a spring or other pressure member (not shown) with a force of 980 N (100 kgf). Thus, a fix nip section Y′, about 8 mm wide, is formed between the heat roller <b>531</b> and the pressure roller <b>532</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Consequently, in the fixer <b>23</b>, the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b> measure about 40 mm in diameter; the load necessary to fix toner T onto recording paper P (hereinafter, “required fixing load”), that is, the pressure of the pressure roller <b>232</b> to the heat roller <b>233</b> is 745N; and the fix nip section Y is <b>6</b> mm wide. In contrast, in the fixer <b>53</b>, the roller <b>531</b>, <b>532</b> measure about 55 mm in diameter; the required fixing load is 980 N; and the fix nip section Y′ is 8 mm wide.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">As discussed in the foregoing, the roller diameter, fixing load, fix nip section width are specified to greater values in the fixer <b>53</b> than in the fixer <b>23</b>, because the fixer <b>53</b>, including no external heat roller, inevitably requires a greater fixing load, fix nip section width, etc. to achieve equivalent fixing performance at the same fixing rate (recording paper transit speed) as in the fixer <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">The heating nip transit time t (ms) is preferably determined to meet two conditions: (a) The power consumption during paper transit is less than or equal to the power consumption during paper transit of the fixer <b>53</b> with a conventional structure. (b) The surface temperature of the external heat roller is 200° C. or lower.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">In condition (b), the surface temperature of the external heat roller is 200° C. or lower. This is because an examination of the aforementioned heat resistance of the external heat roller revealed that the heat resistance temperature (upper limit value) was about 200° C.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">Here, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 19</figref>, the range of heating nip transit time meeting conditions (a), (b) is indicated by two arrows.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">Table 7 shows the upper and lower limits of the range for the heating nip transit time meeting conditions (a), (b) at the paper transit speeds (fixing rates) shown in Table 6 as derived from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 19</figref>.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">As in the foregoing, the fixer <b>23</b> includes the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b> pressing each other and heats up the recording paper P by passing the recording paper P through the fix nip section Y. The external heat roller <b>233</b>, in contact with the pressure roller <b>232</b> to rotate with the pressure roller <b>232</b>, heats the pressure roller <b>232</b> so that the surface of the pressure roller <b>232</b> reaches a predetermined temperature (for example, the limit for the heat resistance temperature).</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">The heating nip transit time required for any given point on the rotating pressure roller <b>232</b> to pass through the heating nip section Z is decided on the basis of the material and thermal capacity of the external heat roller <b>233</b>, the power consumption by the fixer <b>23</b> (heat roller <b>231</b>, pressure roller <b>232</b>, and external heat roller <b>233</b>) during the transit of the recording paper P, and the surface temperature of the external heat roller <b>233</b> during the transit of the recording paper P.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">In other words, the fixer <b>23</b> is arranged to meet equation (3) or (4) in the case of an aluminum external heat roller <b>233</b> (core metal <b>233</b><i>a</i>). When this is the case, the external heat roller <b>233</b> has a thermal capacity of 34.4 J/° C.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">Thus, the heating nip transit time can be determined in accordance with the material and thermal capacity of the external heat roller <b>233</b> so that, for example, the heater's power consumption during the transit of the recording paper P is smaller that in the comparative example with no external heat roller <b>233</b> or the surface temperature of the external heat roller <b>233</b> during the transit of the recording paper P does not exceed a predetermined temperature (for example, heat resistance temperature (here, 200° C.)).</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">Therefore, power consumption can be lowered although the external heat roller <b>233</b> is included.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">The following will examine an external heat roller (equivalent to the external heat roller <b>233</b>) with a carbon steel (steel) core metal (equivalent to the core metal <b>233</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). To obtain external heat rollers with an equal thermal capacity (here, 34.4 J/° C.), and thereby the same warm-up conditions, five external heat rollers were prepared with varying roller diameters and roller thicknesses.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">The load to the external heat roller was determined so that the warpage of each external heat roller does not exceed 0.1 mm, which was the upper limit of the practically problem-free range. Under the conditions, the width of the heating nip section Z formed between the external heat roller and the pressure roller was measured.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">Shown in Table 8 are the roller diameters (mm), roller thicknesses (mm), thermal capacities (roller thermal capacities) (J/° C.), loads (N), maximum warpages (roller maximum warpages) (mm), and widths (heating nip widths) (mm) of the heating nip section Z of the five carbon steel external heat rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">The carbon steel composing the core metal of the external heat roller had a Young modulus of 21000 (kgf/mm<sup>2</sup>).</p>

The paper P is then passed between the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b> which is being pressed by the roller <b>231</b>, that is, through the fix nip section Y.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">While passing through the section Y, the unfixed toner T melts and firmly adheres onto the recording paper P under heat and pressure from the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>. Hence, the fixer <b>23</b> arranged as above is capable of fixing the toner T onto the recording paper P passing between the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">A typical copying machine operates in copy mode, warm-up mode, standby mode, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">warm-up mode is the mode in which the copying machine operates immediately after its power supply is turned on. In that mode, the copying machine first feeds current to the heater lamps <b>234</b>, <b>235</b> to heat up the heat roller <b>231</b> to a predetermined temperature (here, 200° C.). As the heat roller <b>231</b> reaches the predetermined temperature, the machine turns on the drive motor, driving the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b> to rotate at a peripheral speed (fixing rate) of 365 mm/sec. and simultaneously with the driving, feeds electric current to the heater lamp <b>239</b>. The external heat roller <b>233</b> is continuously heated until it reaches a predetermined temperature (here, 190° C. (at which time the pressure roller <b>232</b> reaches 150° C.)).</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">In copy mode, the copying machine forms an image on the recording paper P moving at a predetermined speed. It is in this mode that the fixer <b>23</b> fixes toner onto the recording paper P. In copy mode, the electric current feeds to the heater lamps <b>234</b>, <b>235</b>, <b>239</b> are controlled so as to maintain the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b> at predetermined temperatures (here, for example, 200° C. and 136° C. respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">Specifically, the heater lamp <b>239</b> in the external heat roller <b>233</b> is so controlled as to maintain the external heat roller <b>233</b> at a temperature (170° C.) required to maintain the surface temperature of the pressure roller <b>232</b> at a predetermined temperature (136° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">In copy mode, if the recording paper P is A4 in landscape orientation, 65 sheets per minute of the recording paper P are fed to the fix nip section Y. Under these conditions, the nip transit time (time taken for any given point on the recording paper P to pass through the fix nip section Y) is 19.2 milliseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0333">In standby mode, electric consumption is maintained at such a level that the copying machine can enter copy mode immediately in response to a print request. After copying is finished, the copying machine is in standby mode for some time before entering low power mode.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">The thermal energy dissipated in the form of radiation from the fixer <b>23</b> varies depending on the place of the fixer <b>23</b>, the transport direction of the recording paper P, and the positional relationship between the pressure roller <b>232</b> and the external heat roller <b>233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">The following will examine the layout in the fixer <b>23</b>, the transport direction of the recording paper P, and the positional relationship between the pressure roller <b>232</b> and the external heat roller <b>233</b> so as to reduce the thermal energy dissipated in the form of radiation (radiation energy) from the fixer <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0336">The fixer <b>23</b> is placed so that the recording paper P is transported vertically upward in the fixer <b>23</b> (the paper transit direction is the direction indicated by arrow E<b>1</b> in the figure) (arrangement (V)).</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">In comparative example (IV), arrangement (VI), and arrangement (VII), all as comparative examples, the fixer differs from arrangement (V) in accordance with the present embodiment in the layout in the fixer, the transport direction of the recording paper P, and the positional relationship between the pressure roller <b>232</b> and the external heat roller <b>233</b>. Comparative example (IV) and arrangements (VI), (VII) were compared to arrangement (V) regarding radiation energy.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338">Table 10 shows the arrangement (paper transit direction, positional relationship (contact position of the external heat roller <b>233</b>) between the external heat roller <b>233</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b>, orientation, area Sa, and temperature of region A, and orientation, area Sb, and temperature of region B) of comparative example (IV) and arrangements (V) to (VII).

<p id="p-0341" num="0340">As viewed in a cross section, showing the external heat roller <b>233</b>, vertical to the center of rotation (rotation axis) of the pressure roller <b>232</b>, region B (second region) is a part of the surface of the pressure roller <b>232</b> stretching from the recording-paper-P-ejecting end of the fix nip section Y to the heating position of the external heat roller <b>233</b> in the rotational direction of the pressure roller <b>232</b>. Similarly, region A (first region) is another part of the surface of the pressure roller <b>232</b> stretching from the heating position of the external heat roller <b>233</b> to the recording-paper-P-loading end of the fix nip section Y.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">The angles (θp) in the description below is measured counterclockwise off a line (dash-dot line H in the figure (facing the right hand side)) vertical to a normal to the plane on which is installed the copying machine incorporating the fixer <b>23</b> (substantially parallel to the ground), the line H present on a plane parallel to that plane. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, in arrangement (V), the paper transit direction is vertical upward (its angle is 90°), and the external heat roller <b>233</b> is positioned at 225° on the pressure roller <b>232</b>. In other words, the line linking the center of the pressure roller <b>232</b> to the center of the external heat roller <b>233</b> is 225° off line H, with the external heat roller <b>233</b> disposed lower than the pressure roller <b>232</b> in terms of the rollers' centers.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, region A is located lower than region B in arrangement (V) in terms of the widthwise center lines of regions A, B. In other words, as shown in Table 10, region A faces downward, and region B upward.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">The area Sa of region A is 1.40×10<sup>4 </sup>(mm<sup>2</sup>), whilst the area Sb of region B is 2.34×10<sup>4 </sup>(mm<sup>2</sup>). The temperature of region A is 136° C., whilst the temperature of region B is 119° C.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">In arrangement (V), the radiation energy from the fixer is 238 W.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">As shown in Table 10 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, comparative example (IV) differs from arrangement (V) in that the fixer is rotated 90° counterclockwise. That is, in comparative example (IV), the paper transit direction is horizontal (in the direction indicated by E<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>; the angle is 0°), and the external heat roller <b>233</b> is positioned at 315° on the pressure roller <b>232</b> (lower than the pressure roller <b>232</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">In comparative example (IV), the area Sa of region A, the area Sb of region B, the temperature of region A, and the temperature of region B are identical to those in arrangement (V). In comparative example (IV), the radiation energy from the fixer is 259 W.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">Setting the paper transit direction to the vertical upward direction as in arrangement (V) as discussed in the foregoing improves heat efficiency by reducing radiation energy by about 9.1% compared to setting the paper transit direction to the horizontal direction as in comparative example (IV).</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">This is because of reduction in heat dissipation by convection from region A. Where the temperature of region A is Tpa, and the temperature of region B is Tpb, Tpa&gt;Tpb holds because region B is yet to be heated by the external heat roller <b>233</b>, and region A has been already heated by the external heat roller <b>233</b>. Therefore, region A is likely to lose heat to the air by radiation compared to region B. In addition, in the case of arrangement (V), region A faces downward, resulting in less heat dissipation from region A by convection. The total heat dissipation from the pressure roller <b>232</b> is therefore less than in comparative example (IV).</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">In arrangement (V), the recording paper P is moved (transported) in a substantially vertical direction. This makes a part of the surface of the heat roller <b>231</b> face downward. The downward region (part) dissipates less heat by convection. Still in the case of arrangement (V), part of the air heated by the heat roller <b>231</b> flows toward the pressure roller <b>232</b>, heating the pressure roller <b>232</b>. This improves the heat efficiency of the fixer.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">Still in the case of arrangement (V), the paper transit direction of the recording paper P is substantially vertical. The space in the fixer <b>23</b> is therefore divided into an upper half (hereinafter, “upper space”) and a lower half (hereinafter, “lower space”) by the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b>. Since region A of the surface of the pressure roller <b>232</b> and the external heat roller <b>233</b> are in the lower space, the air in the lower space is heated to a higher temperature than the air in the upper space. The air heated to this higher temperature hardly flows out of the fixer <b>23</b> and remains inside the lower space, improving the heat efficiency of the fixer <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">Now, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> and Table 10, arrangement (VI) will be described as an example where the external heat roller <b>233</b> is in a different position from arrangement (V).</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, in arrangement (VI), the external heat roller <b>233</b> is positioned at 135° on the pressure roller <b>232</b> (higher than the pressure roller <b>232</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">Again in arrangement (VI), the area Sa of region A is 2.34×10<sup>4 </sup>(mm<sup>2</sup>), and the area Sb of region B is 1.40×10<sup>4 </sup>(mm<sup>2</sup>). The temperature of region A is 136° C., and the temperature of region B is 119° C. In the case of arrangement (VI), the radiation energy from the fixer <b>23</b> is 251 W.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">Similarly to arrangement (V), the paper transit direction in arrangement (VI) is vertical; therefore, the radiation energy is smaller than in comparative example (IV).</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">Arrangement (V) improves heat efficiency by reducing radiation energy by about 5.2% compared to arrangement (VI).</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">This is because region A in arrangement (V) is smaller in terms of area, and hence dissipates less heat by convection, than region A in arrangement (VI).</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">Another reason is that the external heat roller <b>233</b> is present in the lower space in arrangement (V), which makes it difficult for the air heated by the external heat roller <b>233</b> to flow out of the fixer <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> and Table 10, arrangement (VII) will be described as an example where the paper transit direction for the recording paper P differs from that in arrangement (VI).</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, the paper transit direction in arrangement (VII) is vertically downward (in the direction indicated by arrow E<b>3</b> in the figure; the angle is 270°). This is different from arrangements (V), (VI). Therefore, region A is located higher than region B. This is different from arrangements (V), (VI).</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">In arrangement (VII), the area Sa of region A is 1.40×10<sup>4 </sup>(mm<sup>2</sup>), and the area Sb of region B is 2.34×10<sup>4 </sup>(mm<sup>2</sup>). The temperature of region A is 136° C., and the temperature of region B is 119° C. In the case of arrangement (VII), the radiation energy from the fixer <b>23</b> is 256 W.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">Similarly to arrangement (V), the paper transit direction in arrangement (VII) is again vertical; therefore, the radiation energy is smaller than in comparative example (IV).</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362">Arrangement (V) improves heat efficiency by reducing the radiation energy by about 7.0% compared to arrangement (VII).</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">This is because region A in arrangement (VII) faces upward and dissipates more heat by convection than region A in arrangement (V). The total heat dissipation from the pressure roller <b>232</b> is therefore more than in arrangement (V).</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">Another reason is that in arrangement (VII) the paper transit direction is upward; therefore, the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b> rotate upward where they face the cover <b>230</b><i>a </i>and the cover <b>230</b><i>b </i>respectively, exerting such a force to generate an upward flow of air in their vicinity.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">This helps the air in the lower space heated by the heat roller <b>231</b>, pressure roller <b>232</b>, and external heat roller <b>233</b> move into the upper space and flow out of the fixer <b>23</b> through, for example, a paper ejection opening on the fixer <b>23</b>. On the other hand, if the paper transit direction is upward as in arrangement (V), the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b> rotate downward where they face the cover <b>230</b><i>a </i>and the cover <b>230</b><i>b </i>respectively, exerting such a force to generate an downward flow of air in their vicinity. This helps the air in the lower space heated by the heat roller <b>231</b>, pressure roller <b>232</b>, and external heat roller <b>233</b> remain in the lower space.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366">As detailed in the foregoing, the arrangement where the paper transit direction is vertically upward and the external heat roller <b>233</b> is provided such that region A faces downward and is smaller (i.e., shorter in length) than region B (arrangement (V)) achieves the greatest reduction in radiation energy. Somewhat less significant, nevertheless similarly meaningful, reduction in radiation energy is achieved by arranging one of the paper transit direction, the placement (region A, B) of the external heat roller <b>233</b>, etc. similarly to arrangement (V) (arrangements (VI), (VII)).</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">A cleaning roller <b>240</b> may be provided near the surface of the pressure roller <b>232</b>. An arrangement incorporating such a cleaning roller <b>240</b> will be now described.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0368">The following will examine the relationship between the radiation energy from the fixer <b>23</b> and the placement of the cleaning roller <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0369">The cleaning roller <b>240</b> is supported at its axis so that it is rotated by the rotation of the pressure roller <b>232</b>. The cleaning roller <b>240</b> is a core material made of aluminum or a like metal and has a cylindrical shape. Here, the cleaning roller <b>240</b> is made of stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">Arrangement (VIII) is identical to aforementioned arrangement (V), except the cleaning roller <b>240</b> provided upstream to the external heat roller <b>233</b>. In arrangement (VIII), the cleaning roller <b>240</b> is positioned at 135° on the pressure roller <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0371">In comparative examples (V), (VI), the position of the cleaning roller <b>240</b> differs from arrangement (VIII). Comparative examples (V), (VI) were compared to arrangement (VIII) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) regarding radiation energy.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0372">Table 11 shows the arrangement (paper transit direction, positional relationship (contact position of the external heat roller <b>233</b>) between the external heat roller <b>233</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b>, orientation, area Sa, and temperature of region A, and orientation, area Sb, and temperature of region B), the position of the cleaning roller <b>240</b> (positional relationship with the external heat roller <b>233</b>), and the radiation energy of comparative examples (V), (VI) and arrangement (VIII).</p>

<p id="p-0375" num="0374">As shown in Table 11 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, in comparative example (V), the cleaning roller <b>240</b> is positioned upstream to the external heat roller <b>233</b>, at 90° on the pressure roller <b>232</b>. The radiation energy in comparative example (V) is 252 W.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the cleaning roller <b>240</b> in comparative example (V) is positioned downstream to the external heat roller <b>233</b>, at 270° on the pressure roller <b>232</b>. The radiation energy in comparative example (VI) is 256 W.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0376">The radiation energy in arrangement (VIII) is 245 W.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0377">As discussed in the foregoing, arrangement (VIII) improves heat efficiency by reducing radiation energy by about 4.3% compared to comparative example (VI).</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0378">This is because the cleaning roller <b>240</b> is positioned above the external heat roller <b>233</b> in arrangement (VIII). This is different from comparative example (VI). The cleaning roller <b>240</b> in arrangement (VIII) is capable of preventing the air heated by the external heat roller <b>233</b> from flowing out of the fixer <b>23</b> through a paper ejection opening on the fixer <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0379">When in contact with the pressure roller <b>232</b>, the cleaning roller <b>240</b> in typical situations acts as a thermal load and adversely affects the external heat roller <b>233</b>'s function of heating the pressure roller <b>232</b>. Comparative example (VI) is susceptible to the negative effects of the cleaning roller <b>240</b> positioned downstream to the external heat roller <b>233</b>. Arrangement (VIII), however, is less affected by the cleaning roller <b>240</b> acting as a thermal load, because the air heated by the external heat roller <b>233</b> (thermal radiation) heats the cleaning roller <b>240</b> in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0380">Arrangement (VIII) improves heat efficiency by reducing the radiation energy by about 2.8% compared to comparative example (V).</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0381">In comparative example (V), as seen from the external heat roller <b>233</b>, the entire cleaning roller <b>240</b> is hidden behind the pressure roller <b>232</b>. The thermal radiation from the external heat roller <b>233</b> does not reach the cleaning roller <b>240</b>. In contrast, in arrangement (VIII), the external heat roller <b>233</b> and the cleaning roller <b>240</b> are disposed almost to face each other, so as not to be obstructed by the pressure roller <b>232</b>. In other words, the external heat roller <b>233</b> and the cleaning roller <b>240</b> are positioned to face each other around the pressure roller <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0382">Therefore, in arrangement (VIII), the cleaning roller <b>240</b> absorbs part of the thermal radiation from the external heat roller <b>233</b>, reducing the heat loss from the external heat roller <b>233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">The arrangement (for example, material, dimensions, shape, etc.) of the heat roller <b>231</b>, pressure roller <b>232</b>, external heat roller <b>233</b>, and cleaning roller <b>240</b> is by no means limited to the aforementioned arrangement in any special manner.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">The foregoing description took the fixer (heater) <b>23</b> as an example of a device including the rollers <b>231</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>.

Here, for convenience, members of the present embodiment that have the same function as members of embodiment 2, and that are mentioned in that embodiment are indicated by the same reference numerals and description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, a fixer in accordance with the present embodiment measures 40 mm in diameter and is made up of a core metal <b>232</b><i>a </i>and a heat resistant elastic layer <b>232</b><i>b </i>formed on the metal <b>232</b><i>a </i>.

<p id="p-0390" num="0389">As shown in Table 12, the radiation energy in arrangement (V) is 238 W, whilst the radiation energy in arrangement (IX) is 206 W. Arrangement (IX) in accordance with the present embodiment improves heat efficiency by reducing the radiation energy by about 13.4% compared to arrangement (V).</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390">This is because the heat roller method entails heat loss (about 47 W) from the surface of the external heat roller <b>233</b> through thermal radiation and convection, whereas the induction heating method allows the pressure roller <b>232</b> to directly heat up and causes the induction heating coil <b>241</b> itself to hardly heat up, let alone make heat loss.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">Aforementioned embodiments 1, 2 assumed that the paper transit direction was preferably vertical. Needless to say, the paper transit direction does not need to be absolutely vertical, and may be substantially vertical (the recording paper P passes through the fix nip section Y between the heat roller <b>231</b> and the pressure roller <b>232</b> either upward or downward).</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0392">The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same way may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the technical scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0393">A heater in accordance with the present invention, as described in the foregoing, includes a first heating member and a second heating member pressing each other, heats a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where the first heating member and the second heating member meet, and is arranged so that the heater includes an external heating member heating the second heating member from outside the second heating member, wherein: a transit time taken for any given point on the heated material to pass through the press region is less than or equal to 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec.; and a surface temperature, T<b>1</b> (° C.), of the first heating member and a surface temperature, T<b>2</b> (° C.), of the second heating member satisfy T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦100 (° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0394">It is preferred if the heater is such that the surface temperature, T<b>1</b>, of the first heating member and the surface temperature, T<b>2</b>, of the second heating member satisfy T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0395">According to the arrangement, the surface temperature, T<b>1</b> (° C.), of the first heating member and the surface temperature, T<b>2</b> (° C.), of the second heating member satisfy either T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦100 (° C.) or T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.). This eliminates the need for an increase in surface pressure in the press region even in a high speed apparatus for which the transit time taken for any given point on the heated material to pass through the press region is less than or equal to 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec. In other words, the arrangement allows for a smaller load being applied to the heating members.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0396">This allows for construction of thinner and smaller thermal capacity heating members, and hence reduces the warm-up time of the heater. Therefore, pre-heating of the heating members becomes unnecessary. Power consumption in warm-up and standby is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0397">The less load on the heating members, for example, prevents the heating members from creeping and extends the heating members' lifetime.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0398">Further, the reduced thickness of the heating members allows for construction of a more compact heater. The reduced drive torque of the heating members allows for lower power consumption and extends lifetime of driver components.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0399">It is preferred if the heater is such that the external heating member controls a difference between the surface temperature of the first heating member and the surface temperature of the second heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">Specifically, the heater preferably includes: temperature sensing means for sensing a surface temperature of the external heating member; and control means for controlling the surface temperature of the external heating member on the basis of a result of sensing by the temperature sensing means.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401">According to the arrangement, the external heating member heats the second heating member from outside the second heating member, thereby making it possible to readily control the surface temperature of the second heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402">Thus, according to the arrangement, a simple structure enables the control of the difference between the surface temperature of the first heating member and the surface temperature of the second heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">It is preferred if the heater controls to maintain the surface temperature of the first heating member at a substantially constant value.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">According to the arrangement, the surface temperature of the first heating member is maintained at a substantially constant value. The difference between the surface temperature of the first heating member and the surface temperature of the second heating member is therefore controlled by the external heating member based only on the surface temperature of the second heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">It is preferred if the heater is such that the surface temperature, T<b>1</b> (° C.), of the first heating member and the surface temperature, T<b>2</b> (° C.), of the second heating member satisfy T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦30×<b>1</b>n(P)−72.5 where P (kPa) is a surface pressure of the heated material in the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0406">The arrangement reduces T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>, which in turn increases the quantity of heat transferred to the heated material. This allows for a smaller load being applied to the heating members.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407">Another heater in accordance with the present invention, as described in the foregoing, includes a first heating member and a second heating member pressing each other, heats a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where the first heating member and the second heating member meet, and is arranged so that: a transit time taken for any given point on the heated material to pass through the press region is less than or equal to 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec.; and a quantity, Q<b>1</b>, of heat transferred from the first heating member to the heated material while the heated material is passing through the press region and a quantity, Q<b>2</b>, of heat transferred from the second heating member to the heated material while the heated material is passing through the press region satisfy Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>)≧0.25.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">It is preferred if the heater is such that the quantity Q<b>1</b> and the quantity Q<b>2</b> satisfy Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>)≧0.3.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">For example, when the material composing the second heating member has extremely poor heat conductivity, the second heating member in some cases transfers only an insufficient quantity of heat to the heated material, failing to provide sufficient heating, even if the surface of the second heating member is maintained at a high temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">However, the arrangement specifies the quantity of heat transferred to the heated material, not the temperature of the heating members. Regardless of from what material the heating members are made, similar effects are achieved to a case where the aforementioned surface temperature, T<b>1</b>, of the first heating member and surface temperature, T<b>2</b>, of the second heating member are determined to satisfy T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411">In other words, the arrangement allows the load on the heating members to be reduced and enables lower power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">It is preferred if the heater further includes: an external heating member heating the second heating member from outside the second heating member; and control means for controlling a ratio, Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>), of the quantity, Q<b>2</b>, of the heat transferred from the second heating member to the heated material and a total quantity, Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>, of heat transferred to the heated material by controlling a surface temperature of the external heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0413">According to the arrangement, the external heating member controls Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>). Therefore, according to the arrangement, the control of Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>) is enabled by a simple structure.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414">It is preferred if the heater is such that a ratio, Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>), of the quantity, Q<b>2</b> (J), of the heat transferred from the second heating member to the heated material and a total quantity, Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b> (J), of heat transferred to the heated material satisfies Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>)≧−0.078×ln(P)+0.7 where P (kPa) is a surface pressure of the heated material in the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0415">The arrangement allows for an increased Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>) (In other words, the ratio of the quantity, Q<b>2</b>, of the heat transferred from the second heating member to the heated material) and a reduced required fixing load. This enables reduction in power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0416">It is preferred if the heater is such that a surface pressure of the heated material in the press region is less than or equal to 300 (kPa).</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0417">The arrangement allows for load on the heating members and the heated material to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0418">It is preferred if the heater is such that the external heating member includes a heat source body and heats the second heating member by contacting a surface of the second heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0419">The arrangement enables direct heating of the surface of the second heating member, simplifying the structure of the external heating member. The simplified structure occupies less space. This facilitates the mounting of a cleaning roller and other components.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0420">It is preferred if the heater is such that the external heating member is a roller rotating with the second heating member in contact with the second heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0421">According to the arrangement, the second heating member is heated using a simple structure occupying less space. This facilitates the mounting of a cleaning roller and other components.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0422">It is preferred if the heater is such that the second heating member includes a member heated by induction heating, and the external heating member is an induction heating coil heating the second heating member by induction.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0423">The arrangement enables the second heating member to directly heat up; there is little thermal radiation or convection heat loss from the surface of the second heating member. The external heating member hardly heats up, let alone make heat loss. This further improves heat efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0424">It is preferred if the heater is such that the external heating member is shaped to have a curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0425">The arrangement develops a concentration of magnetic flux inside the induction heating coil as the external heating member and hence increases the magnitude of eddy current. This helps the second heating member heat up quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0426">It is preferred if the heater is such that a surface of the first heating member has a thermal capacity per unit length of less than or equal to 200 J/(m·° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0427">According to the arrangement, for example, warm-up time can be cut down to 30 seconds or less. This greatly reduces power consumption in standby.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0428">It is preferred if the heater is such that the first heating member and the second heating member are rotatable rollers and fix toner on the heated material by passing the heated material in the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0429">The arrangement enables the use of the heater as a fixer. This enables reductions in power consumption through the smaller load, while securing toner's fixing performance, and prevents recording paper (recording medium) which is a heated material from creasing and curling up.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0430">An image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention is arranged so that it includes: an image transfer device forming an image of an unfixed toner on the heated material; and the heater described above fixing the unfixed toner on the heated material.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0431">The arrangement provides a low power consumption image forming apparatus. In addition, for example, the heater can be used as a fixer. This enables reductions in power consumption through the smaller load, while securing toner's fixing performance, and prevents recording paper which is a heated material from creasing and curling up.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0432">The arrangement also provides image forming apparatus containing a heater made up of long-life heating members and driver components.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0433">A heating method in accordance with the present invention, as described in the foregoing, is a method of heating a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where a first heating member and a second heating member meet so that any given point on the heated material passes through the press region in 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec., and is arranged so that the method involves the step of heating the second heating member by an external heating member from outside the second heating member so that a surface temperature, T<b>1</b> (° C.), of the first heating member and a surface temperature, T<b>2</b> (° C.), of the second heating member satisfy T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦100 (° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0434">It is preferred if the heating method is such that the second heating member is heated by the external heating member from outside the second heating member so that the surface temperatures, T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, of the first and second heating temperatures satisfy T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.).</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0435">According to the method, the surface temperature, T<b>1</b> (° C.), of the first heating member and the surface temperature, T<b>2</b> (° C.), of the second heating member satisfy either T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦100 (° C.) or T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦70 (° C.). This eliminates the need for an increase in surface pressure in the press region even in a high speed apparatus for which the transit time taken for any given point on the heated material to pass through the press region is less than or equal to 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec. In other words, the method allows for a smaller load being applied to the heating members.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0436">This allows for construction of thinner and smaller thermal capacity heating members, and hence reduces the warm-up time of the heater implementing the heating method. Therefore, pre-heating of the heating members becomes unnecessary. Power consumption in warm-up and standby is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0438" num="0437">It is preferred if the heating method controls the difference between the surface temperature of the first heating member and the surface temperature of the second heating member by controlling a surface temperature of the external heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0438">According to the method, the difference between the surface temperature of the first heating member and the surface temperature of the second heating member is controllable using a simple arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0439">It is preferred if the heating method involves the step of controlling the surface temperature, T<b>1</b> (° C.), of the first heating member and the surface temperature, T<b>2</b> (° C.), of the second heating member so that T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>≦30×ln(P)−72.5 where P (kPa) is a surface pressure of the heated material in the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0440">The arrangement reduces T<b>1</b>-T<b>2</b>, which in turn increases the quantity of heat transferred to the heated material. This allows for a smaller load being applied to the heating members.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0441">A heating method in accordance with the present invention, as described in the foregoing, is a method of heating a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where a first heating member and a second heating member meet so that any given point on the heated material passes through the press region in 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec., and is arranged so that the method involves the step of controlling so that a quantity, Q<b>1</b>, of heat transferred from the first heating member to the heated material while the heated material is passing through the press region and a quantity, Q<b>2</b>, of heat transferred from the second heating member to the heated material while the heated material is passing through the press region satisfy Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>)≧0.25.</p>

<p id="p-0447" num="0446">It is preferred if the heating method involves the step of controlling so that a ratio, Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>), of the quantity, Q<b>2</b> (J), of the heat transferred from the second heating member to the heated material and a total quantity, Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b> (J), of heat transferred to the heated material satisfies Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>)≧−0.078×ln(P)+0.7 where P (kPa) is a surface pressure of the heated material in the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0447">The arrangement allows for an increased Q<b>2</b>/(Q<b>1</b>+Q<b>2</b>) (In other words, the ratio of the quantity, Q<b>2</b>, of the heat transferred from the second heating member to the heated material) and a reduced required fixing load. This enables reduction in power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0448">Another heater in accordance with the present invention, as described in the foregoing, includes a first heating member and a second heating member pressing each other, heats a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where the first heating member and the second heating member meet, and is arranged so that the heater includes an external heating member rotating with the second heating member in-contact with the second heating member and heating the second heating member so that the second heating member has a predetermined surface temperature, wherein a heating nip transit time taken for any given point on the second heating member in rotation to pass through a heating nip region where the second heating member contacts the external heating member is determined based on a material and thermal capacity of the external heating member, a power consumption in the heater while the heated material is passing through the press region, and a surface temperature of the external heating member while the heated material is passing through the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0449">According to the arrangement, the heating nip transit time can be determined in accordance with the material and thermal capacity of the external heating member so that, for example, the power consumption in the heater (first, second, and external heating members) while the heated material is passing through the press region is smaller than that in a heater without an external heating member and the surface temperature of the external heating member while the heated material is passing through the press region does not exceed a predetermined temperature (for example, heat resistance temperature).</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0450">Therefore, power consumption can be lowered by arranging the heater so as to achieve the determined heating nip transit time in this manner, although the external heating member is included.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0451">It is preferred if the heater is such that when, for example, the external heating member is made of aluminum, the heating nip transit time t (ms) satisfies 0.0005V<sup>2</sup>−0.283V+43.9≦t≦9.15 where V (mm/sec.) is a transit speed at which the heated material passes through the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0452">It is preferred if the heater is such that when the heated material is a A4 sheet and passes through the press region so that a 210-mm long side of the heated material is parallel to a transit direction, the heating nip transit time t (ms) satisfies 0.0128 P<sup>2</sup>−1.36 P+35.2≦t≦9.15 where P (copies per minute) is a transit speed at which the heated material passes through the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0453">According to the arrangement, the heater allows for lower power consumption although the external heating member is included.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0454">It is preferred if the heater is such that the external heating member warps 0.1 mm or less due to contact with the second heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0455">The arrangement provides the heating nip region and prevents the external heat roller from receiving excessive load.</p>
<p id="p-0457" num="0456">It is preferred if the heater is such that when, for example, the external heating member is made of steel, the heating nip transit time t (ms) satisfies 0.0005V<sup>2</sup>−0.351V+56.2≦t≦13.10 where V (mm/sec.) is a transit speed at which the heated material passes through the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0457">Alternatively, it is preferred if the heater is such that when the heated material is a A4 sheet and passes through the press region so that a 210-mm long side of the heated material is parallel to a transit direction (i.e., landscape orientation), the heating nip transit time t (ms) satisfies 0.0175 P<sup>2</sup>−1.96 P+54.8≦t≦13.10 where P (copies per minute) is a transit speed at which the heated material passes through the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="0458">According to the arrangement, the heater allows for lower power consumption although the external heating member is included.</p>
<p id="p-0460" num="0459">It is preferred if the heater is such that the steel either carbon steel or stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0461" num="0460">Steels, such as carbon steel and stainless steel, have a high Young modulus. The arrangement therefore improves the mechanical strength of the external heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="0461">It is preferred if the heater is such that the surface of the external heating member is covered with heat resistant resin.</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0462">According to the arrangement, the external heating member, as it rotates, smoothly contacts and separates from the second heating member. In addition, the external heating member is prevented from deforming due to an increased surface temperature of the external heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0463">It is preferred if the heater is such that a transit time taken for any given point on the heated material to pass through the press region is less than or equal to 2.3×10<sup>−2 </sup>sec.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0464">The arrangement enables the heater to be applicable to high speed apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0465">It is preferred if the heater is such that the first heating member and the second heating member are rotatable rollers and fix toner on the heated material by passing the heated material in the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0466">The arrangement enables the use of the heater as a fixer. This enables the image forming apparatus to incorporate a low power consumption fixer.</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0467">An image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention is arranged so that it includes: an image transfer device forming an image of an unfixed toner on the heated material; and the heater described above fixing the unfixed toner on the heated material.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0468">The arrangement enables the use of the heater as a fixer and provides a low power consumption image forming apparatus. In addition, when, the heater is applied to a high speed apparatus, the smaller load allows for a reduced power consumption even in a high speed apparatus, while securing toner's fixing performance and preventing recording paper (recording medium) which is a heated material from creasing and curling up.</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0469">A heating method in accordance with the present invention, as described in the foregoing, is a method of heating a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where a first heating member and a second heating member meet, and is arranged so that the method involves the step of determining a heating nip transit time for any given point on the second heating member in rotation to pass through a heating nip region where the second heating member and the external heating member contact each other, based on a material and thermal capacity of an external heating member rotating with the second heating member in contact with the second heating member and heating the second heating member so that the second heating member has a predetermined surface temperature, power consumptions by the first heating member, the second heating member, and the external heating member, and a surface temperature of the external heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0471" num="0470">According to the method, the heating nip transit time can be determined in accordance with the material and thermal capacity of the external heating member so that, for example, the power consumption in the heater (first, second, and external heating members) while the heated material is passing through the press region is smaller than that in a heater without an external heating member and the surface temperature of the external heating member while the heated material is passing through the press region does not exceed a predetermined temperature (for example, heat resistance temperature).</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0471">The method therefore heats the heated material on low power consumption by arranging the heater so as to achieve the determined heating nip transit time in this manner, although the external heating member is included.</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0472">It is preferred if the heating method is such that when, for example, the external heating member is made of aluminum, the heating nip transit time t (ms) satisfies 0.0005V<sup>2</sup>−0.283V+43.9≦t≦9.15 where V (mm/sec.) is a transit speed at which the heated material passes through the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0473">Alternatively, it is preferred if the heating method is such that when the heated material is a A4 sheet and passes through the press region so that a 210-mm long side of the heated material is parallel to a transit direction, the heating nip transit time t (ms) satisfies 0.0128 P<sup>2</sup>−1.36 P+35.2≦t≦9.15 where P (copies per minute) is a transit speed at which the heated material passes through the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0474">The method heats the heated material on low power consumption by specifying a range for the heating nip transit time t in accordance with the material (aluminum) of the external heating member, although the external heating member is included.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0475">It is preferred if the heating method is such that when the external heating member is made of steel, the heating nip transit time t (ms) satisfies 0.0005V<sup>2</sup>−0.351V+56.2≦t≦13.10 where V (mm/sec.) is a transit speed at which the heated material passes through the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0476">Alternatively, it is preferred if the heating method is such that when the heated material is a A4 sheet and passes through the press region so that a 210-mm long side of the heated material is parallel to a transit direction, the heating nip transit time t (ms) satisfies 0.0175 P<sup>2</sup>−1.96 P+54.8≦t≦13.10 where P (copies per minute) is a transit speed at which the heated material passes through the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0477">The method heats the heated material on low power consumption by specifying a range for the heating nip transit time t in accordance with the material (steel) of the external heating member, although the external heating member is included.</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0478">A heater in accordance with the present invention, as described in the foregoing, includes a first heating member and a second heating member pressing each other, heats a heated material by passing the heated material through a press region where the first heating member and the second heating member meet, and is arranged so that the heater comprises an external heating member heating the second heating member so that the second heating member has a predetermined surface temperature, wherein the heated material passes through the press region between the first heating member and the second heating member either upward or downward.</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0479">According to the arrangement, the direction in which the heated material passes through the press region (transport direction for the heated material) is substantially vertical. A region is therefore downward with respect to the first and second heating members. This lowers heat dissipation by convection from the first and second heating members.</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0480">The air heated in the heater remain in the lower space than the first and second heating members, heating the second heating member. The heat efficiency of the heater is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0481">It is preferred if the heater the heated material passes through the press region in a substantially vertically upward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0483" num="0482">According to the arrangement, for example, the heating members, where they face the cover housing the heater, rotate downward, exerting such a force to generate a downward flow of air in their vicinity. This helps the air in the heater heated by the first, second, and external heating members readily remain in the lower space.</p>
<p id="p-0484" num="0483">It is preferred if the heater the first heating member and the second heating member pass the heated material by rotation; and most of a first region is positioned lower than a center of rotation of the second heating member, the first region being, in a cross-section, showing the external heating member, vertical to a center of rotation of the second heating member, a part of a surface of the second heating member stretching from a heating position of the external heating member to a heated material loading end of the press region in a rotational direction of the second heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0485" num="0484">In typical situations, the second region is yet to be heated by the external heating member, whilst the first region is already heated by the external heating member; the temperature of the first region is therefore higher than the temperature of the second region. Therefore, the first region is likely to lose heat to the air by radiation compared to the second region.</p>
<p id="p-0486" num="0485">However, according to the arrangement, most of the first region is positioned lower than center of rotation of the second heating member, and most of the first region faces downward. This reduces heat dissipation from the first region by convection. Therefore, the heater reduces radiation energy and improves heat efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0487" num="0486">It is preferred if the heater is such that a second region is wider than the first region, the second region being, in the cross-section, a part of the surface of the second heating member stretching from a heated material ejecting end of the press region to the heating position of the external heating member in the rotational direction of the second heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0488" num="0487">The arrangement further reduces heat dissipation from the first region by convection. Therefore, the heater reduces radiation energy and improves heat efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0489" num="0488">It is preferred if the heater is such that the first heating member and the second heating member pass the heated material by rotation; and a center of a first region is positioned lower than a center of a second region, the first region being, in a cross-section, showing the external heating member, vertical to a center of rotation of the second heating member, a part of a surface of the second heating member stretching from a heating position of the external heating member to a heated material loading end of the press region in a rotational direction of the second heating member, the second region being, in the cross-section, a part of the surface of the second heating member stretching from a heated material ejecting end of the press region to a heating position of the external heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0490" num="0489">According to the arrangement, the heated material is transported in a substantially vertically upward direction. Therefore, the air heated by the first, second, and external heating members readily remains in the lower space in the heater. This improves heat efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0491" num="0490">It is preferred if the heater is such that the external heating member is a roller rotating with the second heating member in contact with the second heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0492" num="0491">According to the arrangement, the second heating member is heated using a simple structure occupying less space. This facilitates the mounting of a cleaning roller and other components.</p>
<p id="p-0493" num="0492">It is preferred if the heater is such that a center of rotation of the external heating member is positioned lower than a center of rotation of the second heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0494" num="0493">Typically, the air heated by the external heating member can readily flow out of the device through a heated material ejection opening.</p>
<p id="p-0495" num="0494">However, according to the arrangement, the heated material ejection opening is located far from the external heating member in the heater. The structure better retains the heated air inside the heater. Heat efficiency is thus improved.</p>
<p id="p-0496" num="0495">It is preferred if the heater is such that the second heating member includes a member heated by induction heating, and the external heating member is an induction heating coil heating the second heating member by induction.</p>
<p id="p-0497" num="0496">The arrangement enables the second heating member to directly heat up; there is little thermal radiation or convection heat loss from the surface of the second heating member. The external heating member hardly heats up, let alone make heat loss. This further improves heat efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0498" num="0497">It is preferred if the heater is such that the external heating member is shaped to have a curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0499" num="0498">The arrangement develops a concentration of magnetic flux inside the induction heating coil as the external heating member and hence increases the magnitude of eddy current. This helps the second heating member heat up quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0500" num="0499">It is preferred if the heater is such that the first heating member and the second heating member pass the heated material by rotation; and the heater includes a cleaning member cleaning the surface of the second heating member, the cleaning member located upstream to the external heating member in the rotational direction of the second heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0501" num="0500">It is preferred if the heater is such that the cleaning member is made of a metal.</p>
<p id="p-0502" num="0501">According to the arrangement, the cleaning member is positioned above the external heating member. The cleaning member prevents the air heated by the external heating member from flowing out of the device through a heated material ejection opening on the heater. Heat efficiency thus improved.</p>
<p id="p-0503" num="0502">In addition, the air heated by the external heating member pre-heats the cleaning member. The cleaning member therefore does not act as a thermal load. The provision of the cleaning member does not hamper the external heating member's function of heating the second heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0504" num="0503">It is preferred if the heater is such that the cleaning member and the external heating member are positioned to face each other.</p>
<p id="p-0505" num="0504">According to the arrangement, the thermal radiation heat from the external heating member is partly absorbed by the cleaning member, which reduces heat loss from the external heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0506" num="0505">It is preferred if the heater fixes toner on the heated material by passing the heated material through the press region.</p>
<p id="p-0507" num="0506">According to the arrangement, the heater is applicable as a fixer, providing a high heat efficiency fixer.</p>
<p id="p-0508" num="0507">An image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention is arranged so that it includes: an image transfer device forming an image of an unfixed toner on the heated material; and the heater described above fixing the unfixed toner on the heated material.</p>
<p id="p-0509" num="0508">The arrangement provides a high heat efficiency image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0510" num="0509">The embodiments and examples described in DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS are for illustrative purposes only and by no means limit the scope of the present invention.
