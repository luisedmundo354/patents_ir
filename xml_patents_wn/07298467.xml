<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS:</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0001">Applicant hereby claims foreign priority benefits under U.S.C. § 119 from French Patent Application No. 05 08959 filed on Sep. 1, 2005, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0002">The present invention relates to determining a horizontal profile line that is defined by walls that are essentially vertical.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0003">The invention is directed more particularly to an application of determining a horizontal profile line for measuring the outline of a work surface in a kitchen or a workshop, but without being restricted to such an application.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0004">When the room in question presents vertical walls of profile that is irregular, either because of a local projection or setback, or because of the presence of a portion that is curved in convex or concave manner, it is no longer possible to make do with measurements performed in ordinary manner of the three or four rectilinear sides in question for the purpose of subsequently cutting out the work surface that is to be put into place. Thus, when there are irregularities of greater or lesser size in the horizontal profile line in question, use is made of templates of card or plywood with the edge of such a template being progressively shaped by hand so as to fit as closely as possible to the horizontal profile line defined by the vertical walls in question.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0005">In order to avoid the need to make temporary templates, proposals have also been made to use an interferometer for measuring the corners of a room with a laser beam, however accuracy is then of the order of five millimeters which is not very satisfactory, while also being very limiting as to the shape of the irregularities concerned.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0006">Finally, proposals have also been made to use three-dimensional measuring arms of the kind that are conventionally used in building cars or airplanes, but although such arms provide relatively satisfactory accuracy, they are extremely expensive, and not always easy to put into place on the site where the measurements are to be made.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0007">The state of the art is also illustrated by various article positioning devices, such as plotters. U.S. Pat. No. 4,412,383, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,583,292 illustrate cable driven plotters. A more sophisticated device is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,918,817 which discloses an apparatus using tapes which are pushed or pulled by associated-drive means responsive to signals from control means, said tapes having sufficient stiffness to resist bending under compressive loads applied by the tape drive means in order to be able to pull or push the article over a work surface.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to devise a method and apparatus for determining a horizontal profile line making it possible to completely avoid making a temporary template out of card or plywood, while also enabling the profile line in question to be determined very accurately, regardless of the types of irregularity in question.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0009">Another object of the invention is to devise a method and apparatus for determining a horizontal profile line that makes use of technical means that are compact and of reasonable cost, while nevertheless guaranteeing accuracy that is very satisfactory, in particular accuracy of the order of one-tenth of a millimeter.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0010">According to the invention, the above-mentioned problem is solved by a method of determining a horizontal profile line defined by walls that are essentially vertical, by using a pointer having two calibrated reference points, the method comprising the following successive steps:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0011">a) placing the pointer horizontally in contact with a point of the profile line to be determined;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0012">b) from an origin point situated substantially in the same horizontal plane as the contact point and the two calibrated reference points of the pointer, successively measuring the length of the segments joining the origin point to each of the reference points, and also measuring the angle between said two segments;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0013">c) deducing by calculation the coordinates of the contact point in said horizontal plane, and storing said coordinates; and</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0014">reiterating steps a), b), c) for a plurality of points on the profile line to be determined, including in said plurality of points at least the angle points situated at the intersections between said essentially vertical walls.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">Since all the measurements are made in a single horizontal plane, it is possible to provide measurement means that are well adapted to this type of application, and in particular means presenting structure that is much less sophisticated than that of articulated arms for making measurements in three dimensions or other robots conventionally used in the automotive or aviation fields.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">Preferably, the length measurements performed in step b) are taken by using a measuring tape pulled from the origin point successively to each of the two reference points of the pointer. In particular, the length measurements are taken by electronic means including a detector fork through which the measuring tape passes, and an encoder which co-operates with said tape.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">Also preferably, the angle measurements performed in step b) are taken by using a laser emitter arranged at the origin point and a target engaged on the reference point in question. In particular, the laser emitter is caused to oscillate in a horizontal plane to strike the target several times, with the angle measurement that is retained being the arithmetic mean of the measurements taken during the oscillation of said laser emitter.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">Also advantageously, the target also serves as control means for triggering the taking of measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019">The invention also provides apparatus for implementing a method of determining a horizontal profile line that presents at least one of the above-mentioned characteristics, said apparatus being remarkable in that it comprises:
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0020">a stationary stand;</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0021">a turret mounted on the stationary stand to turn about a vertical central axis;</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0022">a housing secured to the turret and containing a reel of the measuring tape in such a manner that the tape can be pulled from the reel in an essentially horizontal direction so as to bring its free end up to a reference point of a pointer;</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0023">first electronic means also mounted on the turret and arranged to measure accurately the length of tape that has been pulled out;</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0024">second electronic means arranged to measure the angular displacement of the turret about its axis relative to a reference point of the pointer; and</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0025">third electronic means arranged to receive the successive measurements of lengths and angular displacement performed by the first and second electronic means, and to calculate the coordinates of a contact point of the pointer, and to store said coordinates in order to determine the corresponding horizontal profile line.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">Under such circumstances, advantageously, the first electronic means comprise a detector fork through which the tape passes from the reel, and an encoder having a moving portion over which said tape passed. In particular, the measuring tape presents windows that are uniformly spaced apart, with the passage of the windows being read by the detector fork, the encoder enabling the distance beyond the last window that has passed through said detector fork to be measured, and also serving to measure the travel direction of said tape.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">Also advantageously, the second electronic means comprise a laser emitter secured to an encoder mounted on the stationary stand to turn about the same vertical axis as the turret, being arranged in such a manner that the beam emitted by said laser emitter is substantially horizontal, and a target for being aimed at by the beam emitted by the laser emitter, said target also being arranged to serve firstly for hooking onto the free end of the measuring tape, and secondly for being engaged on a reference point of the pointer in such a manner that said free end is close to being vertically above the center of said reference point.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">Under such circumstances, and advantageously, the apparatus includes means for causing the laser emitter to oscillate in a horizontal plane, pivoting about the vertical central axis on either side of the direction to a vertical slit carried by the target. In particular, the means for causing the laser emitter to oscillate comprise a motor and gearbox unit secured to the turret, having a vertical outlet shaft carrying a cam co-operating with a bracket whereby the laser emitter is mounted on the encoder.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0029">Also preferably, the target includes a remote control member for triggering oscillation of the laser emitter and measurement of distance by the first electronic means, while the target is being held in the hand of the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0030">It is also advantageous to make provision for the target to be arranged in the form of a generally cylindrical handle, said handle being independently powered, with a receiver diode behind the vertical slit at which the laser beam is aimed, and an infrared emitter pointing towards the means for causing the laser emitter to oscillate, together with a control member arranged in the form of a pushbutton located at the top of the handle and a member for hooking onto the free end of the measuring tape, which member is arranged at the bottom portion of said handle. In particular, the member for hooking the free end of the measuring tape is mounted to turn about an axis that lies vertically over the center of the reference point of the pointer when the handle is engaged via an engagement stud on said reference point.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0031">Also preferably, the turret carries on top a display member serving in particular to display the coordinates of the measured reference points.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0032">Finally, and advantageously, the third electronic means associated with calculation and storage are grouped together in a separate unit connected to the first and second electronic means by a wireless communications system.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0033">Other characteristics and advantages of the invention appear more clearly in the light of the following description and the accompanying drawings, relating to a particular embodiment.</p>

These walls are not necessarily rectilinear, as shown for the wall P<b>5</b> which presents a surface that is concave towards the outside. The walls P<b>3</b> and P<b>4</b> form a projection that interferes with determining the horizontal profile line given reference L. It should be understood that the horizontal profile line L is the intersection between a horizontal plane referenced H at the selected height and these various walls P<b>1</b> to P<b>6</b> in question, such that the process of determining the profile line takes place exclusively in a two-dimensional space.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the structure of fittings referenced SM defined by a plurality of uprights and cross-members generally made of wood, serving to constitute spaces for receiving machines and/or storage spaces in the form of cupboards or drawers. The top portion of the structure SM is entirely contained in the horizontal plane H, and this structure SM is subsequently to be covered by a work surface PT that presents, beside the walls against which it presses, a horizontal profile line L that corresponds exactly to the shape defined by the walls P<b>1</b> to P<b>6</b> in question.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048">The horizontal profile line L is determined in accordance with the invention by using a pointer having two calibrated reference points. Specifically, there can be seen such a pointer referenced <b>10</b> in the form of a rectilinear ruler possessing two blinds <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> that are set on the central axis of the pointer, and a point <b>13</b> whereby the pointer <b>10</b> is pressed against a point of the profile line L that is to be determined. The distance between the centers of the blind holes forming the calibrated reference points <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> is known with great accuracy, as is the distance between said centers and the contact points <b>13</b>. The pointer <b>10</b> then serves as an accurately calibrated calibration element for all of the measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0049">Naturally, it would be possible to use pointers of some other shape, e.g. U-shaped or H-shaped, with such pointers presenting more than two calibrated reference points.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0050">To implement the line-determining process of the invention, use is made firstly of the above-mentioned pointer <b>10</b> which is merely placed on the available elements forming part of the structure SM, or on an intermediate plate (not shown) providing stable support. Use is also made of a device that is shown very diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, given reference <b>100</b>, which device is secured by arms <b>14</b> connected to fastening clamps <b>16</b> engaging the structure SM. Naturally, the device <b>100</b> could, in a variant, merely be placed on a support S standing on the ground (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), the important point being that the device is held stationary in stable manner, and at a position corresponding substantially to the level of the horizontal plane H in which the pointer <b>10</b> is located.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">Basically, the device <b>100</b> presents a central axis at a point referenced <b>15</b>, and amongst other components it includes a reel <b>105</b> of measuring tape <b>107</b> presenting an end that is pulled up to the reference points of the pointer <b>10</b>. A member referenced <b>200</b> is used for this purpose, the member <b>200</b> having the free end of the measuring tape <b>107</b> hooked to its base, and being arranged to be suitable for engaging in any of the blind holes in the pointer <b>10</b> that define calibrated reference points, and specifically the points <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0052">As can be seen in the plan view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, once the pointer <b>10</b> has been placed horizontally so as to be in contact with a point on the line L that is to be determined, measurements are made from an origin point referenced <b>15</b> set on the vertical axis of the device <b>100</b> and situated substantially in the horizontal plane H containing the contact point <b>13</b> and the two calibrated reference points <b>11</b> (or A) and <b>12</b> (or B) of the pointer <b>10</b>, of the lengths of the segment from the origin point <b>15</b> to each of the reference points <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, these distances are referenced DA and DB, and they are measured in succession using the measuring tape <b>107</b> that constitutes a portion of the device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0054">The device <b>100</b> also includes a laser emitter <b>145</b> mounted to be capable of turning about the vertical central axis of the device, and point towards the target <b>200</b> which is used as a handle for pulling the free end of the measuring tape <b>107</b>. The target <b>200</b> has a vertical slot with a diode placed behind it that emits a signal when it is struck by the laser beam emitted by the laser emitter <b>145</b>. When the emitted beam referenced <b>150</b> strikes the target at the above-mentioned slot, that corresponds to a certain angle value relative to a reference axis, and the same measurement performed when the target is placed on the second calibrated reference points enables another angular position to be determined. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the angles as measured in this way are referenced aA and aB, thus making it possible immediately to determine the angle formed by the two segments joining the origin point <b>15</b> to each of the reference points <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0055">It is then possible to calculate the coordinates of the contact point <b>13</b> in the horizontal plane H, and to store those coordinates.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0056">It is then possible to calculate the coordinates of the contact point <b>15</b> in the horizontal plane H, and to store those coordinates.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0057">The process of taking successive measurements of segment lengths and of the angle formed between said segments is then reiterated for a plurality of points along the profile line L that is to be determined. Naturally, the operator takes care to ensure that said plurality of points includes at least the angle points situated at the intersections between the essentially vertical walls in question. Specifically, measurements should be made of the following angle points: A<b>12</b> at the intersection between walls P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>; A<b>23</b> at the intersection between walls P<b>2</b> and P<b>3</b>; A<b>34</b> at the intersection between walls P<b>3</b> and P<b>4</b>; A<b>45</b> at the intersection between walls P<b>4</b> and P<b>5</b>; and A<b>56</b> at the intersection between walls P<b>5</b> and P<b>6</b>. In addition to the above-mentioned angle points A<b>12</b>, A<b>23</b>, A<b>34</b>, A<b>45</b>, and A<b>56</b>, care will naturally also be taken to take intermediate measurements wherever the profile appears not to be perfectly rectilinear, and in particular when the profile is curvilinear as shown between the points A<b>45</b> and A<b>56</b>. By making a plurality of measurements along this curved portion of the line L, it is possible to copy the curve in question accurately, and thus to reconstitute a complete profile.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0058">The length measurements taken during the process of determining the profile are made by using the measuring tape <b>107</b> pulled from the origin point <b>15</b> successively to each of the reference points <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> of the pointer <b>10</b>. Naturally, it would be possible for the length of tape that is pulled to be examined visually, but it is highly preferable to provide an automatic process for taking the measurements, by using electronic means having a detector fork through which the measuring tape <b>107</b> passes and an encoder that co-operates with said tape. The electronic means are described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0059">Similarly, the angle measurements could be made visually by the operator using means analogous to a protractor, but naturally it is preferable to use electronic means for taking these angle measurements automatically, and in particular the laser emitter <b>145</b> that is arranged at the origin point <b>15</b> and that co-operates with the target <b>200</b> engaged on the reference point <b>11</b> or <b>12</b> in question. As described below, it is advantageous to make provision for the laser emitter <b>145</b> to pivot back and forth in a horizontal plane in order to strike the target <b>200</b> several times, with the angle measurement that is retained then being the arithmetic mean of the measurements performed on each oscillation of said laser emitter. Good accuracy is thus achieved by taking a plurality of complementary measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0060">As shown diagrammatically, there is preferably also a button at the top of the handle-forming target <b>200</b>, which button, referenced <b>240</b>, constitutes control means enabling the taking of measurements to be triggered, without it being necessary to act directly on the device <b>100</b> carrying the laser emitter <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0061">There follows a description in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 8</figref> of the structure of the determination device <b>100</b> that is described very succinctly above.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0062">The device <b>100</b> stands on a machine support S which is either secured to the structure SM or else placed on a local support as mentioned above. The device <b>100</b> has a stationary stand <b>101</b> surmounted by a turret <b>104</b> that is mounted on said stationary stand to turn about a vertical central axis referenced X<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0063">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it can be seen that the entire device above the stationary stand <b>101</b> is housed in a cover forming a housing <b>102</b> that protects all of its components against dust and impacts. Specifically, since the device is entirely self-sufficient in terms of energy, a battery <b>103</b> is included on the housing <b>102</b> so as to avoid the pointless presence of connection wires. The turret <b>104</b> is mounted to turn on the stationary stand <b>101</b> via a ball bearing <b>117</b> which is visible in the section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The assembly is held by a plate <b>118</b> screwed onto the stationary stand <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0064">The turret <b>104</b> presents an essentially vertical plate <b>104</b>.<b>1</b> having mounted thereon a housing <b>106</b> containing a measuring tape reel <b>105</b> from which the tape <b>107</b> can be pulled in an essentially horizontal direction D so as to bring its free end up to one of the reference points of the above-mentioned pointer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0065">In this example the measuring tape <b>107</b> presents a plurality of uniformly spaced-apart windows <b>108</b>, e.g. of rectangular shape and obtained by being punched directly in the tape. The distance between the centers of the windows is accurately guaranteed and there is no accumulation of position error.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0066">The tape <b>107</b> passes through a detector force <b>140</b> disposed directly at the outlet from the housing <b>106</b> containing the reel <b>105</b>. As can be seen more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a bracket <b>116</b> is mounted on the plate <b>104</b>.<b>1</b> and supports the above-mentioned fork <b>140</b> which is constituted both by an emitter <b>141</b> having power supply wires referenced <b>143</b>, and by a receiver <b>142</b> having power supply wires referenced <b>144</b>. The passage of the uniformly spaced windows <b>108</b> in the tape <b>107</b> can then be read by the detector fork <b>140</b>, which can thus count the number of windows <b>108</b> that have gone through since the tape <b>107</b> started to be pulled out. For example, pairs of adjacent windows <b>108</b> may be spaced apart at an interval of 25 millimeters (mm).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0067">Nevertheless, it is appropriate to add to the above-described means firstly in order to refine measurement along the segment between the last two windows <b>108</b> in question, and also to determine the direction in which the tape is traveling since the tape can either be pulled out in the direction D or on the contrary can travel in the opposite direction back onto the reel.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0068">This is achieved by using a encoder <b>125</b> in the form of a wheel <b>126</b> mounted to turn about the central axis X<b>3</b> of the encoder, which axis is horizontal. A bar <b>139</b> secured to the turret <b>104</b> is fitted with a presser wheel <b>127</b> overlying the encoder wheel <b>126</b> leaving a gap that is just wide enough to allow the tape <b>107</b> to pass between them. The encoder wheel <b>126</b> is preferably rubber-coated on its periphery in order to prevent any unwanted slip that would falsify measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0069">The encoder <b>125</b> can then measure the distance beyond the last window <b>108</b> to have passed through the detector fork <b>140</b>, and can also be used to assess the travel direction of the tape <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0070">The tape <b>107</b> can thus be pulled in the direction D, passing through a guide plate <b>136</b> fitted with horizontal spindle rollers <b>137</b> and vertical spindle rollers <b>138</b> defining a rectangular through window. The tape <b>107</b> also passes through a window <b>111</b> formed in a bracket <b>140</b>.<b>3</b> forming part of the turret <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0071">The above-mentioned members thus enable the lengths of the segments joining the origin points set on the vertical central axis X<b>0</b> to each of the two calibrated reference points <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> of the pointer <b>10</b>. The above-mentioned first electronic means, essentially constituted by the encoder <b>125</b> and the detector fork <b>140</b>, make it easy to obtain measurement accuracy of the order of one-tenth of a millimeter.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0072">The device <b>100</b> also has a laser emitter <b>145</b> that is mounted on an encoder <b>120</b>, itself mounted on the stationary stand <b>101</b> so as to turn about the same vertical axis X<b>0</b> as the turret <b>104</b>, and being arranged in such a manner that the beam <b>150</b> emitted by said laser emitter is essentially horizontal.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0073">Specifically, a stationary shaft <b>119</b> is provided that is rigidly secured to the stationary stand <b>101</b>, being set on the central axis X<b>0</b>, which stationary shaft has arranged thereon an encoder <b>120</b> with a bottom portion <b>121</b> that is secured to the stationary shaft <b>119</b>, and a top portion <b>122</b> that is movably mounted to turn about said central axis <b>119</b> via ball bearings <b>123</b>. A bracket <b>124</b> is placed on the moving portion <b>122</b> of the encoder <b>120</b> via a bottom branch <b>124</b>.<b>1</b>, and has a top branch <b>124</b>.<b>2</b> carrying the laser emitter <b>145</b> which is held in position by a tab <b>147</b>. The laser emitter <b>145</b> is powered by an associated cable <b>146</b> which is connected to control means of the device, preferably via wireless communication means, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0074">As mentioned above, the laser beam <b>150</b> is directed towards the target <b>200</b> once it is in position on one of the reference points <b>11</b> or <b>12</b> of the pointer <b>10</b> so as to strike a diode that is arranged in said target behind a narrow vertical slit. Although it might be satisfactory to make use of the signal that is given at the instant when the laser beam <b>150</b> strikes the corresponding diode, even better accuracy can be obtained by taking a plurality of measurements, and for this purpose it is advantageous to be able to cause the laser emitter <b>145</b> to oscillate in a horizontal plane, pivoting about the vertical central axis X<b>0</b> on either side of the direction to the above-mentioned vertical slit carried by the target <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0075">The moving equipment constituted by the top portion <b>122</b> of the encoder <b>120</b>, the support bracket <b>124</b>, and the laser emitter <b>145</b> can be pivoted about the central vertical axis X<b>0</b>. In order to cause this moving equipment to oscillate about the central axis X<b>0</b>, a motor and gearbox unit <b>128</b> is provided that is secured to a plate <b>140</b>.<b>4</b> forming part of the turret <b>104</b> in such a manner that its central axis X<b>4</b> is vertical. The power supply cable to the motor and gearbox unit <b>128</b> is referenced <b>129</b> and the unit is controlled electrically. The output shaft from the unit <b>128</b> is referenced <b>130</b>, and this shaft carries a cam <b>131</b> which is shown as being in the form of a substantially square cam wheel. Furthermore, a bar <b>157</b> is secured to the middle branch of the U-shaped bracket <b>124</b>, which bar <b>157</b> extends in a horizontal direction having a free end that is kept in contact with the cam <b>131</b> by a resilient belt <b>133</b> passing over a finger <b>132</b> on said bar and over a bracket <b>135</b> secured to the fastening plate <b>104</b>.<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0076">As can easily be understood, when the motor unit <b>128</b> is activated, rotation of the cam <b>131</b> causes the bracket <b>124</b> to oscillate and consequently causes the laser <b>145</b> it carries to oscillate on either side of a middle position.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0077">In practice, it is advantageous to make provision for one or two go-and-return cycles, constituting a process of taking four measurements in succession, with the measurement that is finally taken into account then being the arithmetic mean of the four measurements taken. This implements a particular characteristic of the invention whereby the laser emitter <b>145</b> is caused to oscillate in a horizontal plane in order to strike the target <b>200</b> several times, with the angle of measurement finally taken into account being the arithmetic mean of the measurements taken while the laser emitter is oscillating.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0078">There can also be seen a display member <b>115</b> at the top of the bracket <b>140</b>.<b>3</b> serving in particular to display the coordinates as measured of the reference points.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0079">Specifically, remote control means are provided so as to minimize as much as possible the presence of cumbersome wires. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there can be seen an infrared receiver diode <b>114</b> which is struck by a beam <b>250</b> passing through a window <b>113</b> formed in the bracket <b>104</b>.<b>3</b>, which beam <b>250</b> is emitted from the target <b>200</b>, as described below. The above-mentioned window <b>113</b> directly overlies a window <b>112</b> through which the laser beam <b>150</b> emitted by the laser emitter <b>145</b> passes.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows more clearly the particular structure of the target <b>200</b> that is aimed at by the beam emitted by the laser emitter <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0081">The target <b>200</b> thus comprises an outer case <b>201</b> of essentially cylindrical shape that can be manipulated like the handle of a piece of equipment. The target <b>200</b> is thus organized in the form of an independent handle presenting a bottom collar <b>202</b> for pressing against the pointer <b>10</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there can be seen an engagement stud <b>220</b>, whereby the handle <b>201</b> is engaged on one or the other of the reference points <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> of the pointer <b>10</b>. To prevent any interfering forces acting while the handle is being moved, the stud is mounted via a ball bearing <b>204</b>. The central body <b>203</b> that is housed inside the handle-forming case <b>201</b> presents an internal housing <b>205</b> for receiving the free end <b>109</b> of the measuring tape <b>107</b>, and more particularly for hooking onto a plate <b>110</b> rigidly secured to said end <b>109</b>. An axial peg <b>206</b> is provided that is engaged in a hole <b>110</b>.<b>1</b> of the plate <b>110</b>, thereby hooking onto the free end of the tape <b>107</b>. To avoid any untimely release of the free end, a spring blade <b>207</b> is also provided that keeps it in position on the axial peg <b>206</b>. If it is subsequently desired to separate the free end of the tape <b>107</b>, it suffices to lift the raised external portion of the spring blade <b>207</b> slightly in order to separate the plate <b>110</b> from the axial peg <b>206</b>. The axial peg <b>206</b> is set on a vertical axis X<b>1</b> which is accurately in alignment with the central axis of the blind hole associated with the reference point <b>11</b> or <b>12</b>, because the engagement stud <b>220</b> is of frustoconical shape. It is thus the distance between the vertical axes X<b>0</b> and X<b>1</b> that is accurately measured by the above-mentioned electronic means.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0082">To measure angles, a slit plate <b>208</b> is provided that has a narrow vertical slit <b>208</b>.<b>1</b> of width of the order of a few tenths of a millimeter. Behind the slit <b>208</b>.<b>1</b>, there is arranged a receiver diode <b>209</b> that is set on the above-mentioned axis X<b>1</b>. Each time the laser beam <b>150</b> strikes the diode <b>209</b> by passing through the slit <b>208</b>.<b>1</b>, a signal is emitted to trigger measurement of the corresponding angle.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0083">Specifically, the handle is independent, i.e. it contains its own electrical power supply battery referenced <b>210</b>. Furthermore, the handle carries a top control button <b>240</b> that is positioned so as to be easily pressed by the operator's thumb. Above the window <b>208</b> presenting the slit <b>208</b>.<b>1</b>, there is also provided an infrared emitter <b>211</b> arranged to emit a horizontal beam <b>250</b> that strikes the above-mentioned receiver diode <b>114</b>. The infrared emitter <b>211</b> thus points towards the means for causing the laser emitter <b>145</b> to oscillate.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0084">By pressing on the pushbutton <b>240</b>, the operator triggers infrared emission from the emitter <b>211</b>, and consequently triggers both the recording of the measurements corresponding to the reference point in question, and also activation of the motor unit for causing the laser emitter <b>145</b> to oscillate in a horizontal plane so as to obtain the desired angle measurement as well. When the laser beam <b>150</b> emitted by the emitter <b>145</b> activates the diode <b>209</b> carried by the target <b>200</b>, the infrared emitter <b>211</b> sends a signal for making the corresponding recording, thus making it possible to obtain not only a measurement that is very accurate, but also to determine the direction of rotation with a pip of a few milliseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> show the target <b>200</b> being put into position, pulling the hooked end of the measuring tape until the target handle has its engagement stud <b>220</b> engaged in one of the calibrated points <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> of the pointer <b>10</b>. When the target <b>200</b> is engaged on one of the reference points <b>11</b> or <b>12</b>, the axis X<b>1</b> of the target coincides with the axis X<b>11</b> or X<b>12</b> of the reference point <b>11</b> or <b>12</b> in question.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0086">The target handle <b>200</b> can be manipulated quickly and easily, and because the member <b>206</b> for hooking the free end of the tape <b>107</b> can turn about the axis X<b>1</b>, no disturbing force interferes with the pulled tape being rectilinear in shape. It is thus guaranteed that the measurements taken are completely reliable both in terms of length and in terms of angular displacement as recorded by the above-mentioned electronic means.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0087">Once measurements have been taken at both reference points <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, it suffices for the operator to change the position of the pointer <b>10</b> by bringing its end <b>13</b> up to another point to be identified, and take new measurements in the same manner.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0088">The electronic means associated with calculating and storing the measured data are preferably grouped together in a separate unit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a portable computer <b>300</b> constituting such a separate unit, with an antenna <b>301</b> that provides a connection with the electronic means <b>125</b>, <b>140</b> associated with measuring the length of the pulled-out tape, and with the means <b>120</b>, <b>145</b>, <b>200</b> associated with measuring the angular displacement of the turret <b>104</b> about its axis X<b>0</b>, and this is achieved by a wireless communications system. The screen <b>302</b> on the microcomputer <b>300</b> also enables the operator to see the profile L as reconstituted in this way from the various measurements that are taken.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0089">A technique is thus provided for determining a horizontal profile line that is both simple and inexpensive to implement, while being capable of accommodating any type of geometrical irregularity resulting from the specific arrangement of the essentially vertical walls in question.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0090">The data set constituted by the coordinates of the points as determined in this way constituting the horizontal profile line L, i.e. coordinates in the horizontal plane H in which all of the points of said horizontal profile line are situated, constitutes a data set capable of being transmitted subsequently to a numerically-controlled machine tool which will then physically machine a solid board so that its outline corresponds exactly to the horizontal profile line as determined in this way.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0091">The invention is not restricted to the embodiments described above, but on the contrary covers any variant using equivalent means to reproduce the essential characteristics set out above.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0092">For example, in a variant, the above-described device could be used with a different sensor that is U-shaped, having two contact points (the two free ends) and only one calibrated reference point, thus enabling the points of a wall whose profile remains generally close to a rectilinear direction to be measured more quickly. The rectilinear direction in the horizontal plane is then determined by being measured at two spaced-apart points, with the intermediate points between the spaced-apart points being determined by digitizing. Nevertheless, that technique for determining the profile is a little less accurate than when using two calibrated reference points as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0093">While the present invention has been illustrated and described with respect to a particular embodiment thereof, it should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that various modifications to this invention may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
