<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a radar system technology, and particularly to an apparatus and a method for instantly automatic detecting clutter blocks and an interference source and for dynamically establishing a clutter map.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a radar system, filtering and restraining clutter and electronic countermeasures are two subjects. In a scanning space of radar, no matter desired target (e.g. planes) or undesired target (e.g. mountain, cloud, rain etc.) reflects EM wave of radar system and generates echo signal received by an antenna of the radar system. So-called clutter is the echo signal generated by the undesired object. The interference of clutter affects probability for detecting desired target for a radar system, and results the false alarm rate of erroneous target increasing. To establish a clutter map is a method for effectively filtering and restraining the clutter. The said clutter map is a clutter data recorder in scanning area of a radar system. That is, recording intensity of clutter generated by an object in a scanning area of a radar system to establish a clutter intensity space map in the scanning area. The clutter map is used to generate a detection threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, the area established by clutter map is all scanning area of a radar system or partial stationary area. In fact, a valid area of a clutter map is a range generating clutter affecting a radar system for detecting target, so the clutter map only establishes the area where a clutter exits. Furthermore, what is called interference map records an area with an object generating clutter in a scanning area of a radar system. In other words, the interference map is a spatial map recording a distribution of a plurality of clutter blocks in the scanning of the radar system. It is using a clutter map memory with limited capacitance effectively and flexibly by establishing clutter map only for an area indicated a clutter block according to an interference map. In addition, for the area indicated clutter block according to the interference map, the radar selects different searching mode, like moving target indication (MTI), to filter clutter.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and a method for automatically detecting a clutter block capable of deciding where there is an object producing clutter in the scanning area of the radar system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and a method for instantly detecting an interference source capable of deciding whether an interference source interfering the operation of the radar system exists.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and a method capable of producing a clutter threshold value for detecting a target.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides an apparatus for instantly automatic detecting clutter blocks and an interference source and for dynamically establishing a clutter map, which is suitable for a radar system and the apparatus provided by the present invention includes at least:</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">1. A clutter block detecting module receiving a plurality of range cell data. Wherein, each range cell data represents echo intensity at a different distance position of a radar beam area with an elevation and an azimuth in the analyzing space of the radar system. Besides, the clutter block detecting module would divide a radar beam area into a plurality of detecting areas according to a predetermined distance. When the accumulated value of a range cell data in a detecting area is larger than a clutter block level, the detecting area is defined as a clutter block by the clutter block detecting module.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">2. An interference source detecting module. The interference source detecting module also receives the above-described range cell data and accumulates the range cell data in each radar beam area. The accumulated value is compared with an interference source reference level to decide whether an interference source exists.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">3. A clutter map establishing module generates a plurality of clutter map cells according to the range cell data. Wherein, the clutter map cells on different beam area store in three memory blocks sequentially. When one of the clutter map cells is extracted, two clutter map cells on adjacent beam area are also extracted. The largest value among the three clutter map cells is regarded as a clutter threshold value to detect the target.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for instantly detecting clutter blocks, which is suitable for a radar system too. The method for instantly detecting clutter blocks provided by the present invention includes the following steps. First, a plurality of range cell data is received, wherein each range cell data represents echo intensity at a different distance position of a radar beam area with an elevation and an azimuth in the detection space of the radar system. Next, each radar beam area is divided into a plurality of detecting areas and each detecting area includes data of a preset number of range cells. Afterwards, all range cell data of each detecting area are accumulated to obtain a corresponding accumulated value. Further, the accumulated value of each detecting area is compared with a clutter block level to produce a comparison result. Finally, in the present invention, the comparison result is used for deciding which detecting area is regarded as a clutter block. The distribution of the clutter blocks is an interference map.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">On the other hand, the method for instantly detecting an interference source provided by the present invention is also suitable for a radar system. According to the method, the following steps are included. First, a plurality of the abovementioned range cell data is received. Afterwards, all range cell data of each radar beam area are accumulated to obtain a corresponding accumulated value.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Prior to illustrating the present invention, a brief introduction of the detecting scheme for a normal radar system is provided for those skilled in the art to fully understand the novelty and spirit of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In general, a radar system occupies a detection space; when an object intrudes into the detection space, the object will be sensed by the radar system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic cubic drawing of a detection space of a radar system. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a radar system <b>100</b> has a detection space <b>110</b>, which is encompassed by scanning of the electromagnetic wave with an effective sensing range emitted by the radar system <b>100</b>. When an airplane, for example, enters into the detection space <b>110</b>, the airplane will reflect the electromagnetic wave emitted by the radar system <b>100</b> with an echo signal. The radar system <b>100</b> will decide whether an object exists within the detection space <b>110</b> in accordance with the echo signal intensity, and decide the distance between the target and radar system <b>100</b> according to the time difference during the time of radiating EM waves to the time of radar system <b>100</b> receiving the echo signal.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is known to those skilled in the art that a radar system scans the detection space thereof not in one-time manner, but uses the radar system as center and divides the detection space into a plurality beam spaces. The radar system orients toward some orientation or some elevation scanning and positioning space coordinate of the target by known scan orientation and calculated distance of target. The main functions of the radar system are detecting target and marking the space coordinate of the target.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when radar system <b>100</b> scans the detection space <b>110</b>, the radar system <b>100</b> divides the detection space <b>110</b> into different elevation layer, for example φ<b>1</b>, φ<b>2</b>, and φ<sub>m</sub>, according to beam angle of vertical orientation of EM waves generated by the radar system <b>100</b>. Noticeably, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an elevation increment, for example, the difference between φ<sub>2 </sub>and φ<sub>1 </sub>is very big for showing the purpose in exaggeration manner so those skilled in the art can understand it.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The definition of so-called “range cell” must be given first. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is the localized top view of the detection space in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it shows one of different elevation layers, which feature in different elevation φ<sub>1</sub>, φ<sub>2 </sub>and φ<sub>m</sub>. Each elevation layer in a detection space can be divided into a plurality of beam area, for example Y<sub>n</sub>, according to an azimuth θ of horizontal orientation of EM wave generated by a radar, where n is a positive integer indicating the n-th radar beam area.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Each radar beam area is further divided into a plurality of range cells according to a predetermined radar range resolution d. The data contained by each range cell is just the echo intensity at the corresponding position.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of an apparatus for instantly automatic detecting clutter blocks and an interference source for dynamically establishing a clutter map according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an apparatus <b>300</b> provided by the present invention includes a clutter block detecting module <b>302</b>, an interference source detecting module <b>304</b> and a clutter map establishing module <b>306</b>, all of which are able to receive a plurality of range cell data R(i).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The clutter block detecting module <b>302</b> would divide all range cells of each radar beam area into a plurality of detecting areas according to a predetermined space as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, every N range cells are regarded as a detecting area, where N is a positive integer. Afterwards, the clutter block detecting module <b>302</b> accumulates all range cell data of each detecting area. Further, the accumulated value is compared with a clutter block level. If the accumulated value of any detecting area is larger than the clutter block level, the detecting area is defined as a clutter block.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a circuit block diagram of a clutter block detecting module according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the clutter block detecting module includes an accumulated unit <b>401</b> which receives range cell data R(i) through the input of the clutter block detecting module. The accumulated unit <b>401</b> accumulates every N pieces of the range cell data R(i). Then the accumulated value is outputted to a comparator <b>403</b>, where the accumulated value from the accumulated unit <b>401</b> is compared with a clutter block level C<b>1</b>. If the output from the accumulated unit <b>401</b> is larger than the clutter block level C<b>1</b>, the comparator <b>403</b> will produce a logic-1 output. Contrarily, the comparator <b>403</b> will produce a logic-0 output.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The accumulated unit <b>401</b> can include an AND gate circuit <b>411</b>, an adder <b>413</b> and a register <b>415</b>. Wherein, an input end of the AND gate circuit <b>411</b> is coupled to a clearance signal CL<b>1</b>, while another input end receives the output from the accumulated unit <b>401</b>. The adder <b>413</b> serves for receiving the range cell data R(i) and the output from the AND gate circuit <b>411</b>, adding the above-mentioned data and outputting the added result to the register <b>415</b>. If the output value of the register <b>415</b> is larger than clutter block level, the comparator <b>403</b> outputs logic-1 to define the detecting area being a clutter block. Oppositely, the comparator <b>403</b> outputs logic-0 to define the detection area being a non-clutter block.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The clutter block detecting module <b>302</b> can further include a memory device <b>405</b> and a counter <b>407</b>. In the embodiment, the memory device <b>405</b> can be a memory and is used for storing the output from the comparator <b>403</b>. Furthermore, the counter <b>407</b> receives the output of the comparator <b>403</b> through a AND gate <b>409</b> to count the times of logic-1 generated by comparator <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the embodiment, both the memory <b>405</b> and the counter <b>407</b> are comprised with an enabling end ‘enable’, respectively. Wherein, the enabling end of the memory <b>405</b> is coupled to an enabling signal EN<b>1</b>, while the enabling end of the counter <b>407</b> is coupled to the output end of the AND gate circuit <b>409</b>. One of input ends of the AND gate circuit <b>409</b> is coupled to the output of the comparator <b>403</b>, while another input end thereof is coupled to the enabling signal EN<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a timing chart corresponding to the clutter block detecting module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, at a time point t<b>0</b> the clearance signal CL<b>1</b> is logic-0, so that the AND gate circuit <b>411</b> is able to produce a zero output to the adder <b>413</b>. Meanwhile, the first range cell data R(<b>1</b>) is sent to the adder <b>413</b>. The adder <b>413</b> adds the range cell data R(<b>1</b>) to the output from the AND gate circuit <b>411</b>, followed by sending the result to the register <b>415</b>. Since after the first range data R(<b>1</b>) is sent to the register <b>415</b>, the clearance signal CL<b>1</b> is transited to logic-1, so that the following range cell data R(i) sent to the register <b>415</b> are continuously accumulated to the sum of the range cell data R(i) previously arrived at the adder <b>413</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Once N pieces of range cell data R(i) are accumulated by the adder <b>413</b>, i.e. all range cell data R(i) of a detecting area are accumulated, the clearance signal CL<b>1</b> would be transited to logic-0 again at time point t<b>1</b> and the enabling signal EN<b>1</b> is transited to a high-level, so that the memory <b>405</b> are enabled and the output result of the comparator <b>403</b> is written in memory <b>405</b>. On the other side, once the output result of the comparator is logic-1, it is indicating clutter block and the output of the counter <b>407</b> adding 1 at enabling signal EN<b>1</b> being high level. Meanwhile the number of clutter block increases 1. At this time, another n pieces of range cell data R(i) are sent to the adder <b>413</b> together with repeating the above-described operations of the accumulated unit <b>401</b>. According to the counting value of the counter <b>407</b>, the capacity of the clutter map memory to store the clutter map marked a clutter block area is determined. (The counter value of the counter <b>407</b> is used for determining the capacity of the clutter map memory for constructing the clutter map marked with clutter blocks.)</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a flowchart of a method for instantly detecting clutter blocks according to an embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a interference diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention, wherein the method in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is suitable, but not limited to, for the above-described clutter block detecting module <b>302</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, first at step S<b>601</b>, a plurality of range cell data is received. Next at step S<b>603</b>, all received range cells are divided into a plurality of detecting areas as the block areas in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> according to a predetermined space, wherein the detecting areas are equivalent to the above-described detecting areas and the predetermined space in the embodiment is, for example, 500 meters or one kilometer.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">After the range cells are divided into a plurality of detecting areas, at step S<b>605</b>, all range cell data of every detecting area are accumulated to obtain a corresponding accumulated value. Further, at S<b>611</b>, based on the accumulated value, the processed detecting area can be identified whether it is a clutter block or not.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It is assumed that a terrain object or cloudy and raining area exists at the position where the processed detecting area locates, the electromagnetic wave emitted by the radar system would be reflected by the terrain object and an echo signal, i.e. the content of the range cell, is produced. After the radar system receives the echo signal, through the above-described steps from S<b>601</b> to S<b>605</b>, an accumulated value is obtained. Furthermore, at step S<b>611</b>, the accumulated value is compared with a clutter block level. In general, a terrain object or a cloudy and raining area would produce a stronger echo data, thus the above-described accumulated value is always larger than the clutter block level. Finally, at step S<b>613</b>, it is decided that outputting logic-1 data to define the detecting area is a clutter block.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, after the electromagnetic wave emitted by the radar system reflected by an object <b>61</b>, the echo signal that is larger than the clutter threshold value is generated. Meanwhile, the present invention decides the detecting areas around the object <b>61</b> are clutter blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Contrarily, if the above-mentioned accumulated value is less than the clutter threshold value, it is concluded that the generated clutter strength is not strong enough to affect the target detection at the detecting area position. So outputting logic-0 data to define the detecting area is not a clutter block (e.g. the blank blocks in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) as the described in the step S<b>615</b>. Then, as the described in step S<b>617</b>, the determined result that is the logic-1 or logic-0 data is saved in a memory. By means of the above-described method, it is able to record the position of the clutter blocks to the detection space of the radar system.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Continuing to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in response to the electronic wars that are concerned by many countries today, various anti-radar techniques are developed. One of the techniques employs an interference source to emit an interference signal for confusing the detection of the radar system. Therefore, an interference source detecting module <b>304</b> of the present invention is provided to decide whether an interference source exists at all directions of radar beam areas or not.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a circuit block diagram of an interference source detecting module according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, similarly to the above-described clutter block detecting module <b>302</b>, the interference source detecting module <b>304</b> also includes an accumulated unit <b>701</b>, a comparator <b>703</b> and a memory device <b>705</b>. Wherein, the memory device <b>705</b> has an enabling end ‘enable’ for receiving an enabling signal EN<b>2</b>. The couplings of all function blocks are similar to the clutter block detecting module <b>302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and thus the detail is omitted herein for simplicity. A unique point is that the output from the accumulated unit <b>701</b> is compared with an interference source reference level C<b>2</b> by the comparator <b>703</b>. If the output from the accumulated unit <b>701</b> is larger than the interference source reference level C<b>2</b>, the comparator <b>703</b> will produce a logic-1 output; otherwise, a logic-0 output is given by the comparator <b>703</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The accumulated unit <b>701</b> also includes an AND gate circuit <b>711</b>, an adder <b>713</b> and a register <b>715</b>. Wherein, an input end of the AND gate circuit <b>711</b> receives the clearance signal CL<b>2</b> and another input end thereof is coupled to the output from the accumulated unit <b>701</b>. The couplings of the other circuit blocks can refer to the depiction of the accumulated unit <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a timing chart corresponding to the interference source detecting module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, when the first range cell data R(<b>1</b>) is sent to the adder <b>713</b> of the accumulated unit <b>701</b>, the clearance signal CL<b>2</b> is logic-0, which makes the adder <b>713</b> to send the first range cell data R(<b>1</b>) to the register <b>715</b>. Due to a low-level of the enabling signal EN<b>2</b> at the point, the memory device <b>705</b> is disabled. After the first range cell data R(<b>1</b>) passes the register <b>715</b>, the clearance signal CL<b>2</b> is transited to logic-1. In this way, the range cell data input to the adder <b>713</b> are accumulated to the previous sum of the range cell data input to the adder <b>713</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Once all range cell data of a radar beam area are accumulated, the comparator <b>703</b> compares the accumulated value and the interference source reference level. At this time, the enabling signal EN<b>2</b> goes to high resulting the memory <b>705</b> being enabled, and the output result of comparator <b>703</b> is written in memory <b>705</b>. If the accumulated value is larger than the interference source reference level, a logic-1 output is produced by the comparator <b>703</b> to define an interference source existing in the orientation of the beam area. Appositively, a logic-0 output is produced by the comparator <b>703</b> to define no interference source existing in the orientation of the beam area. The energy of echo signal of radar is in inverse proportion with distance quartically, and the interference energy of interference source for the radar is in inverse proportion with distance squarely. If the interference source exists, the energy of echo signal in the search window will be abnormally large. An accumulated value of the energy of the echo signal is used to determine whether the interference source exists or not. Once an interference source is detected, the radar will execute appropriate processing.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flowchart of a method for instantly detecting interference sources according to an embodiment of the present invention, which is suitable, but not limited to, for the interference source detecting module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the method for instantly detecting interference sources provided by the present invention has a first step, as step S<b>901</b>, receiving a plurality of range cell data. Next, as steps S<b>903</b>, all range cell data of the above described each radar beam area are accumulated, respectively, for obtaining the corresponding accumulated values. Further, whether an interference source exists at the direction of each radar beam area can be decided, as step S<b>910</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In more detail, as step S<b>912</b>, after the accumulated values of all radar beam areas are calculated, each accumulated value of all radar beam areas is compared with the above-described interference source reference level to see whether the accumulated value is larger than the reference level. For those radar beam areas where the value are larger than the interference source reference level, a conclusion that an interference source exists at the area direction can be made and outputting logic-1 data, as described in step S<b>914</b>. Otherwise, it is decided that there is no interference source and outputting logic-0 data, as step S<b>918</b>. Finally, as step S<b>920</b>, the determined result is saved in a memory.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> again, the clutter map establishing module <b>306</b> is mainly used for receiving range cell data to generate a clutter threshold value to detect a target.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a circuit block diagram of a clutter map establishing module according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 10</figref>, the above-described clutter map establishing module <b>306</b> can include a range cell collapsing circuit <b>1010</b>, a dynamically updating circuit <b>1020</b>, a memory device <b>1030</b> and a threshold value generating circuit <b>1040</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flowchart of a method for establishing a clutter map according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, for the clutter map establishing module <b>306</b> to generate the clutter threshold value, the range cell collapsing circuit <b>1010</b> receives a plurality of range cell data R(i) first, as described at step S<b>1101</b>. Due to tremendous data of all range cells in the entire detection space, as described at step S<b>1103</b>, a range cell collapsing circuit <b>1010</b> is needed to properly collapse all the received range cell data R(i) into a plurality of range collapsing cells, so that the storing space in the memory device <b>1030</b> can be saved. Next, as described in step S<b>1105</b>, the dynamically updating circuit <b>1020</b> dynamically updates each range collapsing cell and original clutter map cell of the memory device <b>1030</b> at the same position to obtain a new clutter map cell. Then, as illustrated in step S<b>1107</b>, the dynamically updating circuit <b>1020</b> divides each number of radar beam area by 3 to obtain a remainder, and stores the clutter map cells in three memory blocks of a memory space respectively according to the remainder. When the threshold value generating circuit <b>1040</b> generates the clutter threshold value, each clutter map cell is selected from the memory device and the clutter map cells with the corresponding position in the beam areas adjacent to the selected beam area are selected too.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the range cell collapsing scheme in the present invention is to divide all range cells of a radar beam area into a plurality of range collapsing cells, wherein a clutter map collapsing cell (CMCC) includes a first preset number of range cells. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a clutter map collapsing cell includes four range cells, <b>1201</b>, <b>1203</b>, <b>1205</b> and <b>1207</b>. A second preset number of range cells adjacent each clutter map collapsing cell is defined as clutter map spreading cells (CMSCs). Wherein, CMCC□2CMSC. In the embodiment, each CMSC has two range cells; therefore, there are the range cells <b>1211</b> and <b>1213</b> and the range cells <b>1215</b> and <b>1217</b> at both ends, respectively. Each range collapsing cell of the present invention comprises a clutter map collapsing cell plus two adjacent CMSCs.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a diagram showing how the value of each range collapsing cell is decided according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a part of range cell data of a radar beam area, R<b>1</b>˜R<b>20</b>, are illustrated. Wherein, X(<b>0</b>), X(<b>1</b>), X(<b>2</b>) and X(<b>3</b>) represent four range collapsing cells, respectively, while CMCC and CMSC represent clutter map collapsing cell and clutter map spreading cell, respectively. To determine the value of each range collapsing cell in the present invention, all values of all range cells distributed in both CMCC and two CMSCs adjacent to the CMCC are compared with each other and the largest one is chosen as the value of the corresponding range collapsing cell.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For example, to determine the value of range collapsing cell X(<b>0</b>), all values of all range cells distributed in both CMCC and two CMSCs adjacent to the CMCC, i.e. R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, R<b>3</b>, R<b>4</b>, R<b>5</b>, R<b>6</b>, R<b>7</b> and R<b>8</b>, are compared with each other and the largest one is chosen as the value of the range collapsing cell X(<b>0</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Since a CMCC is taken as a basic unit to determine the value of every range collapsing cell, there must be some range cell data within each range collapsing cell, which are compared in duplicate way.

For simplicity, only one set of them is explained hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">One of input ends of the comparator <b>1401</b> receives the range cell data R(i) through the input of the above-described clutter map establishing module <b>306</b>, while another input end thereof is coupled to the output end of the register <b>1413</b>. The comparator <b>1401</b> sends the output signal to the OR gate circuits <b>1405</b>. One of input ends of the OR gate circuits <b>1405</b> is coupled to the output end of the comparator <b>1401</b>, while another input end thereof receives an acquisition signal take<b>1</b>. The unique point of the OR gate circuits <b>1407</b> from the OR gate circuits <b>1405</b> is that the OR gate circuits <b>1407</b> receives a different acquisition signal take<b>2</b>. The multiplexer <b>1409</b> has two input ends (<b>1</b> and <b>0</b>), which are coupled to two input ends of the comparator <b>1401</b>. The selection end ‘select’ of the multiplexer <b>1409</b> receives the output from the OR gate circuit <b>1405</b>, so that the multiplexer <b>1409</b> is able to choose the input end <b>1</b> or <b>0</b> to send the received data to the register <b>1413</b> according to the output from the OR gate circuit <b>1405</b>. The register <b>1413</b> would feedback the output signal from the multiplexer <b>1409</b> to both the comparator <b>1401</b> and the multiplexer <b>1409</b>. Furthermore, the output signal from the multiplexer <b>1409</b> is sent to one input of the multiplexer <b>1417</b> (input end <b>1</b>).</p>

The multiplexer <b>1417</b> has a selection end ‘select’ too for receiving a selection signal SEL<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The second range cell data R(<b>2</b>) is sent to the comparator <b>1401</b>.

If the output from the register <b>1413</b> is larger than the latest input range cell data, the comparator <b>1401</b> will output a logic-0. After the range cell data R(<b>1</b>) passes the OR gate circuit <b>1405</b>, the acquisition signal take<b>1</b> is transited to 0, which makes the output from OR gate circuit <b>1405</b> is just the output of the comparator <b>1401</b>.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">At time point t<b>7</b> the selection signal SEL<b>1</b> is transited to logic-1 and the enabling signal EN<b>3</b> is transited to high-level.
