<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Radio frequency identification (RFID) devices are known and typically utilized to associate information with an object (e.g., a retail product). One challenge associated with RFID devices (e.g., RFID tags, RFID labels, RFID chips, RFID straps, or RFID inlays) is the manufacture and testing of the RFID devices in a cost-efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, a conventional method of testing RFID devices during the manufacturing process involves bi-directional communication with each of the RFID devices at one or more defined frequencies and radio frequency power levels. However, the conventional bi-directional communication typically employs a specialized RFID reader that is expensive and may not be optimized for rapid testing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, because the RFID reader is expensive, the number of RFID readers is typically limited and utilized sparingly to serially test the RFID devices, with each of the RFID devices sequentially positioned into test position or the RFID reader sequentially moved from one RFID device to the next in a designated test area. Thus, the testing process may be limited in terms of the number of RFID devices that can be tested in a cost effective manner.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, any device that incorporates an RFID reader, such as for example a printer that prints on RFID labels, may have a significant increase in price due to the cost of the RFID reader. Consequently, conventional RFID communication techniques may be limited in terms of cost and/or in the number of RFID devices that can be tested. As a result, there is a need for improved communication techniques for RFID devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments of the present invention and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a block diagram of a system <b>100</b>, which illustrates a radio frequency identification (RFID) communication technique in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System <b>100</b> includes an RFID device <b>102</b>, a coupler <b>104</b>, and a transmission line <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">RFID device <b>102</b> may represent any type of RFID device (e.g., an RFID tag, an RFID label, an RFID chip, an RFID strap, or an RFID inlay). For example, RFID device <b>102</b> may include an RFID chip <b>108</b> and an element <b>110</b> (e.g., labeled as elements <b>110</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>110</b>(<b>2</b>)) which, depending upon the type of the RFID device, may represent an antenna or a strap/interposer or other conducting portion of RFID device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Coupler <b>104</b> enables communication with RFID device <b>102</b>, for example, via short-range coupling (e.g., near field coupling techniques) as would be understood by one skilled in the art. In general, an antenna of RFID device <b>102</b> may be viewed as having a near field region and a far field region. The near field region refers to a reactive near field (e.g., approximately R≦λ/2Π) and a radiating near field (e.g., approximately R&lt;2D2/λ), while the far field region refers to a radiating far-field component (e.g., approximately R&gt;2D2/λ), where R is the distance from the antenna and D is the largest dimension of the antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Due to the short-range coupling between coupler <b>104</b> and RFID device <b>102</b>, only RFID device <b>102</b> typically responds to the communication (RF signal), while any other RFID devices in close proximity to RFID device <b>102</b> (e.g., such as other RFID devices on a sheet or a roll of a common carrier web) do not respond to the communication provided for RFID device <b>102</b>. If a neighboring RFID device responds along with RFID device <b>102</b>, RFID device <b>102</b> may be identified based upon its identification code or other data provided in its response.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Alternatively or in addition, coupler <b>104</b> may, for example, communicate to RFID device <b>102</b> through a gap in a metal shield through which the short-range coupling occurs, with the metal shield preventing the other RFID devices near RFID device <b>102</b> from receiving the RF signal provided to RFID device <b>102</b>. Strips of metal to “short” the electric field, dielectric materials to de-tune or change the frequency, and high-permeability materials to interact magnetically and de-tune or change the frequency may also be employed, as would be understood by one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Various conventional short-range coupling techniques are known and may be utilized to provide the RF signal via coupler <b>104</b> to RFID device <b>102</b>, as would be known by one skilled in the art. Additionally, short-range coupling techniques via coupler <b>104</b> to RFID device <b>102</b> may be implemented as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/367,515, filed Feb. 13, 2003, and entitled “RFID Device Tester and Method” and/or as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/882,947, filed Jul. 1, 2004, and entitled “RFID Device Preparation System and Method,” which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, coupler <b>104</b> may represent one or more pairs of couplers (e.g., coupler <b>104</b> or a number of couplers <b>104</b>) to couple via an electric field with RFID device <b>102</b> (e.g., capacitively couple to element <b>110</b> of RFID device <b>102</b>). Alternatively, or in addition, coupler <b>104</b> may represent a coil (e.g., single-turn coil or multi-turn coil) to couple via a magnetic field with RFID device <b>102</b> (e.g., inductively couple to element <b>110</b> of RFID device <b>102</b>). Thus, coupler <b>104</b> may couple to RFID device <b>102</b> via an electric field, a magnetic field, or some combination of electric and magnetic fields (electromagnetic field), with coupler <b>104</b> providing the appropriate structure (e.g., parallel plates, single or multi-turn coils, transmission lines, or other types of structures). Furthermore, the signal frequency provided to RFID device <b>102</b> via coupler <b>104</b> and/or transmission line <b>106</b> may be at a frequency different from the natural resonant frequency of RFID device <b>102</b>, as discussed further in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/367,515 and 10/882,947.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As another example, coupler <b>104</b> may provide short-range coupling by making a direct connection with one or more conducting contact points of RFID device <b>102</b>, as would be understood by one skilled in the art. For example, coupler <b>104</b> may make a direct connection with the antenna, the strap, or chip pads of RFID device <b>102</b>, depending upon the type of RFID device being utilized. Thus, coupler <b>104</b> may provide short-range coupling in the near field via electric and/or magnetic fields or by direct connection with RFID device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Transmission line <b>106</b> (e.g., labeled as transmission line pair <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>106</b>(<b>2</b>)) is employed to couple (e.g., via near field or far field techniques) un-modulated RF energy to RFID device <b>102</b>. For example, an RF transmitter or other RF transmission source may be utilized to provide the un-modulated RF energy of a defined level via transmission line <b>106</b> (e.g., in the near field region) to RFID device <b>102</b>. For example, the double-headed arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrate the coupling or transfer of energy and/or information between transmission line <b>106</b> and RFID device <b>102</b> and between coupler <b>104</b> and RFID device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Alternatively, another type of RF energy delivery method may be employed instead of transmission line <b>106</b> to deliver the un-modulated RF energy to one or more of RFID devices <b>102</b>. For example, RFID device <b>102</b> may be illuminated with an antenna in the far field region to provide the un-modulated RF energy at a sufficient level for RFID device <b>102</b> to function properly.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A communication device (not shown) may communicate with RFID device <b>102</b> via coupler <b>104</b>. For example, the communication device may communicate via coupler <b>104</b> with RFID device <b>102</b> by modulating the un-modulated RF energy provided (e.g., via transmission line <b>106</b>) and receive (e.g., detect) the response, if any, provided by RFID device <b>102</b>. As an example, the communication device may provide an amplitude modulated data sequence via coupler <b>104</b> to the RF energy provided to RFID device <b>102</b> to communicate (e.g., provide commands) to RFID device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a block diagram of a system <b>200</b>, which illustrates an exemplary implementation of an RFID communication system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System <b>200</b> includes RFID device <b>102</b>, coupler <b>104</b>, transmission line <b>106</b>, an RF source <b>202</b>, a controller <b>204</b>, and diodes <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Capacitors <b>206</b> (i.e., capacitors <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>206</b>(<b>4</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) are shown to illustrate an exemplary capacitive coupling affect between transmission line <b>106</b> and RFID device <b>102</b> and between coupler <b>104</b> and RFID device <b>102</b>. Thus, capacitors <b>206</b> are only representative of the capacitive nature of this exemplary implementation and actual physical capacitors would typically not be present.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">RF source <b>202</b> (e.g., an RF transmitter or other known source of RF energy) provides the un-modulated RF energy via transmission line <b>106</b> to RFID device <b>102</b>. Controller <b>204</b> may be implemented as an application specific integrated circuit, a programmable logic device, a computer (e.g., a processor-based system), a microprocessor (e.g., one-time programmable microprocessor), a microcontroller or any other type of circuit or system, which can provide an interface (e.g., a digital or computer interface) and/or one or more functions (e.g., modulation and/or detection) as described further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Alternatively, controller <b>204</b> may represent an interface (e.g., a digital or computer interface) that is controlled by an appropriate device (e.g., a computer or other device as described similarly for controller <b>204</b> herein). Consequently, for example, a number of interfaces may be implemented and controlled by a single device to communicate simultaneously or selectively with a number of RFID devices <b>102</b>. Thus, the RFID devices <b>102</b> may be provided with RF energy by RF source <b>202</b>, with the RFID devices <b>102</b> communicating with corresponding controllers <b>204</b> (e.g., interfaces) that are linked to the single device (e.g., as described further in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Controller <b>204</b> communicates with RFID device <b>102</b> via coupler <b>104</b> and employs diodes <b>208</b>, which are separately referenced as diodes <b>208</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>208</b>(<b>2</b>), to perform various functions. For example, by having controller <b>204</b> determine a voltage level on one or more of its input/output ports <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> (labeled I/O <b>1</b> and I/O <b>2</b>, respectively), controller <b>204</b> may modulate the un-modulated RF energy provided by RF source <b>202</b> or detect a signal provided by RFID device <b>102</b>. A capacitor <b>210</b> may optionally be coupled across I/O ports <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> of controller <b>204</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (e.g., to reduce noise).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As an example, controller <b>204</b> may control voltage levels on I/O ports <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> to drive a current through diodes <b>208</b>, which reduces their impedance (e.g., close to a short circuit at RF frequencies). Because controller <b>204</b> is closely coupled to RFID device <b>102</b> via coupler <b>104</b> and when the impedance of diodes <b>208</b> is reduced, the amplitude of the un-modulated RF energy provided by RF source <b>202</b> to RFID device <b>102</b> is reduced. Therefore, if a data sequence is provided (e.g., a command) by controller <b>204</b> to RFID device <b>102</b> by varying the voltage level at I/O port <b>212</b> and/or I/O port <b>214</b>, then RFID device <b>102</b> may be provided with an amplitude modulated RF signal, even though controller <b>204</b> has only provided a relatively low frequency data signal.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As a specific implementation example, RF source <b>202</b> provides a continuous RF signal via transmission line <b>106</b> to RFID device <b>102</b>. Controller <b>204</b> modulates the RF signal received by RF device <b>102</b> (from RF source <b>202</b>) with a data sequence by setting I/O port <b>212</b> to a logical low (i.e., a “0” or low voltage level) and switching I/O port <b>214</b> between the logical low and a logical high (i.e., a “1” or a high voltage level) as appropriate for the desired data sequence (i.e., command). Thus, the RF signal provided to RFID device <b>102</b> via coupling is modulated by controlling the state of diodes <b>208</b> (e.g., alternately driving current through diodes <b>208</b> to provide a low RF impedance, which reduces via coupling the RF signal provided to RFID device <b>102</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As another example, controller <b>204</b> may control voltage levels on I/O ports <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> and employ diodes <b>208</b> to detect the response from RFID device <b>102</b>. For example, controller <b>204</b> via diodes <b>208</b> and coupler <b>104</b> detects the RF signal coupled via RFID device <b>102</b> from RF source <b>202</b> via transmission line <b>106</b>. When RFID device <b>102</b> modulates its impedance (e.g., by shorting a transistor across an RF input) to transmit a signal, such as in response to a command, the change in the coupled power and the detected voltage is sensed by controller <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As a specific implementation example, RF source <b>202</b> provides a continuous RF signal via transmission line <b>106</b> to RFID device <b>102</b>. Controller <b>204</b> detects the modulation provided by RFID device <b>102</b> (e.g., in response to a command as described above) by setting I/O port <b>212</b> to a logical low and setting I/O port <b>214</b> as an input port to monitor its state. For example, when the input impedance of RFID device <b>102</b> is in its normal state, a high voltage will be detected at I/O port <b>214</b>. When RFID device <b>102</b> changes from its normal state (e.g., by shorting the RF input of its antenna), a low voltage will be detected at I/O port <b>214</b> by controller <b>204</b>. Thus, information (e.g., a response) provided by RFID device <b>102</b> may be received (e.g., detected) by controller <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In general, in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention, a test interface for one or more RFID devices is disclosed. For example, the test interface technique provides a method of interfacing with one or more RFID devices, without the need to generate a separate RF signal to communicate with each RFID device. The test interface technique may be applied to assembly line testing, to high-speed RFID device testing during the manufacturing process, and may be implemented in various devices (e.g., a printer for RFID labels) that may need to communicate with the RFID devices.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a method is disclosed of communicating with RFID devices that receive an un-modulated RF signal from a common source. A controller (e.g., a microcontroller) drives one or more diodes linked to a coupler to module the un-modulated RF signal and detect the modulation from the RFID device. The RF signal may be provided from a common RF source, such as a transmission line or a far field antenna, with the controllers (or interfaces controlled by the controller) placed at intervals (depending upon the application or requirements) to communicate with the corresponding RFID devices.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">By separating the RF source for the RFID devices from the interface that modulates the RF energy to send commands and that detects the RFID device's response, a simple, low-cost module may be provided to facilitate communication with the RFID devices. The modules may be provided for parallel testing of a large number of RFID devices at high speed. Furthermore, the systems and methods disclosed may provide isolation between the RFID devices, because the RFID devices adjacent to the RFID device being tested may be saturated with RF energy and unable to detect the amplitude modulation imposed on the RFID device under test.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a block diagram of a system <b>300</b>, which illustrates an exemplary implementation of an RFID communication system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System <b>300</b> includes RF source <b>202</b>, which is a common source for providing un-modulated RF energy (e.g., via transmission lines <b>106</b>, not shown, or via a far field antenna) to a number of communication stations <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Communication stations <b>302</b> (separately referenced as communication stations <b>302</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>302</b>(<i>n</i>), where “n” represents the total number of communication stations <b>302</b>) may each include controller <b>204</b>, diodes <b>208</b>, and coupler <b>104</b> for communicating with corresponding RFID devices <b>102</b>. Communication stations <b>302</b>, for example, may be implemented as a test system for RFID devices <b>102</b>, such as during the manufacturing process or to add functionality to a device (e.g., a printer configured to print RFID labels and/or communicate with RFID devices).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each controller <b>204</b> may communicate with the corresponding RFID device <b>102</b>, as described herein. For example, controllers <b>204</b> may independently communicate with corresponding RFID devices <b>102</b> or, optionally a device <b>304</b> may be provided to couple to controllers <b>204</b> to control the communication. Device <b>304</b>, for example, may be implemented as an application specific integrated circuit, a programmable logic device, a computer (e.g., a processor-based system), a microprocessor (e.g., one-time programmable microprocessor), a microcontroller, or any other type of circuit or system to control controller <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As discussed herein, RF source <b>202</b> may provide the un-modulated RF energy via a far field antenna or via transmission lines <b>106</b>. Furthermore, transmission lines <b>106</b> may provide the RF energy generally to one or more RFID devices <b>102</b> (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or in a more individual fashion using short-range coupling techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a block diagram illustrating a system <b>400</b> for an RFID communication system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System <b>400</b> includes transmission line <b>106</b> and couplers <b>402</b> (which are separately referenced as couplers <b>402</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>402</b>(<i>n</i>), where “n” is the desired number of couplers <b>402</b>). Transmission line <b>106</b> may represent any type of transmission path (e.g., a twin line, a coaxial line, a microstrip, or any other desired form of wired transmission path for carrying RF signals to couplers <b>402</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Couplers <b>402</b> may represent individual electric, magnetic, or electric and magnetic coupling devices or a direct connection coupler, such as those described for example in reference to couplers <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>). Thus, couplers <b>402</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>402</b>(<i>n</i>) may be implemented to provide un-modulated RF energy from RF source <b>202</b> via transmission line <b>106</b> to corresponding RFID devices <b>102</b> (i.e., RFID devices <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>102</b>(<i>n</i>)). For example, system <b>400</b> may be implemented within system <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to provide the un-modulated RF energy from RF source <b>202</b> to RFID devices <b>102</b> within communication stations <b>302</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>302</b>(<i>n</i>) via transmission line <b>106</b> and corresponding couplers <b>402</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>402</b>(<i>n</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Couplers <b>402</b> and transmission line <b>106</b> may be configured in any desired configuration and may be implemented as desired depending upon the type of application. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a block diagram of a system <b>500</b> for an RFID communication system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System <b>500</b> includes RF source <b>202</b>, transmission line <b>106</b>, and couplers <b>502</b>. RF source <b>202</b> provides a common RF signal (e.g., 125 kHz or 13.56 MHz) to couplers <b>502</b> via transmission line <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Couplers <b>502</b> are configured in an exemplary sized array configuration, with each coupler <b>502</b> capable of providing short-range coupling to a corresponding RFID device <b>102</b>. Couplers <b>502</b>, for example, may represent a specific exemplary implementation of couplers <b>402</b>, with couplers <b>502</b> providing an array of individual coupling coils designed to couple with corresponding RFID devices <b>102</b> (e.g., low frequency RFID tag devices).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It may be difficult to keep the loading on transmission line <b>106</b> constant and avoid reflections, depending upon the system requirements or desired application, when the short-range couplers (e.g., couplers <b>402</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> or couplers <b>502</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) are driven by the common RF source <b>202</b>. One technique, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, is to employ an amplifier (e.g., a high input impedance amplifier) for one or more couplers <b>402</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) or couplers <b>502</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a block diagram illustrating a system <b>600</b> for an RFID communication system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System <b>600</b> includes RF source <b>202</b>, transmission line <b>106</b>, an amplifier <b>602</b>, and a coupler <b>606</b>. Coupler <b>606</b> may represent coupler <b>402</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) or coupler <b>502</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and employ amplifier <b>602</b> to take the RF signal from transmission line <b>106</b> (e.g., tap into the RF signal distribution source) and drive the RF signal to coupler <b>606</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Amplifier <b>602</b>, for example, may represent a high input impedance amplifier having a gain that is adjustable to provide the desired signal level to coupler <b>606</b>. Consequently, by using amplifier <b>602</b>, the propagation of the RF signal in transmission line <b>106</b> between RF source <b>202</b> and a termination point <b>604</b> (optional) may be less affected by the number of couplers <b>606</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, amplifier <b>602</b> may be provided between transmission line <b>106</b> (e.g. a coaxial cable) and each corresponding coupler <b>606</b> to tap off the RF signal, while generally avoiding disturbing the Rf signal on transmission line <b>106</b>. Thus, unwanted reflections of the RF signal on transmission line <b>106</b> may be reduced and amplifier <b>602</b> may be utilized to adjust the signal level to corresponding coupler <b>606</b>, which may be required, as the RF signal tends to attenuate with distance along transmission line <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As discussed herein (e.g., in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), controller <b>204</b> and diodes <b>208</b> may be employed to communicate with RFID device <b>102</b>. As an alternative implementation, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a block diagram illustrating a system <b>700</b> for an RFID communication system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System <b>700</b> provides a coupling interface to modulate the RF signal provided by RF source <b>202</b> to RFID device <b>102</b> (not shown) and detect the changes caused by RFID device <b>102</b> modulating its impedance when it replies.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">System <b>700</b> includes coupler <b>104</b> (e.g., couplers <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>)), controller <b>204</b>, a switch <b>702</b>, and an RF detector <b>704</b>. I/O port <b>214</b> controls switch <b>702</b> (e.g., an RF switch such as a shunt transistor or a high frequency analog switch integrated circuit) to modulate the RF signal provided to RFID device <b>102</b>, for example, via RF source <b>202</b> and transmission line <b>106</b> (as described similarly in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Switch <b>702</b> is coupled between coupler <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>) as shown and coupled, for example, to a reference voltage (e.g., ground).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">RF detector <b>704</b> is employed to detect any response provided by RFID device <b>102</b> and provide this information to I/O port <b>212</b>. RF detector <b>704</b>, for example, may be implemented as any type of conventional RF detector (e.g., a diode-based detector or an integrated circuit RF detector), as would be understood by one skilled in the art. In general, RF detector <b>704</b> provides a baseband voltage, which represents the amplitude of the RF signal rectified and integrated over time to remove voltage changes at the RF frequency and recover voltage changes due to the baseband signal modulation, as would be understood by one skilled in the art. The baseband voltage, for example, may be further provided to a voltage comparator circuit (e.g., via a series capacitor), which will provide a digital signal representing changes in the baseband signal. The voltage comparator circuit, for example if implemented, may be incorporated within RF detector <b>704</b> or within controller <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Thus, diodes <b>208</b> and capacitor <b>210</b> (if present) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be replaced by switch <b>702</b> and RF detector <b>704</b> to provide a short-range coupling interface (e.g., a near field coupling interface). Switch <b>702</b>, controlled by controller <b>204</b>, provides a variable impedance, which induces an amplitude modulation of the RF signal received by RFID device <b>102</b> from RF source <b>202</b>, as described similarly in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. RF detector <b>704</b> provides a detector function to detect changes in the RF signal due to RFID device <b>102</b> modulating its RF impedance (e.g., when RFID device <b>102</b> responds to a command message).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Embodiments described above illustrate but do not limit the invention. It should also be understood that numerous modifications and variations are possible in accordance with the principles of the present invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is defined only by the following claims.</p>
