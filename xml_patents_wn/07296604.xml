<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method of processing wood, according to which a wooden piece is compressed and deformed into a predetermined shape.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, techniques for processing wood by compressing and forming the same into a desired shape have been focused. With a wide variety of grain patterns, wood products made of wood exhibit individual features depending on positions of the raw wood from which the particular wood products are cut out. Such individual features of each wood product give it a unique quality. In addition, surface damages and discoloration caused by a long-term use create unique textures which tend to evoke warm and familiar feeling in the user. Thus, the wood attracts attention as a material for products of uniqueness and taste which cannot be found in products made of synthetic resin or light metals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one conventionally known technique for compression processing of wood: a wooden board is softened with water absorption and compressed; the compressed wooden board is cut along a direction substantially parallel with a direction in which the compressing force is applied, whereby a primary fixed product with a sheet-like shape is obtained; and the primary fixed product is deformed into a desired three-dimensional shape under heat and moisture (for example, see Japanese Patent No. 3078452 Publication). Further, according to another conventional technique, a softened wooden board is compressed and temporarily secured in a prepared mold and left in the mold until the wooden board recovers. Thus a wood product with a desired shape can be obtained (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H11-77619 Publication).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For the implementation of compression process of wooden pieces, a thickness of a wooden piece to be employed and a compression rate must be determined based on various factors such as an individual characteristic of each wooden piece, wood species, and a required strength and a purpose of use of a resulting wood product.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method of processing wood into a predetermined shape through compression, according to one aspect of the present invention, includes compressing a first wooden piece and a second wooden piece separately; placing the compressed second wooden piece on the compressed first wooden piece; and compressing together the compressed first wooden piece and the compressed second wooden piece which are placed one on another.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The above and other objects, features, advantages and technical and industrial significance of this invention will be better understood by reading the following detailed description of presently preferred embodiments of the invention, when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a structure of an electronic device whose jacket is made of a compressed wood product formed through a method of processing wood according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The electronic device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a digital camera <b>100</b> which encloses various electronic elements inside a substantially rectangular solid jacket <b>1</b> formed from wooden covers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> joined together, each formed like a bowl.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of a structure of the covers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. The cover <b>11</b> includes a main plate <b>11</b><i>a </i>which has a substantially rectangular surface, two side plates <b>11</b><i>b </i>that extend from respective opposing longer sides of the main plate <b>11</b><i>a </i>in a direction substantially perpendicular to the main plate <b>11</b><i>a</i>, and two side plates <b>11</b><i>c </i>that extend from respective opposing shorter sides of the main plate <b>11</b><i>a </i>in a direction substantially perpendicular to the main plate <b>11</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The cover <b>12</b> is of substantially the same shape as the cover <b>11</b>, and includes a main plate <b>12</b><i>a </i>which has a substantially rectangular surface, two side plates <b>12</b><i>b </i>that extend from respective opposing longer sides of the main plate <b>12</b><i>a </i>in a direction substantially perpendicular to the main plate <b>12</b><i>a</i>, and two side plates <b>12</b><i>c </i>that extend from respective opposing shorter sides of the main pate <b>12</b><i>a </i>in a direction substantially perpendicular to the main plate <b>12</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view along a line A-A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the covers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> is formed through a compression of two separately compressed wooden sheets. More specifically, the cover <b>11</b> is formed from two layers, i.e., an outer part <b>111</b> and an inner part <b>112</b>, whereas the cover <b>12</b> is formed from two layers, i.e., an outer part <b>121</b> and an inner part <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the outer part <b>111</b>, wooden fibers run in a direction L<sub>111 </sub>which is substantially parallel with the lengthwise direction of the cover <b>11</b>, whereas in the inner part <b>112</b>, wooden fibers run in a direction L<sub>112 </sub>which is substantially parallel with the breadthwise direction of the cover <b>11</b>. In the outer part <b>121</b>, wooden fibers run in a direction L<sub>121 </sub>which is substantially parallel with the lengthwise direction of the cover <b>12</b>, whereas in the inner part <b>122</b>, wooden fibers run in a direction L<sub>122 </sub>which is substantially parallel with the breadthwise direction of the cover <b>12</b>. Thus, the direction of wooden fibers in the outer part is substantially perpendicular to the direction of wooden fibers in the inner part in each cover.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The main plate <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>11</b> has openings <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> exposing an imaging unit <b>5</b> having an image pick-up lens and a photoflash <b>6</b>, respectively. The side plates <b>11</b><i>b </i>and <b>11</b><i>c </i>of the cover <b>11</b> have cut-out portions <b>151</b> and <b>161</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the other hand, the main plate <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>12</b> includes an opening <b>17</b> to expose a display unit <b>8</b> which is implemented by a liquid crystal display, a plasma display, an organic electroluminescence (EL) display or the like for display of image information or textual information. Over the opening <b>17</b>, a protective member made of glass or the like is mounted to protect the display unit <b>8</b>. The side plates <b>12</b><i>b </i>and <b>12</b><i>c </i>of the cover <b>12</b> include cut-out portions <b>152</b> and <b>162</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the covers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> with the above-described structures are joined together in an assembly of the digital camera <b>100</b>, the cut-out portions <b>151</b> and <b>152</b> face with each other to form an opening <b>15</b>, whereas the cut-out portions <b>161</b> and <b>162</b> face with each other to form an opening <b>16</b>. The opening <b>15</b> exposes a shutter button <b>7</b>, whereas the opening <b>16</b> exposes a connection device for connecting to an external device such as a personal computer. The connection device is, for example, a connection terminal such as a universal serial bus (USB) terminal, a connection port for an external storage media such as an xD picture card, a smart media or the like, and a receptacle for power supply. A cap may be provided to the opening <b>16</b> for protection of the connection device not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, the covers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> may include an additional opening and an additional cut-out portion to mount a finder or to expose a manual operation button.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The jacket <b>1</b> houses, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at least a part of electronic elements which realize electronic functions of the digital camera <b>100</b>, and more particularly, a control unit <b>9</b> which includes a control circuit that controls driving related to imaging process or the like of the digital camera <b>100</b>, an imaging element such as a charge coupled device (CCD), and electronic units including an audio input-output element such as a microphone, speaker, or the like. The control circuit is realized with a central processing unit (CPU) having functions of operation and control, and a flash memory which stores various information such as a program for launching a predetermined operating system (OS).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the covers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> are assembled to form the jacket <b>1</b> so as to house the electronic elements, adhesive or the like is applied to corresponding end surfaces of the side plates of the covers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. After joining two covers, a periphery of the interface of two covers may be covered with sealant, such as an elastic material and sealed. Alternatively, a groove may be formed on an end of a side plate of one of two covers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, and a protrusion which would fit the groove may be formed on an end of a side plate of the other cover, and the protrusion may be fit into the groove at the joining.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, a method of processing the cover into the above-described structure is described in detail. First, wooden pieces are cut out from raw wood as material for the cover <b>11</b> or <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an explanatory diagram which schematically shows shaping of the wooden pieces to be processed into the cover <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, from uncompressed raw wood <b>50</b>. A wooden piece <b>51</b>, which is a material for the outer part <b>111</b> or <b>121</b>, is a planar sheet and cut out from the raw wood <b>50</b> so that a lengthwise direction of the wooden piece <b>51</b> is substantially parallel with a direction L of wooden fibers of the raw wood <b>50</b>. The wooden piece <b>51</b> thus shaped, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, has a straight grain surface where grains 50 G run substantially parallel with each other, and has a thickness R.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">On the other hand, a wooden piece <b>52</b>, which is a material for the inner part <b>112</b> or <b>122</b>, is a planar sheet and cut out from the raw wood <b>50</b> so that a breadthwise direction of the wooden piece <b>52</b> is substantially parallel with the direction L of wooden fibers of the raw wood <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view of a structure of the cut-out wooden piece <b>52</b>. The wooden piece <b>52</b>, similar to the wooden piece <b>51</b>, has the thickness R and a straight grain surface, but is shorter in length in a lengthwise direction than the wooden piece <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Here, the wooden pieces <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are cut out from the raw wood <b>50</b>, so that the cut-out wooden pieces <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are larger in volume than finished pieces by an amount to be decreased in the compression process described later. The raw wood which is employable in the first embodiment is, for example, Japanese cypress, hiba cedar, paulownia, Japanese cedar, pine, cherry, zelkova, ebony wood, teak, mahogany, and rosewood. Any of these wood species can be employed as the raw wood in all embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">After the cutting out, the wooden piece <b>51</b> is compressed (first compression process). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an explanatory diagram schematically showing how the first compression process of the wooden piece <b>51</b> is carried out, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view of the wooden piece <b>51</b> and metal molds along a line B-B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the wooden piece <b>51</b> is compressed by two metal molds <b>61</b> and <b>71</b> in the first compression process. Of these two metal molds, the metal mold <b>61</b> used to apply compressing force to the wooden piece <b>51</b> from above the wooden piece <b>51</b> has a downward protrusion <b>62</b>. On the other hand, the metal mold <b>71</b> used to apply compressing force to the wooden piece <b>51</b> from below the wooden piece <b>51</b> during the compression process has a downward depression <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Before the first compression process, the wooden piece <b>51</b> is left in a water vapor atmosphere in high temperature and high pressure for a predetermined time period. Thus, the wooden piece <b>51</b> absorbs water in excess to be softened. Thereafter, at least one of the metal molds <b>61</b> and <b>71</b> is brought closer to another of the metal molds <b>61</b> and <b>71</b> in the same water vapor atmosphere to sandwich and compress the wooden piece <b>51</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a vertical sectional view of the wooden piece <b>51</b> sandwiched and compressed by the metal molds <b>61</b> and <b>71</b>, along the line B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, similarly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the wooden piece <b>51</b> is deformed into a substantially bowl-like three-dimensional shape corresponding to a gap formed between the protrusion <b>62</b> and the depression <b>72</b>, while being sandwiched and compressed by two metal molds <b>61</b> and <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the first embodiment, the wooden piece <b>51</b> is deformed to have a uniform thickness r<sub>1 </sub>(&lt;R) over the whole area thereof by the first compression process. A compression rate C<sub>1 </sub>of the wooden piece <b>51</b> in the first compression process can be represented as (R−r<sub>1</sub>)/R. Specifically, the compression rate C<sub>1 </sub>is approximately in the range of 0.3 to 0.6.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">After the wooden piece <b>51</b> is left in the state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> for a predetermined time period, the metal mold <b>61</b> is separated from the metal mold <b>71</b> to release the wooden piece <b>51</b> from compression and water vapor atmosphere, and then the wooden piece <b>51</b> is dried. Depending on the material of the wooden piece <b>51</b>, the wooden piece <b>51</b> may recover the original shape when released from the metal molds <b>61</b> and <b>71</b>. When such type of wood is employed, the wooden piece <b>51</b> is left sandwiched between the metal molds <b>61</b> and <b>71</b> during the compression release and drying. The length of time for drying the wooden piece <b>51</b> may vary according to the shape and the species of the wooden piece <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thus the first compression process for the wooden piece <b>51</b> is described. The first compression process is similarly carried out on the wooden piece <b>52</b>. In the first compression process of the wooden piece <b>52</b>, different metal molds from the metal molds <b>61</b> and <b>71</b> employed for the compression of the wooden piece <b>51</b> are employed, so that the wooden piece <b>52</b> after the first compression process is of a bowl-like shape slightly smaller than the wooden piece <b>51</b> after the first compression process, and has a thickness r<sub>2 </sub>(&lt;R) substantially over a whole area thereof. A compression rate C<sub>2 </sub>of the wooden piece <b>52</b> in the first compression process can be represented as (R−r<sub>2</sub>)/R.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the first embodiment, the metal molds are designed so that the thickness r<sub>1 </sub>of the wooden piece <b>51</b> and the thickness r<sub>2 </sub>of the wooden piece <b>52</b> after the first compression process are equal. Hence, the compression rate C<sub>1 </sub>of the wooden piece <b>51</b> and the compression rate C<sub>2 </sub>of the wooden piece <b>52</b> in the first compression process are the same (i.e., C<sub>1</sub>=C<sub>2</sub>). Hereinafter, the wooden pieces <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> after the first compression process are referred to as the outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">After the first compression process described above, the outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> are placed one on another and compressed together (second compression process). Hereinafter, the formation of the cover <b>11</b> will be described by way of example. The cover <b>12</b> is formed in the same manner.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an explanatory diagram schematically showing how the second compression process is carried out, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a sectional view of the inner part, the outer part, and metal molds along a line C-C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In the second compression process, the inner part <b>112</b> is placed over the outer part <b>111</b> in the same water vapor atmosphere of high temperature and high pressure as in the first compression process, and two parts <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> are placed at a predetermined location between metal molds <b>81</b> and <b>91</b>. Then, two metal molds sandwich and compress the outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> to deform the same into a predetermined shape.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The metal mold <b>81</b>, which applies compressing force to the inner part <b>112</b> from above has a protrusion <b>82</b> which fits an inner surface of the inner part <b>112</b>. The protrusion <b>82</b> has a curved surface which fits an inner surface of a curved portion <b>112</b><i>ab </i>extending between a bottom portion and a side portion of the inner part <b>112</b>. A radius of curvature RA of the curved surface of the protrusion <b>82</b> is smaller than a radius of curvature RI of the inner surface of the curved portion <b>112</b><i>ab</i>. On the other hand, the metal mold <b>91</b> which applies compressing force to the outer part <b>111</b> from below has a depression <b>92</b> which fits an outer surface of the outer part <b>111</b>. The depression <b>92</b> has a curved surface which fits an outer surface of a curved portion <b>111</b><i>ab </i>extending between a bottom portion and a side portion of the outer part <b>111</b>. A radius of curvature RB of the curved surface of the depression <b>92</b> is smaller than a radius of curvature RO of the outer surface of the curved portion <b>111</b><i>ab. </i></p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a vertical sectional view of the outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> sandwiched and compressed by the metal molds <b>81</b> and <b>91</b>, along the line C-C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, similarly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> are further compressed in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In the second compression process, sap components seep out from the outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> to serve as adhesive, and hence, the outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> stick with each other without application of adhesive. Here, depending on the material of the outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b>, a suitable amount of adhesive may be applied to contact surfaces of the outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> prior to the second compression process.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">After the outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> are left in the state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> for a predetermined time period, the outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> are released from compression and dried. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a perspective view of an original structure of the cover <b>11</b> after the second compression process, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a sectional view of the cover <b>11</b> along a line D-D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> after the second compression process are substantially the same in thickness, i.e., r, whereby the thickness of the cover <b>11</b> is approximately 2r. The thickness 2r is approximately 30% to 50% of 2R, which is a sum of thicknesses of two wooden pieces as cut out from the uncompressed raw wood. Therefore, a compression rate through two compression processes is approximately 0.5 to 0.7, which is slightly larger than the compression rate (approximately 0.3 to 0.6) in the first compression process.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Thereafter, with the formation of an opening, a cut-out portion or the like in a predetermined position via cutting or punching, the cover <b>11</b> is finished. When the finished cover <b>11</b> has an unnecessary portion on an outer periphery thereof, such portion is removed via cutting and a suitable processing is performed on a resulting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a vertical sectional view which schematically shows examples of strength distribution in the outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> that are processed into the cover <b>11</b> through compression as described above. The outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> after the first compression process has a relatively higher strength in regions S in the vicinity of the surfaces which directly receive compressing force from the metal molds compared with intermediate regions M.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the cover <b>11</b> is formed through the second compression process of the outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> placed one on another, the cover <b>11</b> receives compressing force at regions S<sub>1 </sub>in the vicinity of surfaces thereof to increase fiber density, whereby the strength thereof is further enhanced. In addition, a region S<sub>2 </sub>in the vicinity of surfaces adhering with each other of the outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> has a higher strength than intermediate regions M<sub>1 </sub>though lower than the regions S<sub>1</sub>, and the region S<b>2</b> is relatively thick. Thus, a layer with relatively high strength is superimposed on a layer with relatively low strength alternately and in various manners in the cover <b>11</b>, whereby a yielding material with high strength and toughness can be obtained through two compression processes.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to the first embodiment as described above, two wooden sheets are first compressed separately (first compression process), and then the two compressed wooden sheets stacked are further compressed together (second compression process). Thus the wooden piece can be made thin in the first compression process to facilitate forming thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, according to the first embodiment, two compression processes result in a production of a wooden piece where a layer with a higher strength and a layer with a lower strength are alternately stacked, and the strength of each layer is diverse, whereby a yielding compressed wood product with high strength and toughness can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Still further, according to the first embodiment, the direction of wooden fibers in the outer part of the cover is substantially perpendicular to the direction of wooden fibers in the inner part of the cover. Thus each of the outer part and the inner part can function as to supplement a lack of strength in the other part along the surface direction. Thus, non-uniformity of strength along the surface direction of the wooden piece can be eliminated, whereby uniform and suitable strength can be granted to the wooden piece.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Alternatively, contrary to the first embodiment, the direction of wooden fibers of the outer part <b>111</b> may be made substantially parallel with the breadthwise direction thereof, whereas the direction of wooden fibers of the inner part <b>112</b> may be made substantially parallel with the lengthwise direction thereof, so that the direction of wooden fibers of the outer part <b>111</b> is made substantially perpendicular to the direction of wooden fibers of the inner part <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Still alternatively, the directions of wooden fibers of two wooden pieces are not necessarily substantially perpendicular. In other words, as far as the directions of wooden fibers of two wooden pieces are arranged so as to intersect with each other, a similar advantage as in the first embodiment can be obtained. In this regard, the wooden piece cut out from the raw wood <b>50</b> does not necessarily have a straight grain surface.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Still alternatively, the directions of wooden fibers of the outer part and the inner part, and the shapes thereof may be opposite in the cover <b>11</b> and in the cover <b>12</b>. For example, the cover <b>11</b> may be formed similarly as in the first embodiment, whereas the cover <b>12</b> is formed so that the direction of wooden fibers of the outer part <b>121</b> is substantially parallel with the breadthwise direction, whereas the direction of wooden fibers of the inner part <b>122</b> is substantially parallel with the lengthwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the above description, two wooden sheets are placed one on another for the formation of the compressed wood product. The compressed wood product, however, can be formed from more than two wooden sheets. For example, when three wooden sheets with a straight grain surface are employed, three wooden sheets may be arranged so that the directions of wooden fibers thereof form angles of approximately 60 degrees with each other. Then, the wooden sheets can supplement lack of strength of each other as to improve the overall strength of the resulting product. In general, when n wooden sheets of straight grain surface (here, n is an integer not less than two) are employed, the wooden sheets are arranged so that wooden fibers thereof form angles of 180/n degrees with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">An example of suitable dimension is illustrated below for a cover made of two wooden sheets as a jacket for a small portable electronic device such as a digital camera. First, two planar wooden sheets are cut out so that the thickness R of each sheet is approximately 2 millimeters (mm), and compressed in the first compression process until each of the wooden sheets has a thickness of approximately 1.0 to 1.1 mm. In the subsequent second compression process, joined wooden sheets are compressed until a total thickness 2r thereof is approximately 1.6 to 1.8 mm.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a perspective view of a structure of the covers <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>.

The cover <b>22</b> is of substantially the same shape as the cover <b>21</b> and includes a main plate <b>22</b><i>a</i>, and side plates <b>22</b><i>b </i>and <b>22</b><i>c </i>that extend from a periphery of the main plate <b>22</b><i>a </i>at a predetermined angle.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The cover <b>21</b> is formed through a compression of two wooden sheets that are previously compressed separately and placed one on another, and includes two layers of an outer part <b>211</b> and an inner part <b>212</b>. The cover <b>22</b> is formed similarly to the cover <b>21</b> and includes two layers of an outer part <b>221</b> and an inner part <b>222</b>. In the second embodiment, the outer part and the inner part composing each cover have different grain pattern as indicated by 50 G. More specifically, the outer parts <b>211</b> and <b>221</b> have flat grain surfaces, whereas the inner parts <b>212</b> and <b>222</b> have straight grain surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, each of the outer parts <b>211</b> and <b>221</b> with a flat grain surface has a grain pattern where wooden fibers do not run in a uniform direction. On the other hand, in each of the inner parts <b>212</b> and <b>222</b> with a straight grain surface, directions L<sub>212 </sub>and L<sub>222 </sub>of wooden fibers are substantially parallel with the lengthwise directions of the covers <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, respectively. When the outer part has a flat grain surface, i.e., has a non-uniformly running pattern of wooden fibers, whereas the inner part has a straight grain surface, i.e., has a uniformly running pattern of wooden fibers, and such outer part and such inner part are placed one on another to form the covers <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, the directions of wooden fibers in the outer part and the inner part intersect with each other. As a result, anisotropy of the strength of each cover is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The main plate <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>21</b> includes an opening <b>23</b> to expose the imaging unit <b>5</b> and an opening <b>24</b> for an attachment of the photoflash <b>6</b>.

The side plates <b>22</b><i>b </i>and <b>22</b><i>c </i>of the cover <b>22</b> include cut-out portions <b>252</b> and <b>262</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When the covers <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> with the above-described structures are joined together in an assembly of the digital camera <b>200</b>, the cut-out portions <b>251</b> and <b>252</b> face with each other to form an opening <b>25</b>, whereas the cut-out portions <b>261</b> and <b>262</b> face with each other to form an opening <b>26</b>.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The digital camera <b>200</b> has a similar internal structure as the digital camera <b>100</b> described above (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Specifically, the jacket <b>2</b> houses at least a part of electronic elements which realize electronic functions such as imaging processing of the digital camera <b>200</b>, and more particularly, houses the control unit <b>9</b>. A structure, a manner of assembly or the like of the jacket <b>2</b> are the same as the structure, the manner of assembly or the like of the jacket <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment described above, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Next, a method of processing the cover into the above-described structure is described in detail. First, wooden pieces are cut out from raw wood as material for the covers <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, so that the cut-out wooden pieces are larger than finished pieces by an amount to be decreased by the compression. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is an explanatory diagram which schematically shows shaping of the wooden pieces, which are materials for the covers <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, from the uncompressed raw wood <b>50</b>. A wooden piece <b>53</b>, which is a material for the outer part <b>211</b> or <b>221</b>, is a planar sheet and cut out from the raw wood <b>50</b> so that a lengthwise direction of the wooden piece <b>53</b> is substantially parallel with the direction L of wooden fibers of the raw wood <b>50</b>. The wooden piece <b>53</b> thus obtained has a flat grain surface (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">On the other hand, a wooden piece <b>54</b>, which is a material for the inner part <b>212</b> or <b>222</b>, is cut out from the raw wood <b>50</b> so that the lengthwise direction thereof is substantially parallel with the direction L of wooden fibers of the raw wood <b>50</b>, and has a straight grain surface. The wooden piece <b>54</b> has the same structure as the wooden piece <b>51</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The thicknesses of the wooden pieces <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> are the same and represented as R. The wooden piece <b>53</b> is longer than the wooden piece <b>54</b> in the lengthwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Then, the cut-out wooden pieces <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> are compressed (first compression process). In the first compression process, the wooden pieces <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> are left in a water vapor atmosphere of high temperature and high pressure for a predetermined period prior to the compression. Thereafter, the wooden pieces <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> that have absorbed the water in excess and been softened are each sandwiched and compressed by predetermined two metal molds.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Through the first compression process, the wooden pieces <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> are deformed to have substantially uniform thicknesses r<sub>3 </sub>(&lt;R) and r<sub>4 </sub>(&lt;R), respectively, over a whole area thereof. A compression rate C<sub>3</sub>=(R−r<sub>3</sub>)/R of the wooden piece <b>53</b> and a compression rate C<sub>4</sub>=(R−r<sub>4</sub>)/R of the wooden piece <b>54</b> are both approximately 0.3 to 0.6.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is an explanatory diagram schematically showing how the second compression process is carried out where the outer part <b>211</b> and the inner part <b>212</b> formed through separate compression of the respective wooden pieces <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> are placed one on another and compressed together. Hereinafter, the second compression process of the cover <b>21</b> is described. The cover <b>22</b> is also subjected to the same second compression process. In the second compression process, the inner part <b>212</b> is placed over the outer part <b>211</b> in the same water vapor atmosphere of high temperature and high pressure as in the first compression process, and two parts <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> are placed at a predetermined location between the metal molds <b>81</b> and <b>91</b>. Then, two metal molds sandwich and compress the outer part <b>211</b> and the inner part <b>212</b> to deform the same into a predetermined shape.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Thereafter, the outer part <b>211</b> and the inner part <b>212</b> are released from the compression and dried whereby an original form of the cover <b>21</b> is obtained. As a result, the thickness of the cover <b>21</b> becomes approximately 30% to 50% of the total thickness 2R of the two wooden pieces before compression. Therefore, a compression rate through two compression processes is approximately 0.5 to 0.7, which is slightly larger than the compression rate (approximately 0.3 to 0.6) in the first compression process.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Thereafter, with the formation of an opening, a cut-out portion or the like in the compressed cover <b>21</b> in a predetermined position via cutting or punching, the cover <b>21</b> is finished. When the finished cover <b>21</b> has an unnecessary portion on an outer periphery thereof, such portion is removed via cutting and a suitable processing is performed on a resulting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Thus, the second embodiment of the present invention realizes the same advantages as in the first embodiment. According to the second embodiment as described above, two wooden sheets are compressed separately (first compression process), and then the two compressed wooden sheets stacked are compressed together (second compression process). Thus the wooden piece can be made thin in the first compression process to facilitate forming thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, according to the second embodiment, two compression processes result in a production of a wooden piece including a layer with a higher strength and a layer with a lower strength alternately stacked, and the strength of each layer is diverse (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), whereby a yielding compressed wood product is granted with a suitable and uniform strength, and a compressed wood product with high strength and toughness can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Still further, according to the second embodiment, the grain patterns of the outer part and the inner part constituting the cover are made different so that the directions of wooden fibers in the outer part and the inner part intersect with each other as to supplement lack of strength in weak positions of each other along the surface direction. As a result, the non-uniformity of strength in the surface direction of the wooden piece can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Thus, in the second embodiment, the wooden piece with a flat grain surface and the wooden piece with a straight grain surface are employed as the outer part and the inner part, respectively. Such selection of grain patterns is preferable in the following regards. First, the flat grain pattern, though categorized as such, shows different patterns in each wooden piece. When the flat-grain wooden piece is employed as an outer part of the product, the grain pattern can be a part of the product design and each product can show more notable and unique individual feature. Secondly, the straight-grain wooden piece tends to have a lower anisotropy and the direction of wooden fibers thereof is uniform. Hence, such wooden piece is strong against a force applied in a perpendicular direction to the direction of wooden fibers, and easily bent along the fiber direction for processing. Thus, the combination of the flat-grain wooden piece and the straight-grain wooden piece allows for the manufacturing of a compressed wood product with the advantages of both.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Alternatively, a wooden piece with an end grain surface can be employed as the outer part, or a wooden piece with grain pattern other than the straight grain pattern, e.g., an intermediate grain pattern of the straight grain and the flat grain, may be employed as the inner part. In particular, the flat grain wooden piece and the end grain wooden piece are relatively soft and contain relatively high sap components. Thus, the use of such wooden pieces brings about an additional advantage of easy bonding of the wooden piece with other part in the product in the second compression process.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the second embodiment, similarly to the first embodiment, the compressed wood product may be manufactured from more than two wooden pieces. As mentioned above, the flat grain wooden piece and the end grain wooden piece are unique in design thereof. When the flat grain wooden piece or the end grain wooden piece, for example, is employed as the outer part, while two straight grain wooden pieces are employed as the inner parts and each superimposed on the outer part so that the directions of wooden fibers of the two straight grain wooden pieces are substantially perpendicular to each other and subjected to the second compression process, a resulting compressed wood product can enjoy suitable strength as well as excellence in design. Here, the flat grain wooden piece or the end grain wooden piece may be thinner than each of the other two straight grain wooden pieces when being taken out from the raw wood.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is an explanatory diagram schematically showing how the second compression process is carried out where the outer part <b>311</b> and the inner part <b>312</b> formed through separate compression of the respective wooden pieces <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> are placed one on another and compressed together. Hereinafter, the second compression process of the cover <b>31</b> is described. The cover <b>32</b> is also subjected to the same second compression process.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the second compression process, the inner part <b>312</b> is placed over the outer part <b>311</b> in the same water vapor atmosphere of high temperature and high pressure as in the first compression process, and two parts <b>311</b> and <b>312</b> are placed at a predetermined location between the metal molds <b>81</b> and <b>91</b>. Then, two metal molds sandwich and compress the outer part <b>311</b> and the inner part <b>312</b> to deform the same into a predetermined shape.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Thereafter, the outer part <b>311</b> and the inner part <b>312</b> are released from the compression and dried whereby an original form of the cover <b>31</b> is obtained. As a result, the thickness of the cover <b>31</b> becomes approximately 30% to 50% of the total thickness 2R of the two wooden pieces before compression. Therefore, a compression rate through two compression processes is approximately 0.5 to 0.7, which is slightly larger than the compression rate (approximately 0.3 to 0.6) in the first compression process.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Thereafter, with the formation of an opening, a cut-out portion or the like in the compressed cover <b>31</b> in a predetermined position via cutting or punching, the cover <b>31</b> is finished. When the finished cover <b>31</b> has an unnecessary portion on an outer periphery thereof, such portion is removed via cutting and a suitable processing is performed on a resulting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In the third embodiment, the grain patterns of the outer part and the inner part are generally substantially the same after the second compression process. Hence, the contraction and expansion of the jacket <b>3</b> caused by the application of external forces or the changes in temperature or humidity is substantially the same in the outer part and the inner part joined with each other. Therefore stress is not likely to be accumulated inside the outer and the inner parts. As a result, the product can enjoy a specific advantage that the strain is not likely to be caused even under the application of external forces or the changes in temperature or humidity.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Further, when the grain patterns of the outer part and the inner part are substantially the same, the resulting product can possess similar characteristics to a compressed wood product of a similar shape made of one wooden piece. On the other hand, though the direction of wooden fibers in the outer part and the direction of wooden fibers in the inner part are substantially parallel, the grain patterns of the outer and the inner parts after joined together do not completely match with each other. Hence, the compressed wood product made of plural parts as in the embodiments is allowed to have smaller anisotropy of strength and the strength thereof is more uniform compared with the compressed wood product made of one wood piece.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the third embodiment, the employed wooden pieces are not necessarily straight grain wooden pieces as far as the grain patterns of the outer part and the inner part are substantially the same. Alternatively, the flat grain wooden piece, the end grain wooden piece, or the wooden piece with an intermediate grain pattern of the flat grain and the straight grain may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">According to the third embodiment as described above, similarly to the above-described two embodiments, two wooden sheets are compressed separately (first compression process), and then the two compressed wooden sheets stacked are further compressed together (second compression process). Thus, similarly to the two embodiments described above, the wooden piece can be made thin in the first compression process to facilitate the forming thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Further, according to the third embodiment, two compression processes result in a production of a wooden piece including a layer with a higher strength and a layer with a lower strength alternately stacked, and the strength of each layer is diverse (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), whereby a yielding compressed wood product with high strength and toughness can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Further, according to the third embodiment, the outer part and the inner part constituting the cover are placed one on another so that the grain patterns thereof substantially match and are fixed in the second compression process. Thus, fixed two parts expand/contract substantially in the same manner as to prevent accumulation of internal stress. Thus, strain is not easily caused even under the application of external forces or the change in temperature or humidity.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Further, according to the third embodiment, though the matching of the grain patterns grants the product a similar advantage found in the product made of one wooden piece, the grain patterns of the superimposed parts do not completely match. Hence, the anisotropy of the strength can be smaller and overall strength of the product can be more uniform compared with the compressed wood product made of one wooden piece.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is an explanatory view which schematically shows how a wooden piece is processed in a second compression process of a method of processing wood according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the second compression process is performed on an outer part <b>411</b> and an inner part <b>412</b>, subjected to the first compression process at the same compression rate, with a reinforcing member <b>413</b> interposed therebetween. The first compression process in which planar wooden pieces cut out from raw wood are separately compressed to be the outer part <b>411</b> and the inner part <b>412</b> is the same as the first to the third embodiments described above.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the grain pattern and the direction of wooden fibers are not clearly shown for the outer part <b>411</b> and the inner part <b>412</b>, since the method of processing wood according to the fourth embodiment is employable regardless of the grain pattern or the direction of wooden fibers in the outer part <b>411</b> and the inner part <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The reinforcing member <b>413</b> is formed from natural fibers such as cotton, hemp, linen, including wooden fiber component such as cellulose, or regenerated cellulose fibers such as rayon. More specifically, the reinforcing member <b>413</b> is formed from a bunch of plural fibers that have a uniform thread-like shape and are arranged in a uniform direction in a high density. When the direction of fibers in such reinforcing member <b>413</b> is set to intersect with the direction of wooden fibers of the wooden piece, i.e., in a direction in which the wooden piece is weak, the bending strength as well as the tensile strength of the compressed wood product after the processing can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">For example, if the outer part <b>411</b> and the inner part <b>412</b> are straight grain wooden pieces similar to the outer part <b>111</b> and the inner part <b>112</b> of the first embodiment, the direction of wooden fibers of the outer part <b>411</b> is arranged substantially parallel with the lengthwise direction of the cover <b>41</b> and the direction of wooden fibers of the inner part <b>412</b> is arranged substantially parallel with the breadthwise direction of the cover <b>41</b>. Thus, if the reinforcing member <b>413</b> is arranged between the outer part <b>411</b> and the inner part <b>412</b> so that the direction of fibers therein forms an angle of 45 degrees with both the direction of wooden fibers of the outer part <b>411</b> and that of the inner part <b>412</b>, the reinforcing member <b>413</b> can function to strengthen the resulting product, in which the outer part <b>411</b> and the inner part <b>412</b> are superimposed, in a direction in which the strength is relatively weak.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a perspective view of a structure of the finished cover <b>41</b> after the second compression process followed by the release of compression and drying, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is a sectional view of the cover <b>41</b> along a line E-E of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, the reinforcing member <b>413</b>, after compressed between the outer part <b>411</b> and the inner part <b>412</b>, partly bites into the surfaces of the outer part <b>411</b> and the inner part <b>412</b>. The reinforcing member <b>413</b> is, however, mainly formed from a component contained in wood and hence has a high affinity with wood. As a result, the reinforcing member <b>413</b>, without damaging the wooden fiber by cutting or the like, is fixed to the surface of the wooden piece in a conforming state.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In addition, under the application of external forces or the changes in temperature or humidity, the reinforcing member <b>413</b> is deformed following the deformation of the cover <b>41</b>, thereby preventing an excessive deformation of the cover <b>41</b>. This is because the reinforcing member <b>413</b> is mainly formed from the component contained in the wood, and Young's modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, and coefficient of moisture expansion of the reinforcing member <b>413</b> are close to Young's modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, and coefficient of moisture expansion of the cover <b>41</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Here, the direction of wooden fibers of the reinforcing member <b>413</b> is not necessarily be uniformly aligned, and may be at random. Still alternatively, the reinforcing member <b>413</b> may be formed from fibers knitted like netting. In addition, the length of each fiber is not necessarily be uniform, and the reinforcing member <b>413</b> may be formed from an extremely thin fabric made of silk or hemp, unwoven fabric, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The material for the reinforcing member <b>413</b> is not limited to what containing a wooden fiber component. For example, carbon fibers may be applicable as the reinforcing member <b>413</b>, and a suitable material to which predetermined fabrics are pasted may be employed as the reinforcing member <b>413</b>. Still alternatively, the reinforcing member <b>413</b> may be formed from a metal sheet or metal netting.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The cover <b>41</b> formed as described above, in combination with another cover (not shown) which is formed similarly to the cover <b>41</b>, constitutes a jacket of an electronic device. A structure and a method of assembly or the like of the jacket for the electronic device, for example, for a digital camera are the same as the structure and the method of assembly or the like of the jacket <b>1</b> for the digital camera <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment, respectively, except for the presence of the reinforcing member <b>413</b> in the former (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">According to the fourth embodiment of the present invention as described above, a compressed wood product can be readily formed and a suitable strength can be provided over a whole area thereof through the two compression processes.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In addition, according to the fourth embodiment, with the reinforcing member arranged between the outer part and the inner part of the cover (compressed wood product), the strength of the cover can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In particular, with the use of the reinforcing member containing wooden fiber component, contraction rate of the reinforcing member is substantially the same as contraction rate of the wooden pieces. Thus, the reinforcing member has a high affinity with wood and quality of product material can be homogenized. Still further, the reinforcing member containing wooden fiber component does not cut into the wooden fibers of the wooden piece itself, thereby further improving the strength of the cover as the compressed wood product without degrading the strength of the wooden piece itself.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Here, the reinforcing member may be applied to one or both of the outer surface of the outer part and the inner surface of the inner part. When the reinforcing member is to be provided on the outer surface of the outer part, the reinforcing member serves as a part of design of the product to further enhance the unique quality of the product, as well as contributing to improve the strength of the compressed wood product. On the other hand, when the reinforcing member is provided on the inner surface of the inner part, the strength of the compressed wood product can be improved without any influence on an appearance thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">When more than two wooden pieces are employed for the manufacturing of the compressed wood product, the reinforcing member may be arranged between at least one pair of adjacent wooden pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Though the exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described above in details as the first to the fourth embodiments, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above. Other embodiments of the present invention will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">(1) An electronically functioning element may be arranged between the outer part and the inner part of the cover. For example, a ground circuit board may be arranged between the outer part and the inner part so that the ground circuit can be connected to the electronic element housed in the jacket. Then, a space for the ground circuit, which may be usually set inside the jacket, is not necessary and hence the space saving is allowed. Further, a metal sheet may be provided between the outer part and the inner part. The metal sheet, in addition to functioning as a reinforcing member, serves as a shielding material to protect the product from electromagnetic waves. Still further, a sheet, a flexible substrate or the like in which an IC chip or various mounted elements are built may be provided between the outer part and the inner part. Then, various functions can be realized in a manufactured electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">When the cover is formed from more than two wooden pieces, the reinforcing member and the electronically functioning element can be arranged at various positions. Such elements may be arranged in combination depending on the use of the cover.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">(2) <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> is a sectional view of a structure of the cover made of a compressed wood product of which outer part and inner part have different thicknesses. The compression rates for an outer part <b>451</b> and an inner part <b>452</b> are the same in the first and the second compression processes. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, a cover <b>45</b> has the outer part <b>451</b> with thickness h<sub>1 </sub>which is smaller than thickness h<sub>2 </sub>of the inner part <b>452</b> (h<sub>1</sub>&lt;h<sub>2</sub>). Since the outer part <b>451</b> is relatively thin, a wooden piece which easily cracks and is difficult to form is employable as a material. For example, a flat grain wooden piece or an end grain wooden piece can be employed for the outer part <b>451</b>. Thus, with the use of a thin wooden piece, the first compression process is simplified and damages such as cracks in the wooden piece can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">On the other hand, with the use of a wooden piece such as a straight grain wooden piece with higher strength as the inner part, the strength of the cover <b>45</b> as a whole can be improved by an amount of increase in the thickness of a part with higher strength, though the entire thickness of the cover itself does not change. When a plate-like wooden piece is subjected to the processing such as bending, and the degree of deformation is different for the outer part and for the inner part in the first compression process, the part with a higher degree of deformation may be set thinner than the easily deformable part.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">(3) Through the adjustment of the thickness of the wooden piece and the shape of the metal mold employed in the first compression process, the compression rate for the outer part and the inner part may be changed for each part. The color tone of the wooden pieces taken from the same species of wood after the compression varies according to the compression rates. More specifically, the higher the compression rate, the more the carbonization of the wooden piece advances to darken the surface color. In addition, the wooden piece subjected to compression at relatively higher compression rate exhibits improved surface smoothness and gloss and is more resistant to stain.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Contrarily, the wooden piece subjected to compression with relatively lower compression rate is softer, though exhibits a smaller change in surface color compared with the wooden piece with relatively higher compression rate. In addition, the wooden piece subjected to compression with relatively lower compression rate keeps more wood-like texture and feels nice. If the compression rate of the wooden piece is set according to the design or the characteristic of a product to be manufactured in view of the above-mentioned features, unique compressed wood products with various color tones can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">For example, the compression rate for the end-grain wooden piece may be set low since the end-grain wooden piece is difficult to form via bending or the like, whereas the compression rate for the straight-grain wooden piece may be set high since the straight-grain wooden piece is easy to form. Then, a compressed wood product can be easily formed from these wooden pieces stacked and compressed together. Thus, with a combination of wooden pieces subjected to compression with different compression rates, suitable strength can be guaranteed along with the provision of a wide variety of color tones and appearance of the products.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">When the compression rate of the wooden piece is set sufficiently high within the range of below limiting compression rate of the wooden piece, the compression brings about not only the change in color tone but carbonization of the wooden piece through burning by the heated metal molds, which turns the wood material into a conductor that functions as an electromagnetic shield. Hence, when the compressed wood product is to be manufactured via the method of processing wood according to the present invention so as to be employed as a jacket for an electronic device, preferably one wooden piece is turned into a conductor by the high compression rate and another wooden piece is made to remain an insulator without carbonization, and the wooden pieces with different characteristics may be placed one on another to form the jacket. For the manufacture of such compressed wood product, at least one of a surface of the outer part and a surface of the inner part facing with each other in the finished product may be carbonized in the first compression process.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Here, since one wooden piece is carbonized, joining of the wooden pieces is not achievable only with sap components. Hence, adhesive is necessary for joining of wooden pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">(4) In the above description, it is assumed that the all wooden pieces are taken out from the same species of wood. However, the wood species may differ for different parts. For example, when the cover for an electronic device is formed with two wooden pieces placed one on another, a species of wood which looks particularly good may be employed as the outer part to improve design property, whereas a strong species of wood is employed as the inner part with the focus on a higher strength. When a combination of wooden pieces taken out from different species of wood is well utilized and processed, a resulting compressed wood product may possess both strength and appearance which cannot be obtained if the wood pieces taken out from one wood species are only employed.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Here, the thickness and the compression rate of each part can be adjusted similarly as described above according to the degree of difficulty of processing of wood employed as the outer part and the inner part.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">(5) With the adjustment of the shape of the metal mold, the advantages of both the first compression process and the second compression process is fully utilized in the processing. More specifically, since each wooden piece is thinner and thus easier to form at the time of the first compression process, the wooden pieces are processed nearly to the finished shape in the first compression process. On the other hand, the degree of deformation in the second compression process is set smaller than in the first compression process. In the second compression process, the wooden pieces may be compressed slightly in the thickness direction. However, the second compression is mainly dedicated to processing that requires high alignment accuracy. For example, joining of wooden pieces, carving of a name of manufacturer or a product name, carving for design purpose, or the like are performed in the second compression process. Thus, when two separate compression processes are fully utilized, highly accurate forming of the wooden piece is allowed.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">(6) The wooden piece may be cut out from the raw wood so as to be in a predetermined three-dimensional shape. An opening or a cut-out portion may be formed simultaneously with the cutting out of the wooden piece from the raw wood. Alternatively, the opening or the cut-out portion may be formed via cutting or punching after the wooden piece is cut out from the raw wood.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">(7) The compressed wood product formed by the method of processing wood according to the embodiment of the present invention can be applied as a jacket material to various electronic devices other than a digital camera, such as a portable communication terminal such as a portable telephone, a personal handyphone system (PHS) or a personal digital assistant (PDA), a portable audio device which mounts audio recording medium such as MD, CD, or cartridge tape to output sound, an IC recorder, a portable television, a portable radio, remote controls of various home appliances, and a digital video. Further, the compressed wood product according to the embodiments can be employed for purposes other than as a jacket for electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Embodiments which are achievable through suitable combination of the above-described first to fourth embodiments and other embodiments listed as (1) to (7) fall within the scope of the present invention. Thus, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
