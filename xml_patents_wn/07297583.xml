<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuits, and more specifically to an apparatus and method of making strained channel complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors having epitaxial lattice-mismatched epitaxial extension and source and drain regions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Both theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that carrier mobility in a transistor can be greatly increased when a stress of sufficient magnitude is applied to the conduction channel of a transistor to create a strain therein. Stress is defined as force per unit area. Strain is a dimensionless quantity defined as the change in a particular dimension of an item: for example, the change in the item's length, versus the initial dimension of that item: for example, its original length, when a force is applied in the direction of that dimension of the item: for example, in the direction of the length of the item's length. Strain can be either tensile or compressive. In p-type field effect transistors, the application of a compressive longitudinal stress, i.e. in the direction of the length of the conduction channel, creates a strain in the conduction channel which is known to increase the drive current of a PFET. However, if that same stress is applied to the conduction channel of an NFET, its drive current decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has been proposed to increase the performance of an NFET and a PFET by applying a tensile longitudinal stress to the conduction channel of an NFET and applying a compressive longitudinal stress to the conduction channel of a PFET. Such proposals have focused on masked processes involving the masking of a PFET portion of the chip and altering the materials used in shallow trench isolation regions near the conduction channel of the PFET to apply a desired stress thereto. Separate steps would then be performed to mask the NFET portion of the chip and alter the materials used in shallow trench isolation regions near the conduction channels of the NFET to apply a desired stress thereto. Other proposals have involved masked processes centered on modulating intrinsic stresses present in spacer features.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Silicon germanium is a desirable lattice-mismatched semiconductor for use in forming strained silicon transistor channels. A strain is created when a second semiconductor is grown onto a single-crystal of a first semiconductor when the two semiconductors are lattice-mismatched to each other. Silicon and silicon germanium are lattice-mismatched to each other such that the growth of one of them onto the other produces a strain in each which can be either tensile or compressive.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Silicon germanium grows epitaxially on silicon having a crystal structure aligned with the silicon crystal structure. However, because silicon germanium normally has a larger crystal structure than silicon, the epitaxially grown silicon germanium becomes internally compressed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In other proposals using strained silicon, a substrate includes a very thick layer of silicon germanium. Alternatively, the bulk substrate consists of single-crystal silicon germanium. In either case, the silicon germanium layer or substrate is known as a relaxed layer because the strain is released by dislocations which form within the silicon germanium layer. When a single-crystal silicon layer is grown epitaxially on a relaxed layer of single-crystal SiGe, a tensile strain is produced in the epitaxially grown silicon crystal layer. This results in improved electron mobility, which improves the performance of an NFET.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, such technique requires the SiGe to be relaxed, which requires that the SiGe layer be very thick, i.e. at least 0.5 to 1.0 μm thick. Improvements in the mobility of holes is difficult to obtain because to do so, the SiGe layer requires a large percentage of germanium, which can result in excessive dislocations in the SiGe crystal, causing yield problems. Further, processing costs can be prohibitive.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other techniques such as graded Ge concentration and chemical mechanical polishing methods are used to improve the quality of the films. However, those techniques are plagued by high cost and high defect density.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, it would be desirable to create a strain in the channel region of a PFET without the use of a thick SiGe crystal region. It would be desirable create a desired strain in a channel region of a device using an epitaxially grown SiGe film in source and drain regions of the PFET.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It would further be desirable for the SiGe film to be formed sufficiently thin to enable the SiGe film to apply a desirably high magnitude stress and avoid the SiGe film from becoming a relaxed film.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It would further be desirable to create a compressive strain to increase hole mobility in the channel region of a PFET by growing an epitaxial layer of SiGe in the source and drain regions of the PFET.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It would further be desirable to provide a process of forming raised source and drain regions extending above a level of the gate dielectric which include the lattice-mismatched semiconductor for creating a desirable strain in the channel region of the PFET.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It would further be desirable to provide a process for creating a desired strain in the channel region of a PFET without creating the same strain in the channel region of the NFET.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It would further be desirable to provide a structure and method for forming a lattice-mismatched semiconductor layer in source and drain regions of a PFET in close proximity to the channel region of the PFET while preventing the lattice-mismatched semiconductor layer from being formed in close proximity to the channel region of an NFET of the same integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It would further be desirable to provide a structure and method for forming a lattice-mismatched semiconductor layer in extension regions of a PFET in close proximity to the channel region of the PFET while preventing the lattice-mismatched semiconductor layer from being formed in extension regions in close proximity to the channel region of an NFET of the same integrated circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an aspect of the invention, a method is provided of fabricating an integrated circuit including a p-type field effect transistor (PFET) and an n-type field effect transistor (NFET). Such method includes forming a PFET gate stack and an NFET gate stack over a first single-crystal semiconductor region having a first composition, the PFET gate stack and the NFET gate stack each having a gate conductor overlying a gate dielectric formed on a main surface of the first region and first spacers including a first material formed on sidewalls of the gate conductor. Second spacers are formed on sidewalls of the first spacers of the PFET gate stack and the NFET gate stack, the second spacers including a second material. Portions of the second material are removed from the second spacers of the PFET gate stack selective to the first material while protecting the second material from being removed from the second spacers of the NFET gate stack. Thereafter, an epitaxial single-crystal semiconductor layer having a second composition is grown on an exposed area of the first region, the epitaxial semiconductor layer being lattice-mismatched to the first region. A PFET source region and a PFET drain region of the PFET are then formed to include at least a portion of the epitaxial semiconductor layer, and an NFET source region and an NFET drain region of the NFET are formed, whereby the epitaxial semiconductor layer applies a stress having a first magnitude to the channel region of the PFET and the epitaxial semiconductor layer does not apply the stress having the first magnitude to the channel region of the NFET.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another aspect of the invention, a method is provided of fabricating an integrated circuit including a p-type field effect transistor (PFET) and an n-type field effect transistor (NFET), each of the NFET and the PFET having a channel region disposed in a first single-crystal region consisting essentially of a first semiconductor. In such method, a PFET source region and a PFET drain region of the PFET are formed in which the PFET source region and the PFET drain region each have a first portion consisting essentially of a second semiconductor, the second semiconductor being lattice-mismatched to the first semiconductor, and the first portions being disposed at a first distance from the channel region of the PFET to apply a stress having a first magnitude to the channel region of the PFET. An NFET source region and an NFET drain region of the NFET are formed in which the NFET source region and the NFET drain region each have a second portion consisting essentially of the second semiconductor, the second portions disposed at a second distance from the channel region of the NFET, and the second distance being greater than the first distance. In that way, the second portions apply a stress having at most a second magnitude to the channel region of the NFET, the second magnitude being lower than the first magnitude.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to yet another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for fabricating an integrated circuit including a p-type field effect transistor (PFET) and an n-type field effect transistor (NFET), each of the PFET and the NFET having a channel region disposed in a first single-crystal semiconductor region of a substrate, and the first region having a first composition. In such method, linearly extending patterns are formed over a main surface of the first region, each of the patterns having a first linearly extending edge and a second linearly extending edge opposite the first edge. A PFET source region and a PFET drain region of the PFET are formed in a manner aligned to the first and second edges of one of the patterns, respectively. The PFET source region and the PFET drain region include first portions having a second semiconductor composition, such that the first portions are lattice-mismatched to the first region. The first portions are disposed at a first distance from the channel region of the PFET to apply a stress having a first magnitude to the channel region of the PFET. An NFET source region and an NFET drain region of the NFET are formed in a manner aligned to the first and second edges of one of the patterns, respectively. The NFET source region and the NFET drain region include second portions having the second semiconductor composition. The second portions are disposed at a second distance from the channel region of the NFET, the second distance being greater than the first distance, such that the second portions apply a stress having at most a second magnitude to the channel region of the NFET, and the second magnitude is lower than the first magnitude.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a p-type field effect transistor (PFET) and an n-type field effect transistor (NFET) according to an embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the NFET <b>10</b> and PFET <b>20</b> are fabricated in a single-crystal semiconductor region <b>14</b> of a substrate <b>16</b>. The substrate <b>16</b> may either be a bulk substrate or may preferably be a semiconductor-on-insulator substrate such as a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate in which a relatively thin single-crystal region of a semiconductor is formed over an insulating layer <b>18</b>. When field effect transistors (FETS) are formed in such SOI substrates, faster switching operation is often achieved than otherwise, because junction capacitance between the channel region of the transistor and the bulk substrate is eliminated. The substrate preferably includes a single-crystal silicon region <b>14</b>, and is more preferably an SOI substrate having a single-crystal silicon region <b>14</b> above an insulating layer <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described in this and the embodiments to follow, reference will be made to the fabrication of NFET and PFET transistors having channel regions disposed within a single-crystal region of a substrate preferably consisting essentially of a first semiconductor such as silicon. As the first semiconductor is preferably silicon, the lattice-mismatched second semiconductor is preferably a different semiconductor such as silicon germanium or silicon carbide, and more preferably silicon germanium (Si<sub>x</sub>Ge<sub>y</sub>) where x and y are percentages where x plus y equals 100 percent. The ranges of variation between x and y can be rather large, y illustratively varying from 1% to 99%, and in such case, x consequently varying between 99% and 1%.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">However, the present invention is not limited to the fabrication of transistors in a pure silicon crystal. The single crystal region of the substrate <b>14</b> may consist essentially of silicon germanium in proportions according to a first formula Si<sub>x1</sub>Ge<sub>y1</sub>, where x<b>1</b> and y<b>1</b> are percentages where x<b>1</b>+y<b>1</b>=100%, and the layer of the second semiconductor consists essentially of silicon germanium in different proportions according to a second formula Si<sub>x2</sub>Ge<sub>y2</sub>, where x<b>1</b> and y<b>1</b> are percentages where x<b>2</b>+y<b>2</b>=100%, x<b>1</b> being not equal to x<b>2</b>, and y<b>1</b> being not equal to y<b>2</b>. The second semiconductor, being lattice-mismatched to the first semiconductor, is formed by epitaxial growth in source and drain regions of the PFET in close proximity to the channel region of the PFET while the lattice-mismatched second semiconductor is simultaneously prevented from being formed in close proximity to the channel region of the NFET.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an aid to understanding principles on which the structure and method of the present embodiments of the invention are founded. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> graphically illustrates magnitudes of compressive stress induced in a single-crystal silicon region of interest by a thin epitaxial layer of silicon germanium that is laterally displaced from the region of interest. The curves in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represent magnitudes of compressive stress, as mapped in relation to lateral displacement from the edge of the region of interest, for different percentage concentrations of germanium in the epitaxial layer.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a SiGe layer having a Ge percentage of 37.5% applies a stress of 350 MPa to a region of a single-crystal silicon at a lateral displacement of 10 nm. However, as the lateral displacement from the SiGe layer is increased, the magnitude of the stress decreases rapidly. For the same Ge percentage of 37.5%, the stress decreases to 150 MPa at a lateral displacement of 30 nm. SiGe layers having lower percentages are also graphed. A SiGe layer having a Ge percentage of 6.25% applies a stress of 75 MPa to a region of single-crystal silicon at a lateral displacement of 10 nm. However, the stress decreases to about 30 MPa when applied at a lateral displacement of 30 nm. The other curves in the chart indicate that stress induced in the channel increases as the Ge content increases.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the layer of silicon germanium <b>38</b> laterally extends to a sidewall of a first spacer <b>30</b> of the PFET <b>20</b> and under second and third spacers <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a stage in processing to form a PFET and an NFET according to an embodiment of the invention.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an embodiment, the gate conductors <b>26</b> of the PFET gate stack and the NFET gate stack are already provided at this stage with desired dopant types and concentrations to provide desirable work functions.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, extension and halo implants are preferably performed into the active area of the single-crystal region <b>14</b> adjacent to the NFET gate stack <b>45</b>, using the NFET gate stack <b>45</b> as a mask to prevent implants from penetrating too deeply into the channel region <b>122</b> below the NFET gate stack <b>45</b>. During such implants, the active area adjacent to the PFET gate stack <b>44</b> is prevented from being implanted, as by a block mask <b>42</b> preferably including a photoresist material.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the block mask <b>42</b> is removed and pairs of first spacers <b>30</b> are formed on the sidewalls of the PFET gate stack <b>25</b> and NFET gate stack <b>45</b>. The spacers <b>30</b> are preferably formed of a deposited nitride such as silicon nitride and are preferably thin, e.g. ranging from 3 nm to 20 nm in thickness, more preferably between 5 nm and 15 nm in thickness, and most preferably about 10 nm in thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, extension and halo implants are preferably performed into the active area of the single-crystal region <b>14</b> adjacent to the PFET gate stack <b>44</b>, using the PFET gate stack <b>44</b> as a mask to prevent implants from penetrating too deeply into the channel region <b>22</b> below the PFET gate stack <b>44</b>. During such implants, the active area adjacent to the NFET gate stack <b>45</b> is prevented from being implanted, as by a block mask <b>43</b> preferably including a photoresist material.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the block mask <b>43</b> is removed and a thick conformal material layer <b>46</b> is deposited over the PFET gate stack <b>44</b> and NFET gate stack <b>45</b>. The conformal material layer <b>46</b> should be insulative rather than conductive or semiconductive in nature. Preferably, the conformal material layer <b>46</b> includes an oxide, preferably being silicon dioxide, and is preferably deposited at a low temperature such as from a tetra-ethylorthosilicate (TEOS) precursor. Hereinafter, the material of this layer <b>46</b> is referred to as “oxide”.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an additional, i.e. a third, pair of spacers <b>48</b> preferably including a nitride material, more preferably being silicon nitride, is formed over the oxide layer <b>46</b> on both the PFET gate stack <b>44</b> and the NFET gate stack <b>45</b>. This process is preferably performed by depositing a conformal layer of silicon nitride and then vertically etching the structure as by a reactive ion etch (RIE) such that the spacers <b>48</b> remain on the sidewalls of the oxide layer <b>46</b> but the conformal nitride layer is removed from horizontal surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, after the nitride spacers <b>48</b> are in place, the oxide layer <b>46</b> is etched, as by RIE selective to nitride, from the top surface of the structures down to the level of the insulating caps <b>50</b> on both the PFET gate stack <b>44</b> and the NFET gate stack <b>45</b>. During such etch the oxide layer <b>46</b> is also removed from areas of the single-crystal region <b>14</b> that extend beyond the nitride spacers <b>48</b> on each of the PFET gate stack <b>44</b> and the NFET gate stack <b>45</b>. During such etch, the nitride spacers <b>48</b> protect the sidewalls of the structures from being etched, and the insulating caps <b>50</b> protect the gate conductors <b>26</b> of the PFET gate stack and the NFET gate stack from damage and/or being etched.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a block mask <b>52</b> is again applied over an area including the NFET gate stack <b>45</b> while the PFET gate stack <b>44</b> remains exposed. The block mask <b>52</b> preferably includes a photoresist material. With the block mask <b>52</b> in place, the oxide layer <b>46</b> adhering to the PFET gate stack <b>44</b> is undercut, as by an isotropic wet chemical etch selective to nitride. This results in the oxide layer <b>46</b> having the appearance shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. As a result of this etch, the main surface <b>54</b> of the single-crystal semiconductor region <b>14</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a single-crystal layer of a second semiconductor, lattice-mismatched to the first semiconductor, is epitaxially grown onto the main surface of the single-crystal semiconductor region <b>14</b>. As described above relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the second semiconductor is preferably silicon germanium having a higher percentage of germanium than that of the single-crystal semiconductor region <b>14</b>, whether or not that region <b>14</b> has any germanium content or not. In the PFET region, this layer <b>38</b> is formed under the undercut portion <b>56</b> of the oxide layer <b>46</b> such that it applies a compressive stress in close proximity to the channel region <b>22</b> of the PFET <b>20</b>, the layer <b>38</b> being laterally spaced from the channel region <b>22</b> only by the first nitride spacer <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">On the other hand, in the NFET the silicon germanium layer <b>39</b> is not formed in as close proximity to the gate conductor <b>26</b> such that it does not apply a compressive stress to the channel region <b>122</b> of the NFET in as great a magnitude as the compressive stress applied to the channel region <b>22</b> of the PFET because a compressive stress hinders electron mobility in an NFET. However, if the lattice-mismatched semiconductor layer that induces the stress is displaced an adequate distance from the channel region <b>122</b> of the NFET <b>10</b>, then the compressive stress can be tolerated, as described above relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Additionally, parameters of the spacers <b>30</b> and oxide layer <b>46</b> can be tailored to apply a lower magnitude counter stress to improve electron mobility in the NFET. Such counter stress would be applied as a low magnitude tensile stress to counter the effects of the low magnitude compressive stress applied by the silicon germanium layer <b>39</b> in the NFET channel region <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A final processing stage of this embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. During this stage of processing, source and drain regions <b>24</b> of the PFET <b>20</b> are implanted into the single-crystal region <b>14</b> using the PFET gate stack <b>44</b> structure including the gate conductor <b>26</b>, first spacers <b>30</b>, second spacers <b>32</b> and third spacers <b>34</b> as a mask while areas of the NFET <b>10</b> are protected from such implanting by a block mask (not shown). In a preferably separate implant step, source and drain regions <b>24</b> of the NFET <b>10</b> are implanted into the single-crystal region <b>14</b> using the NFET gate stack <b>45</b> including the gate conductor <b>26</b>, first spacers <b>30</b>, second spacers <b>32</b> and third spacers <b>34</b> as a mask while the PFET <b>20</b> is protected from such implanting by a block mask (not shown). Thereafter, high temperature processing can be performed to anneal the implanted source and drain regions <b>24</b> and to drive the implanted dopant to the desired depth and lateral dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">At this time, the nitride insulating caps <b>50</b> are removed from the PFET gate stack <b>44</b> and the NFET gate stack <b>45</b>. Preferably, a silicide-forming metal is then deposited over the structures shown and then reacted by high temperature processing with the semiconductor material of a polysilicon gate conductor <b>26</b> in contact therewith and with the layers <b>38</b> and <b>39</b> of silicon germanium in contact therewith to form a self-aligned silicide (“salicide”) <b>40</b>. Alternatively, following the high temperature anneal of the source and drain regions <b>24</b>, the nitride insulating caps <b>50</b> and the polysilicon gate conductors <b>26</b> can be removed from between the spacers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> as by RIE selective to nitride and oxide and a metal replacement gate be formed in its place. In such alternative process, the gate dielectric formed prior thereto preferably functions as an etch stop layer, i.e. as a sacrificial layer, for the polysilicon RIE. The first formed gate dielectric is removed after the RIE removal of the polysilicon gate <b>26</b> due to damage suffered by that layer during RIE. Thereafter, a second gate dielectric <b>27</b> is deposited in the place formerly occupied by the removed first gate dielectric. The metal gate conductor is then deposited in the openings formed thereby between the spacers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> as a conformal layer over the layers <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> of the single-crystal silicon germanium. In such way, a metal replacement gate is formed after substantially completing processing of the PFET <b>20</b> and NFET <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Another embodiment of a PFET <b>220</b> and an NFET <b>210</b> formed according to the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In this embodiment, as many as four pairs of spacers are utilized in the NFET <b>210</b> for displacing raised silicided source and drain regions <b>224</b> a desirable distance from the channel region of the NFET <b>210</b> and for displacing raised silicided source and drain regions <b>224</b> a desirable distance from the channel region of the PFET <b>220</b>. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a lattice-mismatched semiconductor layer <b>238</b> of a PFET is formed as a raised layer contacting the single-crystal semiconductor region <b>214</b> in close proximity to the channel region <b>322</b> of the PFET. In the NFET <b>210</b>, a lattice-mismatched semiconductor layer <b>239</b> is formed as a raised layer but not in as close proximity to the channel region <b>222</b> of the NFET <b>210</b> due to the presence of an additional spacer <b>231</b> between the layer <b>239</b> and the channel region <b>222</b>. In this embodiment, a compressive stress is applied in different magnitudes to the channel regions <b>222</b>, <b>322</b> of both the NFET and PFET by the layers <b>239</b>, <b>238</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this embodiment, the amount of a strain created in the channel region of the NFET <b>210</b> can be tailored based on the width <b>240</b> of the second spacer <b>231</b>. As discussed above, a greater lateral displacement of the layer <b>239</b> from the channel region <b>222</b> of the NFET <b>210</b> creates a lower strain in the channel region <b>222</b> of the NFET. Lower strain, in turn, affects electron mobility in the NFET <b>210</b> less negatively than a higher strain. In this embodiment, such lower strain can be achieved by the use of an appropriately sized spacer consisting essentially of a material such as silicon nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The spacer <b>231</b> has a width <b>240</b> determined by a thickness of a deposited conformal silicon nitride material. If still lower strain is needed in the channel region <b>222</b> of the NFET <b>210</b>, the thickness of the silicon nitride spacer <b>231</b> can be made larger by depositing that layer to a greater thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Stages in fabrication of the embodiment will now be described relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 through 18</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a PFET gate stack <b>244</b> and an NFET gate stack <b>245</b> each include a polysilicon gate <b>226</b> overlying a gate dielectric <b>227</b> preferably of a thermally grown oxide on a single-crystal semiconductor region <b>214</b> of a substrate such as a single-crystal silicon region. Insulating caps <b>250</b> overlie the polysilicon gates <b>226</b>. Pairs of first spacers <b>230</b> are formed on sidewalls of the polysilicon gates <b>226</b> after patterning and etching the gate stack structures <b>244</b>, <b>245</b>. These first spacers <b>230</b> are preferably thin, ranging in width between 3 nm and 20 nm, more preferably between 5 nm and 15 nm, and most preferably about 10 nm in width.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">After forming the spacers <b>230</b>, halo and extension ion implants are performed into source and drain regions (not shown) of the PFET <b>220</b> and the NFET <b>210</b> adjacent to the spacers, preferably by block masking NFET regions while implanting the PFET regions and then block masking PFET regions while implanting the NFET regions. Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, second pairs of spacers <b>231</b> are formed on sidewalls of the first pairs of spacers <b>230</b>. This is done by a process of depositing a conformal material such as silicon nitride, and thereafter vertically etching the structure, as by RIE, to provide the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a block mask <b>243</b> is applied over the NFET gate stack <b>245</b> and adjacent areas. The second spacers <b>231</b> are then removed from the PFET gate stack <b>244</b>. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a layer of silicon germanium <b>238</b> is selectively grown over the single-crystal region <b>214</b> of the substrate. Due to presence of the second spacers <b>231</b> on sidewalls of the NFET gate stack <b>245</b>, the layer <b>238</b> of silicon germanium is laterally displaced from the channel region <b>222</b> of the NFET by a greater distance (e.g. by the width <b>240</b> of the spacer <b>231</b>) than it is to the channel region <b>322</b> of the PFET. In such manner, greater hole mobility is achieved in the PFET without severely affecting electron mobility in the NFET.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, further spacers <b>232</b> and <b>234</b> are formed. These spacers <b>232</b> and <b>234</b> are used to space the final raised silicided source and drain regions <b>224</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) from the channel regions <b>222</b> and <b>322</b> of the NFET and the PFET respectively. These spacers <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> preferably include nitride and oxide, respectively. Preferably, spacer <b>232</b> consists essentially of nitride and spacer <b>234</b> consists essentially of oxide. During this process, additional RIE etches are performed, resulting in the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Finally, self-aligned silicide layers <b>224</b> are formed in areas of layer <b>238</b> that are not covered by the gate stacks <b>244</b> and <b>245</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A further embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref>. In contrast to the embodiment illustrated relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-18</figref>, in this embodiment, the silicon germanium layer <b>338</b> does not form a part of the NFET structure <b>310</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. Rather, that layer <b>338</b> is disposed only in the PFET structure <b>320</b>. In such manner, a compressive stress is applied to the channel region <b>422</b> of the PFET <b>320</b> but not to the channel region <b>423</b> of the NFET <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A process for fabricating the PFET <b>320</b> and NFET <b>310</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>.
