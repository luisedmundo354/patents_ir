<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention provides, in one embodiment, a method for accessing an operative space within a patient. The method can employ a multifunctional, multi-piece medical device, such as for use with a vacuum lift shell. The method provides flow communication between the external environment and operative field inside the patient's body during medical procedures, including diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical procedures. The invention allows entry and exit of air or gas to help create and maintain the operative field. The invention can be used to provide an open and unobstructed working path, and allows the operative space to be maintained at ambient conditions of pressure and temperature.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention is related to medical devices and methods, and more specifically to methods useful in performing vacuum assisted surgery, such as laparascopic surgery without insufflation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventional minimally invasive procedure requires the use of gas (such as carbon dioxide) insufflation to lift the tissue or body wall from internal organs, thereby separating the body wall from the internal organs to create an operative space to introduce various surgical instruments to conduct the procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following patents disclose various tools for medical or surgical applications: US20030065358A1, U.S. Pat. No. 6,120,437A1, U.S. Pat. No. 6,099,550A1, U.S. Pat. No. 5,865,802A1, U.S. Pat. No. 5,823,947A1, U.S. Pat. No. 5,797,939A1, U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,169A1, U.S. Pat. No. 5,456,684A1, U.S. Pat. No. 5,336,220A1, U.S. Pat. No. 5,186,714A1, EP0614646B1, WO0193742A2.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following patents disclose examples of medical devices, including trocar and instrument assemblies: US200383628A1, US 20030060770A1, US 20030023257A1, US20030004529A1, US20030004528A1, U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Though insufflation is commonly used, non-gas based methods have been proposed. For example, such methods may use mechanical devices wherein the tissue is lifted externally or by provided internal stirrup like supports of different mechanical assemblies to lift the tissue to create the operative space without the use of gas. One method employs a vacuum actuated tissue lifting device. The following US patents are incorporated herein by reference for disclosure related to lifting devices and methods, including vacuum lifting devices and methods: U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,539, U.S. Pat. No. 5,938,626, U.S. Pat. No. 5,893,368.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,539 describes a vacuum shell and provides a “dome” like operative field within the patient. An optical trocar having an obturator and cannula sleeve may be employed with such a vacuum shell. However, there can be difficulties related to use of such a trocar with vacuum assisted surgery and/or surgery without insufflation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For instance, conventional trocars can have a working length that is not sufficient for such an application (working length can be defined as the actual length of the tubular section of a trocar below the sealing surface of the trocar). On the other hand, a trocar with an increased length may be difficult to maneuver and may restrict movement during the surgical procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additionally, it may not be desirable to use a conventional bladed trocar with a vacuum shell or other vacuum lift device, due to the possibility of accidental contact with internal organs during a first “blind” entry into the body cavity. Even if an optical obturator is employed, skill is still required to introduce and monitor the position of the trocar tip simultaneously. Also, introducing the camera assembly into the trocar obturator can result in a bulky (difficult to handle) assembly during the step of penetrating the body tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, a conventional trocar which has a fixed length may not be suitable for all patients. Different patients can have different thicknesses of the abdominal wall and/or the fatty layers associated with the abdominal wall. For example, a thin or normal weight patient may require a trocar having a certain length, while a relatively obese patient may require a longer trocar.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another problem with using a conventional trocar in vacuum assisted surgery is that when the trocar is inserted after the vacuum shell is placed on the tissue, the trocar will first cut through the perforable membrane of the shell, then pass into the patient's tissue. If the user attempts to penetrate the body wall without the application of vacuum to the vacuum shell, body wall will tend to buckle under the penetration force, and it is possible that internal organs could be injured. On the other hand, if the conventional trocar is inserted after applying vacuum and obtaining a partial or full lift of the abdominal wall from the internal organs, the internal body cavity and organs below the abdominal wall may also “lift”. Movement of the bowels under peristalsis can become sluggish due to the effects of anesthesia, which may lead to the formation of pockets of trapped gases. These trapped gases can expand under vacuum, and may result in reduced operative space and increased gas pressure in the lumens of the bowel. Also, in the case of abdominal surgery, the time during which the intra abdominal cavity is under vacuum can lead to pulling of the diaphragm into the abdominal cavity, and can create a negative pressure in the thoracic cavity.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Applicants have recognized the drawbacks of the use of conventional trocars with vacuum lift devices, and that there is a need for an improved device for providing access to the inside of the body when vacuum lift devices are employed. Applicants have recognized the need for a multicomponent passageway for use as a fluid (e.g. air) conduit with a vacuum shell. Applicants have also recognized the desirability of such an assembly to be of sufficient length to take into account the gap between the tissue's external surface and the vacuum shell before vacuum application (approx. 75-100 mm) plus the tissue wall thickness to be penetrated to access the intra operative space.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the invention provides a medical device comprising a multicomponent passageway for providing access to an internal space in a patient, the device comprising a first elongate, hollow member having proximal end, a distal end, and an internal lumen; a second elongate member having an open proximal end, an open distal end, and an internal lumen providing a passagweay extending therethrough; and wherein the first member is releasably attachable to the second member to provide a generally continuous internal lumen. The distal end of the first member can be positioned intermediate the proximal and distal ends of the second member upon attachment of the second member to the first member.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, the invention provides an assembly comprising a vacuum device for providing an operative space within a patient; and a multicomponent device for providing access from a point external of the vacuum device to a point within the patient. The multicomponent device can comprise detachable first and second members, the first member for providing a first portion of an access passageway, and the second member for providing a second poriton of an access passageway.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for performing a medical procedure. The method can comprise the steps of separating one portion of a patient's body from another portion of the patient's body to provide an operative space within the patient's body; and accessing the operative space through a multicomponent passageway.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The multifunctional, multicomponent passageway device can provide bi directional movement of air. The device and its method of use is such that it allows placement and access to the body cavity below the body wall before the application of vacuum with a vacuum lift device, thereby avoiding the problems related to the body cavity being under vacuum, or bowel dilation. The multimember design can provide flexibility to vary the length of the device. The device and method of the present invention can avoid potential difficulties of a first blind entry by not requiring a forced penetration or use of a sharp or pointed end to penetrate through the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A multicomponent passageway device of the present invention can help assure that the operative space created by lifting is maintained at ambient conditions (e.g. ambient pressure conditions). The device, due to its inner lumen, can also be used for passage of camera and or instruments including but not restricted to laparoscopic hand instruments during a procedure. The bi directional passage of air to maintain the ambient conditions in the body cavity may be maintained even when an instrument is passed through the device. The device of the present invention can accommodate insertion of diagnostic probes, such as, but not limited to, ultrasonic laparoscopic probes or catheter based probes through its inner lumen for intra-operative diagnostic procedures. The device can also allow removal of excised or extirpated tissue through its inner lumen during the surgical procedure (as it offers an unobstructed pathway which is devoid of any valve or flow control assembly such as is typically present in an conventional trocar) and without loss of operative space. The device according to the present invention, due to its open communication with the external ambient environment, can also provide venting of fumes which may be generated during use of electro surgical equipments for cutting or coagulation of internal tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Upon release of vacuum and removal of the vacuum lift shell, the multicomponent passageway device of the present invention can also provide a channel for easy release of any air trapped in pockets of the internal body cavity. After release of vacuum and removal of the shell, the device can provide a channel for placement of a drainage catheter to drain body fluids post operatively. Also, if desired, a cannula component can be left in the incision and closed with a substantially tight cap, post operatively, to provide a port to the internal body cavity for visualization for possible bleeding or any such post operative complications.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Without being limited by theory, the multifunctional, multi member conduit device provided by the present invention can be used in medical procedures such as but not limited to gasless minimally invasive procedures using an external vacuum actuated tissue lifting device, to provide a passage way for bi directional movement of air to maintain the operative field at ambient conditions of temperature and pressure, for introducing instruments and medical camera etc, that may be used during the operative procedure i.e. diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical, for removal of extirpated/excised tissue, for clearance of fumes generated during use of electro surgical device, for cutting or coagulation etc, and for drainage of body fluids intra-operative or post operatively.</p>

Sealing sleeve <b>434</b> can be formed of a relatively flexible material, such as a flexible polyurethane, silicone, polypropylene, polyisoprene, or rubber. Sealing sleeve <b>434</b> can be disposed about the outer surface of cannula <b>233</b>, such that sleeve <b>434</b> fits snugly about the outer diameter of the cannula <b>233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref>, the cannula extension <b>132</b> can have any suitable cross-section, including circular and non-circular cross-sections. The cannula extension <b>132</b> can have an open proximal end <b>142</b> and a distal end <b>144</b> which may be open or closed. The cannula extension can include an internal lumen <b>140</b> which extends from a proximal end <b>142</b> to a distal end <b>144</b> of the cannula extension <b>132</b>. Both the cannula extension and the internal lumen can have circular cross sections, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3-6</figref>, or non-circular, generally oval cross-sections as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref>. Alternatively, the cannula extension <b>132</b> could have a generally cylindrical outer surface, and the inner lumen <b>140</b> could have a non-circular cross-section. The cannula extension <b>132</b> is shown as a single, unitary component, but cannula extension <b>132</b> could be in the form of multiple components if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The cannula extension <b>132</b> can have a length (as measured from the proximal end to the pointed tip <b>138</b>) of at least about 100 mm (millimeters), and in one embodiment the length of the cannula extension can be between about 100 mm and about 175 mm, and can be at least about six times the outer diameter of the cannula extension <b>132</b>. The outer diameter of the cannula extension <b>132</b> can be about 15 mm, and the inside diameter of lumen <b>140</b> can be about 12.75 mm, such as to accommodate 10 mm sized hand instruments. Without being limited by theory, when 10 mm sized instruments are to be employed, it is believe that it can be desirable to have an inner diameter of at least about 12.75 mm to provide flow area around instruments introduced through lumen <b>140</b>. If a non-circular lumen is employed, a inside lumen with an inside dimension of at least 12.75 mm can be employed to provide flow around such an introduced instrument (e.g. if an oval or elliptical shaped cross section is employed, it can be desirable to have the major axis be at least about 12.75 mm, and the minor axis to be at least about 11 mm). It will be understood that the outside and inside diameters may be varied for different applications (e.g. reduced for smaller diameter 5 mm or 3 mm minimally invasive instrument sets).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The cannula extension <b>132</b> can include a pointed tip <b>138</b> associated with distal end <b>144</b>. The pointed tip <b>138</b> can be provided for piercing through a portion of a vacuum shell membrane. The main body portion of cannula extension <b>132</b> can have a generally cylindrical outer surface, and a distal portion of cannula extension <b>132</b> can have a tapered, generally conical outer surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>. One or more lateral openings <b>137</b> (or “windows”) can extend through the wall of the tapered distal portion of the cannula extension <b>132</b> to provide communication from the inner lumen <b>140</b> through the outer surface of the cannula extension <b>132</b>.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The openings <b>137</b> can have any suitable shape. It can be desirable that the openings <b>137</b> have a combined surface area of at least about 30 square millimeters to provide sufficient air passage, such as to help in avoiding the occurance of a negative pressure (vacuum) inside the body cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Cannula extension <b>132</b> can also include an attachment portion <b>139</b> for releasably attaching the cannula extension <b>132</b> to the cannula <b>233</b>. The attachment portion <b>139</b> can be in the form of external screw threads for allowing the cannula extension <b>132</b> to be releasably attached to the cannula by threaded engagement in screw-like fashion, though other attachment means (e.g. latching mechanisms, press fits, snap fits, and other releasable fastening devices) could be employed.

The bifurcated distal portion <b>160</b> can be formed by cutting or otherwise forming the distal end of the cannula extension <b>132</b>. For instance, the distal end of the cannula extension <b>132</b> can be cut or formed to have a slit <b>167</b> extending generally parallel to the axis of the cannula extension <b>132</b> to generally bisect the distal end of the cannula extension <b>132</b>. The distal portion <b>160</b> can be formed of a flexible material, such rubber, silicone rubber, or a suitable flexible polymeric material so that tip portions <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> can be easily spread apart (as shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates how bifurcated distal portion <b>160</b> can be separated to allow introduction of a laparoscope <b>1012</b> (shown in phantom) therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the proximal portion of the cannula extension <b>132</b> can be formed from a generally cylindrical, relatively rigid and generally transparent polycarbonate tube <b>180</b>, and the distal portion <b>160</b> can be formed of rubber or other relatively flexible material, with distal portion <b>160</b> being joined to the tube <b>180</b> at a flexible hinge portion <b>170</b>. Hinge portion <b>170</b> can have a corrugated or bellows-like wall construction to provide for bending of distal portion <b>160</b> relative to the polycarbonate tube <b>180</b>. Hinge portion <b>170</b> can be attached to tube <b>180</b> by any suitable method, including without limitation by interference fit, press fit, snap fit, adhesive, or by threaded engagement. If desired, one or more surfaces on the distal portion <b>160</b> can be employed to provide sealing engagement with an abutting surface on the cannula <b>233</b>. For instance, one of the inclined surfaces on the hinge portion <b>170</b> can be used to form a seal against an abutting surface on the cannula <b>233</b>. Also, in an alternative embodiment, the grooves of the hinge portion <b>170</b> can be employed to mate with complimentary grooves which can be provided on the cannula extension <b>132</b> to provide releasable attachment of the cannula extension <b>132</b> and the cannula <b>233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>10</b> illustrate a cannula <b>233</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The cannula <b>233</b> can have any suitable cross sectional shape (e.g. circular or non-circular, such as oval), which cross-sectional shape can be the same as, or different from the cross sectional shape of the cannula extension <b>132</b>. The cannula <b>233</b> can have a proximal end <b>238</b> and a distal end <b>236</b>, with an internal lumen <b>242</b> extending from the proximal end to the distal end. The cannula <b>233</b> can have any suitable cross sectional shape, including circular and non-circular cross-sections (e.g. oval) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref> and FIGS. <b>15</b>,<b>17</b>. The distal end <b>236</b> can be beveled to form a beveled tip, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, for easy entry through any incision. The wall thickness of the cannula can be uniform or can vary along the length of the cannula. For instance, the wall thickness at the distal end <b>236</b> may be varied for easy penetration through an incision.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The cannula <b>233</b> can have a length of at least about 100 mm, and in one embodiment the cannula has a length between about 100 mm and about 175 mm. The length of the cannula <b>233</b> can be greater than, less than, or substantially the same length as that of the cannula extension <b>132</b>. When 10 mm size instruments are to be introduced through the cannula <b>233</b>, the outside diameter of the cannula can be about 15 mm, and the inside diameter of the internal lumen <b>242</b> can be at least about 12.75 mm. The dimensions of the cannula <b>233</b> can be varied, such as by being reduced for use with smaller 5 mm or 3 mm instrument sets. Generally, it is desirable that the outer diameter and shape of the cannula and the cannula extension be substantially the same to avoid leakage through the vacuum shell membrane. In one embodiment, the minimum inner diameter of both the cannula and the cannula extension can be at least about 12.75 mm to provide a continuous, uninterrupted air passageway with or without instruments extending through the cannula and cannula extension.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The cannula <b>233</b> can include one or more lateral openings through the wall of the cannula, such as circular eyelets <b>235</b>. For instance, two or more circular eyelets <b>235</b> can be spaced at generally equal angular intervals around the circumference of outside surface of cannula <b>233</b>. If desired, a relatively larger eyelet <b>235</b>A can be positioned along the longest side of the beveled tip <b>236</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The eyelets extend through the wall of the cannula and provide fluid (e.g. gas such as air) communication from internal lumen <b>242</b> to the outside of the cannula. The eyelets can be positioned proximally of the beveled tip, and in one embodiment the eyelets <b>235</b> can be spaced a maximum of about 5-10 mm from the edge of the beveled tip as measured parallel to the axis of the cannula <b>233</b>. The eyelets can provide an air passageway for air from cannula extension <b>132</b> through cannula <b>233</b> and into the internal body cavity in the event the distal end <b>236</b> of cannula is blocked for any reasons (e.g. such as by end <b>236</b> being positioned against a tissue or organ mass).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The cannula can also include an attachment portion <b>243</b>, such as internal grooves or an internal threaded portion for releasably attaching the proximal end of the cannula <b>233</b> to the cannula extension <b>132</b>.

The cap <b>331</b> can include a main body portion <b>357</b> and an attachment portion <b>356</b> such as an external threaded portion. The relatively large outside diameter of body portion <b>357</b> provides a handle for gripping by the user. External threaded portion <b>356</b> can be formed to engage the threaded portions of the cannula extension <b>132</b> and the cannula <b>233</b>, such that cap <b>331</b> can be releasably attached to the proximal end of either cannula extension <b>132</b> or cannula <b>233</b>. The cap <b>331</b> can have an internal, central bore <b>358</b> which can be of substantially the same size (e.g. same diameter) as the internal lumen <b>140</b> and the internal lumen <b>242</b>.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27-29</figref> illustrate a sealing sleeve <b>434</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention.

A central bore <b>470</b> extends through sleeve <b>434</b>. Central bore <b>470</b> can be sized so that sleeve <b>434</b> can snugly fit around and slide along the length of the outside surface of cannula <b>233</b>. The sleeve can be formed of a relatively flexible material such as rubber, so that flange portion <b>468</b> can contour to contours of the patient's body. A bottom surface <b>469</b> of the flange <b>468</b> can be coated with or otherwise provided with an adhesive, such as a pressure sensitive adhesive coating or other suitable adhesive. A release liner (not shown) can be used to cover the adhesive prior to time of use, and the release liner can be pealed from the flange surface at the time of use to expose the adhesive coating. The adhesive coating provided on surface <b>469</b> can be used to temporarily attach the sleeve <b>434</b> to an outer surface of the patient's body, so that flange <b>468</b> helps in supporting the cannula <b>233</b> when the cannula is inserted into an incision in the patient's body. The surface <b>469</b> can also be provided with a medicinal substance, such as a medicinal substance selected from the group of substances consisting of hemostatic substances, anti-microbial substances, antibacterial substances, pain reducing agents, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref> illustrate an alternative embodiment of a cannula extension labeled with reference number <b>1044</b>. Cannula extension <b>1044</b> is shown having a generally oval shaped cross-section and an internal lumen <b>1045</b> having a generally oval shaped cross-section. FIGS. <b>15</b>,<b>16</b> &amp; <b>17</b> illustrate an alternative embodiment of a cannula labeled with reference number <b>2049</b>. Cannula <b>2049</b> is shown having a generally oval shaped cross-section and having an internal lumen <b>2052</b> having a generally oval shaped cross-section. The cannula extension <b>1044</b> can be releasably joined to cannula <b>2049</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Employing internal lumens having oval cross-sections or other non-circular cross-sections may be advantageous for accommodating instruments having a large width dimension that can be inserted so that the large width dimension is aligned with the long axis of the oval cross-section. An oval cross-section may also be useful for simultaneously receiving multiple instruments, such as in side by side relationship. An oval cross-section may also be useful in retrieving larger tissue samples through the cannula <b>2049</b>. An oval cross-section may also aid in reducing the stretching of tissue around the incision in the patient. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, the non-circular cross-section of lumen <b>2049</b> can also leave gaps <b>2055</b> on either side of a circular instrument <b>2050</b> inserted in the lumen, so that an air passage is maintained through the cannula <b>2049</b> even when the instrument is positioned in the lumen <b>2049</b>. The relatively large cross-section provided by an oval shape can also provide for a larger flow volume through the lumen <b>2049</b>, which may be desirable in applications where fast air pass or a large quantity of air is required. For example, when the tissue is lifted with a vacuum shell using a very high capacity vacuum, if the air passageway is not large enough, a partial vacuum effect may be created inside the body cavity for a short period of time. A non-circular design such as an oval shaped cross-section can avoid such a partial vacuum effect by providing gaps <b>2055</b> around the instrument <b>2050</b>, as well as providing a large flow area when the instrument is not present.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An non-circular cross-section such as an oval cross-section can be employed to accommodate an instrument which would not pass through a circular cross-section having an internal diameter comparable to the minor dimension of the non circular cross-section. Alternatively, an oval cross section may also be employed to accommodate multiple instruments of smaller profiles simultaneously. An oval or non-circular cross-section may also be useful for use in extracting relatively large excised tissue through the cannula and cannula extension. The non-circular cross-section can cause the tissue to be squeezed in one direction while allowing it to expand in the other when passing through such a cannula and cannula extension. Without being limited by theory, an oval or similar non-circular cross-section may also reduce the stretching of the tissue around the incision <b>59</b> through which it passes. Further, a non-circular shape may be employed to provide larger area for passage of air and thus help in applications where fast air pass or a larger quantity of air passage is desired (for example when the tissue is lifted by using a very high capacity vacuum, if the lumen of device is not large enough, a partial vacuum effect may be created inside the body cavity for a short period of time. A non-circular lumen cross-section can be employed to avoid such a partial vacuum by providing a relatively large flow area even when the instrument <b>51</b> is present.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The method of use of the multifunctional device <b>30</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-26</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, with the patient lying on his/her back during the procedure, an incision <b>59</b> can be made through the body wall <b>60</b> (or other tissue which is to be lifted) to obtain access to the internal body cavity <b>67</b>. Once the incision is made, it is kept open using artery forceps or retractors and the cannula <b>233</b> of the multifunctional device <b>30</b> can be introduced into the body cavity <b>67</b> such that beveled tip <b>236</b> and the multiple eyelets <b>235</b> are all disposed inside the body cavity. Markings can be provided on the external surface of the cannula <b>233</b> to help the surgeon determine the depth of insertion to avoid leakage of air or slippage of the cannula extension into the body cavity. If desired, the outside surface of the cannula <b>233</b> can include grooves or ridges (such as coaxial ring grooves along a length of the outside surface of the cannula <b>233</b>) to help prevent slipping of the cannula <b>233</b> in the incision, and to help provide an air seal between the borders of the incision and the outer surface of the cannula <b>233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Once the cannula extension is inserted to the required depth, incision may be sutured using a purse string technique to make it air tight around the cannula extension <b>233</b>. Additional the sealing sleeve <b>434</b> can be slid downwards over the cannula extension <b>233</b> towards the incision <b>59</b>. The protective release liner can be removed from the adhesive coated surface <b>469</b> of flange <b>468</b> on the sleeve <b>434</b>. The flange <b>468</b> can then be pressed onto the external surface of body wall <b>60</b> surrounding the incision <b>59</b> to make it airtight. In addition to the adhesive coating, the surface <b>469</b> may also be coated with other active agents such as anti microbial agents, wound healing agents, hemostatic agents, and the like for additional activity and use of the sealing sleeve. Alternatively instead of an adhesive coating a gel like coating may also be used to make the seal substantially air tight. In addition to providing sealing at the incision, the sleeve <b>434</b> can also help stabilize the cannula extension <b>233</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Once the incision is made sufficiently airtight, the vacuum shell <b>61</b> is placed on the outside surface of the body wall <b>60</b> (e.g the outer skin off the abdomen) such that at least one perforable membrane <b>62</b> of the vacuum shell is above the cannula extension <b>233</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. The pointed tip <b>138</b> of the cannula extension <b>132</b> can be used to penetrate the perforable membrane <b>62</b> of the vacuum shell to form an opening <b>63</b> in the membrane <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>). The cap <b>331</b> can be joined to the cannula extension <b>132</b> and can serve as a handle to provide grip for advancement of the cannula extension <b>132</b>. The cannula extension <b>132</b> can then be pushed distally toward the incision and aligned with the proximal end of the cannula <b>233</b>. The pointed tip <b>138</b> can be inserted into the cannula <b>233</b>, and the extension <b>132</b> can be releasably attached to the member <b>233</b>, such as by threaded engagement, friction fit, or any other suitable releasable attachment mechanism, thereby providing an assembly of the cannula <b>233</b>, the extension <b>132</b>, the sleeve <b>434</b>, and the cap. With the components assembled, vacuum can be provided to the vacuum shell. <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Vacuum applied using the shell <b>61</b> results in air being drawn from the space <b>66</b>, as illustrated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. The vacuum causes body wall <b>59</b> to lift upwards towards the shell <b>61</b>. Simultaneously, air from the external ambient environment can enter body cavity <b>67</b> through device <b>30</b>, by passing through the inner lumens of the hollow cannula <b>233</b> and the hollow cannula extension <b>132</b>. Air can enter into the device <b>30</b> through the cap <b>31</b>, pass through its inner lumen <b>458</b>, then through inner lumen <b>140</b> of cannula extension <b>132</b>. The air can then pass through the distal end of extension <b>132</b> by passing through the fluid passage windows <b>137</b>, to enter lumen <b>242</b> of the cannula <b>233</b>. The air can then flow into the body cavity through the beveled tip <b>236</b> and/or through the plurality of eyelets <b>235</b>/<b>235</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The amount of air drawn into the body cavity depends, to some extent, on the size of the inner lumen of the device <b>30</b> as assembled, as well as the size of the windows <b>137</b> and the opening at the beveled tip <b>236</b>, and the rate and level of vacuum applied to the vacuum shell. By providing a continuous fluid passage through the assembled device <b>30</b>, the air drawn into the body cavity <b>67</b> will be sufficient to balance the effect of the vacuum applied by the vacuum shell and to maintain body cavity <b>67</b> at an ambient condition of pressure and also avoid any lifting or bloating or distension of internal organs <b>65</b> below the body wall.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Cap <b>31</b> can be employed to help avoid slippage of the device <b>30</b> into the body cavity or below the shell <b>61</b>. During the entire procedure the multifunctional, multicomponent device <b>30</b> can serve to provide communication path for fluids and/or devices from the external environment outside the patient to the internal body cavity <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As complete vacuum lift is obtained, the external surface of the body wall <b>60</b> can contact the internal surface of the vacuum shell <b>61</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. Due to this lift an operative space is created in the body cavity <b>67</b>. The device <b>30</b> as assembled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> can then be retracted proximally as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> until the junction of the cannula <b>233</b> and the cannula extension <b>132</b> is postioned externally of the perforable membrane <b>62</b> of the shell <b>61</b>. Cap <b>331</b> can be grasped for pulling the device <b>30</b> proximally. Depth markings on the external surface of cannula <b>233</b> can be used to a minimum desirable length of the cannula <b>233</b> remains within the space in the body cavity <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The cannula extension <b>132</b> can be detached from the cannula <b>233</b>, and cap <b>331</b> can be detached from cannula extension <b>132</b> and releasably attached to cannula <b>233</b>. The reconfigured device <b>30</b> now comprises the cap <b>331</b> releasably joined to the proximal end of the cannula <b>233</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. Cannula <b>233</b> provides a flow passage for ambient air pressure to body cavity <b>67</b>. Additionally, various medical devices, such as endoscopic medical devices, can be introduced into body cavity <b>67</b> through the cap <b>331</b> and cannula <b>233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The cannula <b>233</b> positioned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> can provide a number of functions, including without limitation: providing bi-directional passage of air to maintain an ambient condition inside operative space the body cavity <b>67</b>; venting of fumes and odors that may be generated due to cauterization of internal organs <b>65</b> to maintain good visibility inside the operative space; permitting multiple instrument exchange without loss of operative space; maintaining the incision open and thereby provide continuous access to the internal body cavity <b>67</b>; permitting simultaneous passage of two or more instruments through the cannula <b>233</b>; removal of tissue or body fluid from the operative through the cannula <b>233</b> (possible in part because a valve is not required as is needed in a typical cannula); and introducing medications or diagnostic probes through the cannula <b>233</b> either during the procedure or post operatively.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When the procedure is complete, the vacuum associated with the vacuum shell <b>61</b> can be released, so that body wall <b>60</b> drops to its original configuration. The cap <b>331</b> can be detached, and the shell <b>61</b> can be removed while keeping cannula <b>233</b> in place in the incision <b>59</b>. The cannula <b>233</b> can be used to introduce a drainage catheter before final removal or closure of incision <b>59</b>. Alternatively, it may be fitted with a new solid non-hollow cap similar to cap <b>331</b> but without the inner lumen <b>358</b> to provide an access conduit that is sealed from ambient conditions and which can then be used for visualization of the procedure site within the body cavity, such as for post operative inspection for any suspected bleeding or drainage until such time as the surgeon decides to close the incision.</p>
