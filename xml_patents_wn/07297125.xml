<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a chest brace and method of using a chest brace to prevent collapse of a chest wall of a patient, such as a neonate, to keep the lungs inflated. More particularly, the present invention pertains to an inexpensive chest brace that interacts with the skin covering the chest, rather than through applied negative air pressure, to provide a distending force on the chest wall to prevent its collapse, especially during respiration.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Pulmonary insufficiency associated with immaturity is one of the most common life-threatening hurdles that confronts the premature newborn baby. The newborn's rib cage is soft and buckles easily during spontaneous respiration, particularly during inspiration. Underdevelopment of the intercostal muscles, lungs, or both contributes to the chest's deformability. In premature infants below 30 weeks gestation, thoracic wall elastic recoil is almost non-existent, so that the resting volume of the lungs is very close to or below their collapsed volume. Also, the relatively compliant chest wall tends to collapse as the diaphragm descends, resulting in a diminished tidal volume. As a result, most premature infants require assisted ventilation or a continuous distending pressure (CDP).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is widely established as an effective method for preventing lung wall collapse, chest wall distortion, and for increasing oxygenation. Currently, CPAP is used almost exclusively in preference to continuous negative distending pressure. CPAP, however, is potentially hazardous to newborn infants with weakened respiratory systems. It is usually administered by nasal prongs, but has major limitations and serious side effects. These include: nasal trauma, difficulty in obtaining a good fit in very small infants, and high gas flows that cause airway cooling, drying, and obstruction of the nasal passages. During periods of crying and mouth opening, especially with high CPAP flows, there is a loss of pressure and the infant inhales room air. Frequent dislodgement of the nasal prongs makes nursing difficult, especially when associated with repeated bouts of desaturation. High or fluctuating saturation may increase the risk of retinopathy. Perhaps more serious are the circulatory disturbances, decreased venous return to the heart, diminished cardiac output, and increased intracranial hemorrhage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Negative pressure applied intermittently around the chest has been used for more than a 100 years as a way of assisting ventilation in patients with respiratory failure. The iron lung is perhaps one of the best recognized negative pressure ventilators. Continuous negative distending pressure (CNP) is used to manage a number of specific conditions that produce respiratory failure in neonates and older infants. Negative distending pressure is highly effective and does not have many of the side effects of CPAP. Among its benefits with patients with respiratory disease syndrome are an increase in resting volume of the lung and arterial oxygen tension. There is also no need for an airway or nasal prongs. As opposed to positive distending pressure, CNP produces a decrease in intrathoracic and right arterial pressures, favoring venous return to the heart from parts of the body that are not exposed to the negative pressure. CNP further increases lung lymph flow and lung albumen transport. CNP also avoids the increases in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure that are observed with positive airway pressure. Recently, CNP has been re-introduced to treat infants with various pathological conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">While improvements have been made in the design of devices for generating extra-thoracic negative pressure, the devices are still difficult to attach to small newborns. Current designs consist of a cuirass or chamber and use vacuum around the chest or lower body to generate negative pressure. These devices require some form of electrical power supply, are relatively expensive, and are cumbersome. Technical difficulties are associated with temperature control, neck seals obstructing venous return, leaks around the seals and limited patient access. These devices also require considerable training and experience to operate and the technical problems make nursing difficult and frustrating. This limits the use of a potentially life saving treatment modality.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There are also situations where the thoracic shape of the newborn is not within normal thresholds, regardless of whether or not the chest is collapsing during respiration. A normal, healthy infant has a thoracic index between approximately 85%-95%. Thoracic index is defined as the ratio of the height of the chest, i.e., in an anterior-to-posterior direction or vice versa, over the width of the chest, i.e., in a lateral or side-to-side direction, when measured in the prone or supine position. Newborns with a thoracic index of less than 65%, for example, are generally not considered healthy. This decrease may or may not be related to collapsing of the chest during respiration. For example, a decreased thoracic index can be due to a malformation, or it may be present simply because the infant's chest has collapsed to a point at beyond which it can collapse no further. In such infants, there is a need to restore the thoracic index to its normal range. However, conventional assisted ventilation and CNP devices, which used primarily to prevent lung collapse, does little or nothing to improve the infant's thoracic index.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a chest brace that overcomes the shortcomings of conventional techniques for preventing collapse of a patient's chest during spontaneous inspiration.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is another object of this invention to provide a chest brace that provides a continuous distending pressure on the patient's chest so as to correct any collapse that is evident between breaths, i.e., at the end of expiration.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is still another object of this invention, to provide a chest brace that provides continuous distending pressure on the patient's chest cavity without requiring vacuum seals.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is yet another object of this invention to provide a chest brace that is particularly adapted for use with premature newborn babies.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is still another object of this invention to provide a chest brace that is simple to attach, inexpensive, and does not require electrical power to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a chest brace and method of using such a brace to improve a patient's thoracic index even in the absence of chest collapse associated with respiration.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is still a further object of this invention to provide a chest brace that is adapted to provide intermittent negative pressure ventilation for a patient without a need for endotracheal intubation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">These objects, among others, are achieved, according to one embodiment of the present invention, by providing a chest brace that includes an anterior member adapted to overly a patient's chest. An adhesive mechanism secures the anterior member to the surface of the patient. A support structure is coupled to the anterior member such that, in use, the support structure imparts a force on the anterior member in a manner so as to distend a thorax of the patient. In one embodiment of the present invention, the support structure includes a posterior member that is coupled to the anterior member using a mechanical linkage, so that the anterior member can be moved relative to the posterior member in a ratchet-like fashion, thereby imparting the distending pressure. This allows the patient to receive the distending force regardless of whether they are in the supine or prone position. In another embodiment of the present invention, the support structure includes a support structure, such as a shield, having a portion that is placed over the patient. The anterior member is suspended from the shield in a manner so as to impart the distending force on the patient's chest. The present invention also contemplates adhering a chest plate to the patient so that the anterior member can be selectively attached to the patient merely by securing it to the chest plate, thereby avoiding the need to remove the adhesive from the patient each time the patient is removed from the chest plate.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method of imparting a distending force on a thorax of a patient that that overcomes the shortcomings of conventional methods for preventing collapse of a patient's chest, improving the patient's thoracic index, or both. This object is achieved by providing a method that includes adhesively securing an anterior member of a chest brace structure to a patient's chest and imparting a force on the anterior member so as to distend a thorax of such a patient. Numerous techniques for imparting a force on the anterior member are discussed in detail below.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EXEMPLARY MBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A chest brace <b>10</b> according to the principles of the present invention is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and comprises a resilient metal core that is bent to surround a patient's chest <b>12</b>, which is shown in cross-section. Chest brace <b>10</b> includes a pair of arms <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> bent around chest <b>12</b>. A frontal resilient segment <b>18</b> adheres to the patient's chest wall by an adhesive structure <b>20</b> whose details are described below. In similar fashion, arms <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> adhere to the patient's back via an adhesive structure <b>22</b>. The lateral segments <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of chest brace <b>10</b> do not adhere to the patient's chest wall, thereby enabling lateral expansion and contraction during breathing.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Chest brace <b>10</b>, when in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, exerts an outward distending force, as generally indicated by arrows A, via an adhesive structure <b>20</b> on the skin of the patient's chest. The distending force is accomplished by assuring that the resilient metal core assumes an approximately oval shape when arms <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are bent around the patient, the oval shape being such as to cause a separation of frontal resilient segment <b>18</b> from the patient's chest wall. After the arms <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> have been adhered to the patient's back, a pressure is applied to frontal resilient segment <b>18</b>, causing it to adhere to the patient's chest wall. The resiliency and inherent recoil of the compressed metal core causes an outward flexure of frontal resilient segment <b>18</b>, and a continuous distending force A upon the patient's chest wall.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a small section of chest brace <b>10</b> is shown and illustrates that resilient metal core <b>28</b> is sandwiched between a soft material layer <b>30</b> and a Velcro™ layer <b>32</b>. Velcro layer <b>32</b> only extends over the length of chest brace <b>10</b> that makes contact with a mating layer of Velcro that has been adhered, by an intermediate adhesive layer, to the patient's chest wall.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The Velcro/adhesive layer is shown in further detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and is comprised of a thin, elastic, transparent and self-adhesive hydrocolloid layer <b>34</b>. Such materials are often used as a sterile skin dressing in neonatal intensive care units to protect newborn skin. Such materials consist of liquid absorbing particles in an elastic, self-adhesive mass <b>34</b><i>a</i>, covered on one side by a semi-permeable elastic and non-adherent polyurethane film <b>34</b><i>b</i>. The principal ingredients of such a hydrocolloid dressing are sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, synthetic block co-polymer, artificial tackifier and a plasticizer. Such a hydrocolloid material is manufactured by Coloplast, Inc., Tampa, Fla., and is marketed under the trademark COMFEEL™.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Adhered to film surface <b>34</b><i>b </i>of hydrocolloid layer <b>34</b> is a further layer of Velcro <b>36</b>. Velcro layer <b>36</b> may be of the loop variety and Velcro layer <b>32</b> of the hook variety (or vice-versa) to enable a joinder therebetween. While the attachment mechanism is most preferably accomplished by the described, interacting Velcro layers, those skilled in the art will realize that any instrumentality which enables an adhesion between the patient's chest wall and the inner surface of chest brace <b>10</b> is within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Resilient metal core <b>28</b> is preferably comprised of strips of thin steel, e.g. 0.007-0.020 shim steel. The metal strips (or strip) are encased on their outer side with a soft material, such as moleskin™, available from the Johnson &amp; Johnson Company, New Brunswick, N.J., and on their inner surface with Velcro layer <b>32</b>. The thickness of each metal core <b>28</b> can be changed to suit the needs and dimensions of the patient. For example, an infant weighing 1,500 grams may need a chest brace <b>10</b> made of two steel strips, with each steel strip being approximately ¼ inch wide, thereby making the brace a little more than ½ inch wide.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref> illustrate the method of application of chest brace <b>10</b> to a patient. A strip of self-adhesive loop Velcro <b>36</b> is centered on the top of hydrocolloid layer <b>34</b> on the patient's anterior chest wall. Velcro <b>36</b> extends between the positions of the chest which tend to buckle inwards and a similar Velcro strip <b>40</b> is placed over hydrocolloid layer <b>42</b> posteriorly between the patient's scapulas. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With the patient in the supine position, arm <b>16</b> of chest brace <b>10</b> is first brought into contact with Velcro layer <b>40</b> and is joined thereto by the corresponding Velcro layer on arm <b>16</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Chest brace <b>10</b> is then swung anteriorly so as to encircle the patient's chest, arching over the xiphisternum and leaving at least ½ inch space between Velcro layer <b>36</b> on the patient's chest (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and Velcro layer <b>32</b> on the underside of the resilient segment (see. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The free end of the chest brace <b>10</b>, e.g., arm <b>18</b>, is then attached onto Velcro layer <b>40</b>, that is adhered to the patient's back by hydrocolloid layer <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Frontal resilient segment <b>18</b>, positioned above the patient's sternum, is then indented by finger pressure so that the complementary Velcro layers lock together. It is preferred to have resilient segment <b>18</b> adhere to as much of anterior chest Velcro <b>36</b> as possible to disperse the load on the skin and the subcutaneous tissue. Once indented, the inherent recoil in the steel core exerts an outward pull on the chest wall. Sides <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the chest brace <b>10</b> are not attached to the patient and act as levers which pull out the chest anteriorly.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition to providing rigidity for the patient's chest wall and a continuous negative distending pressure, a second embodiment of a chest brace <b>10</b>′ is adapted to provide active ventilation. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the exterior surface of chest brace <b>10</b>′ includes an air bladder <b>50</b> that is bonded thereto. By controlling the amount of air within air bladder <b>50</b>, via tube <b>52</b>, the stiffness of bladder <b>50</b> can be altered to control the amount of outward pull of chest brace <b>10</b>′, as indicated by arrows B. More specifically, filling bladder <b>50</b> with air changes its shape, and as bladder <b>50</b> straightens, it pulls the brace away from the chest. When pressure is released from air bladder <b>50</b>, chest brace <b>10</b>′ is enabled to resume its original position by the natural resiliency of its metal core. In such manner, ventilation of the patient can be assisted by periodically altering the air pressure within air bladder <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a third embodiment of a chest brace <b>10</b>″ is shown. Chest brace <b>10</b>″ provides the same ventilation function as chest brace <b>10</b>′ of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> except that in this case, a pair of bladders <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> are positioned within a chest brace <b>10</b>″. Inflation and deflation of the bladders, either individually or simultaneously, controls the position of frontal resilient segment <b>18</b> of chest brace <b>10</b>″, as generally indicated by arrows C. In such a manner, ventilation of the patient is assisted.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a fourth embodiment of a chest brace <b>60</b> that comprises a pair of separated brace members <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>. Anterior brace member <b>62</b> is adhered to the patient's chest wall via the same connection mechanism as described above. Similarly, posterior brace member <b>64</b> is adhered to the back of the patient in the manner described above. The spacing between brace members <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> is controlled by air pressure within a pair of corrugated respirator tubes <b>65</b> and <b>66</b>. Thus, as pressure is increased within corrugated tubes <b>65</b> and <b>66</b>, anterior brace member <b>62</b> moves away from posterior brace member <b>64</b>. Through the action of the Velcro interconnection between anterior brace member <b>62</b> and the patient's chest wall, the patient's chest wall moves outwardly. When, however, pressure is reduced within corrugated tubing <b>65</b> and <b>66</b>, a vacuum is created thereby causing a squeezing action on the patient's chest between brace numbers <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>. In such manner, the patient's respiration is assisted. Control of air pressure in tubes <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> is via an input <b>68</b> from a ventilator system which provides the necessary alterations in air pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref> illustrate air as the medium used to control the actuation of the chest brace, it is to be understood that other fluids, such as an inert gas or water, can be used to hydraulically or pneumatically actuate these chest brace devices. Furthermore, rather than using these chest braces to provide or assist active ventilation, they can also be used to provided a continuous distending force of the chest wall to prevent its collapse, with the amount of fluid delivered to the actuating bladder or tubes controlling the magnitude of the distending force. Using the chest brace of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref> in this manner has the benefit in that the amount of distending force applied to the patient's chest wall can be easily controlled and altered and the brace need not be flexed in order to adhere it to the patient. Instead, each piece can be applied to the patient, and, when properly fitted, the bladder or tube can be actuated to apply the desired degree of distending force to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The presence of adhesive structure <b>20</b> on a patient's chest renders it further possible to manually compress and distend the chest. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a T-shaped plunger <b>80</b> includes a distal layer <b>82</b> of Velcro, which attaches to Velcro layer <b>84</b> that is, in turn, adhered to chest wall <b>86</b> by adhesive layer <b>88</b>. Manual manipulation of plunger <b>80</b> allows compression and distension of chest wall <b>86</b>, as indicated by arrow D. This produces compression and emptying of the heart, while distension produces a filling of the heart and lungs.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a fifth embodiment of a chest brace <b>99</b> is shown, which comprises a pair of separated brace members <b>100</b> and <b>102</b>. Anterior brace member <b>100</b> is adhered to the patient's chest wall via the same adhesive connection mechanism described above. Similarly, posterior brace member <b>102</b> is adhered to the back of the patient in the manner described above. The spacing between brace members <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> is controlled by a pair of screws <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, each of which is threaded into posterior brace member <b>102</b>. The distal end of each of screws <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> is positioned in a respective orifice <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> in brace member <b>100</b>. The diameters of orifices <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> are sufficiently large as to receive, without interference, the distal ends of screws <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> so that the screws are free to move within the orifice.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Adjustment of screws <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> to move anterior brace member <b>100</b> away from posterior brace member <b>102</b>, as indicated by arrow E, distends a patient's chest. In use, the weight of the patient adhered to anterior brace member <b>100</b> urges anterior brace member <b>100</b> toward posterior brace member <b>102</b>, as indicated by arrow F, so that the anterior and posterior brace members remain in an engaged relation. Further, if the patient is being actively ventilated or breaths spontaneously, the clearances between orifices <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> and the distal ends of screws <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> enable brace member <b>100</b> to rise when air enters the patient's lungs, assuming, or course, that anterior brace member <b>100</b> and posterior brace member <b>102</b> are positioned close enough to one another that the movement of the patient during respiration moves anterior brace member <b>100</b> away from posterior brace member <b>102</b>. During the exhalation cycle, brace member <b>100</b> falls until the distal ends of screws <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> hit the bottoms of orifices <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, respectively. This action allows for free movement of the patient's chest during inhalation while preventing collapse of the patient's chest wall during exhalation due to the interaction of brace member <b>100</b> and the adhesive layer that is adherent to the patient's chest.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">It should be understood that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the invention. Various alternatives and modifications can be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. For instance, while screws <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> are shown as threaded into brace member <b>102</b>, they could be threaded into brace member <b>100</b> and orifices <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> could be positioned in brace member <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>E illustrate a sixth embodiment of a chest brace <b>120</b> and its components according to the principles of the present invention. Chest brace <b>120</b> includes an anterior member <b>122</b> that overlies the patient's chest and a posterior member <b>124</b> that overlies the patient's back so that the patient is positioned in the center of the ring defined by the anterior and posterior members. Although not shown, anterior member <b>122</b> and posterior member <b>124</b> are attached to the chest and back of the patient, respectively, using the same adhesive connection mechanism described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-12</figref>. A pair of mechanical linkages <b>126</b> on each end of anterior member <b>122</b> and posterior member couple the anterior and posterior members to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The general function of chest brace <b>120</b> is much the same as chest brace <b>99</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Namely, mechanical linkages <b>126</b> include a ratchet mechanism that allows anterior member <b>122</b> to be moved away from posterior member <b>124</b> in the direction of arrow G to a desired position. The ratchet mechanism prevents any movement back toward the posterior member in the direction of arrow H, so that the anterior member is maintained at a fixed distance from the posterior member to apply a distending force on the patient's chest. Mechanical linkages <b>126</b> also allow anterior member <b>122</b> to move unimpeded farther away from posterior member <b>124</b> beyond the fixed distance, so that the patient's chest can expand freely during respiration. However, as noted above, chest brace <b>120</b> will not allow anterior <b>122</b> member to move any closer to posterior member <b>124</b> than the fixed distance set using the ratchet mechanism, thereby preventing the patient's chest from collapsing.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, anterior member <b>122</b> includes channels <b>128</b> at each end for receiving a sliding member <b>130</b> in mechanical linkage <b>126</b>. Channel <b>128</b> and sliding member <b>130</b> are sized and configured to allow for free translation movement therebetween, i.e., so that anterior member <b>122</b> can slide up and down on sliding members <b>130</b> freely. Posterior member <b>124</b> includes a pair of protrusions <b>132</b> at each end for retaining sliding member <b>130</b> in an engaged relation, while also allowing translational movement of the sliding member relative to the posterior member. Posterior member <b>124</b> also includes a central post <b>134</b> at each end, with a protrusion <b>136</b> provided at the distal end of each post. An engaging tab <b>138</b> is provided at the end of protrusions <b>136</b>. The cantilevered arrangement of posts <b>134</b> on posterior member <b>124</b> allows a small amount of lateral (side-to-side) movement of the distal end of the post.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Mechanical linkages <b>126</b> each include a retaining tab <b>140</b> that is fixed to protrusions <b>136</b> on central posts <b>134</b> by securing engaging tab <b>138</b> in a slot <b>142</b> provided in retaining tab. When assembled in this manner, protrusion <b>136</b> is disposed in a slot <b>144</b> in sliding member <b>130</b>, with retaining tab <b>130</b> and protrusions <b>132</b> keeping sliding member <b>130</b> in an engaged relation with posterior member <b>124</b>. Sliding members <b>130</b> include teeth <b>146</b> and central posts <b>134</b> include teeth <b>148</b>, so that when assembled, teeth <b>146</b> engage teeth <b>148</b> in a ratchet fashion. More specifically, the teeth on sliding member <b>130</b> and posterior member <b>124</b> allow sliding member <b>130</b> to move incrementally upward, i.e., in direction G, as teeth <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> slip past one another, but prevent downward movement of the sliding member, i.e., in direction H, by engagement of teeth <b>146</b> and <b>148</b>. The flexing of central posts <b>134</b> and the configuration of teeth <b>146</b> and/or <b>148</b> allows this ratchet movement of the sliding member relative to the posterior member.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Each sliding member <b>130</b> includes a shoulder <b>150</b> that engages an edge <b>152</b> of anterior member <b>122</b> for carrying the anterior member upward as the sliding members move upward. Once the fixed or operative position of the sliding member is set, further upward movement of anterior portion <b>122</b> lifts the anterior member off shoulders <b>150</b>. In this manner, anterior member <b>122</b> can slide up and down on the distal ends of sliding members <b>130</b> but cannot drop below the fixed position because of the engagement between shoulders <b>150</b> of sliding members <b>130</b> and the ratchet mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moving sliding members <b>130</b> and anterior member <b>122</b>, upward, i.e., in direction G, is facilitated by a protruding portion <b>154</b> on retaining tabs <b>140</b> and a protruding portion <b>156</b> on sliding members <b>130</b>. More specifically, to raise anterior member <b>122</b> off of posterior member <b>124</b>, the user need only squeeze or pinch protrusions <b>154</b> and <b>156</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref> illustrate a seventh embodiment of a chest brace <b>160</b> according to the principles of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A-21</figref> illustrate selected components of chest brace <b>160</b> in greater detail. Chest brace <b>160</b> includes an anterior member <b>162</b>, a posterior member <b>164</b>, and flexible linkages <b>166</b> that couple anterior member and posterior member <b>164</b>. In the previous chest brace embodiments, the anterior and posterior members are directly coupled to the patient via an adhesive mechanism. In this embodiment, however, anterior member <b>162</b> is coupled to the patient via a chest plate <b>168</b>, and posterior member <b>164</b> is coupled to the patient via a back plate <b>170</b>. Chest plate <b>168</b> and back plate <b>170</b> are releaseably secured to anterior member <b>162</b> and posterior member <b>164</b>, respectively, via an interlocking mechanism described in greater detail below. Chest plate <b>168</b> and back plate <b>170</b> can have any number of configurations and sizes, so long as the function of securing the patient's chest to the anterior member <b>162</b> and the patient's back to the posterior member <b>164</b>, respectively, are accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">This configuration for chest brace <b>160</b> minimizes the amount of material that is adhered to the patient, while still allowing the patient to be quickly and easily attached to the remainder of the chest brace as needed. As a result, a neonate, for example, can be easily and quickly disengaged from the major components of the chest brace for breast feeding, cleaning, diaper changing, examination, mother or father bonding, etc., and then returned to the chest brace structure without having to remove the adhesive applied to the infant. It can be appreciated that removing and reapplying the adhesives is a much more time consuming and cumbersome process that merely detaching chest plate <b>168</b> and back plate <b>170</b> from anterior member <b>162</b> and posterior member <b>164</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A further benefit of this embodiment for the chest brace is that the major components of chest brace <b>160</b>, i.e., anterior member <b>162</b>, posterior member <b>164</b>, and flexible linkages <b>166</b>, can be used on a relatively large number of patients, with only the chest plate and back plate being patient-specific. This minimizes the number of different chest brace components that are necessary and that must be kept on hand in order to accommodate a wide variety of patients.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Chest plate <b>168</b> and back plate <b>170</b> are preferably made from poyurethane. However, the present invention contemplates that other plastic or semi-plastic materials, such as vinyl, can be used for the chest plate and back plate. In addition, it is preferable that the chest plate and back plate be made from a transparent material to allow a caregiver, for example, to visually monitor the patient's tissues underlying each plate without having to remove these plates.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Chest plate <b>168</b> includes a relatively planar base <b>172</b> and a stem <b>174</b> attached thereto for securing the chest plate to anterior member <b>162</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, base <b>172</b> includes a first end <b>173</b> having a generally linear edge and a second end opposite the first end having a pair of lobes <b>175</b>. When properly positioned in the patient, first end <b>173</b> is closer to the patient's head than lobes <b>175</b> so that the chest brace overlies the patient's rib cage.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">An exposed surface <b>176</b> of the base <b>172</b>, which is opposite stem <b>174</b>, provides a surface that adheres to the patient. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a hydrogel adhesive of the type used conventionally to secure EKG electrodes to a patient are used as an adhesive material to bond surface <b>176</b> of chest plate <b>168</b> to the surface of the patient. A hydrogel adhesive, such as the hydrogel adhesive identified as RG73P and manufactured by Ludlow Technical Products of Huntington Beach, Calif., which is a water-based adhesive, is preferred because, as a hydrogel, it dissolves or has reduced adhering capability when flushed with water. Therefore, the adhesive can easily removed from the patient with a minimal amount of tissue damage and pulling using only water as a solvent. Although a water-based hydrogel is believed to be preferably due to its biocompatibility with human tissue, the present invention also contemplates using other types of hydrogels, such as oil-based adhesives, to secure the back plate and chest plate to the surface of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">To facilitate detachment of the chest plate from the patient, a channel <b>178</b> is defined in stem <b>174</b>. Channel <b>178</b> allows a liquid solvent capable of dissolving the hydrogel to be inserted between surface <b>176</b> and the surface of the patient. The insertion of such a liquid between surface <b>176</b> and the surface of the patient also provides a pneumatic release mechanism tending to urge surface <b>176</b> and the surface of the patient apart.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Because it is important that planar base <b>172</b> adhere securely to the surface of the patient, which is not planar, but is oftentimes slightly caved-in, i.e., concave, the present invention contemplates providing channels <b>180</b> in a lengthwise direction of the base plate, i.e., in a direction generally aligned with the length of the patient on which the chest plate is placed. Channels <b>180</b> separate the base plate into several portions that have a small degree of movement relative to one another, as indicated by arrows I and J. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>. A pair of support members <b>182</b> are provided on surface of base <b>172</b> opposite surface <b>176</b> act as hinges to maintain the structure integrity of the base. Channels <b>180</b>, together with the small degree of flexibility present in most plastics, such as polyurethane, used in support members <b>182</b> allow the planar base plate to be contoured, at least somewhat, to match the contour of the patient, and, in particular, to better match the concavity a patient whose chest is slightly caved-in.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Preferably, the degree of movement in direction J is greater than in direction I so that the base plate can conform to the patient's concave chest while not buckling when a load is applied to surface <b>176</b>. Channels <b>180</b> provide this ability because they allow for a bending movement in direction J, but limit the amount of movement in direction I. Movement in direction I is limited because the channel walls impinge on one another after a predetermined amount of deflection in direction I, thereby preventing any additional deflection so that the base plate does not fold in on itself.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">While the figures illustrate base <b>172</b> has having two channels defined therein, the present invention contemplates that no channels, one channel, or more than two channels can be provided. For example, internal structures (wires, tubes, or etc.), scoring, or materials having different bending properties can be used in base <b>172</b> to provide the desired degree of flexibility in virtually any direction of the base so that it can be contoured to match the surface of the patient. The depth, width, and shape of the channels can also be varied depending on the desired degree of flexibility for base <b>172</b>. Also, the location of the channels and their shape in the base plate can be other than that shown in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Although support members <b>182</b> are shown as being integrally formed with base <b>172</b>, the present invention contemplates that such support members can be added after the base is formed. They can also be defined within the base and need not have the specific size, shape, and configuration illustrated. The present invention also contemplates varying the stiffness of the material defining the base plate, providing internal reinforcing structures, varying the shape or thickness of the base itself to achieve the functions of channels <b>180</b>, support members <b>182</b>, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, chest plate <b>168</b> attaches to anterior member <b>162</b> in a slot and key configuration by interlocking stem <b>174</b> in a channel <b>183</b> defined in the center of the anterior member. Channel <b>183</b> includes a first, relatively wide portion, having a diameter greater than that of stem <b>174</b> so that the stem can readily insert into the first portion of the channel. Channel <b>183</b> also includes a second, narrower portion, so that once the stem is moved into the second, narrower portion of the channel, the stem and, hence, the chest plate, are engaged to anterior member <b>162</b>. A flaring may be provided on the stem to facilitate such attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The present invention contemplates that second portion of channel <b>183</b> and stem <b>174</b> can be sized such that the stem is prevented from moving in the second portion of the channel once it is moved into this portion of this channel. This configuration causes chest plate <b>168</b> and anterior member <b>162</b> move as a single piece. An alternative embodiment of the present invention, however, contemplates allowing stem <b>174</b> to rotate, as generally indicated by arrow <b>177</b>, within channel <b>183</b>, as well as move in a vertical direction, as indicated by arrows K and L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Flanges can be provided on stem <b>174</b> to limit the movement in direction L or K. If desired, protrusions or other such structures can be provided on stem <b>174</b> to limit the rotational movement.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">It is to be understood, that the stem and channel interlocking technique described immediately above for securing the chest plate to the anterior member represents only one of a number of techniques for selectively engaging these components of the chest brace contemplated by the present invention. For example, the present invention contemplates using a snap-fit configuration, bolt and screw, tongue and groove, or hook and loop technique for selectively interlocking chest plate <b>168</b> and anterior member <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Back plate <b>170</b> includes a base plate <b>184</b> that is curved to match the general curvature of the back of the patient and a stem <b>186</b> attached thereto. A surface <b>188</b> of base <b>184</b> adheres to the back of the patient, preferably using the above-described hydrogel adhesive. In the illustrated embodiment, the thickness of the back plate is the greatest at its center and decreases as the distance from the center increases, so that distal ends <b>190</b> are relatively more flexible than the center portion. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>. This allows distal ends <b>190</b> to have greater flexibility for adhering to the surface of the patient farther form the centerline, wherein the curvature increases as the distance from the center of the back increases. Like stem <b>174</b> in chest plate <b>168</b>, stem <b>186</b> of back plate <b>170</b> includes a channel <b>192</b> so that a liquid, preferably a solvent, can be inserted between surface <b>188</b> and the surface of the patient. As noted above, the insertion of such a liquid between surface <b>188</b> and the surface of the patient assists in dissolving or loosening the adhesive securing surface <b>188</b> to the patient and provides a pneumatic release mechanism tending to urge surface <b>188</b> and the surface of the patient apart.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, back plate <b>170</b> attaches to posterior member <b>164</b> by interlocking stem <b>186</b> in a channel <b>189</b> defined in the center of the posterior member. Channel <b>189</b>, like channel <b>183</b> in anterior member <b>162</b>, includes a first, relatively wide portion, having a diameter greater than that of stem <b>186</b> so that the stem can readily insert into the first portion of the channel. Channel <b>189</b> also includes a second, narrower portion, so that once the stem is moved into the second, narrower portion of the channel, the stem and, hence, the back plate, is engaged to posterior member <b>164</b>. A flaring may be provided on the stem to facilitate such attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">It is to be understood, that the stem and channel interlocking technique described immediately above for securing the back plate to the posterior member represents only one of a number of techniques for selectively engaging these components of the chest brace contemplated by the present invention. For example, the present invention contemplates using a snap-fit configuration, bolt and screw, tongue and groove, or hook and loop technique for selectively interlocking back plate <b>170</b> and posterior member <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Anterior member <b>162</b>, a posterior member <b>164</b>, and flexible linkages <b>166</b> cooperate in a manner similar to that described above with respect to chest brace <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> in that the flexible linkage allows the anterior member to be moved away from the posterior member, as indicated by arrow K, in a ratchet fashion to apply a distending force on the patient's chest to prevent its collapse. Because a distending force is acting on both the front and back of the patient in the current embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-21</figref>, as is also the case with the devices shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b>-<b>14</b>E, the patient can be placed in the supine position or in the prone position without compromising the effectiveness of the distending properties of the chest brace. This is particularly important in situations where the patient will be wearing the chest brace of extended periods of time, where the position of the patient needs to be frequently changed.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Once anterior member <b>162</b> is moved to a set point, which is selectable by the user, the ratchet mechanism, which is provided by the interaction of flexible linkages <b>166</b> and posterior member <b>164</b>, prevents the anterior member from moving back toward the posterior member, i.e., in the direction indicated by arrow L, thereby maintaining the distending force to splint the patient's chest from collapsing. However, once in the set position, additional movement of the anterior member in direction K away from the posterior member is possible because there is no structure preventing such movement. If the patient is wearing the chest brace and it is at its set point, further expansion of the patient's chest, which could occur if the patient inhales deeply or coughs or is on mechanical ventilation with a positive airway pressure sufficient to cause the chest to rise, for example, results in additional unimpeded outward movement of the anterior member relative to the posterior member, i.e., in direction K, to accommodate this additional chest distention.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Flexible linkages <b>166</b> are provided in channels <b>194</b> defined at least at the ends of in posterior member <b>164</b>. Posterior member <b>164</b> includes various protrusions <b>196</b> that serve to maintain the flexible linkages in an engaged relation with the posterior member. Flexible linkages <b>166</b> are moveable within the channels defined in posterior member <b>164</b>, as generally indicated by arrows M and N in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. However, movement of the flexible linkages is controlled in a ratchet-like fashion. This is accomplished by providing a number of teeth <b>198</b> in each linkage and a cantilever level <b>200</b> on the posterior member associated with each flexible linkage. Cantilever level <b>200</b> has at least one ratchet tooth for engaging teeth <b>198</b> in a manner that permits incremental movement of flexible linkages <b>166</b> relative to posterior member <b>164</b> in direction M, but prevents movement in direction N when the teeth in cantilever level <b>200</b> engage teeth <b>198</b> in flexible member <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As flexible linkage <b>166</b> moves in direction M, an engaging end <b>202</b> engages ends <b>204</b> of anterior member <b>162</b>. Preferably, ends <b>204</b> includes a slot <b>206</b> for receiving a protrusion <b>208</b> provided on engaging ends <b>202</b> of flexible linkages <b>166</b>. The engagement between engaging end <b>202</b> of flexible linkage <b>166</b> and ends <b>204</b> of anterior member <b>162</b> is such that the anterior member can be freely removed or pulled off of the ends of the flexible linkage. It can be appreciated that the depth at which the engaging end of the flexible linkage is inserted into the stop in the end of the anterior member dictates the amount of movement that is available before the anterior member detaches from the ends of the flexible member.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Movement of flexible linkages <b>166</b> in direction M is facilitated by tab <b>210</b> provided on posterior member <b>164</b> and tab <b>212</b> provided on the flexible linkages. To move anterior member <b>162</b> away from posterior member <b>164</b> in direction K, the user need only squeeze or pinch tabs <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> together. The amount of travel of flexible member <b>166</b> in the channel of posterior member <b>164</b> is limited by tab <b>212</b> engaging a removable stop <b>214</b> on each end of the posterior member. The present invention contemplates that either or both of these stops can be broken off of the posterior member or bent up to allow additional advancement of the flexible member in direction M. In which case, a portion <b>216</b> of the frame of posterior member <b>162</b> would act as a stop for tab <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Flexible linkage <b>166</b> preferably includes a plurality of indicia <b>218</b> that represent the distance d between the center of the chest plate and the center of the back plate in the assembled chest brace. This allows the same chest brace to be repeatedly used without having to reestablish the correct settings for the displacement between the anterior member and the posterior member. Indicia <b>218</b> can be viewed, for example, through a window provided in the ends of posterior member <b>164</b> (not shown) or as they are exposed upon exiting channel <b>194</b> as flexible linkage <b>166</b> is moved in direction M.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">An alternative technique for supporting chest plate <b>168</b> using anterior member <b>162</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. Chest brace <b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> includes a shield <b>222</b> under which the patient is located. Chest plate <b>168</b> and anterior member <b>126</b> are suspended from shield by a pair of suspension lines <b>224</b>. This embodiment for the chest brace allows the patient to immediately receive a chest distending force, once chest plate <b>168</b> and anterior member <b>162</b> are attached to the patient, without having to place any structures behind the patient. This can be particularly important, for example, in a newborn infant whose chest is collapsing, where it is essential that the chest be prevented from collapsing as soon as possible with a minimal amount of handling of the infant. The ease of use of chest brace <b>220</b> allows the infant's chest to be immediately supported while avoiding lifting the baby. Shield <b>222</b> can also serve as a heat shield help keep the baby warm. Of course, other structures, such as a tripod or suspension arm, can be provide the function of shield <b>222</b>, i.e., to suspend anterior member <b>162</b> and chest plate <b>168</b> above the patient and provide the chest distending force.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The present invention contemplates attaching suspension lines <b>224</b> to anterior member <b>162</b> in any suitable manner. Preferably, the suspension lines are attached to the anterior member in a manner that allows for secure attachment, while also allowing for easy removal of the suspension lines from the anterior member. For example, the present invention contemplates providing hooks at the end of the suspension lines that attach to a loop or other structure provided on the anterior member. Another variation of the present invention contemplates providing an attachment plate at the end of the suspension lines so that the suspension lines can be threaded through a hole in the anterior member with the attachment plate serving as a stopper to maintain the suspension line in an engaged relation with the anterior member.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The present invention also contemplates attaching suspension lines <b>224</b> to shield <b>222</b> in any suitable manner. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, shield <b>222</b> includes a slot <b>226</b> through which the suspension lines are threaded. The suspension lines are selectively engaged by means of clamping members <b>228</b> to suspend anterior member <b>162</b> and chest plate <b>168</b> above the patient to prevent chest wall collapse. Clamping member <b>228</b> can have any one of a variety of configurations so long at it performs the function of selectively securing the suspension lines to the shield. The illustrated embodiment of clamping member <b>228</b>, which is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, is a disk-shaped piece with a slot <b>230</b> defined therein. Slot <b>230</b> is shape so that suspension line <b>224</b> is pinched or clamped when the line is moved to one end of the slot.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates a further technique for supporting chest plate <b>168</b> attached to the patient's chest. In this embodiment, shield <b>222</b> is again used to suspend the chest plate above the patient so that a distending force is applied to the patient's chest, preventing its collapse. However, in this embodiment, suspension line <b>224</b> is attached directly to chest plate <b>168</b>, without using anterior member <b>168</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. This embodiment of the present invention allows for even faster application of a distending force on a patient without having to handle the patient to attach a back plate or posterior member behind the patient and without attaching the anterior member.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, suspension line <b>224</b> is directly attached to chest plate <b>168</b>, for example, by being tied to stem <b>174</b>. It is preferable, however, that suspension line <b>224</b> be releasably secured to the chest plate so that it can be easily and quickly removed so that the suspension system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>, which are contemplated as temporary or stopgap techniques for preventing chest wall collapse, can be replaced with a more stable chest brace system, such as those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref>, <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates an exemplary technique for releasably securing suspension line <b>224</b> to chest plate <b>168</b>. In this embodiment, suspension line <b>224</b> is attached to an attachment member <b>232</b> having a slot <b>234</b> defined therein. Slot <b>234</b> is sized and configured to receive stem <b>174</b> of chest plate <b>168</b> freely. Once stem <b>174</b> is inserted in a first portion of slot <b>234</b>, the attachment member, stem, or both are moved so that the stem is located in a second portion of slot <b>234</b>, where the stem is securely engaged with the attachment member. This technique is similar to the technique used to secure stems <b>174</b> and <b>186</b> to anterior member <b>162</b> and posterior member <b>164</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates an eight embodiment of a chest brace <b>240</b> according to the principles of the present invention. Chest brace <b>240</b> is generally similar to chest brace <b>160</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref>, except that in chest brace <b>240</b>, there are no structural elements underlying the patient. Chest plate <b>168</b> is attached to an anterior member <b>242</b>. The ends of anterior member <b>242</b> sit in trays <b>244</b> that are slideably attached to a base element <b>246</b> located on each side of the patient. Preferably, the interior surfaces <b>145</b> of the tray and base element are contoured to generally match the curvature of the patient. A locking mechanism <b>248</b>, such as a screw, is provided to set the position of trays <b>244</b> relative to base element <b>246</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates a ninth embodiment of a chest brace <b>250</b> according to the principles of the present invention. Chest brace <b>250</b> is also generally similar to chest brace <b>160</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref>, except that chest brace <b>250</b> provides adjustability in lateral distance x between the sides of the brace, as indicated by arrow O, in addition to adjustability for the separation distance d between anterior member <b>252</b> and posterior member <b>254</b>, as indicated by arrow P. Of course, different sized anterior members <b>252</b> may be necessary as different lateral distances x are selected. Alternatively, the length of anterior member <b>252</b> can also be adjustable using any conventional technique to match the selected lateral distance between the sides of the chest brace.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Adjusting lateral distance x is accomplished, for example, by providing a slot <b>256</b> in posterior member <b>254</b>, in which an adjustable support member <b>258</b> is slideably located. Each adjustable support member includes a tray <b>260</b> for receiving an end of anterior member <b>252</b>. The height of each support member <b>258</b> is adjustable, for example, by providing each support member with a first element <b>262</b> that is threaded into a second element <b>264</b>, so that rotation of first element <b>262</b> relative to second element <b>264</b> alters the overall height of the support member.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The present invention contemplates a variety of techniques for locking support member <b>258</b> in position within slot <b>256</b>, with only one example of such a technique being illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. In this embodiment, a locking mechanism <b>266</b> is provided in a second slot <b>268</b> in posterior member <b>254</b> and is mechanically coupled to support member <b>258</b> for locking the support member in place. Locking mechanism <b>266</b> is any device that is capable of being selective secured to posterior member <b>254</b>, such as a screw that can be tightened by hand.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Although posterior member <b>254</b> is illustrated as being planar, it is to be understood that exposed surface <b>270</b> can be contoured to approximate the shape of a patient's back, with the patient being adhere to surface <b>270</b> using any of the above described adhesive mechanisms. The present invention also contemplates providing a back plate that selectively secures to posterior member <b>254</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27</figref>, <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> illustrate a tenth embodiment of a chest brace <b>280</b> according to the principles of the present invention.

Chest brace <b>280</b> includes an anterior member <b>282</b> and a posterior member <b>284</b> coupled together at each end. As in the previous embodiments, the anterior and posterior members are preferably made from a plastic or semi-plastic material and are preferably transparent Anterior member <b>282</b> supports chest plate <b>168</b> and posterior member <b>284</b> supports back plate <b>170</b> in the same manner as the previous embodiments. That is, each chest or back plate is preferably selectively attachable to the associated anterior or posterior member, and, once attached, is either fixed to the respective anterior or posterior member, or moveably attached thereto. In a preferred embodiment, chest plate <b>168</b> is selectively attachable to anterior member <b>282</b> so at to be rotateable, as indicated by arrow Q, and moveable in an anterior-posterior direction indicated by arrow R. Back plate <b>170</b> is also preferably selectively attachable to posterior member <b>284</b> so at to be rotateable, as indicated by arrow S, and moveable in an anterior-posterior direction indicated by arrow T.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The ends of anterior member <b>282</b> and posterior member <b>284</b> define mechanical linkages <b>286</b> that couple these two members to one another. Mechanical linkages <b>286</b> preferably allow the anterior member to be physically detached from the posterior member so that they can be easily positioned about the patient and then reattached so that the anterior and posterior members provide the chest brace around the torso of the patient. Mechanical linkages also allow the anterior member and posterior member to open, as indicated by arrows U, and close, as indicated by arrows V, in a clam-shell like manner so that a distance d between the chest plate and the back plate can be controlled.

Teeth <b>288</b> and teeth <b>290</b> engage one another to prevent rotational movement of the anterior member relative to the posterior member. This allows distance d to be set. The flexibility of anterior member <b>282</b>, posterior member <b>284</b>, or both allows anterior member <b>282</b> to be bent away from posterior member <b>284</b>, as indicated by arrow W, so that teeth <b>288</b> disengage from teeth <b>290</b>. When disengaged, the anterior member is free to rotate relative to the posterior member to change distance d. Additional separation of anterior member <b>282</b> away from posterior member <b>284</b>, as indicated by arrow W, allows these two members to completely detach from one another. The resiliency of the material or materials defining the anterior member, posterior member, or both maintains these two members in the engaged relation.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">A wide variety of configurations are contemplated for mechanical linkages <b>286</b> to allow for the rotational movement of the anterior member relative to the posterior member. For example, teeth <b>288</b> or <b>290</b> can be shaped so that these two member rotateably move relative to one another in a ratchet-like fashion. The male-female relationship between the circular array of teeth and the cavity in which they are located in the anterior and posterior members can be reversed from that shown. The present invention also contemplates extending a protrusion, as indicated by dashed lines <b>292</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> beyond the sides of anterior member <b>284</b>. Such a protrusion, when pressed, facilitates disengaging of teeth <b>288</b> and <b>290</b> by causing the anterior and posterior member to move apart. The present invention also contemplates providing a snap-fit or other technique for rotateably engaging the ends of the anterior member and posterior member in addition to or in place of relying on the resiliency of these members to maintain the ends in the engaged relation. As in the previous embodiments, this embodiment of the present invention also contemplates eliminating the chest plate, back plate, or both in favor of a direct attachment of the anterior member, posterior member, or both to the surface of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Anterior member <b>282</b> and posterior member <b>284</b> are configured and arranged such that the mechanical linkages are moved farther down the torso of the patient, i.e., in a direction away from the head, than in the previous embodiments. This arrangement provides a less cluttered area near the patient's upper body, which is typically where medical sensors are located. This arrangement also provides a relatively large amount of room for the patient's arms, while still providing the distending forces at the appropriate locations on the patient's thorax due to the curved or v-like shape of the anterior and posterior members. It can be appreciated that this arrangement for mechanical linkages <b>286</b> reduces the number or parts for such linkages between the anterior and posterior member as compared to the mechanical linkages of previous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As noted above, the rotational position of anterior member <b>282</b> relative to posterior member <b>283</b>, and, hence distance d, is controlled by at least one of the mechanical linkages. This sets the operating distance between the chest plate and the back plate. A small amount of additional distension of the chest is allowed for due to the translational movement of the chest plate and/or back plate in directions R and T, respectively, also due to the tolerances between teeth <b>288</b> and <b>290</b> in the mechanical linkages. However, the present invention contemplates providing even more freedom for distension of the chest in direction in direction U, while not allowing for any significant decrease in distance d between the chest and back plates.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">This is accomplished according to one embodiment of the present invention by providing a channel, indicated by dashed lines <b>294</b>, in each side of anterior member <b>282</b>. Channel <b>294</b> effectively provides a hinge point in the anterior member, with the material at location <b>296</b> providing a bending moment that allows an upper portion <b>298</b> of anterior member <b>282</b> to move in direction U due the elasticity of this material while a lower portion <b>300</b> of anterior member <b>282</b> remains in the set position. Movement in direction V, that would decrease distance d, is prevented due to the engagement of the walls of channel <b>294</b> in much the same manner channels <b>180</b> in chest plate <b>168</b> prevent buckling of the chest plate when a load is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">It should be noted that the chest brace of the present invention is useful in doing more than preventing chest collapse occurring during respiration. In many situations, the shape of the patient's chest at rest is not within normal parameters, i.e., the patient's thoracic index is not in the normal range. In such cases, it is desirable to apply a distending force on the thorax to move chest walls to restore the thoracic index to acceptable parameters, even if the chest is not otherwise collapsing during respiration. For example, in an infant may have a malformed chest, applying a distending force on the chest, especially over an extended period of time, may allow the chest to grow in a proper manner without surgery. Maintaining the chest shape at its proper thoracic index, may not only improve the work of breathing, but may also serve to dilate blood vessels in the thorax to improve circulation.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Although the chest brace of the present invention has been described throughout as applying a distending force on the patient's chest in an anterior-posterior orientation, with minor structural changes, the chest brace of the present invention can be used to apply a distending force in a side-to-side orientation if desired. Also, it should be understood that the chest brace of the present invention can be used in adults as well as newborns, and can even have veterinary applications.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Although the invention has been described in detail for the purpose of illustration based on what is currently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that such detail is solely for that purpose and that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover modifications and equivalent arrangements that are within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
