<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates in general to a method and a device for adjusting a control parameter of a servo of an optical drive, and more particularly to a method and a device that introduces a sinusoidal signal into a control loop of a servo system and then obtains the gain and/or phase variations of the introduced sinusoidal signal so as to derive required parameter regarding the control loop.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a servo system of a conventional optical drive. An optical sensor <b>102</b> receives an optical signal reflected from a disk (not shown) and converts the reflected optical signal into an electric signal such that a pre-stage amplifier <b>104</b> manipulates the electric signal and generates a tracking error signal Te/focusing error signal Fe. The gain and phase of the processed signal Te/Fe is then compensated into a compensator <b>108</b> after the data format of the tracking error signal Te/focusing error signal Fe is converted by an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) <b>106</b> . After the compensated tracking error signal Te/focusing error signal Fe is processed by a DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) <b>110</b>, a signal Tro/Foo is obtained and directed into a drive circuit <b>114</b> so as to derive a control signal T/F for controlling a position of an optical pickup <b>116</b>. A laser diode (not shown) in the optical pickup <b>116</b> generates a laser beam to read/write the optical disk. The ADC <b>106</b>, the compensator <b>108</b> and the DAC <b>110</b> may be integrated in an identical ASIC <b>112</b> as applications.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the physical property of the system may vary from the normal due to the temperature variation after a long-term working. That is, the gain and/or phase of the control loop formed by the drive circuit <b>114</b>, the optical pickup <b>116</b>, the optical sensor <b>102</b> and the pre-stage amplifier <b>104</b> may deviate from the normal situation and make the system unstable. This system instability may affect the disk-read/-write operations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are several solutions proposed for overcoming the aforementioned disadvantage in the conventional. Firstly, an additional temperature sensor is introduced into the optical disk system to sense the temperature variations. The gain variation of the control loop is then estimated according to the temperature variation. This approach, however, cannot obtain a precise gain variation, which indicates that the improvement to the system instability is quite relatively restricted. In addition, the extra component still increases the cost of the optical disk drive. Secondly, the read/write speed of the optical disk drive is decreased so as to reduce the read/write error rate. However, this solution cannot really solve the problem of gain/phase variations.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of this, the invention proposes a device for adjusting a control parameter of a servo system of an optical disk drive basically encompasses a sinusoidal signal generator, a band-pass filter, a compensator and a processor. The first signal parameter of the first sinusoidal signal are generated and directed from the microprocessor to the sinusoidal signal generator. Thereafter, the sinusoidal signal generator generates and feeds the first sinusoidal signal into the control loop of the servo system. After this first sinusoidal signal being processed and amplified in the control loop, the band-pass filter is used to derive a second signal parameter regarding a second sinusoidal signal. Gain and/or phase variations of the control loop can be derived in the microprocessor by comparing signal parameters of the first and second sinusoidal signals. Finally, the microprocessor may issue an adjustment signal to the compensator to adjust the gain/phase variations of the control loop such that the system instability disadvantage is easily overcome.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the embodiment, a method is proposed for overcoming the system instability disadvantage by using the steps as follows. The first signal parameter of a first sinusoidal signal is derived firstly, while the first sinusoidal signal is generated according to the first signal parameter. After the first sinusoidal signal being processed and amplified by the control loop, a second signal parameter of a second sinusoidal signal can be derived from the control loop by using a BPF (Band-Pass Filter). An adjustment signal can be issued to adjust the gain/phase variations of the control loop according to a control parameter that is derived by comparing the signal parameter of the first sinusoidal signal with that of the second sinusoidal signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing a servo system of an optical disk drive according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. The disclosed device in the embodiment basically includes a signal generator, a digital BPF (Band-Pass Filter) <b>220</b> and a microprocessor <b>218</b>. The signal generator, for example, is a sinusoidal wave generator <b>222</b> used for generating an actual sinusoidal signal according to a first signal parameter delivered from the microprocessor <b>218</b>. The disclosed device is used in a control loop of a servo system of an optical drive <b>200</b>, and the control loop is a close loop. The control loop is formed by an optical sensor <b>202</b>, a pre-stage amplifier <b>204</b>, an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) <b>206</b>, a compensator <b>208</b>, a DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) <b>210</b>, a drive circuit <b>214</b> and an optical pickup unit <b>216</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The optical sensor <b>202</b> receives light reflected from a loaded disk (not shown) and converts this reflected light into an electric signal ES before directing to the pre-stage amplifier <b>204</b>. The pre-stage amplifier <b>204</b> converts the electric signal ES into a first tracking error signal Te′/focusing error signal Fe′, while the ADC <b>206</b> converts the first tracking error signal Te′/focusing error signal Fe′ into a digital signal D. The digital signal D and the first sinusoidal signal S<b>1</b> generated by the sinusoidal wave generator <b>222</b> are coupled and derived an input signal X, which is then directed to the compensator <b>208</b> and the digital BPF <b>220</b> simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">After the input signal X (which is a sum of the digital signal D and the first sinusoidal signal S<b>1</b>) being fed into the compensator <b>208</b>, the compensator <b>208</b> adjusts the gain and the phase variations of the input signal X based on the adjustment signal Cp. The control signal C generated after the compensation is inputted to the DAC <b>210</b> so that a second tracking error signal Tro′/focusing error signal Foo′ is obtained. The control signal C used for compensation is then delivered to the DAC <b>210</b> for deriving the second tracking error signal Tro′/focusing error signal Foo′. The second tracking error signal Tro′/focusing error signal Foo′ is fed into the drive circuit <b>214</b>, which generates a control signal T′/F′ for controlling the position of the optical pickup unit <b>216</b>. A laser diode (not shown) in the optical pickup unit <b>216</b> generates a laser beam being used during disk-read/-write operations. Please note that the ADC <b>206</b>, the compensator <b>208</b>, the DAC <b>210</b>, the digital BPF <b>220</b> and the sinusoidal wave generator <b>222</b> may be integrated into the same ASIC <b>212</b>. Any person having ordinary skills in the art should modify the embodiment as requirements, but all similar modifications or variations within the spirits of the embodiment should be included in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The compensator <b>208</b> outputs a control signal C for controlling disk-read/-write operations of the optical disk drive <b>200</b>. The sinusoidal wave generator <b>222</b> generates and feeds a first sinusoidal signal S<b>1</b> into the control loop according to a first signal parameter P<b>1</b> delivered from the microprocessor <b>218</b>, while the control loop manipulates and amplifies the first sinusoidal signal S<b>1</b> to be a second sinusoidal signal S<b>2</b> in a close loop manner. The digital BPF <b>220</b> is used to filter out the second sinusoidal signal S<b>2</b> and derive related signal parameter P<b>2</b>. The microprocessor <b>218</b> computes a relationship between the second sinusoidal signal S<b>2</b> and the first sinusoidal signal S<b>1</b> based on their signal parameters P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> such that an adjustment signal Cp is issued to adjust a control parameter of the compensator <b>208</b>. Please note that the first signal parameter P<b>1</b>, for example, signal period and amplitude, are generated and controlled by the microprocessor <b>218</b>, which indicates that the microprocessor <b>218</b> can easily derive gain/variations of the control loop while the second signal parameter P<b>2</b> is obtained. For example, if the gain/phase variations of the control loop are respectively G and Δp in comparison with the signal parameters P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>, the microprocessor <b>218</b> may adjust the adjustment signal Cp to vary the control signal C derived by the compensator <b>208</b> and thus eliminate the gain/phase variations G and Δp. Please note that the gain variation may be obtained by comparing the amplitude variations indicated by the first and second signal parameters P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>. The system instability disadvantage is thus easily overcome. Additionally, the band-pass filter should be designed according to the first signal parameter P<b>1</b> that are controlled by the microprocessor <b>218</b> and make sure the second signal parameter P<b>2</b> can be accurately derived from the control loop.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In implementations, the aforementioned adjustment signal may be derived according to a ratio of a second amplitude of the second sinusoidal signal indicated by the second signal parameter to a first amplitude of the first sinusoidal signal indicated by the first signal parameter. Moreover, the adjustment signal may be derived according to a difference between a second phase of the second sinusoidal signal indicated by the second signal parameter and a first phase of the first sinusoidal signal indicated by the first signal parameter. Similarly, the adjustment signal may be derived for changing a gain of the compensator with respect to the control signal, or changing a phase lagging value or a phase leading value of the compensator with respect to the control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Consequently, the microprocessor <b>218</b> can obtain the gain and phase variations of the control loop caused by the temperature variations, or the physical property variations of system components by means of the additionally introduced first sinusoidal signal S<b>1</b> after the long-term working. The invention can precisely obtain the gain and phase variations of the control loop and accurately adjust the parameter of the compensator, which indicates that the optical disk drive under the present invention is more stable than the conventional ones.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of a preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements and procedures, and the scope of the appended claims therefore should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements and procedures.</p>
