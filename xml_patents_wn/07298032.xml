<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This U.S. non-provisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119 from Korean Patent Application No. 2003-21922, filed on Apr. 8, 2003, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to a semiconductor multi-chip package and a method of manufacturing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional semiconductor chips have either a center pad configuration, wherein bonding pads <b>12</b> are formed on a center region of the chips, or a peripheral pad configuration, wherein bonding pads <b>14</b> are formed on a peripheral region of the chips. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a plan view of a semiconductor chip having a center pad configuration and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a plan view of a semiconductor chip having a peripheral pad configuration. The center pad configuration is generally more suitable for achieving high-speed operation of semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently, the semiconductor industry is expending significant resources toward forming semiconductor multi-chip packages that can meet the demand for high packing density in high-speed, multi-functional semiconductor devices. As part of such efforts, the industry has proposed semiconductor multi-chip packages that include stacked chips having a peripheral pad configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One such conventional multi-chip package is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a semiconductor multi-chip package includes stacked chips <b>20</b>, <b>40</b>, each having a peripheral pad configuration. The chips <b>20</b>, <b>40</b> are stacked one on top of the other with a spacer <b>30</b> placed between them. Unfortunately, however, the multi-chip package of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> cannot be assembled using a lower chip with a center pad configuration, because the center pads do not provide sufficient room between them for placement of a spacer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one conventional attempt to provide a semiconductor multi-chip package <b>32</b> having a lower chip <b>32</b> originally configured having a center pad configuration, i.e., pad wiring patterns (not shown) formed on a center region thereof (“center pad wiring patterns”).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate a technique for redistributing center pad wiring patterns <b>36</b> to peripheral bonding pads <b>38</b>, in which an actual wire bonding process is performed. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, a conventional multi-chip package <b>32</b>, according to this example, includes stacked chips <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> originally configured having a center pad configuration. The center pad wiring patterns <b>36</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are redistributed from a center region to a peripheral region using redistribution patterns <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In other words, the center pad wiring patterns <b>36</b> are connected to the peripheral bonding pads <b>38</b> through the redistribution patterns <b>39</b>. This allows for a spacer <b>37</b> to be placed between the bonding pads <b>38</b> on the lower chip <b>32</b> to form a multi-chip package <b>300</b> comprising stacked chips <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> with the center pad wiring patterns <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Unfortunately, however, the cost of redistributing the pad wiring patterns is considerably high, and the process and package reliability are yet to reach desirable levels. Accordingly, a need remains for a reliable and cost-effective method of manufacturing semiconductor multi-chip packages using chips having a center pad configuration.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to principles of the present invention, a high-density semiconductor multi-chip package can be formed using chips with a center pad configuration. This can preferably be accomplished using existing assembly equipment and without the use of costly and unreliable pad redistribution processes.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one embodiment, for example, a multi-chip package comprises a package substrate having bond fingers disposed thereon. A first chip is disposed on the package substrate and preferably includes first bonding pads formed on a substantially center portion of the chip. Insulating support structures are preferably formed outward of the bonding pads on the first chip. A bonding wire is preferably connected between one of the bond fingers and at least one of the first bonding pads. A portion of the bonding wire is preferably spaced apart from the first chip using the support structures. A second chip is disposed over the bonding wire and overlying the insulating support structures.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Various embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings. It should be noted, however, that the various embodiments of the present invention described herein can be modified in arrangement and detail, and that the scope of the present invention is not restricted to the described embodiments. Rather, these exemplary embodiments are provided to demonstrate the principles of the present invention to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a preferred embodiment of a multi-chip package constructed according to principles of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a multi-chip package <b>400</b> preferably comprises a package substrate <b>200</b> having bond fingers <b>220</b> disposed thereon. A first chip <b>210</b> preferably has a center pad configuration, and therefore includes first bonding pads <b>215</b>, formed on a substantially center portion thereof. The first chip <b>210</b> is preferably disposed on the package substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Insulating support structures <b>260</b> are preferably formed on the first chip <b>210</b> outwards of the bonding pads <b>215</b>. The insulating support structures <b>260</b> can, for example, be formed spaced apart from each other along opposite sides of the first chip <b>210</b>, with the bonding pads <b>215</b> therebetween. The insulating support structures <b>260</b> can, for example, extend in a line shape along a periphery of at least two opposing sides of the first chip <b>210</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The support structures <b>260</b> are by no means limited, however, to having a line shape, and other shapes are within the contemplation of the invention. For example, the support structures <b>260</b> may be a plurality of separate, mound-like structures disposed along the length of two or more edges of the first chip <b>210</b>. The support structures <b>260</b> can also be formed in corners of the first chip <b>210</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14B</figref>. By using separate, mound-like support structures, manufacturing costs and processing time can be reduced, as compared to the line-shaped support structures <b>260</b>, because the amount of material required to form the insulating support structures can be reduced. Also, the support structures <b>260</b> are not limited to a straight line shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Other shapes such as a wavy line shape may be used to implement the present invention. In addition, more than a single line of insulating support structures <b>260</b> can be formed on opposing peripheral regions of the first chip <b>210</b> depending on manufacturing objectives.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A bonding wire <b>230</b> is preferably connected between one of the bond fingers <b>220</b> and at least one of the first bonding pads <b>215</b>. The bonding wire <b>230</b> is preferably spaced apart from the first chip <b>210</b> by the insulating support structures <b>260</b>. It is also desirable to ensure that the top of the bonding wire loop <b>230</b> is not substantially higher than the top of the support structures <b>260</b>. A second chip <b>310</b> having second bonding pads <b>315</b> is preferably disposed over the bonding wire <b>230</b> and overlying the insulating support structures <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment incorporating principles of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the bonding wire <b>230</b> may pass through, rather than overlying, the support structures <b>260</b>. In this configuration, the insulating support structures <b>260</b> can directly support the second chip <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In still other embodiments, however, depending on manufacturing objectives, the bonding wire <b>230</b> need not directly contact the support structures <b>260</b> and could, for example, be arranged over but not touching or alongside the line-shaped or separate, mound-like support structures <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates another aspect of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the multi-chip package <b>400</b> preferably includes an interposer <b>270</b> sandwiched between the first chip <b>210</b> and the second chip <b>310</b> for adhesion therebetween. The interposer <b>270</b> supports the second chip <b>310</b> and prevents it from touching the bonding wire <b>230</b> connected to the first chip <b>210</b>. An interposer material <b>170</b>—for example, an epoxy without a filler such as silica therein—is preferably placed between the spaced apart support structures <b>260</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) to form the interposer <b>270</b>. Various alternative embodiments can be formed, however, without using the interposer <b>270</b>, by instead using the insulating support structures <b>260</b> and/or insulating tape <b>340</b> to support the second chip <b>310</b> and insulate the bonding wires <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the multi-chip package <b>400</b> may further include an insulating tape <b>340</b> disposed between the second chip <b>310</b> and the bonding wire <b>230</b>, for example, to provide isolation therebetween. The insulating tape <b>340</b> is preferably formed on a bottom surface of the second chip <b>310</b>. The insulating tape <b>340</b> may directly touch the bonding wire <b>230</b>, although not shown. Also, the insulating tape <b>340</b> may directly touch the insulating support structures <b>260</b>, for example, if the bonding wire <b>230</b> passes through the support structures <b>260</b> as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>. Alternatively, the insulating tape <b>340</b> may contact the interposer <b>270</b> without contacting the bonding wire <b>230</b> or the insulating support structures <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The multi-chip package <b>400</b> may also include an epoxy molding compound (EMC) <b>350</b> that encapsulates the first and second chips <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>. Although not shown, if the interposer <b>270</b> is not formed on the first chip <b>210</b>, the EMC <b>350</b> is preferably instead disposed between the first chip <b>210</b> and the second chip <b>310</b> in place of the interposer <b>270</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Manufacturing Method</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A preferred method of manufacturing the above-described semiconductor multi-chip package <b>400</b> will now be described in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-12</figref>. Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a semiconductor multi-chip package <b>400</b> is formed by mounting a lower (or first) semiconductor chip <b>210</b> on a package substrate <b>200</b>. This can be accomplished using conventional techniques. An adhesive <b>240</b> can, for example, be applied on the package substrate <b>200</b> using a conventional die-bonder having a dispenser unit for dispensing the adhesive <b>240</b>. The adhesive may be a conventional adhesive material typically used in semiconductor packaging.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The package substrate <b>200</b> may be a printed circuit board (PCB) or other package substrate such as a lead frame or a wiring tape, for example. The substrate <b>200</b> preferably has bond fingers (or wire connection contacts) <b>220</b> for electrical connection between the package substrate <b>200</b> and the first chip <b>210</b>. The first chip <b>210</b> preferably has first bonding pads (center bonding pads) <b>215</b> formed on a substantially center portion of the chip <b>210</b>. The lower semiconductor chip <b>210</b> is preferably attached to the package substrate <b>200</b> using the adhesive <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, insulating support structures <b>260</b> can be formed by applying a liquid type nonconductive epoxy resin, or any other suitable non-conductive insulating material, for example, hybrid type adhesive, silicon type adhesive, film type adhesive, on the peripheral surface (i.e., the surface of the peripheral region) of the lower chip <b>210</b>. This can be done using conventional techniques, including, for example, a dispensing technique. A die bonder dispenser unit, as used to apply the adhesive <b>240</b> onto the package substrate <b>200</b>, can be used to provide the epoxy resin onto the peripheral surface of the lower chip <b>210</b>. The insulating support structures <b>260</b> can, for example, be arranged as lines along the peripheral region of the lower chip <b>210</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) or they can be arranged as a plurality of separate, mound-like structures aligned, for instance, with the center bonding pads <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The resultant structure is then preferably heat treated at approximately 100° C. or higher to solidify the epoxy resin of the support structures <b>260</b>, as well as the adhesive <b>240</b>. The insulating support structures <b>260</b> can thereby be formed on the peripheral region of the lower chip <b>210</b>. The width d<b>1</b> of the support structures <b>260</b> is preferably less than half of the distance d<b>2</b> between the center of the bonding pads <b>215</b> and the nearest edge of the first chip <b>210</b>. In addition, the height h of the support structures <b>260</b> is preferably between about 25˜200 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a portion of the bond fingers <b>220</b> are preferably electrically connected to the first bonding pads <b>215</b> through first bonding wires <b>230</b> made of a conductive material such as gold or copper. This wire bonding process can be performed using conventional techniques including, but not limited to, a wedge bonding technique or a bump reverse ball bonding technique. The wire bonding process may be performed directly on the first bonding pads <b>215</b> formed on a substantially center portion of the chip <b>210</b>. The first wires <b>230</b> may directly contact the top surface of (i.e., placed directly overlying) the support structures <b>260</b>, as shown in reference area A. The bonding wires <b>230</b> could also be configured to pass through the support structures <b>260</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) or located over the insulating support structures <b>260</b> such that they do not touch the support structures <b>260</b>. Using the insulating support structures <b>260</b>, conventional problems such as bond wire sagging can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an interposer material <b>170</b> is preferably provided on the surface of the lower chip <b>210</b>. The interposer material <b>170</b> may be a liquid, and may be the same as the material used to form the support structures <b>260</b>. The interposer material <b>170</b> can be applied using a conventional dispensing technique.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an upper (or second) semiconductor chip <b>310</b> is mounted on the first chip <b>210</b>. The second chip <b>310</b> may have either a center pad configuration or a peripheral pad configuration. The loop height and the shape of the wires <b>230</b> are preferably controlled such that the first wires <b>230</b> do not contact the bottom surface of the second chip <b>310</b>. In this respect, the bonding wires <b>230</b> may have a low loop height and have a substantially flat portion suitable for stacking the second chip <b>310</b> over the first chip <b>210</b>. The package thickness can thereby be reduced and device failure resulting from unwanted contact between the wires <b>230</b> and the second chip <b>310</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Optionally, the second chip <b>310</b> may have an insulating tape <b>340</b> disposed on the bottom side thereof. The insulating tape <b>340</b> prevents the bottom surface of the second chip <b>310</b> from touching the first wires <b>230</b> and allows the second chip <b>310</b> to be arranged closer to the first chip <b>210</b>, reducing overall package thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The insulating tape <b>340</b> is not required, however, and even without the insulating tape <b>340</b>, sufficient isolation between the wires <b>230</b> and the second chip <b>310</b> can be obtained through use of the interposer <b>270</b> and/or the insulating structures <b>260</b> disposed between the first and second chips <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>. For example, if the bonding wire <b>230</b> passes through the support structures <b>260</b> as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, the insulating tape <b>340</b> is not needed between the first chip <b>210</b> and the second chip <b>310</b>. In either of these embodiments, the bonding wires <b>230</b> are preferably distanced sufficiently from the bottom surface of the second chip <b>310</b> to provide isolation therebetween. Thus, according to various embodiments of the present invention, the height of the first bonding wires <b>230</b> (the wire loop) can be substantially reduced, which in turn substantially reduces the overall package thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">During mounting or attaching of the second chip <b>310</b> to the first chip <b>210</b>, the interposer material <b>170</b> is pushed down and spreads out toward the peripheral region of the lower chip <b>210</b>. During this process, the insulating support structures <b>260</b> extending along the length of the first chip <b>210</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) act as a dam structure, helping to contain the interposer material <b>170</b> within the boundaries of the first chip <b>210</b> and prevent it from leaking out onto the package substrate <b>200</b>. Although it is possible to have insulating support structures <b>260</b> arranged on more than two sides of the first chip <b>210</b>, because voids may be generated within the interposer material <b>170</b> when mounting or attaching the upper chip <b>310</b> on the lower chip <b>210</b>, it is preferable to have the insulating support structures <b>260</b> extend along only two opposing sides of the first chip <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">By helping to prevent the interposer material <b>170</b> from flowing onto the sidewalls of the lower chip <b>210</b>, an adequate thickness of the interposer <b>270</b> can be maintained. In addition, by preventing the interposer material <b>170</b> from flowing between the lower chip <b>210</b> and the housing <b>350</b>, weak adhesion between them can be prevented. For example, if the interposer material <b>170</b> is permitted to escape from the edge of the lower chip <b>210</b>, the interposer material <b>170</b> having the weak adhesion characteristics are interposed between the lower chip <b>210</b> and the an epoxy molding compound that encapsulates the first and second chips <b>210</b>, <b>310</b>, thereby preventing the strong direct adhesion between the molding compound that forms a housing <b>350</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) and the lower chip <b>210</b>. Escape of the interposer material <b>170</b> can thereby lower the overall package reliability. The support structures <b>260</b> may also be useful in maintaining a parallel relationship between the second chip <b>310</b> and the first chip <b>210</b> during the attachment. This also improves the yield and reduces the overall package thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">After the second chip <b>310</b> is mounted on the first chip <b>210</b>, the interposer material <b>170</b> is then solidified by thermal treatment at a temperature between about 50° C. to about 200° C. to form an interposer <b>270</b>. The interposer <b>270</b> permits the lower and upper chips <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> to be adjoined to each other while further securing the bonding wires <b>230</b> within the solidified interposer <b>270</b>. Because the interposer <b>270</b> can prevent the first wires <b>230</b> from being swept or bent by a flowing molding compound during a transfer molding process, conventional encapsulation problems such as wire sweeping and sagging caused by an encapsulation material can be effectively prevented. In addition, the interposer <b>270</b> also provides isolation between the first chip <b>210</b> and the second chip <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The other portions of the bond fingers <b>220</b> are preferably electrically connected to second bonding pads <b>315</b> formed in the upper chip <b>310</b> through second bonding wires <b>330</b>. This can also be done using conventional wire bonding techniques, as discussed above. The upper chip <b>310</b> may also have insulating support structures formed using similar methods to those described above.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the resultant structure can then be subjected to a molding process to form a housing <b>350</b>. This can be a conventional molding process using EMC. Those skilled in the art, however, will appreciate that the housing <b>350</b> can be formed of materials other than EMC, such as ceramic, and that it can be formed using processes other than the conventional molding process. As pointed out previously, the interposer <b>270</b> prevents the first wires <b>230</b> from being swept and bent by a molding compound during a transfer molding process. Thus, bonding wire reliability and package reliability can be substantially improved compared to conventional packages having such wire sweeping and sagging problems. A conductive ball array such as a solder ball array can be formed on the bottom side of the package substrate <b>200</b> to form a ball grid array (BGA) package and to permit interconnection to an external system.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Alternative Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment implementing the principles of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, this alternative embodiment is similar to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-13B</figref>, except that the support structures <b>260</b> are formed after forming the first wires <b>230</b>. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the first wires <b>230</b> can pass through the support structures <b>260</b>. In the specific embodiment shown, the first wires <b>230</b> pass through a middle portion of the support structures <b>260</b> such that the first wires <b>230</b> are fixed or secured within the support structures <b>260</b>. One advantage of this embodiment is that the top height of the first wires <b>230</b> is lower than the top height of the support structures <b>260</b>. The bottom side of the upper chip <b>310</b> can thereby be sufficiently isolated from the first wires <b>230</b> and the wire sweeping and sagging problem can be prevented and insulating tape <b>340</b> is not needed. The upper chip <b>310</b> can also be kept parallel with the lower chip <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, a single-chip package can benefit from various principles of this invention. In this embodiment, after forming the support structures <b>260</b>, the resultant structure may be subjected to a molding process and a process for forming a solder ball array. In this single-chip embodiment, the support structures <b>260</b> help prevent sweeping and sagging of the first wires <b>230</b> during the molding process.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Wafer-Level Manufacturing Technique</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> illustrate a wafer-level manufacturing technique according to still another aspect of the present invention. The wafer-level manufacturing process is similar to the process explained above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 13B</figref>, except that the support structures <b>260</b> can be formed at the wafer level.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a wafer includes a plurality of chips <b>210</b>, each having insulating support structures <b>260</b> formed thereon. The support structures <b>260</b> can be formed using a wafer-level dispensing technique similar to the dispensing techniques described previously. The support structures <b>260</b> may also be formed using a screen-printing technique. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a screen mask <b>402</b> used to form line-shaped support structures <b>260</b>. The screen mask <b>402</b> could also be used to form a plurality of separate, interspersed structures. The screen-printing technique provides better control over the width and height of the support structures <b>260</b>. After the insulating support structures <b>260</b> are formed, the wafer are cut out (dicing) to singulate the plurality of chips <b>210</b>. Next, the processes described above or similar methods are performed to form a multi-chip package according to the principles of the present invention. The method of forming support structures <b>260</b> at the wafer level may also be used for a package having only a single chip.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Chip Packages Having Three or More Chips</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a still further embodiment implementing principles of the present invention in which a multi-chip package includes more than two stacked chips. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a multi-chip package <b>500</b> according to this embodiment includes three or more stacked chips <b>510</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, <b>540</b>. For simplicity in illustration, all of the bond wires <b>512</b> in this figure appear connected to a single bond finger <b>514</b>. Those skilled in the art will understand, however, that the respective bonding wires <b>512</b> are connected to corresponding bond fingers <b>514</b> as needed. Each of the stacked chips <b>510</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, <b>540</b> may have either a center pad configuration or a peripheral pad configuration. Not all of the stacked chips <b>510</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, <b>540</b> need to have the same pad configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In conclusion, using the insulating structures <b>260</b> disclosed as part of the present invention, with or without the interposer <b>270</b>, multi-chips packages can be formed using lower chips having a center pad configuration. Further, the methods disclosed herein are less expensive than conventional methods and are able to be implemented using existing equipment. Additionally, conventional problems such as wire sweeping or sagging can be avoided.</p>
