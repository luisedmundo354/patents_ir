No. 60/487,630, entitled Snap-in Retention Contact System, filed Jul. 16, 2003, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to an electrical interconnect assembly for electrically connecting a first circuit members to one or more second circuit members, and in particular, an electrical connector adapted to surface mount on a printed circuit board having elongated contact members with two or more beams adapted to electrically couple with integrated circuits and a pitch of about 1.1 millimeters or less.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The current trend in connector design for those connectors utilized in the computer field is to provide both high density and high reliability connectors between various circuit devices. High reliability for such connections is essential due to potential system failure caused by improper connections of devices. Further, to assure effective repair, upgrade, testing and/or replacement of various components, such as connectors, cards, chips, boards, and modules, it is highly desirable that such connections be separable and reconnectable in the final product.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Pin-type connectors soldered into plated through holes or vias are among the most commonly used in the industry today. Pins on the connector body are inserted through plated holes or vias on a printed circuit board and soldered in place using a conventional mechanism. Another connector or a packaged semiconductor device is then inserted and retained by the connector body by mechanical interference or friction. The tin lead alloy solder and associated chemicals used throughout the process of soldering these connectors to the printed circuit board have come under increased scrutiny due to their environmental impact. The plastic housings of these connectors undergo a significant amount of thermal activity during the soldering process, which stresses the component and threatens reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The soldered contacts on the connector body are typically the mechanical support for the device being interfaced by the connector and are subject to fatigue, stress deformation, solder bridging, and co-planarity errors, potentially causing premature failure or loss of continuity. In particular, as the mating connector or semiconductor device is inserted and removed from the connector attached to the printed circuit board, the elastic limit on the contacts soldered to the circuit board may be exceeded causing a loss of continuity. These connectors are typically not reliable for more than a few insertions and removals of devices. These devices also have a relatively long electrical length that can degrade system performance, especially for high frequency or low power components. The pitch or separation between adjacent device leads that can be produced using these connectors is also limited due to the risk of shorting.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another electrical interconnection method is known as wire bonding, which involves the mechanical or thermal compression of a soft metal wire, such as gold, from one circuit to another. Such bonding, however, does not lend itself readily to high-density connections because of possible wire breakage and accompanying mechanical difficulties in wire handling.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An alternate electrical interconnection technique involves placement of solder balls or the like between respective circuit elements. The solder is reflowed to form the electrical interconnection. While this technique has proven successful in providing high-density interconnections for various structures, this technique does not allow facile separation and subsequent reconnection of the circuit members.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An elastomer having a plurality of conductive paths has also been used as an interconnection device. The conductive elements embedded in the elastomeric sheet provide an electrical connection between two opposing terminals brought into contact with the elastomeric sheet. The elastomeric material that supports the conductive elements compresses during usage to allow some movement of the conductive elements. Such elastomeric connectors require a relatively high force per contact to achieve adequate electrical connection, exacerbating non-planarity between mating surfaces. Location of the conductive elements is generally not controllable. Elastomeric connectors may also exhibit a relatively high electrical resistance through the interconnection between the associated circuit elements. The interconnection with the circuit elements can be sensitive to dust, debris, oxidation, temperature fluctuations, vibration, and other environmental elements that may adversely affect the connection.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The present interconnect assembly provides the ability to press-fit the contacts into lower layers to position, point and retain the contact and seal the interface to prevent solder or flux wicking during reflow. A post insertion solder mask (as done on printed circuit boards and IC packages) can also be added to improve solder deposit formation and wick prevention.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The present lamination process permits stiffening layers, spacer, circuitry, and/or protective layers to be added to the interconnect assembly. The lamination system also permits the creation of high aspect ratio contacts, in which almost 80-90% of the physical height of the contacts can be vertically compressed, even in quad contact beam systems. The present low cost, high signal performance interconnect assemblies, which have low profiles and can be soldered to the system PC board, are particularly useful for desktop and mobile PC applications.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Use of the present interconnect assembly permits manufactures to install expensive IC devices during system build, providing the opportunity to later customize the system without stocking substitute circuit boards. The use of the present interconnect assembly allows new IC devices to replace initial release IC devices in the field (or at OEM) without the need for disassembling the system or reworking the circuit board. Trends towards lead-free electronics also increases the attractiveness of the present interconnect assembly. The IC supplier can leave the solder balls off their package or device to reduce the lead content.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an interconnect assembly <b>20</b> in accordance with the present invention. The interconnect assembly <b>20</b> includes a contact system <b>22</b> and a housing <b>24</b> having electrical insulating properties. The housing <b>24</b> includes a plurality of through openings <b>26</b>. Contact members <b>28</b>A, <b>28</b>B, <b>28</b>C and <b>28</b>D (referred to collectively as “<b>28</b>”) are located in at least some of the through openings <b>26</b> and are coupled to the housing <b>24</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the interconnect assembly <b>20</b> is electrically coupled to circuit member <b>40</b>. As used</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The present invention is directed to a technique for creating an insulator housing in low, medium, or high volume by laminating layers of precisely patterned materials. The patterned layers can be constructed from the same or multiple material types. The layers are optionally selectively laminated to relieve stress caused by thermal expansion differentials.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The present construction method permits internal features that would normally be impossible to mold or machine. For large pin count devices, the laminating process produces an inherently flat part without requiring molds. Stiffening layers made of materials such as BeCu, Cu, ceramic, or polymer filled ceramic can be added to provide additional strength and to provide thermal stability during solder reflow.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The multi-layered housing can also include circuitry layers. Power, grounding and/or decoupling capacitance can be added between layers or between pins, and unique features such as embedded IC devices or RF antennae can optionally be incorporated. In some cases, layers can be used to assist with device insertion or removal, such as with ZIF or stripper plate actuation mechanisms. Consequently, the present interconnect assembly can be enhanced in ways not possible using conventional molding or machining techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The present interconnect assembly permits the creation of high aspect ratio through holes and slots with internal cavities having non-moldable features, to allow for contact flexure clearance, on fine contact to contact spacing (pitch). The present interconnect assembly accommodates pin counts of 1000-2500 I/O range at 1.0 mm pitch, and more preferably a pitch of about 0.8 millimeter, and most preferably a pitch of about 0.5 millimeter. Such fine pitch interconnect assemblies are especially useful for communications, wireless, and memory devices. herein, the term “circuit members” refers to, for example, a packaged integrated circuit device, an unpackaged integrated circuit device, a printed circuit board, a flexible circuit, a bare-die device, an organic or inorganic substrate, a rigid circuit, or any other device capable of carrying electrical current.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The housing <b>24</b> may be constructed of a dielectric material, such as plastic. Suitable plastics include phenolics, polyesters, and Ryton® available from Phillips Petroleum Company. Alternatively, the housing <b>24</b> may be constructed from metal, such as aluminum, with a non-conductive surface, such as an anodized surface. For some applications, the metal housing may provide additional shielding of the contact members. In an alternate embodiment, the housing is grounded to the electrical system, thus providing a controlled impedance environment. Some of the contact members can be grounded by permitting them to contact an uncoated surface of the metal housing. As used herein, an “electrically insulative connector housing” or a “module housing” refers to a housing that is either non-conductive or substantially coated with a non-conductive material to prevent unwanted conductivity between the contact members and the housing, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The housings of the present invention can optionally be constructed from a plurality of discrete layers. The layers can be etched or ablated and stacked without the need for expensive mold tooling. The layers can create housing features that have a much larger aspect ratio than typically possible with molding or machining. The layers also permit the creation of internal features, undercuts, or cavities that are difficult or typically not possible to make using conventional molding or machining techniques, referred to herein as a “non-moldable feature.” The present housings also permit stiffening layers, such as metal, ceramic, or alternate filled resins, to be added to maintain flatness where a molded or machined part might warp.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The housings of the present invention can optionally include circuitry, power, and/or ground planes to selectively connect or insulate contact members within a given field. The layers can be selectively bonded or non-bonded to provide contiguous material or releasable layers. As used herein, “bond” or “bonding” refers to, for example, adhesive bonding, solvent bonding, ultrasonic welding, thermal bonding, or any other techniques suitable for attaching adjacent layers of the housing. Multiple layers of differing contact members can be implemented to interact with each other, while being permanently engaged or separable. The layers can be structured in such a way as to rigidly retain the contact members or to allow the contacts to float or move along the X, Y, and/or Z axes of the contact members. The layers can be constructed in such a way that the base of the contact members are either in a sealed condition as a result of the insertion process to prevent solder or flux wicking during reflow, or the interface can be sealed post assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates more detail of one of the contact members <b>28</b> interlocked to the housing <b>24</b>. The contact member <b>28</b> has a first interface portion <b>30</b> and a second interface portion <b>36</b>. The first interface portion <b>30</b> is positioned to electrically couple with terminal <b>32</b> on first circuit member <b>34</b> and the second interface portion <b>36</b> is positioned to electrically couple with terminal <b>38</b> on the second circuit member <b>40</b>, when the first and second circuit members <b>34</b>, <b>40</b> are biased toward the housing <b>24</b>. Any method of securing can be used, including bolting, clamping and gluing.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The contact member <b>28</b> includes an interlocking feature <b>42</b> and a transition portion <b>44</b> connected to the interlocking feature <b>42</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the interlocking feature <b>42</b> is greater in size than the transition portion <b>44</b> in at least one direction. The through opening <b>26</b> in the housing <b>24</b> includes at least one interlocking feature <b>46</b> of sufficient size to accommodate the interlocking feature <b>42</b> on the contact member <b>28</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the interlocking feature <b>42</b> is a ball-shaped structure and the interlocking feature <b>46</b> is a socket. As used herein, “interlocking” and “interlocked” refer to a mechanical coupling where one part is trapped or captured by another part in such a way as to permit at least a portion of one of the parts to move relative to the other part through at least one degree of freedom, such as for example by hooking, snap-fit, non-binding interference fit, dovetailing. An “interlocking feature” refers to a structure for interlocking.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The housing <b>24</b> includes an opening <b>48</b> large enough to accommodate the transition portion <b>44</b> but smaller than the interlocking feature <b>42</b> in at least one direction so that the contact member <b>28</b> does not fall out of the housing <b>24</b>. The interlocking feature <b>42</b> thus can be secured to the interlocking feature <b>46</b> with the transition positioned <b>44</b> extending through the opening <b>48</b>.</p>

As used herein, “snap fit” refers to interlocking by substantially elastic deformation of a contact member and/or a housing.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the operation of the contact member <b>28</b> in the housing <b>24</b>. The housing <b>24</b> includes a top surface <b>60</b> and a bottom surface <b>62</b>. The top surface <b>60</b> is adapted to be biased toward the first circuit member <b>34</b> and the bottom surface <b>62</b> is adapted to be biased toward the second circuit member <b>40</b> (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The first interface portion <b>30</b> of the contact member <b>28</b> is biased by elastomeric member <b>64</b> to protrude above the top surface <b>60</b> (position A) when the first circuit member <b>34</b> is not secured to the housing <b>24</b>. The first interface portion <b>30</b> is displaced toward the top surface <b>62</b> (position B) when the first circuit member <b>34</b> is biased toward the housing <b>24</b>. The location of the second interface portion <b>36</b> is biased against the second circuit member <b>40</b> when both the first and second circuit members <b>34</b>, <b>40</b> are biased toward the housing <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the biasing of the first interface portion <b>30</b> is provided, at least in part, by a elastomeric member <b>64</b> located under the first interface portion <b>30</b>. The elastomeric member <b>64</b> can be in any form suitable to provide the necessary biasing force, including spherical, cylindrical and rectangular. It can be secured in a variety of ways, including being glued to the housing <b>24</b> and/or the contact member <b>28</b>, press-fitted into a cavity defined on either the housing of the contact member, or simply trapped in a space defined between the housing and the contact member. As the first circuit member <b>34</b> is biased toward the housing <b>24</b>, the elastomeric member <b>64</b> is compressed, and the moment arm created by the forces at the tip portion <b>66</b> by the elastomeric member <b>64</b> and at the first interface portion <b>30</b> results in a force biasing the second interface portion <b>36</b> toward the second circuit member <b>40</b> secured to the bottom surface <b>62</b> of the housing <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">It should be noted that the designations of “top” and “bottom” in this context is purely for the convenience of distinguishing different parts of the contact system and the environment in which it is used.

<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The cutouts <b>1723</b> can be replaced with cutout of a variety of shaped, such as for example, oval, triangular, rectangular, hexagonal, and the like. By changing the size and the shape of the cutout <b>1723</b> and/or the size and the shape of the solder member <b>1726</b>, the solder member <b>1726</b> can be permitted to move relative to the contact member <b>1700</b>, while still being retained in the tabs <b>1716</b>, <b>1718</b>. A free-floating solder member <b>1726</b> increase the ability of the contact member <b>1700</b> to adapt to non-planarity of the circuit member <b>1772</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The solder member <b>1726</b> has a generally spherical shape with a diameter <b>1728</b> that is slightly greater than spacing <b>1730</b> between the tabs <b>1716</b>, <b>1718</b>. In one embodiment, the tabs <b>1716</b>, <b>1718</b> elastically deform to receive the solder member <b>1726</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, a portion of the solder member <b>1726</b> is seated in the opposing engagement features <b>1722</b>, <b>1724</b> in a snap-fit relationship. In an alternate embodiment, the solder member <b>1726</b> and/or the tabs <b>1716</b>, <b>1718</b> are plastically deformed during or after mechanical engagement, such as for example by crimping the tabs <b>1716</b>, <b>1718</b> to more securely fasting the solder member <b>1726</b> to the contact member <b>1700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In another embodiment, the solder member <b>1726</b> is plastically deformed, such as for example by coining, before engagement with the tabs <b>1716</b>, <b>1718</b> (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49 and 50</figref>). The solder member <b>1726</b> may include one or more complementary features that mechanically engage with the solder member attachment mechanism <b>1702</b>. For example, a series of protrusion can be formed in the surface of the solder member <b>1726</b>. By arranging the number, size and spacing of the protrusions, it is possible to increase the likelihood that a protrusion will engage with an engagement feature on the tabs.</p>
