<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to allocating access across a shared communications medium and, in particular, to allocating bandwidth used to convey data of competing users across a shared communications medium of a Carrier Network.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As used herein, a “Carrier Network” generally refers to a computer network through which users (such as homes and businesses) communicate with various service providers. The Carrier Network extends from the location of each user to an intermediate switched/routed network (hereinafter “Intermediate Network”). The service providers, in turn, are connected to the Intermediate Network, either directly or indirectly via the Internet, for communications with the users. The Carrier Network is maintained by a “Carrier,” which also may serve as a service provider for certain services. For example, a Carrier or a related entity may serve as an Internet service provider (ISP).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Two prevalent types of Carrier Networks include a “Shared Access Carrier Network,” in which data of multiple users are conveyed together over a shared communications medium between the users and the Intermediate Network, and a “Dedicated Connection Carrier Network,” in which data of each user are conveyed alone between the user and the Intermediate Network and are not combined with data of other users. One of the most prevalent Shared Access Carrier Networks today is found in the Data-Over-Cable (DOC) Network, which includes the traditional network constructed from coaxial cable and the hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) network constructed with both fiber optical cabling and coaxial cable. Other Shared Access Carrier Networks include wireless and digital subscriber line (xDSL) networks (the xDSL lines typically being aggregated onto an oversubscribed backhaul trunk into the Intermediate Network, with the trunk defining the shared communications medium).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, with regard to DOC Networks, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> wherein a conventional DOC Network <b>40</b> is illustrated, data packets are transmitted in a downstream direction from a cable modem termination system (CMTS) <b>30</b>, which is located in a headend <b>36</b> (or distribution hub) of a Carrier, over a coaxial cable <b>32</b> to respective cable modems (CMs) <b>34</b> of users. All of the CMs <b>34</b> are attached by the coaxial cable <b>32</b> to the CMTS <b>30</b> in an inverted tree configuration, and each CM <b>34</b> connected to the coaxial cable <b>32</b> listens to all broadcasts from the CMTS <b>30</b> transmitted through the coaxial cable <b>32</b> for data packets addressed to it, and ignores all other data packets addressed to other CMs <b>34</b>. Theoretically, a CM <b>34</b> is capable of receiving data in the downstream direction over a 6 MHz channel with a maximum connection speed of 30-40 Mbps. Data packets also are transmitted in the upstream direction over a 2 MHz channel by the CMs <b>34</b> to the CMTS <b>30</b> typically using time division multiplexing (TDM) and at a maximum connection speed of 1.5-10 Mbps.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The headend <b>36</b> in the DOC Network <b>40</b> includes a plurality of CMTSs, with each CMTS supporting multiple groups of CMs each connected together by a respective coaxial cable. Each such group of CMs connected to a CMTS defines a Shared Access Carrier Network, with the coaxial cable in each representing the shared communications medium. This arrangement of a group of CMs connected to a CMTS by a coaxial cable is referred to herein as a “Cable Network.” Accordingly, the DOC Network <b>40</b> includes a plurality of Cable Networks <b>38</b> originating from CMTSs at the headend <b>36</b> of the Carrier, with a particular Cable Network <b>38</b> being illustrated in an expanded view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The DOC Network <b>40</b> also includes multiple headends <b>36</b>,<b>64</b>,<b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In contrast to the Shared Access Carrier Network, a user in the Dedicated Connection Carrier Network establishes a dedicated connection directly with the Intermediate Network for the transfer of data directly therebetween, and no data of other users travel over the dedicated connection. Examples of a dedicated connection are shown for comparison in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and include a connection established by a telephony modem <b>74</b> and a connection established by an ISDN modem <b>76</b>. Both downstream and upstream connection speeds in a Dedicated Connection Carrier Network range from a maximum of 53 kbps in a telephony modem connection to a maximum of 128 kbps in a basic rate interface ISDN connection.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Connection speeds and, more importantly, throughput rate—the amount of data actually transmitted successfully in a given time interval—are important in minimizing downtime that users spend waiting for HTML documents to download from the Web. A Shared Access Carrier Network is considered superior to a comparable Dedicated Connection Carrier Network because the maximum instantaneous connection speed offered by the Shared Access Carrier Network is greater. A Shared Access Carrier Network is considered “comparable” to a Dedicated Connection Carrier Network where the entire bandwidth over a shared communications medium of the Shared Access Carrier Network equals an aggregate bandwidth that is divided between and dedicated to users in a Dedicated Connection Carrier Network. Accordingly, Shared Access Carrier Networks are able to offer significantly faster downloads of web documents, emails, and file transfers that are not considered available in Dedicated Connection Carrier Networks.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, new multimedia applications and Internet services, such as voice and video communications via the Internet, now are offered which require even greater throughput rates for acceptable levels of service than that of the traditional Internet services, i.e., throughput rates greater than that required for acceptable text-based Web browsing, file transferring, and email communication. It is believed that these new multimedia applications and Internet services cannot adequately be provided for over Dedicated Connection Carrier Networks and that, consequently, Shared Access Carrier Networks ultimately will prevail as the predominant type of Carrier Network for Internet access by users.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Of course, the actual throughput rates experienced by a particular user rarely, if ever, will equate to the maximum connection speeds of which the Shared Access Carrier Network is capable because of the shared nature of the communications medium. For example, in a Cable Network the total bandwidths available over the shared cable in the downstream and upstream directions, which determine the respective maximum connection speeds, must be shared among all of the users communicating at a given time. Thus, rarely will a single user have available for use a large portion of the entire bandwidth in a particular direction. Further, as a Carrier adds users to the Cable Network, the actual downstream and upstream bandwidths available to the user-and thus throughput rates of the user-generally will decrease. A Carrier therefore must be careful to draw a balance between the number of users connected to a Cable Network and the performance users experience communicating over the network.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Unfortunately, Shared Access Carrier Networks that have been established were designed to provide the traditional Internet services, and not the new multimedia applications and Internet services that require higher throughput rates for acceptable levels of service. Consequently, each balance previously struck by Carriers in establishing Shared Access Carrier Networks was based on considerations of the throughput rates required for the traditional Internet services, and user throughput rates currently experienced by users in such networks are believed to fall short of acceptable quality of service (QoS) standards believed required in a Carrier Network for the new multimedia applications and Internet services.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additionally, with regard to new Shared Access Carrier Networks that are being established, considerations of the new multimedia applications and Internet services tend to reduce the number of users that a Carrier now can reasonably expect to connect to the shared communications medium before degrading the performance levels of the new multimedia applications and Internet services. The balance is being shifted towards less users per shared access medium in exchange for higher throughput rates and, thus, higher QoS standards.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an attempt to avoid reducing the number of users, it has been proposed, at least in DOC Networks, to discriminate between the traditional Internet services and the new multimedia applications and Internet services with regard to priority of data packet transmissions. In particular, the generally accepted standard in the United States governing communication protocols over cable is DOCSIS version 1.0, which was ratified by the International Telecommunication Union in March of 1998. DOCSIS stands for “Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications.” When DOCSIS 1.0 was developed, it was generally believed that, in view of the “fast” connection speeds of Cable Networks, the provision of bandwidth on a best effort basis would be sufficient to meet all user requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, each user subscribed to receive network access pursuant to a service level agreement (SLA) which provided for network access (or bandwidth in Cable Networks) only on a best effort basis. Now, in an effort to address the foreseen ever-increasing demand for higher throughput rates, DOCISIS version 1.1 has been proposed, in accordance with which each data packet transmitted over a DOC Network now must include a classification designation for prioritization purposes by network equipment. Subsequently, data packets representing voice or video, for example, now can be identified and given priority transmission over data packets representing email, file transfers, and text-based Web documents. A benefit of such flow classification is that, while overall bandwidth generally available to a user may otherwise remain unchanged, throughput rates of data for voice and video now may be provided at a higher rate than throughput rates of data for the traditional Internet services, thereby increasing the performance of voice and video applications and services while at least maintaining the traditional number of users connected to a Cable Network.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A disadvantage of the revisions to DOCSIS 1.1 is that the revisions do not enhance established Cable Networks constructed with only DOCSIS 1.0 compliant equipment, as such equipment does not support the added functionality of DOCSIS 1.1 so as to distinguish between data packets.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">More broadly, another disadvantage of the classification of data packets into Internet Protocol (IP) flows based on the services represented by the data packets is that such classification discriminates against users who do not utilize multimedia applications and services receiving the prioritized transmissions. At least for some extensive users of the traditional Internet services, some degradation in performance may be noticed by lower classification of their data packets, particularly if the user engages in, for example, web hosting. While the transmissions of data packets for documents, files, and emails are not as time-sensitive as data packets for voice and video, increased data packet latency for documents, files, and emails, even if incrementally small, nevertheless will result in service degradation for large or numerous documents, files, and emails.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Accordingly, a need exists for a method and apparatus that will accommodate differing demands for network access by users competing for such access across a shared communications medium of a Shared Access Carrier Network, whether new or established, and irrespective of data packet classifications.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Briefly summarized, the present invention relates to a method of providing network access across a shared communications medium between competing users pursuant to SLAs of the users. The method broadly includes the steps of: (a) monitoring network access usage by each user during a time interval; (b) comparing the monitored network access usage by each user with a predetermined threshold value; and (c) soliciting a user to modify the user's SLA if the user's monitored network access usage varies from the predetermined value by a predetermined tolerance.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Features of the present invention include the additional steps of allocating network access to each user for a future time interval, and forecasting network access usage by users in the future time interval. Another additional feature of the present invention includes the step of prioritizing the users for allocating network access to the users.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The network access usage includes the user throughput rate, bandwidth consumption, and/or bandwidth requested for a predetermined period of time. The threshold value preferably represents a respective maximum level of network access (whether maximum allowed or maximum guaranteed) for each user or a respective maximum burstable level of network access with target probability for each user. The solicitation is conducted via email, instant messaging, redirection of a web browser of the user to a solicitation web page, generation and mailing of literature, telephonic communication, or other communication means. The solicited modification of the user's SLA includes guaranteeing a level of network access to the user on a permanent or on a temporary basis. A charge preferably is applied to the user for the modification.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A preferred method of the present invention includes the identification of a recurrent period of high network access usage by a user based on the monitoring, and in response thereto, the solicitation of the user to modify the user's SLA in order to guarantee a minimum level of network access during an anticipated future recurrent period of high network access usage.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth with regard to preferred embodiments of the present invention in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention; however, it will be apparent to ordinary artisans that the present invention may be practiced without all of these specific details. Well-known structures and devices also are shown in block diagram form, the specific details of which are not considered a necessary part of the present invention. Furthermore, as will become apparent to ordinary artisans, the present invention may be embodied in or performed by hardware, firmware, or software, or various combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As described above, a conventional DOC Network <b>40</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and includes a plurality of Cable Networks <b>38</b>, with a particular Cable Network <b>38</b> being illustrated in an expanded view and comprising a group of CMs <b>34</b>, each connected to a computer <b>44</b> representing a user. Additionally, as used herein, “user” includes not only a person who interacts with a computer <b>44</b>, but any additional persons who also interact with the same computer <b>44</b>, as well as any group of persons all of whom interact with computers attached either to the same CM <b>34</b> or to the same computer <b>44</b> which, itself, is attached to a CM <b>34</b>. While not shown, such additional arrangements are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The CMs <b>34</b> are connected by a coaxial cable <b>32</b> with a CMTS <b>30</b> and, specifically, to a card <b>31</b> mounted within the CMTS <b>30</b>. Each of the CMTSs of the DOC Network <b>40</b> preferably includes a plurality of cards, with each card supporting a group of CMs connected thereto in an inverted tree configuration to define a Cable Network <b>38</b>. Furthermore, each CMTS conventionally supports up to 1,500 users, although recent CMTSs have been introduced that support up to 15,000 users.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Each Cable Network <b>38</b> defines a Shared Access Carrier Network, wherein data of respective users in each are conveyed together through a shared coaxial cable. For instance, data packets (or frames) addressed to at least one of the computers <b>44</b> are transmitted by the CMTS <b>30</b> downstream over the coaxial cable <b>32</b> to all of the CMs <b>34</b> within a 6 MHz data channel. Conversely, data packets intended for delivery to the CMTS <b>30</b> and beyond are transmitted by a CM <b>34</b> upstream to the CMTS <b>30</b> over the coaxial cable <b>32</b> within a 2 MHz channel.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The Cable Network <b>38</b> shown in expanded view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a traditional all coaxial cable network. The other Cable Networks <b>38</b> collectively include both traditional all coaxial cable networks as well as HFC networks.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The CMTS <b>30</b> transmits and receives data packets between the Cable Networks <b>38</b> and an Intermediate Network <b>46</b>, which begins with a router <b>48</b> in the headend <b>36</b>, and includes switched and routed network equipment at a Regional Data Center <b>50</b> that provides connectivity to service providers <b>52</b>,<b>54</b>,<b>56</b>,<b>58</b>, either directly or through the Internet <b>60</b>. In this regard, during user communications the router <b>48</b> conveys data packets from the CMTS <b>30</b> to the Regional Data Center <b>50</b> of the DOC Network <b>40</b> and, conversely, routes data packets received from the Regional Data Center <b>50</b> to the appropriate CMTS for delivery to a particular user. Data packets that are conveyed to the Regional Data Center <b>50</b>, in turn, are directed on to an appropriate service provider <b>52</b>,<b>54</b> directly connected to the Regional Data Center <b>50</b>, or to an appropriate service provider <b>56</b>,<b>58</b> indirectly connected to the Regional Data Center <b>50</b> via the Internet <b>60</b>. Alternatively, data packets from users are conveyed to a server of an application server group <b>62</b> of the Regional Data Center <b>50</b>, which includes, for example, servers supporting Web hosting, news, chat, SMTP, POP3, Proxy, cache and content replication, and streaming media.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The Cable Networks <b>38</b> stemming from headend <b>36</b> are maintained by a Carrier which also may maintain the Regional Data Center <b>50</b> as well as serve as a service provider. Moreover, the Carrier may maintain the Cable Networks of additional headends <b>64</b>,<b>66</b>, or of only one or more of the headends <b>64</b>,<b>66</b>. In any event, the Cable Networks that are maintained by the Carrier are administered on a daily basis through an element management system (EMS) <b>68</b>. The EMS <b>68</b> comprises an operations system designed specifically to configure and manage CMTSs and associated CMs, and includes a CM database <b>70</b>. Operational tasks performed by the EMS <b>68</b> include provisioning, day-to-day administration, and testing of various components of each CMTS. The EMS <b>68</b> typically is located at a central network operations center of the Carrier, but may be collocated at the headend <b>36</b> of the Carrier as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The DOC Network <b>40</b> is managed through a control plane server group <b>72</b> typically located at the Regional Data Center <b>50</b>. The control plane server group <b>72</b> includes the usual servers necessary to run the DOC Network <b>40</b>, such as user authorization and accounting servers, log control servers (Syslog), IP address assignment and administration servers (DHCP, TFTP), domain name servers (DNS), and DOCSIS control servers.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For purposes of comparison, two dedicated connections also are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wherein a telephony modem <b>74</b> and an ISDN modem <b>76</b> are connected directly to the Intermediate Network <b>46</b> at the Regional Data Center <b>50</b>. As will be immediately apparent, data conveyed over each dedicated connection is between a single user and the Intermediate Network <b>46</b>, and is not combined with data of other users over a shared communications medium as in each Cable Network <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As is common in conventional Cable Networks <b>38</b> such as those shown in the DOC Network <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when a CM comes online the CM is assigned a configuration file which, inter alia, sets a constant limit on the bandwidth that can be utilized in the downstream direction by the CM during any particular interval of time, and sets a constant limit on the bandwidth that can be utilized in the upstream direction by the CM during any particular interval of time. The configuration file also includes other parameters, such as the IP address for the CM.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The configuration file for each CM conventionally is obtained by the CM when first brought online, or when the CM is reset. The upstream and downstream bandwidth limits are predetermined by the Carrier or other appropriate entity, the determination of which is based on the expected number of users to be serviced by the particular Cable Network <b>38</b> to which the CM belongs.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With particular regard to data transmissions in the downstream direction, when the bandwidth limit is reached in receiving data within a particular time interval, the CM transmits a signal to the router <b>48</b> to cease further data forwarding for the remainder of the time interval. Thereafter, whereas any data received by a CMTS is relayed on to the CM as the data is received, any additional data received by the router <b>48</b> during the remainder of this time interval is stored for later transmission in a buffer up to a threshold limit and, thereafter, any further data received within the time interval is dropped.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">With regard to data transmissions in the upstream direction, when the CM registers with the CMTS following receipt by the CM of its configuration file, the CM informs the CMTS of the constant bandwidth limit to be applied to upstream transmissions from the CM. Then, actual requests for bandwidth (i.e., requests for timeslots) for transmission of data in the upstream direction are submitted regularly by each CM to the CMTS. In response to the submissions, the CMTS schedules timeslots in a particular time interval to the CMs for exclusive transmission of data within each timeslot by a respective CM. However, the CMTS does not grant an amount of bandwidth (by assigning too many timeslots) to a particular CM that would exceed the constant bandwidth limit for the particular CM.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The timeslots are assigned to requesting CMs based on an established assignment policy. For example, timeslots may be assigned by the CMTS on a first-in-first-out basis, or timeslots may be assigned equally to the CMs that request bandwidth within a particular window of time. The requesting CMs also may be prioritized by the CMTS for assignment of the timeslots.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Preferred embodiments <b>78</b>,<b>80</b>,<b>82</b>,<b>84</b> of a DOC Network in accordance with the present invention are shown, respectively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, wherein each includes a “network access manager” <b>86</b> in accordance with the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the network access manager <b>86</b> is located in the headend <b>36</b> of the DOC Network <b>78</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the network access manager <b>86</b> is located at the Regional Data Center <b>50</b> of the DOC Network <b>80</b>, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref> the network access manager <b>86</b> is remotely located, but is disposed for communication with the respective DOC Network <b>82</b>,<b>84</b>, either directly as shown in the DOC Network <b>82</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, or indirectly via the Internet <b>60</b> as shown in the DOC Network <b>84</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The network access manager <b>86</b> preferably comprises a hardware component having software modules for performing methods in accordance with the present invention. For commercial purposes, especially in enhancing existing DOC Networks, preferably the network access manager <b>86</b> is self-contained and need only be connected in communication with the DOC Network to operate correctly. In a DOC Network that is being upgraded or established, preferably the software modules are distributed within the DOC Network itself and may or may not include any additional hardware components such as the network access manager <b>86</b>. For example, the software modules may be incorporated into the EMS, CMTS, and control plane server group of a DOC Network, thereby avoiding the expense of additional computer hardware components.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In order to accommodate deployment and implementation of the present invention, the software modules preferably are designed as peers within a messaging infrastructure and, in particular, within a CORBA infrastructure <b>87</b>, the system architecture of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Due to the interoperability of the peers to the CORBA infrastructure <b>87</b>, the separate modules readily call upon each other as described in detail below without regard to differences in location between the modules. Nevertheless, for ease of deployment, the network access manager <b>86</b> is best suited for deployment and implementation of the present invention in established DOC Networks, whether situated within the Intermediate Network as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, or remotely situated as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The software modules include a Data Collector <b>88</b>, a Database Manager <b>90</b>, Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b>, and GUI &amp; Report Generating Engine <b>94</b>. The Data Collector <b>88</b> and Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> each includes an external system interface layer <b>96</b>,<b>98</b>, respectively, that enables it to communicate with network equipment of a DOC Network. In the system architecture of preferred embodiments, the Data Collector <b>88</b> communicates with each CMTS and CMs of each Cable Network for which network access is managed by the network access manager <b>86</b>, and the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> communicates with the control plane server group <b>72</b> of the DOC Network as well as with the CMTS and CMs.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">If a DOC Network is DOCSIS 1.0 compliant, then each external system interface layer <b>96</b>,<b>98</b> is a DOCSIS external system interface layer. If a DOC Network uses proprietary interface specifications, then each external system interface layer <b>96</b>,<b>98</b> is designed based on the proprietary interface specifications. In either case, however, the Data Collector <b>88</b> and Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> generally need not be modified; only the external systems interface layers <b>96</b>,<b>98</b> thereof need be changed based on the particularities of the DOC Network. Each of the Data Collector <b>88</b> and Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> also includes a scheduling element <b>100</b>,<b>102</b>, respectively, that schedules the timing of actions and communications thereof with the network equipment of a DOC Network.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The GUI &amp; Report Generating Engine <b>94</b> communicates with an Administrator <b>106</b> of the network access manager <b>86</b>, preferably through a web server, whereby the Administrator <b>106</b> sets up and configures the network access manager <b>86</b> and accesses reports generated by the network access manager <b>86</b>, such as graphs of bandwidth consumption and bandwidth requested per time interval for a user. The Administrator <b>106</b> may be the Carrier, a service provider, or some other entity, such as the entity managing the Regional Data Center <b>50</b> or a third-party responsible for maintenance of the network access manager <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The Database Manager <b>90</b> stores configuration and setup information received from the GUI &amp; Report Generating Engine <b>94</b>, as well as information processed by the Data Collector <b>88</b>. The Database Manager <b>90</b> also provides information to the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> and GUI &amp; Report Generating Engine <b>94</b> as requested via the CORBA infrastructure <b>87</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Having now described in detail the structure of preferred DOC Networks <b>78</b>,<b>80</b>,<b>82</b>,<b>84</b>, preferred methods of the present invention will be described with reference thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In accordance with preferred methods of the present invention, network access usages of each user in the upstream and downstream directions are monitored through the Data Collector <b>88</b>. Specifically, the Data Collector <b>88</b> issues queries to the CMTS and CMs to which counter values of logical data units (LDUs) are returned for the users. Preferably, counter values are returned for each user for the number of bytes and the number of data packets that are transmitted in both the upstream and downstream direction, the number of bytes and the number of data packets that are dropped in both the upstream and downstream direction, the number of bytes and the number of packets that are requested to be transmitted in the upstream direction, and the time for which the counter values are returned. Accordingly, as used herein the phrase “monitoring network access usage” is intended to refer to the collection of data representative of at least one of: (i) the number of LDUs that are transmitted in a particular direction across a shared communications medium; (ii) the number of LDUs that are dropped in transmitting in a particular direction across a shared communications medium; and (iii) the number of LDUs that are requested to be transmitted in a particular direction across a shared communications medium.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In a DOCSIS compliant DOC Network, the information is collected from the CMTS and CMs of a Cable Network via the simple network management protocol (SNMP). The counter values for bytes and data packets that are transmitted and that are dropped in the upstream direction from each CM, and the number of bytes and data packets that are requested to be transmitted in the upstream direction from each CM, are recorded by the CMTS in accordance with a management information base (MIB) of a DOCSIS compliant CMTS. Likewise, the counter values for bytes and data packets that are transmitted and that are dropped in the downstream direction from the CMTS to a CM are recorded by the CM in accordance with a MIB of a DOCSIS compliant CM. Both bytes and data packets are monitored since each data packet may vary in the number of bytes it contains.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The scheduling element <b>100</b> of the Data Collector <b>88</b> initiates the data collection from each CMTS and from the CMs connected thereto, preferably at different predetermined time intervals. For example, the data collection from a CMTS preferably occurs at five minute intervals and data collection from the CMs connected thereto preferably occurs at thirty minute intervals. The data collection from the CMs preferably is less often than the data collection from the CMTS in order to minimize consumption of bandwidth across the Cable Network that otherwise would be allocated to users.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the counter values and time thereof are returned to the Data Collector <b>88</b>, the Data Collector <b>88</b> calculates the change over time for each counter value to arrive at the average rates of bytes and data packets that are successfully transmitted, the average rates of bytes and data packets that are requested to be transmitted, and the average rates of bytes and data packets that are dropped. The respective rates and time intervals for the rates (as well as the counter values and time stamp data) are then communicated to the Database Manager <b>90</b>, which stores the information in a user statistics table (“stats”) for later use by the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> and GUI &amp; Report Generating Engine <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b>, in turn, continually determines over succeeding time intervals an allowance of network access—or bandwidth in a Cable Network—that may be consumed by each user. As used herein, “network access allowance” refers to a respective maximum level of network access that may be made available to the user for utilization during a particular time interval and, accordingly, it may or may not represent the level of network access actually utilized by the user during such time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The user bandwidth allowances are determined by equating the user bandwidth allowances to user allocations of bandwidth determined by allocating to the users the bandwidth that is available during a particular time interval in accordance with a selected allocation policy. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a selected allocation policy has resulted in the allocation of bandwidth to the users of the shared communications medium <b>1850</b> for a time interval extending from t<sub>o </sub>to (t<sub>o</sub>+dt) wherein User <b>2</b> and User K each is allocated a single bandwidth unit (b/w unit <b>3</b> and b/w unit X, respectively), while User <b>1</b> and User <b>3</b> each is allocated two bandwidth units (b/w unit <b>1</b> and b/w unit <b>2</b> to User <b>1</b>, and b/w unit <b>4</b> and b/w unit <b>5</b> to User <b>3</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, in the next time interval extending from (t<sub>o</sub>+dt) to (t<sub>o</sub>+2dt), User <b>1</b>, User <b>3</b>, and User K each is allocated a single bandwidth unit (b/w unit <b>1</b>, b/w unit <b>5</b>, and b/w unit X, respectively), while User <b>2</b> is allocated three bandwidth units (b/w unit <b>2</b>, b/w unit <b>3</b>, and b/w unit <b>4</b>). The bandwidth units broadly represent network access to the communication member <b>1800</b> that is shared between the users across the shared communications medium <b>1850</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In accordance with the present invention, respective user bandwidth allowances for each time interval are equated with these user allocations, and no user receives more bandwidth in a time interval than that user's respective bandwidth allowance for that time interval. Thus, bandwidth allocations under the present invention represent limits on bandwidth that can be utilized (or consumed) by users during a time interval, and do not represent per se the amount of bandwidth that actually will be utilized or consumed during the time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In determining user bandwidth allowances in the preferred embodiments set forth herein, the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> preferably performs three routines, including: the prediction of bandwidth of each user in a predetermined future interval of time (“First Routine”); the prioritization of users for allocation of bandwidth (“Second Routine”); and the determination of a respective bandwidth allocation as each user's bandwidth allowance for the future time interval (“Third Routine”).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The First Routine preferably is performed utilizing statistical analysis of past bandwidth consumption of each user or, alternatively, past bandwidth requested for each user, and the forecasted bandwidth includes the bandwidth expected to be consumed by each user or, alternatively, the bandwidth expected to be requested by each user. Any function, method, or algorithm that generates an estimate of a future sample based on previously encountered samples may be used and many are well known in the art of statistical analysis as is evident from SPYROS MAKRIDAKIS ET AL., FORECASTING METHODS AND APPLICATIONS (3d. Ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons 1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The preferred algorithm includes the combined use of an adaptive-response-rate single exponential smoothing function (ARRSES Function) and a Holt-Winters' seasonal exponential smoothing function (HW Function). These two functions are utilized according to the forecast generation flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The input includes a list of active users and applicable time intervals for bandwidth allocation.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The First Routine <b>700</b> begins by identification (Step <b>702</b>) of the users of the Cable Network to which bandwidth is to be allocated in the Third Routine. Then, for each user, a bandwidth allowance for a succeeding time interval is predicted according to either the ARRSES Function or HW Function by first determining (Step <b>704</b>) whether the user previously has been assigned a forecast function. If not, then in Step <b>706</b> the ARRSES Function is assigned to the user and the ARRSES Function is used to generate and record the forecasted bandwidth for the succeeding time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">On the other hand, if it is determined in Step <b>704</b> that a forecast function is assigned, but it is determined in Step <b>707</b> that the forecast function is not the HW Function, then a determination is made (Step <b>708</b>) whether to check for a seasonal cycle of the user. This determination in Step <b>708</b> is made by checking the elapsed time since the last seasonal check was made, with a seasonal check being made after a predetermined period of time elapses. If the determination in Step <b>708</b> is affirmative, then a seasonal identifier algorithm is executed (Step <b>710</b>), in which an autocorrelation function and a seasonal identifier function are performed. The autocorrelation function is well known in the art of statistical analysis, and is used to identify elements in a time series which are influential on a current observation of that same series. Based on the output of the autocorrelation function, the seasonal identifier function identifies possible seasonal cycles of the time series by identifying local maxima of the results of the autocorrelation function.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Based on the results of the seasonal identifier function, a determination is made (Step <b>712</b>) whether an actual seasonal pattern exists. If a seasonal pattern is not found, or if it is not yet time to check for a seasonal cycle, then a forecast is generated and recorded (Step <b>714</b>) using the ARRSES Function. If a seasonal pattern is found, then the HW Function is assigned (Step <b>716</b>) to the user, the HW Function is initialized (Step <b>718</b>), and the first forecast is generated and recorded (Step <b>720</b>) using the HW Function.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">If it is determined in Step <b>707</b> that the current function assigned to the user already is the HW Function, then the determination is made (Step <b>722</b>) whether the last forecasted bandwidth was acceptable. This determination is made by comparing whether the forecasted bandwidth was within 10% of the actual bandwidth consumed or requested. If this determination in Step <b>722</b> is negative, then the ARRSES Function is assigned to the user and the new forecast is generated and recorded in accordance with the ARRSES Function (Step <b>706</b>). If the last forecast is determined (Step <b>722</b>) to have been acceptable, then a determination is made (Step <b>724</b>) whether the seasonal cycle has ended. If the seasonal cycle has ended, then the HW Function is reinitialized (Step <b>726</b>), and the first forecast of the next seasonal cycle is generated and recorded (Step <b>728</b>) via the HW Function. If the seasonal cycle has not expired, then the next forecast is generated and recorded (Step <b>730</b>) in accordance with the HW Function.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Following each of Step <b>706</b>, Step <b>714</b>, Step <b>728</b>, and Step <b>730</b>, the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> determines (Step <b>732</b>) whether the forecasting has been completed for all users and, if not, then repeats (Step <b>738</b>) a forecast loop for a remaining user. If it is determined in Step <b>732</b> that all users have been evaluated, then the forecasts are communicated (Step <b>736</b>) to the Database Manager <b>90</b> and the forecasting routine ends.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A forecast of bandwidth for a user in a future time interval is generated in accordance with the ARRSES Function via the following formulas:

<p id="p-0085" num="0098">The Second Routine performed by the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> comprises the prioritizing of users for resolving competition between users during the determination of bandwidth allocations in the Third Routine. Prioritization is performed in accordance with one or more of various possible prioritization policies. The prioritization policies may depend upon, for example, (i) each user's SLA, (ii) each user's forecasted bandwidth, (iii) fairness considerations, or (iv) any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0099">SLAs that at least partially affect prioritization policies include those that specify, for example: (i) a guaranteed minimum level of bandwidth; (ii) a time-of-day (TOD) minimum level of bandwidth; or (iii) a guaranteed minimum level of bandwidth up to a maximum burstable level of bandwidth with target probability.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0100">Under a SLA providing for a guaranteed minimum level of bandwidth, a user will have a guaranteed minimum level of bandwidth for use at all times. Accordingly, if the available bandwidth to such a user otherwise would fall below the minimum guaranteed level, then such a user is given priority over all other users whose guaranteed minimum levels of bandwidth (if applicable) have been satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0101">Similarly, under a SLA providing for a TOD minimum level of bandwidth, a user will have a guaranteed minimum level of bandwidth for a particular TOD. If the available bandwidth to such a user otherwise would fall below the minimum guaranteed level during the particular TOD, then such user is given priority over all other users whose guaranteed minimum levels of bandwidth (if applicable) have been satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0102">Finally, under a SLA providing for a guaranteed minimum level of bandwidth up to a maximum burstable level of bandwidth with target probability, a user will have a guaranteed minimum level of bandwidth at all times and, in addition thereto, probably will have additional bandwidth up to a maximum level at any given time in accordance with the target probability. Accordingly, if the bandwidth available to such user otherwise would fall below the minimum guaranteed level, then the user is given priority over all other users whose guaranteed minimum levels of bandwidth (if applicable) have been satisfied. The user also is given priority over such other users in allocating additional bandwidth as needed up to the maximum level in accordance with the target probability.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0103">Other SLA provisions not relating to guaranteed levels of bandwidth also may affect a prioritization policy. Thus, for example, each user's SLA may specify a fee (in dollars per unit time per unit bandwidth) that is paid by the user based upon bandwidth consumption by the user for a particular amount of time, and the fee may be different as between users or different groups of users. Under these circumstances, prioritization may be determined so as to maximize fee revenues that are paid by the users.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0104">Similarly, each user's SLA may specify a credit (in dollars per unit time per unit bandwidth) that is applied by the Carrier to the user's account based upon a bandwidth shortfall to the user for a particular amount of time when a guaranteed level of bandwidth available to the user is not met. Moreover, the credit may be different as between users or different groups of users. Under these circumstances, prioritization may be determined so as to minimize the collective credit payments that a Carrier applies to user accounts.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0105">An example of prioritization based upon the forecasted bandwidth of each user includes giving priority to a first user over all other users, each of whom have a forecasted bandwidth that is greater than that of the first user.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0106">Prioritization may also be performed based on unilateral fairness considerations, especially when user SLAs do not guarantee minimum levels of bandwidth for individual users or when users otherwise would share equally in priority. Thus, users may be prioritized based on, for example: (i) the throughput of each of the users for a given time interval, with priority going to the user with the lesser throughput; (ii) data packets dropped over a given time interval, with priority going to the user with the greater data loss; and (iii) throughput experienced during a particular time of day or day of the week, with priority going to the user with the lesser throughput for the particular time of day or day of the week.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0107">An example of fairness considerations that may be utilized in determining priority is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, wherein user throughput for a time interval is graphed against user data packets dropped in the time interval for Users A and B. A target QoS standard for minimum throughput and maximum packet loss rates are established by the Carrier, whereby in the illustrated example each user is prioritized based on the user's absolute distance from the target QoS standard. Thus, under this policy, User A experiencing higher throughput rate and a lower packet loss rate, and thus having a shorter distance from the standard, is prioritized lower than User B having a lower throughput rate and higher data loss rate.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0108">The Third Routine performed by the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> is the determination of bandwidth allocations to the users for the future time interval in accordance with one or more of various allocation policies. Examples of such allocation policies include: (i) the equal distribution of all available bandwidth to all users; (ii) the distribution of all available bandwidth to all users proportional to each user's respective forecasted bandwidth; (iii) the distribution of bandwidth to each user equal to the user's respective forecasted bandwidth, with any surplus bandwidth being distributed to the users either equally or proportionally based upon the user's respective forecasted bandwidth; and (iv) the initial distribution of bandwidth to each user based upon the minimum of the user's guaranteed bandwidth or the forecasted bandwidth and, thereafter, incremental allocations of remaining bandwidth to all of the users.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0109">Examples of alternate preferred methods of prioritizing users and allocating bandwidth by the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> will now be described, each of which utilizes one or more of the aforementioned prioritization and allocation policies. Such methods preferably are initiated pursuant to the scheduling module <b>102</b> of the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b>, which may operate independently of the scheduling module <b>100</b> of the Data Collector <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0110">Accordingly, a first method <b>1100</b> of prioritizing users and allocating bandwidth (whether upstream or downstream) by the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and begins with the retrieval (Step <b>1102</b>) of the forecasted bandwidth from the Database Manager <b>90</b> for all active users. Whether a user is active is determined by past bandwidth consumption of the user (or, alternatively, requested bandwidth for the user), as revealed by the user stats maintained by the Database Manager <b>90</b>. All users are then prioritized (Step <b>1104</b>) based on each user's forecast in increasing order, whereby users having lesser forecasted bandwidths will be prioritized over users having larger forecasted bandwidths. The “surplus” is then set (Step <b>1106</b>) to the total bandwidth available in the particular direction of communication, and the total bandwidth is then allocated (Step <b>1108</b>) to each user in an amount equaling the forecasted bandwidth subject to a respective maximum bandwidth value. Preferably the respective maximum bandwidth value is determined either in the user's SLA or by the Carrier, Administrator <b>106</b>, or other entity. Allocation of bandwidth to a user additionally is subject to the actual availability of bandwidth following previous allocations thereof to users with equal or higher priority.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0111">Following allocations to all users, any bandwidth determined (Step <b>1110</b>) to be remaining is then allocated equally (Step <b>1112</b>) to the users subject to each user's respective maximum bandwidth value. The resulting user allocations are then incorporated (Step <b>1114</b>) into the DOC Network as the user bandwidth allowances, which incorporation is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0112">The method <b>1200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is the same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, except that surplus bandwidth, if any, is allocated (Step <b>1202</b>) proportional to the forecasted bandwidths of the users, again subject to each user's respective maximum bandwidth value.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0113">The preferred method <b>1300</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> does not prioritize the users for purposes of allocation but, instead, treats all users equally. The method <b>1300</b> begins with the retrieval (Step <b>1302</b>) of the forecasted bandwidth from the Database Manager <b>90</b> for all of the users. The surplus is then set to the total bandwidth available in the particular direction of communication, and the sum of all user's forecasts is calculated (Step <b>1304</b>). The available bandwidth then is allocated (Step <b>1306</b>) to all users proportional to the user's forecasted bandwidth, again subject to each user's maximum bandwidth value. The resulting user allocations then are incorporated into the DOC Network (Step <b>1308</b>) as the user bandwidth allowances.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0114">The preferred method <b>1400</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> seeks to maximize revenues from fees (F) that are paid by users for bandwidth consumption. The method <b>1400</b> begins with the retrieval (Step <b>1402</b>) of the forecast for each user as well as a fee which each user pays for bandwidth. The users are then sorted (Step <b>1404</b>) based on user fees in decreasing order, with the user paying the most for bandwidth receiving the highest priority. Next, the surplus is set (Step <b>1406</b>) to the total bandwidth available in the particular direction of communication. Available bandwidth then is allocated (Step <b>1408</b>) to the users from highest to lowest priority in an amount equal to the user's forecasted bandwidth, subject to the respective maximum bandwidth value for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0115">Both preferred method <b>1500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b, </i>and preferred method <b>1600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>differ from the other methods <b>1100</b>,<b>1200</b>,<b>1300</b>,<b>1400</b> in that these two methods allocate bandwidth to the users in multiple allocation rounds. Method <b>1500</b> begins in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref><i>a </i>with the retrieval (Step <b>1502</b>) of the forecasted bandwidths of the users as well as a credit (C) that applies if a respective user does not receive up to a guaranteed maximum level of bandwidth. The users are then prioritized (Step <b>1504</b>) based on each user's respective credit in decreasing order, with those users having higher credits being given priority over users with lesser credits. Next, the surplus is set (Step <b>1506</b>) to the total bandwidth available in the particular direction of communication. Available bandwidth then is allocated (Step <b>1508</b>) as available in a first round to the users from highest to lowest priority. The allocation in the first round is equal to the minimum of the forecasted bandwidth or the maximum bandwidth that is guaranteed, subject to the respective maximum bandwidth value for each user.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0116">If any additional bandwidth is determined (Step <b>1510</b>) to remain after the first allocation round, then the surplus is set to the additional bandwidth (Step <b>1514</b>). Bandwidth then is allocated (Step <b>1516</b>) as available to each user in the same user order. Assuming sufficient bandwidth remains available, the allocation in the second round brings the user's allocation up to the user's forecasted bandwidth subject to the user's respective maximum bandwidth value. Following the second allocation round, a determination is made (Step <b>1518</b>) whether any remaining bandwidth exists and, if so, then the remaining bandwidth is allocated (Step <b>1522</b>) equally to the users, subject to each user's respective maximum bandwidth value. The resulting user allocations are then incorporated (Step <b>1524</b>) into the DOC Network as the user bandwidth allowances. If it is determined that no bandwidth remains available in either of Step <b>1510</b> or Step <b>1518</b>, then the user allocations are completed and are incorporated into DOC Network as the user bandwidth allowances in Steps <b>1512</b>,<b>1524</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0117">Method <b>1600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>differs from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>only in that the sum of the forecasted bandwidths for all users is calculated (Step <b>1602</b>) and a determination is made (Step <b>1604</b>) whether the sum exceeds the total bandwidth available to the users. If the sum exceeds the total bandwidth that is available to the users, then the bandwidth is allocated (Step <b>1606</b>) to each user in an amount equal to the forecasted bandwidth, subject to the user's maximum guaranteed bandwidth, and less an amount thereof proportional to the total bandwidth shortfall. Thus, for example, if the sum of all forecasted bandwidths exceeds the total available bandwidth in an amount equal to 20% of the sum of all forecasted bandwidths, then each user is allocated bandwidth in an amount equal to the user's forecasted bandwidth (subject to the user's maximum guaranteed bandwidth), then less 20% thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0118">The information including fees, credits, guaranteed bandwidths, and respective maximum bandwidth values in the aforementioned preferred methods, is obtained from each user's SLA and/or is predetermined by the Administrator <b>106</b>, Carrier, or other entity. Moreover, this information is retrieved by the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> from the Database Manager <b>90</b>, which includes and maintains a user SLA table as well as a user billing table, as updated from time-to-time by the Administrator <b>106</b>. Specifically, the information is configured and maintained through GUIs provided as part of the GUI &amp; Report Generating Engine <b>94</b>, and is preferably accessed by the Administrator <b>106</b> either directly or indirectly through the Internet <b>60</b>. Alternatively, information is retrieved by the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> from an external database maintained by the Administrator, Carrier, or other entity through an application program interface (API) incorporated into the external system interface layer <b>98</b> of the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b>. The use of an external database is preferred for the SLA and user billing tables, as it eliminates any duplicative maintenance of information otherwise maintained by the Database Manager <b>90</b> which must be synchronized with the external database, including periodic updating of user records in a timely fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0119">Regardless of the particular method or policies utilized by the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b>, once user allocations have been determined, the respective DOC Network is updated with the user allocations as user bandwidth allowances for a particular time interval. Each user then utilizes bandwidth during the particular time interval in an amount that is less than, or equal to, that user's bandwidth allowance. Preferably, the DOC Network is updated at periodic intervals of between one to fifteen minutes and, preferably every five minutes. Furthermore, the periodic interval preferably corresponds to the scheduling of the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> with regard to upstream transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0120">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a preferred method <b>1700</b> of updating a DOC Network for a DOCSIS 1.0 compliant Cable Network is illustrated. The DOC Network is updated by incorporating (Step <b>1702</b>) the user allocations as bandwidth allowances (i.e., bandwidth limits) into CM configuration files (MD-5 files) for the CMs of the respective users. As set forth above, each CM configuration file contains instructions for a respective CM that limits the actual bandwidth consumed by the CM in the upstream direction and in the downstream direction. The CM configuration files are then sent (Step <b>1704</b>) by the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> to a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) Server of the DOC Network, which maintains CM configuration files for the CMs of the Cable Network. A command is also sent (Step <b>1706</b>) to either of the CMs or the CMTS of the respective Cable Network causing the CMs to acquire and implement the CM configuration files maintained on the TFTP Server.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0121">In addition to maintaining information regarding SLAs and user billing data in the Database Manager <b>90</b>, the GUI &amp; Report Generating Engine <b>94</b> further enables the Administrator <b>106</b> to analyze the user stats updated by the Data Collector <b>88</b>, including the generation of reports and graphs regarding, for example, network access usage of the users over time as well as user throughput rates vs. data loss rates similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0122">As now will readily be seen, the preferred methods and networks of the present invention described in detail above enable a Carrier to accommodate differing demands for instantaneous throughput by users competing for access across a shared communications medium. Indeed, Carriers now are able to continuously vary bandwidth consumption limits for each user between time intervals, either in accordance with fairness considerations, forecasted network access usage of the users, or under provisions governing network access agreed upon between users and the Carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0123">Additionally, it will now be evident that the present invention gives rise to new business models that may be implemented by Carriers for providing network access to users and, in particular, to new ways of constructing SLAs, which is also considered part of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0124">For example, Carriers now can offer a guaranteed minimum level of network access to a user that is constant throughout the day or week, or a guaranteed minimum level of network access that varies depending upon considerations such as the time of day or the day of week. Carriers also now can offer a guaranteed minimum level of network access with a guaranteed maximum level of network access provided as needed in accordance with a target probability. Furthermore, not only do these customizable SLAs provide users with greater options for improving performance levels of applications and services that utilize the Shared Access Carrier Networks, but they further enable Carriers to differentiate between users in charging for network access, thereby allowing Carriers to differentiate revenue streams for maximization of revenues.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0125">The present invention also enables Carriers to offer “dynamic SLAs” to users. The term “dynamic SLA” refers to a SLA that can be modified by a user as the user's demand for network access significantly changes, whether such modification is permanent or temporary. In this regard, and in accordance with a preferred method <b>2000</b> of the present invention as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a Carrier monitors (Step <b>2002</b>) network access usage by users of a Shared Access Carrier Network and determines (Step <b>2004</b>), for each user based on network access usage, whether a SLA provision other than those found in the user's current SLA would better meet the user's needs. This determination is made by comparing the user's throughput, bandwidth consumption, and/or bandwidth requested for a predetermined period of time against a set of threshold values, including any guaranteed level of network access provided for in the user's SLA as well as any minimum QoS standard that are deemed necessary for user satisfaction by the Administrator <b>106</b>, Carrier, or other entity. Thus, if the user's level of throughput, bandwidth consumption, and/or bandwidth requested for the predetermined time interval differs by a predetermined tolerance from a respective minimum threshold value, then the user is identified (Step <b>2006</b>) as a “candidate” for modifying the SLA. A similar process alternatively is used, wherein the user's forecasted bandwidth is compared to the threshold values and, if the difference exceeds a predetermined tolerance, then the user is deemed a candidate for modifying the user's SLA.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0126">Once users have been identified as candidates, the candidates are filtered by screening (Step <b>2008</b>) the candidates against a list of users for which solicitations are not to be made. Those candidates passing the screening are then invited (Step <b>2010</b>) to modify their respective SLAs. The solicitation of the user preferably is performed via email, instant messaging, redirection of the user's web browser to a solicitation web page, generation and mailing of solicitation literature via U.S. mail, telemarketing, or other means of communication. The solicitation includes an invitation for the user to modify the user's SLA by increasing for a fee the minimum level of network access guaranteed to the user. The solicitation preferably also includes an invitation to make the modification permanent, or to make the modification only temporary and for a specific period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0127">Thus, for example, if a user is identified as having a high usage pattern at recurrent periods of time (such as every Saturday night when a particular webcast is viewed, or when an Internet game is played), then the user automatically is solicited with an invitation via instant messaging on the following Saturday night to increase the user's guaranteed network access for that night, for a predetermined number of following Saturday nights, and/or for every Saturday night.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0128">Acceptance of the invitation by each user results in the modification (Step <b>2012</b>) of the user's SLA for the appropriate period of time by increasing the level of network access the user is guaranteed (and/or the user's respective maximum bandwidth value, depending upon the policies used). The solicited modification to the user's SLA is updated in the SLA database, which is then used during user prioritization and allocation of bandwidth by the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b>. The resulting higher bandwidth allowance should enhance the user's experience and overall satisfaction with the Carrier Network. In particular, the higher bandwidth (greater network access) should enhance the viewing of the webcast or the playing of the Internet game.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0129">On the other hand, SLAs for which users decline solicitations are not modified. Furthermore, if deemed appropriate, users declining a solicitation are recorded in the list against which candidates are screened.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0130">Preferably, the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> analyzes the user stats maintained by the Database Manager <b>90</b>, identifies those users that are candidates for SLA modification, and initiates the solicitation of such candidates. Information for each user's SLA for comparison with the user's stats automatically is obtained either from the Database Manager <b>90</b>, or from an external database maintained by the Administrator <b>106</b>, Carrier, or other entity. Furthermore, the Bandwidth Allocator <b>92</b> preferably performs this analysis for solicitation on a regularly scheduled basis.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0131">In addition to such solicitations, a user of course may request a change in the level of network access guaranteed without having to first receive a solicitation. Furthermore, the user may request that the change be for a temporary period of time such that, for example, the change is reversed after only a few hours, which would cover a viewing of a particular webcast or the playing of a particular Internet game beginning at the time of the request.</p>
