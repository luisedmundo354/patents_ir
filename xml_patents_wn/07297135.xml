<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A fluid filled cartridge having a fixed needle and a piston assembly for expression of its contents is mounted inside an applicator. In order to extend the needle from the body prior to cartridge contents expression and without premature leakage of fluid therefrom, an actuator is mounted in the body to drive the cartridge forwards. This is accomplished by co-operating driving and driven parts of the actuator and the cartridge (or any carrier it may have) which are decoupled by release formations in the applicator body after the cartridge has been moved sufficiently to extend the needle. The applicator also includes provision for automatic needle retraction after cartridge contents expression. A separate inventive feature is the deformability of the piston so that force transmission to the trigger means to initiate needle retraction only occurs upon full content expression when the piston has “bottomed out” within the cartridge.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a 371 of PCT/GB2003/005424 filed on Dec. 12, 2003.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to hollow needle applicators suitable for administering cartridged drugs etc, particularly but not exclusively in a manner assuring retraction of the needle after use.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In using the term “drugs etc” herein, there is no intention to limit application of this invention to drugs or medicaments as such. This invention is generally applicable to any usefully injectable substance and to injecting any appropriate receiver, whether or not that is tissue of a human or animal subject.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Suitability for use in administering drugs does, however, bring in certain constraining desiderata. One is for exceptional reliability as to accuracy of the administered quantity of drug precisely as and where intended. Another is for minimising costs of applicators as essentially one-use throw-away items. Other than springs, component parts need to be individually suited to high-speed plastics injection moulding, and collectively suited to high-speed automated assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND TO INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Prior proposals for such applicators include providing for needle extension as a first stage in their use, i.e. having an as-supplied state with the needle retracted. Cartridges supplied pre-filled with a measured drug dose typically have fixed needles, in which case such first stage involves movement of the cartridge internally of the applicator. It is known for such movement to be by the same drive force as serves to discharge the cartridge contents through the needle by continuation of such force application through and after cartridge movement for needle extension. It is further known, in relation to typical cartridges having a piston for expression of contents, for drive force application to rely on force transmission through incompressible liquid contents of the cartridge to achieve the first needle extension stage of movement of the cartridge. Examples include EP0516473, which clearly accepts drug weepage through its needle during extension as an inevitability, and also our own earlier WO93/23098 and WO95/35126.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of this invention is to provide an applicator which does not rely entirely on transmission through cartridge contents for initial needle extending cartridge movement so as to obviate premature contents expression on the way to the needle reaching desired tissue penetration.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of this invention is to minimize, indeed virtually eliminate, ullage requirement. The term ullage is used to refer to the amount by which the cartridge has previously had to be overfilled in order to deliver the predetermined dose because it has not hitherto been possible to deliver the entire contents of a cartridge. There has always been at least a small amount remaining in the cartridge and needle after the piston has been displaced to its full extent, and after the needle has automatically retracted in applicators which have such provision.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of this invention there is provided a hollow needle applicator for administering a fluid from a cartridge which has a fixed needle comprising an applicator body in which the cartridge, including its needle, is mounted, a force applying actuator mounted in the body for movement therein to drive the cartridge or a carrier for the cartridge forwards to extend the needle from the applicator body, in which respect the actuator and the cartridge, or its carrier, have co-operating driving and driven parts, and release formation means provided in or on the body to release the said co-operating parts after predetermined movement of the cartridge to extend the needle from the applicator.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In preferred embodiments of the invention the release formation means are arranged to deflect the co-operating driving part of the actuator outwardly of the co-operating driven part of the cartridge or its carrier. This is because preferred practical embodiments of applicator all include means for retraction of the needle after use. This means that an inner region of the applicator body must be kept clear to provide for reception, upon retraction, of piston means and the cartridge body, to which the needle is attached. In embodiments which might be envisaged where some form of needle protection is employed in place of automatic retraction after use, the drive part of the actuator could be deflected inwardly as it is decoupled from the co-operating driven part of the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The movement of the cartridge to extend the needle from the applicator may be predetermined, or may be additionally limited, in any one or more of three ways, namely, by full compression of a spring which will act in subsequent needle retraction and is located in a forward end of the applicator body, by abutment of a shoulder on the cartridge with a ledge inside the applicator body, or by abutment of a shoulder on the cartridge, e.g. where a needle holder overlies the main cartridge body, with a needle guide at the forward end of the applicator body.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In preferred embodiments, the same drive force as achieves said predetermined movement can thereafter continue to act in discharging the contents of the cartridge, but does not so act relative to cartridge contents during said predetermined movement. In other words, said drive force advantageously has no action on and applies no force to in-cartridge means (typically of piston type) for discharge pressuring of cartridge contents until positive releasing of the co-operating driving and driven parts of the actuator and cartridge, respectively, takes place.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Suitable driving and driven parts can be provided by extensions from the actuator and from the cartridge beyond its occupation by its contents (or from any carrier for such cartridge), respectively. Typically such extensions will be oppositely directed and will co-operate by direct engagement prior to positive disengagement by the release formation means. However, it would be possible to have indirect engagement between these parts by way of some intermediate part(s), such as a rotatable, apertured drive coupling ring, which is/are movable by the release formation(s).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Suitable release formation means comprises at least one deflector element projecting internally of the applicator body at a position axially along the applicator body that the cartridge or its carrier reaches in said predetermined movement for needle extension.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Disengagement of the driving and driven parts can, in some embodiments, be by movement of an intermediate part, for example by part rotation of an apertured member, such as the aforementioned drive ring or a slotted disc, the slots of which are then brought into registration with the driving and/or driven parts.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferred actuators have additional force-transmitting part(s) which are ineffective until the mechanical coupling for needle extension is released, and which become effective to pressurise cartridge contents only after such release. Thus, preferred drive actuators, have two force-applying parts for different purposes, one for needle-extension movement of the cartridge and the other for discharging the contents of the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Suitable force-applying parts can be in the form of different extensions of or from the actuator, for example of axial-parallel nature relative to the actuator and the applicator main body part accommodating the actuator, and one being radially inside the other.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Provision for discharging cartridge contents is preferably in conjunction with provision of means for achieving automatic needle retraction after such discharge. This further means advantageously also includes releasable mechanical coupling between the other force-applying part(s) of the actuator and a piston of the cartridge. Moreover, it can be particularly advantageous for the related actuator extension as driving part and the piston rod as driven part to be relatively entrant each other at coupling release.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Positive release of this coupling is advantageously triggered by deformation of the cartridge piston when it reaches the end of the cartridge at the end of intended contents discharge. This necessitates the cartridge piston being formed of suitable deformable material. Also, at the end of contents discharge there must still be substantial force available from the actuator drive spring, for example up to 50% or more compression remaining, preferably about 60%. This can assure that substantially all of the cartridge contents is discharged through the needle, so that virtually no more than needle content is undischarged. This is important for highly expensive drugs as an ullage requirement has hitherto been the norm, i.e. the cartridge having over-fill by as much as 5%-10% compared with actual desired dose as delivered, which may need to be very accurate indeed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The aforesaid feature, whereby needle retraction is triggered only upon deformation of the piston as it “bottoms out” within the cartridge, thereby assuring virtually entire cartridge contents discharge, is a separate aspect of the invention. It may be employed in other embodiments quite independently of any needle extension provision, whether by drive transmission to the cartridge (or a carrier for same) or via pressure on liquid contents of the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus, according to a second aspect of this invention there is provided a hollow needle applicator for administering a fluid from a cartridge which has a fixed needle comprising an applicator body in which the cartridge is mounted, a piston assembly located within the cartridge and slidable therein to discharge the fluid contents of the cartridge via the needle, a force applying actuator mounted into the body and having at least one force transmitting part which provides a coupling with the piston assembly effective to displace the piston assembly within the cartridge to discharge contents of the cartridge, provision for automatic needle retraction after cartridge contents discharge comprising spring means arranged within a forward portion of the applicator body to act between the applicator and the cartridge to which the needle is fixed, and means for release of the coupling between the force transmitting part or parts of the actuator and the piston assembly, characterised in that the piston assembly comprises a deformable piston, a piston rod which transmits force to the piston from the actuator and triggering means which is movable by the piston, when deformed into the end of the cartridge, to release the coupling between the force transmitting part of parts of the actuator from the piston assembly and bring about needle retraction.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Release of the aforesaid force-transmitting relation between the second actuator extension and the cartridge piston rod may be by deflection for directly engaging parts or by movement of an intermediate member from drive-transmitting blockage to unblocking of at least some of the driving/driven parts concerned, again as exemplified by use of an apertured drive ring or slotted disc.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">One suitable length-shortening provision comprises a piston rod with driven coupling extension parts designed to be deflected away from each other or outwardly for coupling release and a triggering rod slidable in bore through the piston rod to spread those parts when the piston is deformed at reaching the end of the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Another suitable length-shortening provision comprises a piston rod with driven coupling extension parts to be deflected towards each other or inwardly for coupling release and a triggering collar slidable about the piston rod to clench those parts when the piston is deformed at reaching the end of the cartridge.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the drawings, referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2A</figref> to D, an applicator <b>100</b> is shown as having a hollow generally cylindrical body comprising a main portion <b>101</b>A and a relatively short forward portion <b>101</b>B of reduced section, the whole body <b>101</b>A, B being designed for being moulded in one piece. The applicator body may have a cross-sectional shape other than circular. For example, oval or polygonal or irregular shapes are equally feasible.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The main body portion <b>101</b>A terminates in an open end <b>102</b> which is shown with a slight flare beyond an internal peripheral groove <b>103</b> and with an external thickening grip formation <b>104</b> below an end bead <b>105</b>. The reduced section forward portion <b>101</b>B terminates in a returned end face <b>106</b> which is shown centrally apertured at <b>106</b>A for passage of a hollow needle <b>107</b> through an inwardly flared re-entrant portion <b>108</b>. The latter retains a needle shield <b>109</b> that in use is typically made of non-curing elastomeric material and pierced by extension of the needle <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The needle <b>107</b> and the shield <b>109</b> are shown fitted to a reduced end <b>110</b>B of a hollow generally cylindrical cartridge which has a main portion <b>110</b>A slidable in the applicator body <b>101</b> including its forward portion <b>101</b>B. The reduced cartridge portion <b>110</b>B is shown as having a slightly enlarged end to aid retention of the needle shield <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The main cartridge portion <b>110</b>A has pre-loaded contents <b>112</b> and a piston <b>111</b> therein and it extends (<b>110</b>E) beyond the full contents-accommodating position of the piston <b>111</b>. An alternative to the cartridge being so extended (<b>110</b>E) would be for such extension to be of a carrier or holder for a standard cartridge. The piston <b>111</b> is of deformable material as will be described in relation to maximising expression of cartridge contents <b>112</b>. An exterior shoulder <b>110</b>S between the main and reduced portions <b>110</b>A, B of the cartridge is acted upon by a compression spring <b>113</b> which is seated at <b>114</b> about the re-entrant portion <b>108</b> of the forward body portion <b>101</b>B. This compression spring <b>113</b> can further compress to allow cartridge movement up to abutment of the cartridge shoulder <b>110</b>S (or part of a cartridge carrier/holder) against an internal ledge <b>101</b>L of the applicator body portion <b>101</b>B as will be described for needle extension.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The internal groove <b>103</b> around the other end <b>102</b> of the main body portion <b>101</b>A aids secure location by external ribbing <b>115</b>R of a plug <b>115</b> which incorporates a releasable capture provision <b>118</b> for an actuator <b>120</b>. The illustrated capture provision <b>118</b> is operative relative to a neck reduction groove <b>121</b>G in an end extension <b>121</b> of the actuator <b>120</b>, conveniently by way of a slider part <b>119</b> with a key-hole aperture <b>119</b>K that holds or releases the actuator extension <b>121</b> according to slider position controlled by a knob or button <b>119</b>S. However, a slider operating knob or button as illustrated at <b>119</b>S is neither essential nor particularly preferred for operation of an applicator in accordance with the invention. An arrangement for push-operation from a side of the body part <b>101</b>A short of its end may well be preferred for at least some practical implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The capture provision <b>118</b> shown includes a plug having an inward extension <b>118</b>E. This provides recessed seating <b>122</b>S for a head part <b>122</b> of the actuator <b>120</b> below the neck-grooved part <b>121</b> and also outer seating <b>125</b>S for an actuator drive spring <b>125</b> which acts on outward flanging <b>124</b>F of a main actuator part <b>124</b> extending from the head part <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It will be appreciated that the drive spring <b>125</b> cannot move the actuator <b>120</b> until the extension part <b>121</b> is released from the capture provision <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The objectives of such released movement of the actuator <b>120</b> includes first to move the cartridge (<b>110</b>A, B) for needle extension without reliance on application of force to the cartridge piston <b>111</b> thus not on force transmission through the cartridge contents <b>112</b>, i.e. without involving either static friction of the piston or hydraulic lock, and secondly, only after such needle extension, to apply force to the cartridge piston <b>111</b> in pressuring the cartridge contents <b>112</b> for discharge through the needle <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For achieving the first objective, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a releasable mechanical coupling between a driving part in the form of extensions <b>126</b> from the flanging <b>124</b>F of the main actuator part <b>124</b> and a driven part in the form of the extension <b>110</b>E of the cartridge (<b>110</b>A, B) beyond the full pre-load position of the cartridge piston <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The illustrated releasable coupling mechanism involves the ends <b>126</b>E of the actuator coupling extensions <b>126</b>, which are, as shown, inclined radially inwardly for force-transmitting engagement with the registering cartridge extensions <b>110</b>E, being releasable from such drive force transmitting engagement by radially outward deflection. This releasing deflection involves positive deflecting action by release formations in the form of deflector elements (also termed triggering extensions) <b>128</b> which project internally of the main body part (<b>101</b>A, B) of the applicator. Specifically, these triggering extensions <b>128</b> are axially parallel projections from the reduced section of the forward body portion <b>101</b>B into the main body portion <b>101</b>A immediately around the main cartridge part <b>110</b>A, thus also having advantageous sliding and locating relation therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Feasible variations on this releasable coupling (<b>126</b>E/<b>110</b>E) include the cartridge (<b>110</b>A, B) being provided in a carrier which has the coupling extensions. Additionally or alternatively the radially relatively inward and outward relationship between the coupling extensions <b>126</b>E and <b>110</b>E could be reversed, i.e. the cartridge or carrier coupling extensions <b>110</b>E could be outward of the actuator coupling extensions <b>126</b>, <b>126</b>E and the triggering extensions <b>128</b> could be radially located to suit. Additionally or alternatively the release deflection could be of the ends of the cartridge or carrier coupling extensions <b>110</b>E, either alone or conjointly with some end deflection of the actuator coupling extensions <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows the deflectable ends <b>126</b>E of the actuator coupling extensions <b>126</b> as having a hinge notch <b>126</b>N shown open in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> but closed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and part-bifurcation slotting <b>126</b>S and tapering <b>126</b>T to aid co-operation with end tapering <b>128</b>T of the triggering extension(s) <b>128</b>. The slotting <b>126</b>S will accommodate the triggering extensions <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As should be apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but see also FIGS. <b>3</b>A/B, the needle, extending movement of the cartridge <b>110</b>A, B is accompanied by compression of the retraction spring <b>113</b>, and is by an amount pre-set to achieve abutment of the cartridge shoulder <b>110</b>S and the internal ledging <b>101</b>L of the forward body portion <b>101</b>B. Strict coincidence between achieving this abutment and completing positive release action of the triggering extensions <b>128</b> is desirable but is not essential.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">One way to assure mechanical coupling right up to cartridge-arresting abutment is to use a two-stage releasable mechanical coupling, having a first stage along the lines described above but with another drive coupling element that is not so positively disengaged but will disengage automatically when the cartridge is finally arrested by abutment. Such other coupling element will have a load-bearing requirement less than that of the positively disengaged elements as the drive spring will be extended near to its maximum for needle extension.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B and 2C</figref> in its various components shows a two-stage releasable mechanical coupling with an additional independently deflectable extension leaf <b>126</b>A between those <b>126</b>E positively deflected by spaced parallel triggering extensions <b>128</b>A, B and with its end shaped for less purchase on co-operating coupling extension <b>110</b>E so as to deflect for decoupling simply by reaction to arrest of the cartridge <b>110</b>. For illustrative purposes only, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B</figref> and C show undeflected coupling engagements to the left and deflected dis-engagements to the right.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The second actuator objective, namely operation of the cartridge piston <b>111</b> to discharge the cartridge contents <b>112</b> through the needle <b>107</b>, also involves a releasable force-transmitting coupling, this time associated with a cartridge piston rod <b>131</b>. Specifically, the engaged force-transmitting state of this coupling <b>130</b> is between deflectable coupling extensions <b>131</b>E of the cartridge piston rod <b>131</b> and coupling extensions <b>132</b>E of a centrally extending actuator part <b>132</b>. The piston rod <b>131</b> is hollow about a trigger rod <b>133</b>, which goes to a point at its rear end. This trigger rod <b>133</b> can slide axially in the hollow piston rod <b>131</b> to deflect the coupling extensions <b>131</b>E of the piston rod <b>131</b> in release of the mechanical coupling <b>131</b>E/<b>132</b>E. This release action is dependant on the cartridge piston <b>111</b> reaching the end of the internal contents-accommodating space of the cartridge (<b>110</b>A, B) and being deformed there to move the trigger rod <b>133</b> as well as assure maximal discharge of the contents <b>112</b> of the cartridge <b>110</b>A, B.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The coupling extensions <b>131</b>E can be inverted forms of what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref> including bifurcation if the trigger rod <b>133</b> is longitudinally ribbed, ridged or splined, i.e. with any such ribbing, ridging or splining accommodated in such bifurcations.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">What is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is well suited to embodiments with three or four angularly spaced sets of inter-acting coupling extensions for each releasable mechanical coupling, typically equi-spaced about the applicator axis. However, two each is practical, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref> to D to be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Sequential operation of the applicator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref> to D. In the as supplied state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> the actuator <b>120</b> is held by the capture/release provision <b>118</b>, the actuator drive spring <b>125</b> fully compressed, the mechanical coupling <b>126</b>E/<b>110</b>E engaged and the releasable mechanical coupling <b>131</b>E/<b>132</b>E also engaged. In the released state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> the actuator <b>120</b> has been moved by the drive spring <b>125</b> to complete needle extending cartridge movement at abutment of the cartridge shoulder <b>110</b>S with the body ledging <b>101</b>L, and release of the actuator/cartridge drive coupling <b>126</b>E/<b>110</b>E by the triggering extensions <b>128</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> discharge of the cartridge contents <b>112</b> has taken place with the mechanical coupling <b>131</b>E/<b>132</b>E still engaged up to deformation of the piston <b>111</b> and release of the coupling <b>131</b>E/<b>132</b>E by the trigger rod <b>133</b> deflecting the piston extensions <b>131</b>E. Finally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> retraction of the discharged cartridge <b>110</b>A, B and its needle <b>107</b> fully into the body part <b>101</b>A, B has taken place. The coupling extensions <b>132</b>E of the actuator <b>120</b> have accordingly entered the cartridge piston space <b>131</b>S about the trigger rod <b>133</b>, and the cartridge or carrier coupling extensions <b>110</b>E as well as the trigger extensions <b>128</b> have passing through an actuator flange <b>124</b>F and into an actuator slot <b>124</b>Y (started at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> stage).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The cross-sections of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref> to D show two-element releasable mechanical couplings <b>126</b>E/<b>110</b>E and <b>131</b>E/<b>132</b>E, the elements being in diametric relation and with main body guidance by way of ribs and grooves <b>101</b>G/<b>126</b>R. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> shows the coupling extensions <b>126</b>E deflected into release compared with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> shows the actuator part <b>132</b> entrant the cartridge or carrier extension <b>110</b>E compared with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Turning to the second embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, its differences compared with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> lie in the structure for realising the second actuator objective, namely the releasable mechanical coupling involved in cartridge discharge. The actuator <b>500</b> is therefore the same as the actuator <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> except for its cartridge discharge piston rod <b>531</b> being located within a bottom-flanged or inverted top-hat section triggering collar <b>533</b>. This collar has an axial through-bore <b>533</b>B and there is a space <b>533</b>S outside its reduced section upstand <b>533</b>U for accommodating a tubular extension <b>532</b>E of the actuator <b>532</b> after release of the mechanical coupling which has brought about cartridge contents discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The releasable mechanical coupling shown involves co-operation between a free end rim <b>532</b>R of the tubular actuator extension <b>532</b>E and splayed coupling extensions <b>531</b>E from the inner end of the piston rod <b>531</b>. The piston rod <b>531</b> is able to slide in relation to the collar <b>533</b>, in its bore <b>533</b>B, during deformation of the piston <b>511</b> when it reaches the end of the cartridge <b>510</b>. This relative sliding (<b>531</b>/<b>533</b>) results in the collar upstand <b>533</b>U acting as a trigger ring to bring about release of the coupling <b>531</b>E/<b>532</b>E, specifically by radially inward deflection of the extensions <b>531</b>E of the piston rod <b>531</b>, as is apparent in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The coupling extensions <b>531</b>E of the piston rod <b>531</b> are partially split to present longer radially inward extensions <b>531</b>F for guidance of the end of the actuator tubular extension <b>532</b>. An alternative would be for the ends of each of the coupling extensions <b>531</b>E to be stepped.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The releasable coupling <b>531</b>E/<b>532</b>E is of an essentially similar nature to that already disclosed in our above mentioned PCT applications. Sequential automatic operation of the applicator <b>500</b> is believed to be apparent from the stages shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref> to D, in which reference numerals for corresponding parts have been advanced by <b>400</b> compared with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> other than the specific differences noted above for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated for the applicator embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7</figref>, it is feasible and advantageous for the radially offset drive coupling extensions <b>126</b>, <b>526</b> with deflectable ends and their co-operating deflector elements <b>128</b> which bring about release after needle extension to be accommodated compactly after such release within consecutive radial spaces inside the coupling extensions <b>126</b>/<b>526</b>E and the outside triggering extensions <b>128</b>. Likewise the elements <b>131</b>/<b>132</b>E (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>) released at cartridge discharge and the elements <b>532</b>E/<b>533</b>U of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are accommodated in consecutive radial spaces.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Such radial or transverse compactness can be enhanced to the extent of effectively “losing” one of those thicknesses if the co-operating elements are out of angular registration and their decoupling relies on rotation of an apertured interposed ring, as shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</figref>, B.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, a drive coupling ring <b>850</b> has outer angularly spaced apertures <b>851</b> and <b>852</b> and inner angularly spaced apertures <b>853</b>. The apertures <b>851</b> have side tapers <b>851</b>T which in use co-operate with side tapering <b>828</b>T of triggering extensions <b>828</b> to rotate the ring <b>850</b> to a position where the apertures <b>851</b> afford full clearance to the triggering extensions <b>828</b>. The apertures <b>852</b> lie next to drive engagement positions <b>854</b> for mechanical coupling extensions <b>826</b> from a spring-driven drive actuator (not shown). This drive engagement will prevail until rotation of the ring <b>850</b> by the triggering extensions <b>828</b> brings the apertures <b>852</b> into clearance registration with the drive coupling extensions <b>826</b>. The inner apertures <b>853</b> are next to engagement positions <b>855</b> for driven mechanical coupling extensions <b>810</b>E from a cartridge or carrier therefore (not shown). These apertures will afford full clearance for the driven coupling extensions after rotation of the ring <b>850</b> by the triggering extensions <b>828</b>, to allow a retracted state equivalent to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, i.e. overlapping the length of the drive spring engaged part of the actuator <b>120</b> without re-compression of the actuator drive spring <b>125</b>. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the drive spring <b>125</b> could engage the ring <b>850</b> at the outer apertured part of its width.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Rotational drive coupling and release is equally feasible for the second mechanical coupling operative for retraction of the discharged cartridge and its needle. Equivalents to outer aperturing <b>851</b>/<b>852</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> would suffice where the actuator drive coupling extensions and release triggering extensions concerned are angularly spaced at the same radial positions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> shows a drive coupling ring <b>860</b> where the triggering extensions <b>831</b> are radially inside the actuator drive coupling extension <b>832</b>E, and outer and inner apertures <b>862</b>, <b>861</b> correspond thereto, respectively. The extensions <b>831</b> can be upstands from a collar <b>831</b>C. As already described for the outer apertures of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, rotation of the ring <b>860</b> is by mutual engagement of tapers <b>831</b>T/<b>861</b>T and results in full clearances <b>831</b>/<b>861</b> and <b>832</b>E/<b>862</b>.</p>
