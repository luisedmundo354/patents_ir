<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a technique of laying out electronic components, and more particularly, to a method for improving efficiency in laying out electronic components which facilitates a user to select a desired electronic component number, so as to improve speed of laying out an electronic circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">With a booming development of electrical technology, electronic products, such as mobile phone, digital camera, computers, and MP3 player have become popular in every family. However, a fabrication of printed circuit boards (PCBs) for the electronic products, which fabrication involves designing, circuit drafting, mechanical drafting, component placement, and drafting of a layout diagram for the printed circuit board, before fabrication of electronic products, is time-consuming. Accordingly, manufacturers continue to propose new techniques in hope of simplify the process of researching for the electronic products.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, the printed circuit board is accomplished with a co-operation of an electronic engineer, a mechanical engineer, and a layout engineer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart showing the design process for a printed circuit board as practiced in the prior-art. Firstly, in Step <b>101</b>, a circuit diagram for an electronic product is designed by the electronic engineer and converted to an initial layout diagram. Secondly, in Step <b>103</b>, a mechanical diagram for the electronic product is designed and drafted by the mechanical engineer. Thirdly, in Step <b>105</b>, component placement is performed by the electronic engineer and the layout engineer, such that the electronic components are placed on the circuit board. Last, in Step <b>107</b>, the electronic components placed on the circuit board are interconnected by a routing method so as to complete the design of the layout diagram. Finally, in Step <b>109</b>, the printed circuit board is fabricated by a manufacturer according to the layout diagram of the circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For the foregoing Steps <b>101</b> through <b>107</b>, the designers design the printed circuit board for an electronic product by using drafting software installed in a computer. When the drafting software is employed to design the circuit diagram of an electronic product by an electronic engineer, a circuit diagram file is firstly converted to a layout diagram file and the placement of the electronic components is performed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart showing the placement procedure for electronic components of a prior-art printed circuit board design technique.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in Step <b>201</b>, the circuit diagram for an electronic product is designed by an engineer using the drafting software, and the circuit diagram file for the product being drafted is subsequently converted to the layout diagram file. In Step <b>203</b>, rules for printed circuit board layout, to be stored in the layout diagram file, are set up by an engineer using the drafting software. Such rules would constrain the printed circuit board layout in certain ways based on certain design requirements. Then, in Step <b>205</b>, electronic components and relevant connection circuitry contained in the drafted circuit diagram are added into the layout diagram file for the printed circuit board. In Step <b>207</b>, important components determined in the mechanical diagram are initially placed on the circuit board. Finally, in Step <b>209</b>, other electronic components which belong to the same page or area of the circuit diagram are located one by one in a manual manner and added to the layout plan for the printed circuit board. Afterwards, determination is made as to whether the external connection locations are congruent with the heights and positions of openings shown in the mechanical diagram in a one-by-one fashion until all of the electronic components have been placed onto the circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">During the placement procedure for the electronic components, however, engineers often need to search through the electronic components which belong to the same page of the circuit diagram, sometimes containing thousands of electronic components, to locate the circuit at hand. Such searching, in order to place the electronic components one-by-one into the printed circuit board layout, can be very time-consuming and placement errors can occur. Moreover, as the variety of electronic components has gradually increased and components have become extremely similar, if the designer decides to modify or replace an electronic component of the original circuit diagram, it is hard to immediately locate the electronic component from numerous pages of the circuit diagram, so as to slow down the design process.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, prior-art layout methods for electronic component layout are not optimized, particularly for electronic products with a short design cycle. The problem to be solved here, therefore, is to provide a method for improving layout efficiency for electronic components in the overall design process, so as to decrease both initial design and subsequent modification time required for electronic component placement. In the latter case, the goal would be to allow the electronic engineer to immediately search and locate electronic components to be modified or replaced, so as to accelerate the design process.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In light of the above prior-art drawbacks, an objective of the present invention is to provide a method for improving efficiency in laying out electronic components, whereby the electronic components contained in a circuit diagram can be rapidly and precisely placed in a printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method for improving efficiency in laying out electronic components, so that subsequent placement of the electronic components in a printed circuit board no longer requires modifications to electronic circuits, so as to effectively shorten the research time.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with the above and other objectives, the present invention proposes a method for improving efficiency in laying out electronic components, applicable to the layout operation for the electronic components of a printed circuit board. Initially, a first two-dimensional planar view containing the various electronic components numbers therein is preset using a drafting software platform. Subsequently, the two-dimensional planar view is converted into a text file and all the data contained in the two-dimensional planar view are recorded in the text file. Then, all of the electronic component numbers contained in the first two-dimensional planar view are displayed in a second two-dimensional planar view, and a function selection menu is generated by an arithmetic process, such that a user can select electronic component numbers contained in the text file to perform placement of the electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Using the method proposed in the present invention, the placement of the electronic components can be rapidly and precisely performed by an electronic engineer and a layout engineer so as to increase layout speed for electronic components and accelerate the design process. Furthermore, when the electronic engineer decides to modify the circuit or replace an electronic component, according to the method proposed in the present invention, the desired electronic component to be modified or replaced can be immediately located, so as to simplify the procedure required for changing electronic component layout.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention is described in the following with specific embodiments, so that one skilled in the pertinent art can easily understand other advantages and effects of the present invention from the disclosure of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart showing a method for improving efficiency in laying out electronic components according to the present invention. In the present embodiment, the method proposed in the present invention is applied to the layout operation for electronic components via a Mentor drafting software platform (hereinafter known as the drafting software platform) included in an information processing system. Thus, when designing an electronic product, a circuit designer is able to successfully design and layout a printed circuit board for the electronic product using the method disclosed in the present invention. As shown in the diagram, in Step <b>301</b>, a two-dimensional circuit diagram plan for the electronic product is designed by an electronic engineer using the drafting software platform, and the circuit diagram has a plurality of electronic component members. Subsequently, Step <b>302</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In Step <b>302</b>, the circuit diagram file is converted into a text file. The text file is encoded with the various electronic component numbers contained in the circuit diagram shown in Step <b>301</b>. The data is stored in a text format, such that a user is able to acquire the data of the circuit diagram being previously drafted via the text file. Next, Step <b>303</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In Step <b>303</b>, the electronic components and relevant layout circuitry comprised in the two-dimensional circuit diagram plan designed in Step <b>301</b> are displayed in a layout diagram for the printed circuit board prior to performance of Step <b>304</b>, such that placement of the electronic components can be performed by a layout engineer.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In Step <b>304</b>, a function selection menu is generated via an arithmetic process, so that the electronic engineer is able to select the electronic component numbers contained in the text file using the function selection menu and perform placement of the electronic components prior to performing Step <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In Step <b>305</b>, the electronic components are placed in the printed circuit board by selecting options shown in the function selection menu by the electronic engineer prior to performance of routing by the layout engineer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart showing the conversion of a circuit diagram file into a text file. Electronic component names and lists comprised in the circuit diagram are converted and stored in a text format. As shown in the diagram, in Step <b>401</b>, a file name for the text file, such as pcb-ba-ref, is established prior to performance of Step <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In Step <b>403</b>, the drafted two-dimensional circuit diagram plan is opened. Also, the total page numbers for the circuit diagram is calculated and a corresponding page number sheet is generated prior to performance of Step <b>405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In Step <b>405</b>, electronic component members contained in the current page being processed for the circuit diagram are stored in the corresponding sheet prior to performance of Step <b>407</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In Step <b>407</b>, it is determined as whether the page is the final page. If the result is affirmative, the process ends, whereas if the result is negative, Step <b>405</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart showing the detailed process for Step <b>304</b> to illustrate placement of all electronic components in each list. The step comprises the following sub-steps:</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">First of all, in Step <b>501</b>, a text file is initially opened and a function selection menu is displayed, such that a user is able to select a list for performing placement, prior to performing Step <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In Step <b>502</b>, electronic component numbers recorded in the text file are extracted, prior to performing Step <b>503</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In Step <b>503</b>, an electronic component number in the list is selected by the user and highlighted, prior to performing Step <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In Step <b>504</b>, it is determined whether the selected electronic component number is to be placed in the printed circuit board selected by the user. If so, Step <b>505</b> is performed, otherwise, Step <b>506</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In Step <b>505</b>, the electronic component selected by the user is placed in a predetermined location on the printed circuit board, prior to performing Step <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In Step <b>506</b>, it is determined as whether the circuit diagram for the electronic component in the sheet selected by the user is opened. If it is opened, Step <b>507</b> is performed to display all components and relevant circuits contained in the selected sheet, and then the process terminates, otherwise, the process terminates immediately.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an operating interface <b>6</b> for drafting software that employs the method according to the present invention.
