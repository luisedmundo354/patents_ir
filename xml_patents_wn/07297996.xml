<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application is based upon and claims the benefits of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-285061, filed on Sep. 30, 2002, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates to a semiconductor memory device and, more particularly, to a twin-cell type semiconductor memory device for storing data in a pair of memory cells as complementary information.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">(2) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the improvement of the performance of electronic devices, such as portable devices, highly reliable memories in which low power consumption, large capacity, and a high integration level can be realized have been needed in recent years.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A memory cell in semiconductor memory devices of a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) type has a simple structure. That is to say, it includes one cell transistor and one capacitor. Therefore, with semiconductor memory devices of a DRAM type a high integration level and large capacity can be realized easily. As a result, it is hoped that semiconductor memory devices of a DRAM type will be applied more widely and that their performance will be improved further.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, twin-cell type DRAMs in which data is stored in a pair of memory cells as complementary information corresponding to the high level (H level) and the low level (L level) have been suggested to, for example, reduce power consumed in DRAMs (refer to, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-143463 (the paragraph numbers [0026]-[0032] and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>)).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(A) and 8(B)</figref> are simplified views showing the arrangement of memory cells in a conventional semiconductor memory device of a DRAM type. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(A)</figref> is a simplified view showing the arrangement of memory cells in a single-cell semiconductor memory device of a DRAM type. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(B)</figref> is a simplified view showing the arrangement of memory cells in a twin-cell semiconductor memory device of a DRAM type.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Both in a single-cell type semiconductor memory device <b>100</b> and in a twin-cell type semiconductor memory device <b>101</b>, memory cells MC each including one cell transistor and one cell capacitor (1T/1C structure) are located at positions where bit lines BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, and /BL<b>2</b> and a word line WL intersect alternately. The same cell array is used in the semiconductor memory devices <b>100</b> and <b>101</b>, so cells are arranged in the same way. The semiconductor memory devices <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> differ in how to connect the bit lines BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, and /BL<b>2</b> and sense amplifiers <b>110</b> and <b>111</b>. In the single-cell type semiconductor memory device <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(A)</figref>, the bit lines BL<b>1</b> and /BL<b>1</b> pair and are connected to the sense amplifier <b>111</b>. Similarly, the bit lines BL<b>2</b> and /BL<b>2</b> pair and are connected to the sense amplifier <b>110</b>. On the other hand, in the twin-cell type semiconductor memory device <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(B)</figref>, the bit lines BL<b>2</b>, BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>2</b>, and /BL<b>1</b> are located in that order from the top. The bit lines BL<b>1</b> and /BL<b>1</b> pair and are connected to the sense amplifier <b>110</b>. The bit lines BL<b>2</b> and /BL<b>2</b> pair and are connected to the sense amplifier <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Information held in each of areas E<b>20</b>, E<b>21</b>, E<b>22</b>, and E<b>23</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(A) and 8(B)</figref> will be treated as a piece of data when one word line WL is driven. That is to say, in the area E<b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(A)</figref>, the potential of the bit line BL<b>1</b> to which a memory cell MC is connected and the potential of the bit line /BL<b>1</b> (which holds reference potential) to which a memory cell MC is not connected are compared by the sense amplifier <b>111</b> and 1-bit data is read. Similarly, in the area E<b>21</b>, the potential of the bit lines BL<b>2</b> and /BL<b>2</b> are compared by the sense amplifier <b>110</b> and 1-bit data is read. In the area E<b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(B)</figref>, the potential of the complementary bit lines BL<b>2</b> and /BL<b>2</b> connected to the gates of a pair of memory cells MC where complementary information has been stored are compared by the sense amplifier <b>110</b> and 1-bit data is read. Similarly, in the area E<b>23</b>, the potential of the complementary bit lines BL<b>1</b> and /BL<b>1</b> are compared by the sense amplifier <b>111</b> and 1-bit data is read.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the twin-cell type semiconductor memory device <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(B)</figref>, only the sense amplifier <b>110</b> is activated to read data from the area E<b>22</b>. In this case, there is no need to activate the sense amplifier <b>111</b>. On the other hand, only the sense amplifier <b>111</b> is activated to read data from the area E<b>23</b>. There is no need to activate the sense amplifier <b>110</b>. Moreover, in the case of reading, complementary information stored in a pair of memory cells MC and corresponding to the H and L levels is read by the complementary bit lines BL<b>1</b> and /BL<b>1</b> or the complementary bit lines BL<b>2</b> and /BL<b>2</b>. This will give a large margin for holding data, compared with the single-cell type semiconductor memory device <b>100</b> in which a comparison is made between the potential of a bit line and reference potential. As a result, a refresh cycle can be lengthened and power consumption can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">There are two kinds of layouts of a cell array in the semiconductor memory devices <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>: capacitor under bitline (CUB) structure in which cell capacitors are formed under bit lines and capacitor over bitline (COB) structure in which cell capacitors are formed over bit lines.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">With the CUB structure, the process for forming cell capacitors comes before the process for forming bit lines. On the other hand, with the COB structure, the process for forming bit lines comes before the process for forming cell capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9(A) and 9(B)</figref> are a view showing a pattern of the layout of a cell array in a conventional semiconductor memory device having the CUB structure and a schematic sectional view of the semiconductor memory device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(A)</figref> is a view showing a pattern of the layout of a cell array in a semiconductor memory device having the CUB structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(B)</figref> is a fragmentary cross sectional view taken along the line C-C′ of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(A)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The layout pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(A)</figref> can be applied both to the single-cell type semiconductor memory device <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(A)</figref> and to the twin-cell type semiconductor memory device <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(B)</figref>, but descriptions of a twin-cell type semiconductor memory device will now be given.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">On a layout pattern for a semiconductor memory device <b>101</b><i>a </i>having the CUB structure, bit line patterns BLp<b>1</b>, /BLp<b>1</b>, BLp<b>2</b>, and /BLp<b>2</b> indicated by dotted lines and a plurality of word line patterns WLp are located like a grid and substrate diffusion layer patterns <b>150</b><i>p </i>located in the same direction as the bit line patterns BLp<b>1</b>, /BLp<b>1</b>, BLp<b>2</b>, and /BLp<b>2</b>, capacitor patterns <b>151</b><i>p</i>, and contact plug patterns <b>152</b><i>p </i>and <b>153</b><i>p </i>are arranged as areas corresponding to memory cells MC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(B)</figref>, the semiconductor memory device <b>101</b><i>a </i>fabricated by the use of this layout pattern includes diffusion layers <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>formed in a substrate <b>154</b>, capacitors <b>151</b> formed under bit lines BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, and /BL<b>2</b>, contact plugs <b>152</b> for connecting a diffusion layer <b>150</b><i>b </i>and a capacitor <b>151</b>, and contact plugs <b>153</b> for connecting a diffusion layer <b>150</b><i>a </i>and the bit line BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, or /BL<b>2</b>. Because of restrictions regarding fabrication, each capacitor <b>151</b> will be formed at a certain distance (corresponding to the width of one word line, in this example) from a contact plug <b>153</b> for connecting a diffusion layer <b>150</b><i>a </i>and from the next capacitor <b>151</b>. Each of areas E<b>25</b><i>a</i>, E<b>25</b><i>b</i>, E<b>26</b><i>a</i>, and E<b>26</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(A)</figref> enclosed with a dashed line corresponds to one memory cell MC having the 1T/1C structure. The areas E<b>25</b><i>a </i>and E<b>25</b><i>b </i>pair and form a twin cell. Similarly, the areas E<b>26</b><i>a</i>, and E<b>26</b><i>b </i>pair and form a twin cell.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is assumed that the substrate <b>154</b> is a p-type one and that the diffusion layers <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>which will function as a drain or a source are n-type ones. Then, for example, an oxide film (not shown) will be formed beneath word lines WL with these word lines WL as gate electrodes. As a result, n-channel metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) will be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the above example, stack capacitors have been used to form CUB structure. However, trench capacitors may be used instead. Descriptions of a case where trench capacitors are used will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10(A) and 10(B)</figref> are a view showing a pattern of the layout of a cell array in a conventional semiconductor memory device having the COB structure and a schematic sectional view of the semiconductor memory device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(A)</figref> is a view showing a pattern of the layout of a cell array in a semiconductor memory device having the COB structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(B)</figref> is a fragmentary cross sectional view taken along the line D-D′ of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(A)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Now, descriptions of a twin-cell type semiconductor memory device having the COB structure will be given. This is the same with the semiconductor memory device <b>101</b><i>a </i>having the CUB structure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">On a layout pattern for a semiconductor memory device <b>101</b><i>b </i>having the COB structure, bit line patterns BLp<b>1</b>, /BLp<b>1</b>, BLp<b>2</b>, and /BLp<b>2</b> indicated by dotted lines and a plurality of word line patterns WLp are located like a grid and substrate diffusion layer patterns <b>160</b><i>p </i>located obliquely to the bit line patterns BLp<b>1</b>, /BLp<b>1</b>, BLp<b>2</b>, and /BLp<b>2</b>, capacitor patterns <b>161</b><i>p</i>, and contact plug patterns <b>162</b><i>p </i>and <b>163</b><i>p </i>are arranged as areas corresponding to memory cells MC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(B)</figref>, the semiconductor memory device <b>101</b><i>b </i>fabricated by the use of this layout pattern includes diffusion layers <b>160</b><i>a </i>and <b>160</b><i>b </i>formed in a substrate <b>164</b>, capacitors <b>161</b> formed over bit lines BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, and /BL<b>2</b>, contact plugs <b>162</b> for connecting a diffusion layer <b>160</b><i>b </i>and a capacitor <b>161</b>, and contact plugs <b>163</b> for connecting a diffusion layer <b>160</b><i>a </i>and the bit line BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, or /BL<b>2</b>. Because of structural restrictions, each capacitor <b>161</b> will be formed at a certain distance (corresponding to the width of one word line, in this example) from the next capacitor <b>161</b>. Areas E<b>27</b><i>a </i>and E<b>27</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(A)</figref> enclosed with a dashed line pair and form a twin cell. Similarly, areas E<b>28</b><i>a </i>and E<b>28</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(A)</figref> enclosed with a dashed line pair and form a twin cell.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is assumed that the substrate <b>164</b> is a p-type one and that the diffusion layers <b>160</b><i>a </i>and <b>160</b><i>b </i>which will function as a drain or a source are n-type ones. This is the same with the semiconductor memory device <b>101</b><i>a </i>having the CUB structure. Then, for example, an oxide film (not shown) will be formed beneath word lines WL with these word lines WL as gate electrodes. As a result, n-channel MOSFETs will be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Moreover, it is assumed that the minimum fabrication dimension in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> is F (corresponding to the width of a word line WL and a space between adjacent word lines). Then 1T/1C requires an area of 8F<sup>2 </sup>both in the CUB structure and in the COB structure.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11(A) and 11(B)</figref> are circuit diagrams of conventional semiconductor memory devices. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(A)</figref> is a circuit diagram of a conventional semiconductor memory device having the CUB structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(B)</figref> is a circuit diagram of a conventional semiconductor memory device having the COB structure.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With semiconductor memory devices <b>101</b><i>a </i>and <b>101</b><i>b</i>, each of memory cells MC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> includes a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) FET (cell transistor) Tr and a cell capacitor C. One input-output terminal (drain or source) of the cell transistor Tr is connected to one of bit lines BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, and /BL<b>2</b>, the other input-output terminal of the cell transistor Tr is connected to one terminal of the cell capacitor C, and the gate of the cell transistor Tr is connected to a word line WL. The potential of the other terminal of the cell capacitor C is equal to cell plate potential (for example, potential between the L and H levels of power supply potential). Each of areas E<b>29</b>, E<b>30</b>, E<b>31</b>, and E<b>32</b> enclosed with a dashed line is a twin cell made up of a pair of memory cells MC each having the 1T/1C structure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When a word line WL is selected and driven, cell transistors Tr the gates of which are connected to the word line WL turn on and the bit line BL<b>1</b> and /BL<b>1</b> or the bit lines BL<b>2</b> and /BL<b>2</b> and cell capacitors C are electrically connected. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the bit lines BL<b>1</b> and /BL<b>1</b> are connected to the sense amplifier <b>111</b> and the bit lines BL<b>2</b> and /BL<b>2</b> are connected to the sense amplifier <b>110</b>. As a result, complementary information is read.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As described above, however, the same cell array that is used in a single-cell type semiconductor memory device is adopted in the conventional twin-cell type semiconductor memory device <b>101</b>. Therefore, typical cells in single-cell type semiconductor memory devices are 8F<sup>2 </sup>in area, while typical cells in conventional twin-cell type semiconductor memory devices are 16F<sup>2 </sup>in area. That is to say, the area of cell arrays in conventional twin-cell type semiconductor memory devices is substantially twice that of cell arrays in single-cell type semiconductor memory devices. This leads to an increase in the total area of chips in semiconductor memory devices.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, if a layout like the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is adopted and the word line WL adjacent to the diffusion layer <b>160</b><i>b </i>is driven, then electric charges in the capacitor <b>161</b> will leak out through the diffusion layer <b>160</b><i>b</i>. This is a problem specific to volatile memories, such as DRAMs. Data may be destroyed, especially if a memory cell MC which includes the capacitor <b>161</b> is in a standby state and the above word line WL for the next memory cell MC is activated frequently.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified view showing the arrangement of cells in a semiconductor memory device according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a semiconductor memory device <b>1</b>, memory cells MC are arranged at each of word lines WLa and WLb at intervals at which bit lines BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, and /BL<b>2</b> are located. The bit lines BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, and /BL<b>2</b> are wired by a folded bit line method and are connected to a sense amplifier <b>10</b> or <b>11</b>. Because of restrictions regarding fabrication, one word line (dummy word line) WLd not driven is located for every two word lines WLa and WLb. Descriptions will be given especially with a case where DRAM cells including one transistor and one capacitor, that is to say, having 1T/1C structure are used as memory cells MC as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The semiconductor memory device <b>1</b> is a twin-cell type one. Each of areas E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b> corresponds to stored 1-bit complementary information. To read complementary information stored in the area E<b>1</b>, voltage is applied to the word line WLa, a change in the potential of the bit lines BL<b>1</b> and /BL<b>1</b> connected to a memory cell MC where complementary data at the H or L level has been written is detected by the sense amplifier <b>10</b>, and the data is read. To read complementary information stored in the area E<b>2</b>, a change in the potential of the bit lines BL<b>2</b> and /BL<b>2</b> connected to a memory cell MC where complementary data has been written is detected by the sense amplifier <b>11</b> and the data is read. Accordingly, as shown by an arrow on the right-hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, two pieces of data can be stored by two pairs of bit lines in the direction of a word line. As shown by an arrow in the center of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, eight pieces of data therefore can be stored in the shown domain by four word lines in the two pairs of bit lines area (two pairs of word lines WLa and WLb) and two dummy word lines WLd, that is to say, by six word lines.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Fixed potential is applied to a dummy word line WLd. This fixed potential preferably is word line reset potential (potential not higher than 0 V) for resetting a word line or any internal power supply potential (power supply potential or potential for raising the potential of a word line).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Now, the layout of a cell array in the semiconductor memory device <b>1</b> will be described. There are two kinds of layouts of a cell array: CUB structure in which cell capacitors are formed under bit lines and COB structure in which cell capacitors are formed over bit lines. Both layouts will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B)</figref> are a view showing a pattern of the layout of a semiconductor memory device suitable for the CUB structure and a schematic sectional view of the semiconductor memory device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref> is a view showing a pattern of the layout of a semiconductor memory device having the CUB structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref> is a fragmentary cross sectional view taken along the line A-A′ of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">On a layout pattern for a semiconductor memory device <b>1</b><i>a </i>having the CUB structure, bit line patterns BLp<b>1</b>, /BLp<b>1</b>, BLp<b>2</b>, and /BLp<b>2</b> indicated by dotted lines and word line patterns WLap and WLbp and a dummy word line pattern WLdp are located like a grid and substrate diffusion layer patterns <b>50</b><i>p </i>located in the same direction as the bit line patterns BLp<b>1</b>, /BLp<b>1</b>, BLp<b>2</b>, and /BLp<b>2</b>, capacitor patterns <b>51</b><i>p</i>, and contact plug patterns <b>52</b><i>p </i>and <b>53</b><i>p </i>are arranged as areas corresponding to memory cells MC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(B)</figref>, the semiconductor memory device <b>1</b><i>a </i>fabricated by the use of this layout pattern includes diffusion layers <b>50</b><i>a </i>and <b>50</b><i>b </i>formed in a substrate <b>54</b>, capacitors <b>51</b> formed under bit lines BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, and /BL<b>2</b>, contact plugs <b>52</b> for connecting a diffusion layer <b>50</b><i>b </i>and a cell capacitor <b>51</b>, and contact plugs <b>53</b> for connecting a diffusion layer <b>50</b><i>a </i>and the bit line BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, or /BL<b>2</b>. Because of restrictions regarding fabrication, each cell capacitor <b>51</b> will be formed at a certain distance (corresponding to the width of one word line, in this example) from a contact plug <b>53</b> for connecting a diffusion layer <b>50</b><i>a </i>and from the next cell capacitor <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Each of areas E<b>5</b> and E<b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref> enclosed with a dashed line is a twin cell, which includes two memory cells MC and which stores complementary information at the H or L level. In this case, the areas E<b>5</b> and E<b>6</b> correspond to, for example, the areas E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b>, respectively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The substrate <b>54</b> is a p-type one and the diffusion layers <b>50</b><i>a </i>and <b>50</b><i>b </i>which will function as a drain or a source are n-type ones.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">At least one pair of bit lines BL<b>1</b> and /BL<b>1</b> or BL<b>2</b> and /BL<b>2</b> connected by the folded bit line method described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are formed in the same wiring layer.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the above example, stack capacitors have been used as cell capacitors C to form CUB structure. However, trench capacitors may be used instead.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(A) and 3(B)</figref> are a view showing a pattern of the layout of a semiconductor memory device suitable for the COB structure and a schematic sectional view of the semiconductor memory device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref> is a view showing a pattern of the layout of a semiconductor memory device having the COB structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref> is a fragmentary cross sectional view taken along the line B-B′ of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">On a layout pattern for a semiconductor memory device <b>1</b><i>b </i>having the COB structure, bit line patterns BLp<b>1</b>, /BLp<b>1</b>, BLp<b>2</b>, and /BLp<b>2</b> indicated by dotted lines and word line patterns WLap and WLbp and a dummy word line pattern WLdp are located like a grid and substrate diffusion layer patterns <b>60</b><i>p </i>located obliquely to the bit line patterns BLp<b>1</b>, /BLp<b>1</b>, BLp<b>2</b>, and /BLp<b>2</b>, capacitor patterns <b>61</b><i>p</i>, and contact plug patterns <b>62</b><i>p </i>and <b>63</b><i>p </i>are arranged as areas corresponding to memory cells MC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>, the semiconductor memory device <b>1</b><i>b </i>fabricated by the use of this layout pattern includes diffusion layers <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>formed in a substrate <b>64</b>, cell capacitors <b>61</b> formed over bit lines BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, and /BL<b>2</b>, contact plugs <b>62</b> for connecting a diffusion layer <b>60</b><i>b </i>and a cell capacitor <b>61</b>, and contact plugs <b>63</b> for connecting a diffusion layer <b>60</b><i>a </i>and the bit line BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, or /BL<b>2</b>.

Each of areas E<b>7</b> and E<b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref> enclosed with a dashed line includes two combinations of 1T and 1C and forms a twin cell. In this case, the areas E<b>7</b> and E<b>8</b> correspond to, for example, the areas E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b>, respectively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref> shows how the diffusion layers <b>60</b><i>a </i>and <b>60</b><i>b </i>which will function as a drain or a source are formed in the substrate <b>64</b>. This is the same with the semiconductor memory device <b>1</b><i>a </i>having the CUB structure. As a result, an n-channel MOSFET, for example, will be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B)</figref>, with the CUB structure the layout in which the contact plugs <b>53</b> for connecting a diffusion layer <b>50</b><i>a </i>and the bit line BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, or /BL<b>2</b> and the cell capacitors <b>51</b> are arranged at intervals at which the bit lines BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, and /BL<b>2</b> are located is adopted. Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(A) and 3(B)</figref>, with the COB structure the layout in which the contact plugs <b>63</b> for connecting a diffusion layer <b>60</b><i>a </i>and the bit line BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, or /BL<b>2</b> and the cell capacitors <b>61</b> are arranged at intervals at which the bit lines BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, and /BL<b>2</b> are located is adopted. As a result, the twin-cell type semiconductor memory device <b>1</b>, which was described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and in which memory cells MC are arranged at intervals at which the bit lines are located, can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Both with the CUB structure and with the COB structure, however, the area of opening portions in a memory may shrink. Therefore, an aspect ratio may be changed to obtain a desired capacitance value or circuit technologies or the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a circuit diagram of the semiconductor memory device according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">This circuit diagram applies both to the CUB structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B)</figref> and to the COB structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(A) and 3(B)</figref>. In the semiconductor memory device <b>1</b>, the memory cell MC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a cell transistor Tr and a cell capacitor C. One input-output terminal (drain or source) of the cell transistor Tr is connected to one of the bit lines BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, and /BL<b>2</b>, the other input-output terminal of the cell transistor Tr is connected to one terminal of the cell capacitor C, and the gate of the cell transistor Tr is connected to the word line WLa or WLb. The potential of the other terminal of the cell capacitor C is equal to cell plate potential (for example, potential between the L and H levels of power supply potential). The cell transistor Tr is not connected to the dummy word line WLd. Each of areas E<b>9</b> and E<b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> enclosed with a dashed line includes two memory cells MC (each memory cell MC includes 1T/1C). That is to say, each of the areas E<b>9</b> and E<b>10</b> forms a twin cell. The areas E<b>9</b> and E<b>10</b> correspond to, for example, the areas E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b>, respectively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the word line WLa is selected and driven, cell transistors Tr the gates of which are connected to the word line WLa turn on and the bit lines BL<b>1</b>, /BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b>, and /BL<b>2</b> and cell capacitors C are electrically connected. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the bit lines BL<b>1</b> and /BL<b>1</b> are connected to the same sense amplifier <b>10</b> and the bit lines BL<b>2</b> and /BL<b>2</b> are connected to the same sense amplifier <b>11</b>. As a result, the sense amplifier <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> read complementary information.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Conventionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(B)</figref>, eight word lines WL have been needed to hold eight pieces of data with two pairs of bit lines. With the semiconductor memory device <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention, however, eight pieces of data can be held by two word lines WLa, two word lines WLb, and two word lines WLd, that is to say, by six word lines in total. In other words, the area of a chip in the direction of bit lines can be reduced by a quarter compared with the conventional twin-cell type semiconductor memory device <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">By fixing a dummy word line WLd at word line reset potential or any internal power supply potential, coupling noise between word lines, leakage from a field-effect transistor, etc. can be restrained. In addition, by doing so, capacitance between a word line WLd and a substrate can be used for stabilizing power supply, resulting in noise restraint.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, assuming that the number of pairs of bit lines used is the same, the number of pieces of data which can be accessed by driving one word line in the semiconductor memory device <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will double compared with the conventional semiconductor memory device <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. This means that the number of pieces of data which can be accessed by driving a word line with the same length as a word line in the conventional semiconductor memory device <b>101</b> has will double. In other words, the length of a word line to be driven for accessing a certain number of pieces of data will be halved compared with the conventional semiconductor memory device <b>101</b>. Therefore, in case of a hierarchical word line scheme, the number of subword decoders (not shown) can be halved. This reduces the total area of a chip.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, by locating one dummy word line WLd for every two word lines WLa and WLb, metal wirings for shunting WLa and WLb can be formed at an interval one and a half times the interval between word lines WLa and WLb.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(A) and 5(B)</figref> are views for describing the shunting of word lines. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(A)</figref> is a view showing a layout pattern on which metal wirings for shunting word lines in a semiconductor memory device having the CUB structure are located. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(B)</figref> is a view showing a layout pattern on which metal wirings for shunting word lines in a semiconductor memory device having the COB structure are located.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(A)</figref>, metal wiring patterns <b>70</b><i>p </i>and <b>71</b><i>p </i>for lining a word line are located above word line patterns WLap and WLbp which connect with cell transistors Tr on the layout pattern for the semiconductor memory device <b>1</b><i>a </i>according to the first embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(A)</figref>. Similarly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(B)</figref>, metal wiring patterns <b>70</b><i>p </i>and <b>71</b><i>p </i>for shunting word lines are located above word line patterns WLap and WLbp which connect with cell transistors Tr on the layout pattern for the semiconductor memory device <b>1</b><i>b </i>according to the first embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">An interval between the word line patterns WLp for the conventional semiconductor memory device <b>101</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(B)</figref> or the conventional semiconductor memory device <b>101</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(B)</figref> is too narrow. Moreover, it is difficult to process a metal material. Therefore, it is difficult to line a word line with a metal wiring formed by the metal wiring pattern <b>70</b><i>p </i>or <b>71</b><i>p</i>. With the semiconductor memory device <b>1</b><i>a </i>or <b>1</b><i>b </i>according to the first embodiment of the present invention, however, there is one dummy word line pattern WLdp for every two word line patterns WLap and WLbp, so an average line and space between word line patterns is wider than conventional ones. As a result, the metal wiring patterns <b>70</b><i>p </i>and <b>71</b><i>p </i>should be formed at an interval one and a half times of the interval between the word line patterns WLap and WLbp. This enables the shunting of a word line by a metal wiring. As a result, there is no need to adopt a hierarchical word lines scheme as means for reducing resistance of word lines and the area of a chip will be reduced.</p>
