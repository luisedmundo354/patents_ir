<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on and incorporates herein by reference Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-227360 filed on Aug. 5, 2002.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a device, method, and program for design-aiding of a casting product.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">JP-A-2001-287023 discloses a solidification analyzing method as a design-aiding method for a cast metal product with a compute. This method includes several steps as follows, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. At Step Z<b>1</b>, after an analyzed target is divided into a plurality of cells, a solidifying process of a molted metal in each cell is computed by solving an equation of heat conduction with a calculus of finite differences. At Step Z<b>2</b>, a solidifying time is recorded. At Step Z<b>3</b>, disruption of not solidifying portion and its solidifying process are analyzed during the course of solidifying. At Step Z<b>4</b>, a volume of generated shrinkage porosity (SP) is computed. At Step Z<b>5</b>, a list of shrinkage cavities is formed with including positions and volumes of all the shrinkage cavities. At Step Z<b>6</b>, all the shrinkage cavities in the list are three-dimensionally shown in a display.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above design-aiding method thus mainly analyzes the positions and the volumes of the generated shrinkage cavities during the course of the solidifying. Although the analyzed shrinkage cavities are three-dimensionally shown in the display, it does not lead to determining whether required strength or durability is obtained. This is an obstacle for designers of casting metal products to use the design-aiding method in actual designing.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to provide a device, method, and program for design-aiding of a casting product enabling easily determining influence of shrinkage cavities on solid state properties of the casting product.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve the above object, a design-aiding device is provided with the following. Solidification process is analyzed based on temperature change of a melted material of the casting product in elapse of time in a three-dimensional model that corresponds to the casting product and is formed of a plurality of cells. Shrinkage porosity occurrence rates of the cells in the three-dimensional model are computed from a result of analyzing. The shrinkage porosity occurrence rates of the cells are stratified and converted to specific gravity values. A region including cells is designated for being evaluated. A shrinkage porosity occurrence rate of the region is quantified, by computing a volume with respect to each of the specific gravity values of the corresponding cells, multiplying the computed volume by each of the specific gravity values to obtain a product, and then summing up all the products corresponding to all the specific gravity values of the corresponding cells included in the region. This structure enables a designer to easily grasp influence of the shrinkage porosity on solid state properties of the product and to determine whether the casting product should be redesigned. This results in remarkably shortening a production preparation period for designing or redesigning a mold, and enhancing quality of the casting product.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A design-aiding device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as a first embodiment of the present invention is constructed by storing an after-described design-aiding program in a memory of a personal computer and the like. The design-aiding device computes specific gravity (SG) values based on occurrence rates of shrinkage cavities in the respective regions of a designed die-casting metal product.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An input unit <b>1</b> such as a keyboard or a mouse inputs shape data (three-dimensional solid model) of a designed casting product, a melted metal, casting condition, or the like. Furthermore, it sets the number of strata of an occurrence rate of shrinkage porosity, and designates a region of the casting product, the region whose specific gravity is to be computed. The input unit <b>1</b> can read the three-dimensional solid model that is formed by a computer-aided design.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A heat-transfer solidifying analyzing unit <b>2</b> divides the three-dimensional solid model into a plurality of cells that are tetrahedral. It furthermore analyzes heat-transfer solidifying of the melted metal in elapse of time to thereby compute a temperature gradient (G) [° C./mm] and cooling rate (R) [° C./sec] of the melted metal in the respective cells.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A shrinkage porosity (SP) computing unit <b>3</b> computes a shrinkage porosity occurrence rate of each cell as a value of G/√{square root over (R)} that is a shrinkage porosity predictive equation. The shrinkage porosity predictive equation can be G/t (t: solidifying time of melted metal), G×t<sup>2/3</sup>/V (V: solidifying speed) or the like, instead of G/√{square root over (R)}. Furthermore, the shrinkage porosity occurrence rate can be a result from directly computing occurrence of the shrinkage porosity with simulation considering flow or pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A database unit <b>4</b> stores specific-gravity-converted (SG-converted) values with respect to the number of strata of occurrence rates of the shrinkage porosity and to a kind of melted metal used in casting. Here, the SG-converted value corresponds to the value of G/√{square root over (R)}. Namely, the value of G/√{square root over (R)} is converted to the SG-converted value that is treated as a specific value.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A specific gravity (SG) converting unit <b>5</b> retrieves, from the database unit <b>4</b>, an SG-converted value based on the value of G/√{square root over (R)}, the number of strata of occurrence rates of the shrinkage porosity, and the kind of melted metal used in casting, to assign the SG-converted value to the respective cells.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A specific gravity (SG) computing unit <b>6</b> as a quantifying means quantifies an occurrence rate of shrinkage porosity in a certain region designated by the input unit <b>1</b> by the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">(1) searching for SG-converted values ρ(j) (1≦j≦m) assigned to respective cells within the certain region;</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">(2) stratifying the searched SG-converted values ρ(j);</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">(3) counting the number Nρ(j) of the cells with respect to each SG-converted value ρ(j);</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">(4) computing a first product of the counted number Nρ(j) and a cell volume Vρ(j) corresponding to each SG-converted value ρ(j), as a first volume Vfρ(j)(=Nρ(j)×Vρ(j)) corresponding to each SG-converted value ρ(j);</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">(5) computing a second product of the first volume Vfρ(j) and the corresponding SG-converted value ρ(j), as a weight Wρ(j) (=Nρ(j)×Vρ(j)×ρ(j)=Vfρ(j)×ρ(j));</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">(6) computing the sum of the weights Wρ(j) corresponding to the respective SG-converted values ρ(j), as a region weight</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The output unit <b>7</b> such as a display shows the computed respective region specific gravities of the respective regions of the casting metal product. The output unit <b>7</b> can be a speaker instead of the display.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Processing of an design-aiding program executed in the design-aiding device according to the first embodiment will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At Step <b>201</b>, shape data (three-dimensional solid model) of a designed casting product, a melted metal, casting condition, or the like are inputted.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At Step <b>202</b>, a region of the casting product is designated for computing a specific gravity from the inputted three-dimensional solid model. Since a shrinkage porosity occurrence rate depends on a region of the casting product, a region for computing a specific gravity is selected in each case.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">At Step <b>203</b>, the number (more than one) of strata of shrinkage porosity occurrence rates is set. This enables the number of strata of a shrinkage porosity occurrence rate to be set according to accuracy in quantifying the shrinkage porosity occurrence rate.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For instance, in an earlier stage of designing, a designer wants generally to understand, regarding a designed product, a shrinkage porosity occurrence rate or strength reduction due to shrinkage porosity. Here, the number of strata is set to a smaller number to decrease processing time for quantifying. By contrast, in a later stage, the designer needs to quantify in high accuracy, so that the number of the strata is set to a larger number.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At Step <b>204</b>, the three-dimensional solid model inputted at Step <b>201</b> is divided into a plurality of cells (tetrahedron). Heat-transfer solidifying of the melted metal in elapse of time is analyzed to thereby compute a temperature gradient (G) and cooling speed (R) of the melted metal in the respective cells.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At Step <b>205</b>, a shrinkage porosity occurrence rate in each cell is computed as a value of G/√{square root over (R)} that is a shrinkage porosity predictive equation. By using the equation includes a cooling rate in addition to a temperature gradient, the shrinkage porosity occurrence rate can be obtained with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At Step <b>206</b>, an SG-converted value is assigned to each cell based on the value of G/√{square root over (R)}, the number of strata of occurrence rates of the shrinkage porosity, and the kind of melted metal used in casting.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At Step <b>207</b>, a shrinkage porosity occurrence rate in each region designated at Step <b>202</b> is quantified as a specific gravity by the same steps as explained in the SG computing unit <b>6</b>. Namely, SG-converted values ρ(j) (1≦j≦m) assigned to respective cells are searched and stratified. The number Nρ(j) of the cells with respect to each SG-converted value ρ(j) is multiplied with a cell volume Vρ(j) corresponding to each SG-converted value ρ(j). Each of the preceding products is furthermore multiplied with the SG-converted value ρ(j), and summed up to obtain a region weight</p>

Finally, the quotient when the region weight W is divided by a region volume V is a region specific gravity ρ (=W/V) that indicates the occurrence rate of the shrinkage porosity of the certain region.
</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Indicating the shrinkage porosity occurrence rate as the specific gravity enables the designer to easily determine whether the casting product is good or bad.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At Step <b>208</b>, the computed specific gravity of the region is shown to notify the designer.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Executing the above design-aiding method enables the design-aiding device of the embodiment to compute and quantify a shrinkage porosity occurrence rate of a casting product. A designer can design a casting product with confirming whether the casting product meets requirement on solid state properties (e.x., strength) of the casting product. This results in remarkably shortening a production preparation period for designing or redesigning a mold, and enhancing quality of the casting product.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the next place, an instance of computing a specific gravity of each region will be explained. A first housing of a product is divided into 17 regions to compute specific gravities of the respective regions in an earlier designing stage. A molted metal for casting is ADC 12 of an alumina alloy. A melted metal supply-stopping temperature is 650° C. A metal mold temperature is 150° C. A heat conduction coefficient of the ADC 12 is 8.400 W/m<sup>2</sup>k. In the earlier designing stage, a shrinkage porosity occurrence rate or strength reduction is roughly required, so that the number of strata of values of G/√{square root over (R)} corresponds to the shrinkage porosity occurrence rates is set to two.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows computed specific gravities of the respective regions of the first housing and actually measured specific gravities of the corresponding regions of the first housing, as two graphs. It is understood that the two graphs nearly correspond to each other. A correlation coefficient between the two graphs is 0.7.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As a second instance, a second housing of a product is divided into 48 regions to compute specific gravities of the respective regions in a final designing stage. A melted metal for casting, a metal mold temperature, and a heat conduction coefficient are the same as in the first housing.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a later designing stage, a shrinkage porosity occurrence rate or strength reduction is accurately required, so that the number of strata of values of G/√{square root over (R)} corresponds to the shrinkage porosity occurrence rates is set to fifteen. A melted metal supply-stopping temperature is set at 570 to 580° C. This is because setting of the melted metal supply-stopping temperature at 570 to 580° C. leads to high concordance rate of shrinkage porosity distribution between actually generated porosity and a computed value using the predictive equation of G/√{square root over (R)}.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows computed specific gravities of the respective regions of the first housing and actually measured specific gravities of the corresponding regions of the second housing, as two graphs. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows fifteen sg-converted values relative to the fifteen strata of G/√{square root over (R)}.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A correlation coefficient between the two graphs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is 0.75, which shows higher concordance rate than that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. It is because of the number of strata being larger than that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which results in accurately grasping influence of the shrinkage porosity on the solid state properties of the product. Here, the reason why a region <b>25</b> does not have a specific gravity is that inlet portion of the melted metal is located in the region <b>25</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A design-aiding device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> as a second embodiment of the present invention includes a datum input unit <b>8</b> in place of the input unit <b>1</b> of the first embodiment, and an additional critical-state determining unit <b>9</b>, in comparison to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The datum input unit <b>8</b> inputs shape data (three-dimensional solid model) of a designed casting product, a melted metal, casting condition, or the like. It further sets the number of strata of occurrence rates of shrinkage cavities, designates regions where specific gravities should be computed from the shape of the designed casting product, and sets critical specific gravities in the respective designated regions. The critical specific gravity is a specific gravity that cannot yield desired solid state properties such as strength of the designed casting product.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The critical-state determining unit <b>9</b> determines whether a specific gravity computed by the SG computing unit <b>6</b> is smaller than a critical specific gravity. When a given region is determined to have a smaller specific gravity than the critical specific gravity, the given region is recognized as a region that does not realize the desired properties. It is thereby notified to the designer through the output unit <b>7</b> that the given region should be redesigned. Other components in the second embodiment are the same as in the first embodiment, so that explanation will be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Processing of a design-aiding program executed in the design-aiding device according to the second embodiment will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">At Step <b>701</b>, shape data (three-dimensional solid model) of a designed casting product, a melted metal, casting condition, or the like are inputted.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At Step <b>702</b>, a region of the casting product is designated for computing a specific gravity from the inputted three-dimensional solid model.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">At Step <b>703</b>, critical specific gravities (SG) are set with respect to the respective regions designated at Step <b>702</b>. This is because properties such as strength required for the designed product depends on a region of the product.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At Step <b>704</b>, the number (more than one) of strata of shrinkage porosity occurrence rates is set.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">At Step <b>705</b>, the three-dimensional solid model inputted at Step <b>701</b> is divided into a plurality of cells (tetrahedron). Heat-transfer solidifying of the melted metal in elapse of time is analyzed to thereby compute a temperature gradient (G) and cooling speed (R) of the melted metal in the respective cells.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At Step <b>706</b>, a shrinkage porosity occurrence rate in each cell is computed as a value of G/√{square root over (R)} that is a shrinkage porosity predictive equation.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">At Step <b>707</b>, an SG-converted value based on the value of G/√{square root over (R)}, the number of strata of occurrence rates of the shrinkage porosity, and the kind of melted metal used in casting is assigned to each cell.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">At Step <b>708</b>, a shrinkage porosity occurrence rate in each region designated at Step <b>702</b> is quantified as a specific gravity by the same steps as explained in the SG computing unit <b>6</b> of the first embodiment. Namely, SG-converted values ρ(j) (1≦j≦m) assigned to respective cells are searched and stratified. The number Nρ(j) of the cells with respect to each SG-converted value ρ(j) is multiplied with a cell volume Vρ(j) corresponding to each SG-converted value ρ(j). Each of the preceding products is furthermore multiplied with the SG-converted value ρ(j), and summed up to obtain a region weight</p>
