<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/545,644, filed Feb. 18, 2004.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A programmable logic controller, or a “PLC,” is a small computer generally used for automation of real-world processes, such as, e.g., control of machinery on factory assembly lines. Modern PLC's are microprocessor-based devices with input/output (“I/O”) functionality (usually input/output circuitry) which oftentimes monitors the status of field connected sensor inputs and controls certain output actuators according to user-created logic.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">PLC's are generally modular devices, composed of separate parts such as, e.g., commercially available processor(s), memory chips, I/O devices, etc. As machinery and machine controllers continue to decrease in size, many PLC's have similarly decreased in size. In this light, many parts of a PLC have been integrated into a single package such as, e.g., I/O circuitry integral with a processor in a single integrated circuit or integrated circuit package (“chips,” as defined herein). Integration of multiple parts into a single chip, however, has been limited.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The user-created logic which drives a PLC has evolved along with the size and integration of components. Such logic is typically stored in non-volatile memory communicating with or integral to the PLC's processor. User-created logic is typically created on a separate computing device, such as a personal computer or a workstation, and then transferred to the PLC's memory. This allows a stream-lining of the internal logic which controls the PLC. While such streamlining is beneficial in terms of conserving storage space, the cost of such streamlining is limiting the internal logic to low-level processing. Such low-level processing is undesirable as it forces a user to either program the user-created logic at a low level, which is time consuming and requires a user knowledgeable regarding such low-level programming, or to perform high-level programming on the separate computing device, translate the programming to a lower-level, and transfer the logic to the PLC.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a programmable logic controller is provided. The programmable logic controller includes an input/output component, a processor, at least one memory component and a kernel, all contained within a chip.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a programmable logic controller is provided. The programmable logic controller includes an input/output component, a processor, a plurality of memory modules and kernel logic, all contained within a single chip.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a system for programming a PLC is provided. The system includes a computing device and application software creation logic electronically communicating with the PLC.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each kernel logic component set forth in Table 1 includes any suitable steps, methods, processes and/or software for performing the function which identifies the component (e.g., “greater than,” “get date,” “CAN,” “display/interface,” “Ethernet”) according to industry standards relating to each such function. For example, “Ethernet logic” includes any suitable steps, methods, processes and/or software for facilitating network communication under industry Ethernet standards. In an additional example, “get date” logic includes any suitable steps, methods, processes and/or software for obtaining the current date. In yet another example, “greater than” logic includes any suitable steps, methods, processes and/or software for comparing two values and determining whether one value is greater than the other.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment, kernel logic <b>200</b> includes any suitable steps, methods, processes and/or software for providing PLC functionality. For example, as discussed below, application logic for a PLC of the current invention is optionally created on a personal computer or workstation, then compiled (or interpreted) into a format that is executable by the PLC. Kernel logic <b>200</b> provides PLC functionality for facilitating execution of the compiled (or interpreted) logic. Kernel logic <b>200</b> acts as a lower layer, an interface between the hardware components of the PLC and the upper layer application program (e.g., the compiled logic), and further runs the application program as necessary. In an embodiment wherein an application creation program (e.g., application software creation logic, as described below) provides a high-level user GUI (such as a graphical ladder interface), kernel logic <b>200</b> includes any suitable steps, methods, processes and/or software for running the application software created by such creation software (by either compilation or interpretation) in the PLC and provides PLC functionality to facilitate such running.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, PLC on a chip <b>100</b> further optionally integrates one or more (or combinations thereof) of the following components/features contained within chip <b>110</b>: CAN, network interfaces, programmable logic, closed loop control, interrupts, ability to interface to external memory, counters, interface for diagnostics, timers, peripheral communications interface, security, low voltage reset, low voltage interrupt, low power modes (stop mode, pseudo stop mode, and wait mode), wake up interrupt inputs, on board voltage regulation and wide temperature operating range. PLC on a chip <b>100</b> further optionally includes one or more external program interfaces, including but not limited to: ladder diagram and function block compiler (described herein), instruction list, structured text, sequential function chart, flow chart, monitor, reverse compiler, timing diagrams and data logging.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in an embodiment, a system for programming a PLC contained in a chip is shown. PLC on a chip <b>100</b> electronically communicates <b>330</b> with a computing device <b>320</b> running therein application software creation logic <b>300</b>. Electronic communication <b>330</b> is accomplished via any suitable interface, including but not limited to I/O described herein. Computing device <b>320</b> is any computing device capable of executing application software creation logic <b>300</b>, including but not limited to a personal computer and a workstation.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Application software creation logic <b>300</b> includes any suitable steps, methods, processes and/or software for creating one or more applications (or “user-created logic”) which are performable on PLC on a chip <b>100</b>. Application software creation logic <b>300</b> optionally includes a compiler <b>310</b> for compiling an application created with application software creation logic <b>300</b> into a format executable by PLC on a chip <b>100</b>. An exemplary suitable application software creation logic <b>300</b> including a complier <b>310</b> is the EZ LADDER suite and compiler available from Divelbiss Corporation. Alternatively and/or additionally, application software creation logic <b>300</b> optionally includes an interpreter (not shown) for interpreting such an application created with application software logic <b>300</b>. It will be appreciated that for applications which are interpreted, the interpreter is physically and/or logically located in any suitable place (i.e., in the kernel, in the application software creation logic, etc).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A user accesses application software creation logic <b>300</b> to create, edit or modify an application for PLC on a chip <b>100</b>, and further to compile (or interpret) the application for execution on PLC on a chip <b>100</b>. In the EZ LADDER suite example, a user is given a graphical ladder interface and the ability to point, click and drag objects to create or modify a ladder diagram. The ladder diagram is complied into a form executable via kernel <b>150</b> on PLC on a chip <b>100</b>, and the executable application is communicated <b>330</b> to the PLC, wherein it is stored in a memory component <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It will be appreciated that kernel logic <b>200</b> (with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is optionally adapted to work with application software creation logic <b>300</b> and compiler <b>310</b> to optimize application logic components. In this embodiment, application software creation logic <b>300</b> and compiler <b>310</b> convert user input into an executable application which is optimized for execution by kernel logic <b>200</b>. The application may thus be streamlined to, e.g., take up less memory space in the PLC. Furthermore, programming capabilities allows a user to program the PLC without needing an in-depth understanding of low-level programming. While the above examples have described a system wherein a ladder diagram is used to create an application, it will be appreciated that application software creation logic <b>300</b> optionally uses any suitable method to facilitate creation of an application, and this disclosure is thus not limited to use of a ladder diagram.</p>
