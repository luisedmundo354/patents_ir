<p id="p-0001" num="0000">To facilitate the use of portable digital devices such as cell phones, printer processing stations are proposed for printing the information that is accessible through the portable digital devices. In general, the portable digital devices have easy access to an enormous amount of information but are equipped with a relatively small display screen without an on-board printing capability. To solve the above dilemma, readily available printer stations allow the user to print a selectable portion of the information at one of the predetermined locations and conveniently charge the user for a print fee.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The current invention is generally related to systems and methods of printing information from portable digital devices, and more particularly related to systems and methods of printing information at conveniently located printer stations from digital devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The use of portable digital devices has already widespread and appears to gain further popularity in the future. The portable digital devices include portable computers, cellular phones, personal handyphone systems (PHS), and personal digital assistances (PDA) such as a Palm™. The portable digital devices are used to keep information such as schedules, addresses, phone numbers as well as to communicate through voice and data. With the recent explosion of the Internet, the portable digital devices are capable of accessing e-mail as well as web sites. For example, in Japan, Nippon Telephone and Telegram (NTT) offers the i-mode™ which allows the portable digital devices such as cell phones to access the web sites for information, on-line shopping, ticket reservations as well as fund transfers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Despite the above described convenient services, the portable digital devices generally suffer some shortcomings. One of them is a lack of printing capabilities. In fact, the portable digital devices fail to support any print driver and are not equipped with a printer connector. The lack of a print capability is further complicated by a large amount of information to be displayed at certain web sites and a small display on the portable digital devices. The small display cannot show a large amount of information at a time, and a user is not able to understand the information in an efficient manner. The small displays also cannot show graphical information at a reasonably high resolution. For example, a user cannot read a detailed map on a small display on the portable digital device. Furthermore, the portable digital device does not allow the user to open a certain attached file in e-mail. Because of these reasons, it appears necessary to print accessed information so that the user fully and efficiently utilizes the accessed information.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Instead of carrying a printer to print the information accessed through a portable digital device, it is desirable to print the information using one of a plurality of printer stations placed at predetermined or remote locations. In other words, as public phones are widely available for use for a fee, it is desired that public printers should be also widely available.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve the above and other problems, according to a first aspect of the current invention, an apparatus for remotely printing desired information on demand, including: a user interface unit for inputting information indicative of at least a desired location in a computer network and for outputting the information; a communication unit connected to the user interface unit for obtaining content data from the network based upon the information; a processing unit connected to the communication unit and the user interface unit for processing print data based upon the content data; a print unit connected to the processing unit for printing the print data and a barcode indicative of a print charge at the desired location on an image-carrying medium; and a charge unit connected to the user interface unit and the processing unit for charging a fee for the image-carrying medium according to a predetermined formula and the barcode.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These and various other advantages and features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed hereto and forming a part hereof. However, for a better understanding of the invention, its advantages, and the objects obtained by its use, reference should be made to the drawings which form a further part hereof, and to the accompanying descriptive matter, in which there is illustrated and described a preferred embodiment of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in general, the user temporarily connects his or her a portable digital device to the above described second preferred embodiment of the printer processing unit <b>31</b> according to the current invention for printing a desired set of information that is already stored in the portable digital device <b>21</b> or that is to be obtained through the portable digital device <b>21</b>. Alternatively, in the second preferred embodiment, the printer processing unit <b>31</b> directly obtains desired information from a web site that the user specifies through the input unit <b>114</b>. After the user selects the desired set of the information to be printed through the display unit <b>113</b> and the input unit <b>114</b>, the control unit <b>111</b> prepares the selected information for printing in the RAM based upon a predetermined format and sends the selected information to the print unit <b>112</b> through the use of the ROM <b>115</b> and the RAM <b>116</b>. In printing the user selected information, the control unit <b>111</b> accesses the data stored in the disk <b>120</b>, and the data includes user profile information as well as printer profile information for limiting certain print activities such as a maximal number of copies that a particular user and or a particular printer processing unit is allowed to make per print session. The profile data will be further explained below. After the specified printing is complete, the charge unit <b>117</b> charges the user a fee for printing the selected information through a predetermined payment method. However, the charge unit <b>1117</b> of the preferred embodiment indicates the fee and a predetermined set of payment methods to the user on the display unit <b>113</b> before printing, and the user selects the preferred method of payment via the input unit <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, the charge unit accepts a prepaid card. Prior to printing, the charge unit <b>117</b> determines a printing fee or charge for the current print job. Then, the charge unit <b>117</b> reads a prepaid card and determines whether or not there is a sufficient amount of unused fund available on the prepaid card for the above determined print charge. The unused fund may be represented in a predetermined unit. If the charge for each page is 2 units and three pages are to be printed, the total print charge is 6 units. Assuming that the prepaid card holds 10 units, the charge unit <b>117</b> sends a signal indicative of proceeding the above printing to the print unit <b>112</b> and records the remaining 4 units on the prepaid card before dispensing it to the user. Finally, information on the above print job such as a number of print outs and print time is kept for the record in the RAM <b>116</b> or the disk <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a diagram illustrates one stage of one preferred embodiment of the user interface screen on the display unit <b>113</b> in the printer processing unit <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> according to the current invention. The preferred user interface includes information on what can be printed using the printer station in the upper half and some advertisement in the lower half. The lower portion of the print station display unit <b>113</b> shows any predetermined advertisement while the print stations <b>11</b> and <b>31</b> are waiting for use. The user is able to touch a certain area of the advertisement to receive additional information. The advertisement is optionally shown to the user also throughout the use of the print stations <b>11</b> and <b>31</b>. The upper portion shows that a user has a choice of printing e-mail, web site contents or data base contents such as a telephone directory. In addition, the user is provided with a choice of the display in a foreign language such as Japanese. In order to initiate printing, the user touches a screen surface area corresponding to a desired language and “start.”</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a diagram illustrates another stage of the preferred embodiment of the user interface screen on the display unit <b>113</b> in the printer processing unit <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> according to the current invention. This stage of the user interface indicates that the user is supposed to establish a connection between a portable digital device and the printer processing unit. The temporary connection is made via a connection cable or an infrared wireless connection. After the connection is established, the user is asked to select a preferred payment method. One example of a payment method is cash. The charge unit <b>117</b> determines an amount of a print charge and indicates the amount on the display unit <b>113</b>. The charge unit <b>117</b> further includes a cash accepting unit and monitors an amount of deposit in the cash accepting unit. The display unit <b>113</b> provides necessary messages including the print charge amount, the deposited amount, the remaining amount after print and a change amount. Although the illustration shows a deposit of a coin, the preferred user interface additionally provides other payment options.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">One example of such a list of payment methods is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The user is asked to select one of the predetermined methods that include a charge to a credit card, a cash payment at a check out line or a casher at the point of sales where the print stations are located, a cash payment into a cash accepting machine, a charge to a predetermined account for printing, use of a prepaid card and a charge to a mobile telephone billing account. If a credit card or a prepaid card is selected, the user is asked to swipe the card on a card reader of the charge unit <b>117</b> at this stage. Furthermore, the charge unit <b>117</b> further includes a card writer to record a remaining amount on the prepaid card after charging. Similarly, if a predetermined account such as a print or mobile telephone account is selected, the user has to input a corresponding account number and a certain predetermined validation code. Alternatively, a key card contains the identification information for the charge account in lieu of inputting the information. For the use of the mobile telephone account, the phone number is read into the RAM <b>116</b> from the portable digital device <b>21</b> that is connected to the print station <b>11</b>, <b>31</b>. The print charge along with the phone number is later transmitted to the corresponding carrier telephone company so that the cell phone user is ultimately charged for the printing. The telephone company retains a predetermined portion of the print charge for handling and transfers the rest to the operator of the print station. Lastly, if a cash payment method is selected, at this stage of the preferred user interface, no user identification may be required.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a diagram illustrates one exemplary user interface for identifying a user before printing information according to the current invention. Depending upon the selected payment method, it is necessary to identify the user via a validation code or personal identification number (PIN). If a predetermined print charge account is selected for payment, in one implementation, information on the user identification and or the corresponding account number is stored in a portable digital device that has been temporarily connected to the print station and the information is automatically retrieved from the portable digital device. Then, the user is simply asked to input a PIN code via the touch-screen user interface. In another implementation, the user has to input both a user identification number and or an account number followed by a PIN to validate a proper use prior to printing. Although the exemplary user interface shows only numerical input buttons, other input buttons such as alphanumeric keys are also within the scope of the current disclosures. Another use for identifying a user is to access certain information applicable to the user. The information is used to limit the user in performing certain aspects of printing. In addition, the user identification is optionally used to restrict a number of users or to confirm a pre-approved membership for using the print stations.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a flow chart illustrates acts involved in one preferred process of identifying a user according to one aspect of the current invention. In act S<b>1</b>, assuming that the portable digital device <b>21</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has been temporarily connected to the print station <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> as respectively shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, the print station <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> retrieves information stored in the portable digital device <b>21</b> in act S<b>1</b>. The information includes at least user identification (ID) and a PIN code or a password for the user ID. After receiving the above information, the print stations <b>11</b> and <b>31</b> prompt a user to input a PIN code or a password and waits for the input in act S<b>2</b>. Upon receiving the password input, the print station <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> compares the inputted password to the retrieved password in act S<b>3</b>. If the comparison in the act S<b>3</b> confirms a match, a requested print process proceeds in act S<b>4</b>. On the other hand, the comparison in the act S<b>3</b> fails to confirm a match, the user identification process ends. Alternatively, the negative match in the act S<b>3</b> leads to the act S<b>2</b> to wait for receiving another password. The alternative user identification process repeats the password comparison acts S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b> for a predetermined number of times before ending the process.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a flow chart illustrates acts involved in a second preferred process of identifying a user according the current invention. In act S<b>11</b>, assuming that the portable digital device <b>21</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has been temporarily connected to the print station <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> as respectively shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, the print station <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> retrieves information stored in the portable digital device <b>21</b> in act S<b>11</b>. The retrieved information includes at least user identification (ID). In addition, in act S<b>12</b>, the print station <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> further retrieves a PIN code or a password for the user ID from a predetermined user information server that is connected to the print station <b>11</b> or <b>31</b>. The user information server stores additional information such as user profile information as will be further described below. After receiving the above information, the print stations <b>11</b> and <b>31</b> prompt a user to input a PIN code or a password and waits for the input in act S<b>13</b>. Upon receiving the password input, the print station <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> compares the inputted password to the retrieved password in act S<b>14</b>. If the comparison in the act S<b>14</b> confirms a match, a requested print process proceeds in act S<b>15</b>. On the other hand, the comparison in the act S<b>14</b> fails to confirm a match, the user identification process ends. Alternatively, the negative match in the act S<b>14</b> leads to the act S<b>13</b> to wait for receiving another password. The second alternative user identification process repeats the password comparison acts S<b>13</b> and S<b>14</b> for a predetermined number of times before ending the process.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a diagram illustrates exemplary contents of a user profile that is used in the preferred remote print-and-charge process according to the current invention. In general, the user profile is created for a given user and contains certain predetermined information for processing a print request from the particular individual. One exemplary user profile includes information on a maximal number of copies or prints that the particular user is allowed to make per a predetermined time frame such as each print session and or a certain set of functions that he is allowed to use. In addition, the user profile information includes a maximal amount of time allowed for a particular user during one print session as well as a time period such as time of the day or day of the week when a particular user is allowed to use a print station. Furthermore, the user profile optionally includes cyberspace information such as a user's e-mail address and book marks for web sites. The user profile information is stored in a local disk storage unit at the print processing unit <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> or in a central server that the print processing units <b>11</b> and <b>31</b> share. Alternatively, the user profile information of a particular individual user is stored in a portable digital device <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a diagram illustrates exemplary contents of a printer station profile that is used in the preferred remote print-and-charge process according to the current invention. In general, the printer station profile is created for a given printer station and contains certain predetermined information for processing a print request from the particular individual. One exemplary printer station profile includes information on a maximal number of copies or prints that any user is allowed to make per each print session and or a certain set of functions that the printer station offers. In addition, the printer station profile information includes a maximal amount of time allowed for any user during one print session. The printer station profile information is stored in a local disk storage unit at the print processing unit <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> or in a central server that the print processing units <b>11</b> and <b>31</b> accesses. When the above described printer station profile is used in combination with the user profile information and there is a conflict between the two sets of information, according to one preferred process, the printer station profile preempts the user profile.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a diagram illustrates one exemplary user interface for selecting a desired category of information to be printed according to the current invention. One example of the touch-screen menu selection offers “e-mail,” “telephone directory” or “web-site contents.” In general, information is downloaded from the Internet according to a selected choice. When the e-mail option is selected, the e-mail contents are retrieved via the portable digital device <b>21</b> or directly by the printer stations <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> from an e-mail address that is specified in the user profile information according to one implementation. As described above, the user profile contains cyberspace information including an e-mail address. If the user profile includes more than one e-mail address, a user selects one of them from a displayed list. Similarly, a telephone directory is accessed based upon certain information in the user profile. Alternatively, a generic telephone directory is accessed, and the user inputs additional search information for retrieving a certain telephone number. Lastly, the web site content information is also retrieved based upon book marked information in the user profile or an additional input.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a diagram illustrates one exemplary user interface for selecting a desired e-mail to be printed according to the current invention. One example of the touch-screen menu selection offers a list of e-mail whose entries are identified by the sender and the date. In addition, the existence of an attachment to e-mail is indicated. To select one or a series of e-mail to be printed, the user simply touches the e-mail item, and the selected item is now highlighted. In this example, “e-mail <b>3</b> from Miss C” has been selected. The attachment is optionally and independently selectable. To display a long list of e-mail entries, the user touches up and down triangular buttons for scrolling respectively upwards and downwards. In order to select a plurality of e-mail items, the above described process is repeated. To browse the content of the selected e-mail, the user quickly touches the selected item twice as if double clicking, and the content of the e-mail is displayed for confirmation. Lastly, to cancel or clear the selected items, the user touches a cancel/clear bottom at the lower left corner.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, after the e-mail items are selected, the user optionally determines print parameters such as a desired format of a print out as well as a number of copies. The print parameters generally include an output format and a number of copies, and these two parameters are displayed at the bottom of the exemplary user interface. For the print format, a default print format such as 11×8 is displayed. In order to change the print format, the user must touch a format button and an additional user interface will appear to select another print format. To specify a number of copies to be printed, the user first touches the number indicator area to invoke a numeric pad screen and specifies a desired number via the numeric pad screen. Based upon the specified number of print outs and the selected print format, an amount of a fee or cost for printing is indicated in the fee area. At this point, the user can proceed to print by touching the print button or area at the lower right corner of the user interface. In addition to the above described print parameters, the user optionally can specify other print parameters that are not displayed on the user interface. To specify the additional print parameters, the user touches the other options button at the bottom of the user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a diagram illustrates one exemplary user interface for selecting desired optional print parameters according to the current invention. One example of the touch-screen option menus includes a print format. In this example, two print formats are offered for printing telephone directory entries. To select a desired print format, the user touches a screen area corresponding to the desired print format. In addition to a print format, although the exemplary diagram does not show, the size and the direction of paper are optionally selectable. Depending upon the selected print options and parameters, the print fee may be updated to reflect the selections.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>, diagrams illustrate print previews of one exemplary image for selecting an additional optional print parameter according to the current invention. One example of the touch-screen option menus includes a resolution level. In this example, two print resolution levels are offered for printing a graphic image. To select a desired resolution level, the user touches a screen area corresponding to the desired resolution level. According to one example, the resolution levels are either high or low. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> illustrates a print preview of a graphic image at the predetermined low resolution level. Not only the detailed of a graphic image is lost, but also that of the textual image is lost. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> illustrates a print preview of the same image at the predetermined high resolution level. For example, the high resolution is provided at 1200 dots per inch (DPI), 36 gradations and 256 colors. Both graphical and textual details are see in the preview image. The implication of the resolution option is significant in certain application such as printing maps. The resolution option therefore accesses the image of a desired resolution from an address referenced by a particular URL. Depending upon the selected print options and parameters, the print fee may be updated to reflect the selections.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">To simplify the implementation of the resolution option, a web site content server stores an image at a predetermined resolution levels at different addresses or URL's. For example, the URL for a high resolution image is:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0051">“http://www.domain_name/printer.html&amp;high_resolution=http://www.doma in_name/printer_p.html&amp;print_charge=$0.75”
<br/>
The URL indicates the image is store at http:/www.domain_name/printer.html&amp;high_resolution while the charge information for the high resolution is $0.75 per print. Similarly, the URL for a corresponding low resolution image is:
</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0052">“http://www.domain_name/printer.html&amp;low_resolution=http://www.domai n_name/printer_p.html&amp;print_charge=$0.25”
<br/>
The URL indicates the image is store at http://www.domain_name/printer.html&amp;low_resolution while the charge information for the low resolution is $0.25 per print. Thus, the URL is read into the RAM to extract certain information in determining a print charge. Furthermore, the URL is designed to include information on a requester, and the content server keeps a list of registered users. Thus, the content server decides whether or not the request is allowed based upon the registration upon each access.

<p id="p-0052" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates one preferred embodiment of the accounting or profit distribution sub-system of the print-and-charge system according to the current invention. The print stations <b>11</b> and <b>31</b> are connected to a predetermined processing center <b>45</b> for periodically reporting relevant identification and financial data including a predetermined print station identification number, an total sales amount and so on. Furthermore, the identification information includes a charge account information for each individual or group and the corresponding print charge information. According to one scheme, participants in the profit distribution include a print station owner, a print location operator such as a retail store operator who has the print station on the premises, and a prepaid card issuer/distributor who sells prepaid cards for using the print stations. The processing center <b>45</b> processes the reported data and calculates a profit distribution amount for each of the participants based upon a predetermined agreement. The profit distribution amounts are reported to a financial institution <b>47</b> such as a bank for electronic deposits or wiring. The financial institution <b>47</b> makes the calculated deposits respectively to a prepaid card issuer account <b>43</b>, a retail store account <b>41</b> and a print station owner account <b>49</b>. Furthermore, if the prepaid card issuer has not paid the retail store owner and the print station owner the predetermined percentage of the prepaid card sales amount, the prepaid card issuer now makes deposits to the retail store owner and the print station owner based upon an agreement.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">The above described profit distribution sub-system is only exemplary, and there are numerous variations. For example, the store owners may own or lease the print stations. Another example of the variations is that the prepaid card issuer pays the store owners and the print station owners commissions at a fixed rate before the profit distributions. Furthermore, the print stations <b>11</b> and <b>31</b> also send charge information to charge accounts that the user specify as a preferred payment. For example, if the user specifies to charge the print fee to a mobile telephone account, the print stations <b>11</b> and <b>31</b> send the charge information to the processing center <b>45</b>. In turn, the processing center <b>45</b> requests the payment from the corresponding telephone companies, the telephone companies then make payments to the financial institutions <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates an exemplary transactional diagram between a prepaid card issuer <b>50</b> and a prepaid card retail store <b>52</b>. According to this exemplary scheme, the prepaid card issuer <b>50</b> manufactures and distributes prepaid cards to the prepaid card retailer <b>52</b>. Upon delivering the prepaid cards, the prepaid card issuer <b>50</b> pays the prepaid card retailer <b>52</b> some predetermined commission. After the prepaid cards are sold, the prepaid card retailer <b>52</b> pays the corresponding prepaid card sales amount. Needless to say that the retail store where the print station is located can sell the prepaid cards as the prepaid card retailer <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates an exemplary print out with a bar code indicating an amount of cash payment for a print fee according to the current invention. The print out includes information such as a cell phone number, a memory dial list, a redial number list, a book mark list, a e-mail address list and a function list that are stored in a cell phone. This print out also illustrates that the user has selected a cash payment at a register of the retail store where the print station is located. The bar code at the lower right indicates the amount of a print fee that needs to be paid at a cash register.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a flow chart illustrates acts involved in a preferred over-all process of printing at the printer processing unit according the current invention. Some of the following acts are implemented through the user interface that have been described in the above. In act S<b>100</b>, advertisement is displayed on a screen of the printer processing unit <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> while it is waiting for a customer to use the printer processing unit. The advertisement space can be sold to any body at a predetermined rate. In act S<b>102</b>, a portable digital device <b>21</b> is temporarily connected to the print processing unit <b>11</b> or <b>31</b>. The connection is made either by a cable or wireless means. According to the preferred process, the user has to enter a user ID and a validation code or a password in act S<b>104</b> after the connection is made in the act S<b>102</b>. The user ID and the matching password are stored at a predetermined location such as the portable digital device <b>21</b>, the printer station <b>11</b> or <b>31</b> or a centrally located server. The user inputted ID and password are matched against the predetermined information in act S<b>106</b>. If the match fails, the user is asked to enter the correct information in the act S<b>104</b> for a predetermined number of trials. When the predetermined number of the trials is exhausted, the preferred process cancels the further acts and returns to the act S<b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the preferred process proceeds when the user inputted ID and the password match the predetermined information in the act S<b>106</b>. In act S<b>107</b>, a list of printable information is displayed to the user. One exemplary list includes categories such as e-mail and web directories, and the list further includes entries of the selected category. According to one preferred process, the user is allowed to browse the content of the selected item for an additional fee in act S<b>108</b>. After confirming the content by browsing, the user selects an item or entry to be printed in act S<b>110</b>. The user optionally selects more than one item to be printed at the same time. After selecting the items, the user now specifies how the selected items are to be printed in act S<b>112</b>. The user inputs print parameters that include a size of a print out, the number of copies and a resolution level. Finally, the preferred process requires the user to specify a payment method from a predetermined set of choices in act S<b>114</b>. The payment choices include a cash payment, a charge/credit card payment, a prepaid card payment and so on. Upon confirming the way to settle the print charge, the preferred process executes the printing in act S<b>116</b> and subsequently charges the fee based upon the selected payment method in act S<b>118</b>. The user is able to continue the preferred process of the print and charge by going back to the act S<b>107</b> in response to a prompt in act S<b>120</b>. Otherwise, the preferred process terminates.</p>
