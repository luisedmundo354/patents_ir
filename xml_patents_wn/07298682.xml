<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of recording information in an optical recording medium, and particularly to a method of recording information in a data rewritable type optical recording medium having a plurality of information recording layers. Further, the present invention relates to an information recording apparatus for recording information in an optical recording medium, and particularly to an information recording apparatus for recording information in a data rewritable optical recording medium having a plurality of information recording layers. Furthermore, the present invention relates to an optical recording medium, and particularly to a data rewritable optical recording medium.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Optical recording media typified by the CD and the DVD have been widely used as recording media for recording digital data. The recording capacity demanded of such optical recording media has increased year by year, and various proposals have been made to achieve this. One of these proposals is a technique that uses a two-layer structure for the information recording layers contained in the optical recording media, which has found practical application in the DVD-Video and DVD-ROM formats which are read-only optical storage media. With such read-only optical recording media, pre-pits formed on the substrate surface become the information recording layer, and such substrates have a laminated structure with an intervening intermediate layer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, in recent years, proposals have been made for optical recording media with a two-layer structure for the information recording layer to be used also as an optical recording medium in which data can be rewritten (data rewritable type optical recording medium) (See Japanese Patent Application Laid Open NO. 2001-273638). Such a data rewritable type optical recording medium has a structure in which a recording film and dielectric films between which they are sandwiched form an information recording layer, and these information recording layers are laminated.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A phase change material is generally used for forming a recording film of a data rewritable type optical recording medium and data are recorded utilizing the difference in the reflection coefficients between the case where the recording film is in a crystal phase and the case where it is in an amorphous phase. More specifically, in an unrecorded state, substantially the entire surface of the recording film is in a crystal phase and when data are recorded, the phase of a predetermined region of the recording film is changed to the amorphous phase to form a recording pit. The phase of the phase change material in the crystal phase can be changed to the amorphous phase by heating the phase change material to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point thereof and quickly cooling it. On the other hand, the phase change material in the amorphous phase can be crystallized by heating the phase change material to a temperature equal to or higher than the crystallization temperature thereof and gradually cooling it.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such heating and cooling can be performed by adjusting the power (output) of a laser beam. In other words, it is possible not only to record data in an unrecorded recording film but also to directly overwrite (direct-overwrite) a recording mark already formed in a region of the recording film with a different recording mark by modulating the intensity of the laser beam. Generally, the power of the laser beam is modulated in accordance with a pulse waveform having an amplitude between a recording power (Pw) and a bottom power (Pb) in order to heat the recording film to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point thereof and the power of the laser beam is set to the bottom power (Pb) in order to quickly cool the recording film. Further, in order to heat the recording film to a temperature equal to or higher than the crystallization temperature thereof and gradually cool it, the power of a laser beam is set to an erasing power (Pe). In this case, the erasing power (Pe) is set to a level at which the recording film is heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the crystallization temperature thereof and lower than the melting point thereof, thereby performing so-called solid phase erasing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Here, in a data rewritable type optical recording medium having two information recording layers, since data are recorded or reproduced by focusing a laser beam onto one of the information recording layers, in the case of recording data in or reproducing data from the information recording layer farther from the light incidence plane (hereinafter referred to as an “L<b>1</b> layer”), a laser beam is projected thereonto via the information recording layer closer to the light incidence plane (hereinafter referred to as an “L<b>0</b> layer”). Therefore, since it is necessary for the L<b>0</b> layer to have a sufficiently high light transmittance, it is general for the L<b>0</b> layer to include no reflective film or even if the L<b>0</b> layer includes a reflective film, the thickness of the reflective film is set to be very thin.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since the L<b>0</b> layer thus includes no reflective film or even if the L<b>0</b> layer includes a reflective film, the thickness of the reflective film is set to be very thin in a data rewritable type optical recording medium having two information recording layers, the heat radiation characteristic of the L<b>0</b> layer is lower than that of the L<b>1</b> layer including a sufficiently thick reflective film and, therefore, re-crystallization of the phase change material tends to occur. More specifically, since metal is generally used as the material for forming a reflective film, heat generated in the L<b>1</b> layer by irradiation with a laser beam can be quickly radiated through the reflective film having high thermal conductivity but since the L<b>0</b> layer includes no reflective film or only a very thin reflective film, heat generated in the L<b>0</b> layer by irradiation with a laser beam cannot be quickly radiated. A recording mark (an amorphous region) formed in the L<b>0</b> layer is therefore deformed and a good signal cannot be reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Particularly, in recent years, attempts have been made to record large quantities of data by setting the quotient (λ/NA) of the wavelength λ of the laser beam used for recording and/or reproducing divided by the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens used to focus the laser beam to be equal to or shorter than 700 nm, for example, by setting the numerical aperture NA to 0.7 or greater, e.g. roughly 0.85, and also shortening the wavelength λ of the laser beam to about 200 to 450 nm in order to make the focused spot diameter of the laser beam smaller and increase the recording density. In such a system that records and/or reproduces data using a laser beam of short wavelength converged by an objective lens having a high NA, the above mentioned influence of thermal interference becomes great in the L<b>0</b> layer and the phase change material tends to be re-crystallized.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic cross section illustrating the structure of an optical recording medium <b>10</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an optical recording medium <b>10</b> according to this embodiment includes a substrate <b>11</b>, an intermediate layer <b>12</b>, a light transmission layer <b>13</b>, an L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> provided between the intermediate layer <b>12</b> and the light transmission layer <b>13</b> and an L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b> provided between the substrate <b>11</b> and the intermediate layer <b>12</b>. The L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> constitutes an information recording layer far from a light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a </i>and is constituted by a first dielectric film <b>21</b>, an L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and a second dielectric film <b>23</b>. Further, the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b> constitutes an information recording layer close to the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a </i>and is constituted by a third dielectric film <b>31</b>, an L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> and a fourth dielectric film <b>33</b>. In this manner, the optical recording medium <b>10</b> according to this embodiment includes two information recording layers (the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> and the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The substrate <b>11</b> is a disc-like substrate having a thickness of about 1.1 mm serving as a support for ensuring mechanical strength required for the optical recording medium <b>10</b> and grooves <b>11</b><i>a </i>and lands <b>11</b><i>b </i>are formed on the surface thereof. The grooves <b>11</b><i>a </i>and/or lands <b>11</b><i>b </i>serve as a guide track for the laser beam L when data are to be recorded in the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b> or when data are to be reproduced from the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b>. Although the depth of the groove <b>11</b><i>a </i>is not particularly limited, it is preferably set to 10 nm to 40 nm and the pitch of the grooves <b>11</b><i>a </i>is preferably set to 0.2 μm to 0.4 μm. Various materials can be used for forming the substrate <b>11</b> and the substrate <b>11</b> can be formed of glass, ceramic, resin or the like. Among these, resin is preferably used for forming the substrate <b>11</b> since resin can be easily shaped. Illustrative examples of resins suitable for forming the substrate <b>11</b> include polycarbonate resin, olefin resin, acrylic resin, epoxy resin, polystyrene resin, polyethylene resin, polypropylene resin, silicone resin, fluoropolymers, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin, urethane resin and the like. Among these, polycarbonate resin or olefin resin is most preferably used for forming the substrate <b>11</b> from the viewpoint of easy processing, optical characteristics and the like. In this embodiment, since the laser beam L does not pass through the substrate <b>11</b>, it is unnecessary for the substrate <b>11</b> to have a light transmittance property.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The intermediate layer <b>12</b> serves to space the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> and the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b> apart by a sufficient distance and grooves <b>12</b><i>a </i>and lands <b>12</b><i>b </i>are formed on the surface thereof. The grooves <b>12</b><i>a </i>and/or lands <b>12</b><i>b </i>serve as a guide track for the laser beam L when data are to be recorded in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> or when data are to be reproduced from the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b>. The depth of the groove <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the pitch of the grooves <b>12</b><i>a </i>can be set to be substantially the same as those of the grooves <b>11</b><i>a </i>formed on the surface of the substrate <b>11</b>. The depth of the intermediate layer <b>12</b> is preferably set to be 10 μm to 50 μm. The material for forming the intermediate layer <b>12</b> is not particularly limited and an ultraviolet ray curable acrylic resin is preferably used for forming the intermediate layer <b>12</b>. It is necessary for the transparent intermediate layer <b>12</b> to have sufficiently high light transmittance since the laser beam L passes through the transparent intermediate layer <b>12</b> when data are to be recorded in the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b> and data recorded in the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b> are to be reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The light transmission layer <b>13</b> forms an optical path of a laser beam and a light incident plane <b>13</b><i>a </i>is constituted by one of the surfaces thereof. The thickness of the light transmission layer <b>13</b> is preferably set to be 30 μm to 200 μm. The material for forming the light transmission layer <b>13</b> is not particularly limited and, similarly to the intermediate layer <b>12</b>, an ultraviolet ray curable acrylic resin is preferably used for forming the light transmission layer <b>13</b>. As described above, it is necessary for the light transmission layer <b>13</b> to have sufficiently high light transmittance since the laser beam L passes through the transparent intermediate layer <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Each of the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>33</b> is formed of a phase change material. Utilizing the difference in the reflection coefficients between the case where the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>33</b> are in a crystal phase and the case where they are in an amorphous phase, data are recorded in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>23</b> and the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>33</b>. The material for forming the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>33</b> is not particularly limited but it is preferable to form them using a SbTe system material. As the SbTe system material, SbTe may be used alone, or InSbTeGe, AgInSbTe, AgSbTeGe, AgInSbTeGe or the like containing In, Te, Ge, Ag or the like as additives may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Since the laser beam passes through the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> when data are recorded in the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b> and data recorded in the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b> are reproduced, it is necessary for the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> to have a high light transmittance. Therefore, the thickness of the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> is set to be considerably thinner than that of the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>. Concretely, it is preferable to set the thickness of the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> to be about 3 to 20 nm and the thickness of the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> to be 0.3 to 0.8 times that of the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first dielectric film <b>21</b> and the second dielectric film <b>23</b> formed so as to sandwich the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> serve as protective films for the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and the third dielectric film <b>31</b> and the fourth dielectric film <b>33</b> formed so as to sandwich the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> serve as protective films for the L<b>10</b> recording film <b>32</b>. The thickness of the first dielectric film <b>21</b> is preferably set to be 2 to 200 nm, the thickness of the second dielectric film <b>23</b> is preferably set to be 2 to 200 nm, the thickness of the third dielectric film <b>31</b> is preferably set to be 2 to 200 nm and the thickness of the fourth dielectric film <b>33</b> is preferably set to be 2 to 200 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Each of these dielectric films may have a single-layered structure or may have a multi-layered structure including a plurality of dielectric films. The material for forming each of these dielectric films is not particularly limited but it is preferable to form it of oxide, nitride, sulfide, carbide of Si, Al, Ta and Zn such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, AlN, TaO, ZnS, CeO<sub>2 </sub>and the like or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The reflective film <b>34</b> serves to reflect the laser beam entering through the light incident plane <b>13</b><i>a </i>so as to emit it from the light incident plane <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the thickness thereof is preferably set to be 20 to 200 nm. The material for forming the reflective film <b>34</b> is not particularly limited but the reflective film <b>34</b> is preferably formed of an alloy containing Ag or Al as a primary component and may be formed of Au, Pt or the like. Further, a moisture proof film may be provided between the reflective film <b>34</b> and the substrate <b>11</b> in order to prevent the reflective film <b>34</b> from being corroded. Materials usable for forming each of the first dielectric film <b>21</b> to the fourth dielectric film <b>33</b> can be used for forming the moisture proof film. Further, although the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> includes no reflective film, a thin reflective film having a thickness of about 3 to 15 nm may be provided in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b>. In this case, the reflective film can be formed of the same material as used for forming the reflective film <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When data are recorded in the thus constituted optical recording medium <b>10</b>, a laser beam having a wavelength of 200 to 450 nm is projected onto the optical recording medium <b>10</b> via the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the amount of the laser beam reflected from the optical recording medium <b>10</b> is detected. As described above, since the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> are formed of the phase change material and the reflection coefficient in the case where the phase change material is in the crystal phase and that in the case where it is in the amorphous phase are different from each other, it is possible to judge by projecting the laser beam via the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a</i>, focusing it onto one of the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> and detecting the amount of the laser beam reflected therefrom whether a region of the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> or the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> irradiated with the laser beam is in the crystal phase or the amorphous phase.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When data are to be recorded in the optical recording medium <b>10</b>, a laser beam having a wavelength of 200 to 450 nm is projected to be focused onto one of the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> and in accordance with data to be recorded therein, a predetermined region of one of the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> is heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point thereof and quickly cooled, thereby changing the phase thereof to the amorphous phase or a predetermined region of one of the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> is heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the crystallization temperature and gradually cooled, thereby changing the phase thereof to the crystal phase. The region whose phase has been changed to the amorphous phase is referred to as “a recording mark” and recorded data are expressed by the length from the starting point of the recording mark to the ending point thereof and the length from the ending point thereof to the starting point of the next recording mark. The length of each recording mark and the length between recording marks (edge to edge) are set to one of the lengths corresponding to 2T through 8T (where T is the clock period) when adopting the (1,7) RLL modulation scheme, although this is no particular limitation. A pulse train pattern used for recording data in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and a pulse train pattern used for recording data in the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When recording data in or reproducing data from the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b>, a laser beam is projected onto the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> via the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b>. Therefore, it is necessary for the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> to have a high light transmittance and, as pointed out above, the thickness of the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> is set to be considerably thinner than that of the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Here follows a description of the method of manufacturing an optical recording medium <b>10</b> according to this preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref> are step drawings illustrating the method of manufacturing the optical recording medium <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a stamper <b>40</b> is used to perform injection molding of a substrate <b>11</b> having grooves <b>11</b><i>a </i>and lands <b>11</b><i>b</i>. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the sputtering method is used to form, upon nearly the entire surface of the side of the substrate <b>11</b> on which the grooves <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the lands <b>11</b><i>b </i>are formed, a reflective film <b>34</b>, a fourth dielectric film <b>33</b>, an L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> and a third dielectric film <b>34</b> in this order, thereby forming an L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b>. Here, the phase of the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> is normally in an amorphous phase immediately after the sputtering is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, ultraviolet curable acrylic resin is spin-coated onto the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b>, and by shining an ultraviolet ray through a stamper <b>41</b> in the state with its surface covered with the stamper <b>41</b>, an intermediate layer <b>12</b> having grooves <b>12</b><i>a </i>and lands <b>12</b><i>b </i>is formed. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the sputtering method is used to form, upon nearly the entire surface of the intermediate layer <b>12</b> on which the grooves <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the lands <b>11</b><i>b </i>are formed, a second dielectric film <b>23</b>, an L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and a first dielectric film <b>21</b> in this order. Thus, an L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> is completed. Here, the phase of the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> is normally in an amorphous phase immediately after the sputtering is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, ultraviolet curable acrylic resin is spin-coated onto the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b>, and by shining an ultraviolet ray, a light transmission layer <b>13</b> is formed. This completes all film deposition steps. In this specification, the optical recording medium in the state with the film deposition steps complete may also be called the “optical recording medium precursor.”</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, the optical recording medium precursor is placed upon the rotary table of a laser irradiation apparatus (not shown) and rotated while being continuously irradiated with a rectangular laser beam having a shorter length in the direction along the track and a longer length in the direction perpendicular to the track. By shifting the irradiation position in the direction perpendicular to the track each time the optical recording medium precursor makes one revolution, the rectangular laser beam can be shined over nearly the entire surface of the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>. Thereby, the phase change material making up the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> is heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the crystallization temperature thereof and then cooled slowly, so the entire surface of the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> is put into the crystalline state, namely the unrecorded state. This process is called “an initializing process” in this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When the initializing process is completed, the optical recording medium <b>10</b> is competed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As described above, it is possible to record the desired digital data onto an optical recording medium <b>10</b> thus manufactured by aligning the focus of the laser beam during recording to either the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> or the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> to form recording marks. In addition, when data is recorded onto the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and/or L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> of the optical recording medium <b>10</b> in this manner, as described above, by aligning the focus of a laser beam set to playback power to either the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> or the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> and detecting the amount of light reflected, it is possible to play back the digital data thus recorded.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(</figref><i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>), in this embodiment, when data are to be recorded in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> or the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>, the power of a laser beam is modulated between three levels (three values) of a recording power (Pw), an erasing power (Pe) and a bottom power (Pb). The level of the recording power (Pw) is set to such a high level that the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> or the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> can be melted by the irradiation with the laser beam and is set to Pw0 when data are to be recorded in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and Pw1 when data are to be recorded in the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>. The level of the erasing power (Pe) is set to such a level that the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> or the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> can be heated to a temperature equal to or higher than a crystallization temperature thereof and is set to Pe0 with respect to data recorded in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and Pe1 with respect to data recorded in the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>. The level of the bottom power (Pb) is set to such a low level that the melted L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> or L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> can be cooled even if it is irradiated with the laser beam and is set to Pb0 when data are to be recorded in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and Pb1 when data are to be recorded in the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The details of the recording power (Pw0, Pw1), the erasing power (Pe0, Pe1) and the bottom power (Pb0, Pb1) will be described later. Hereinafter, a reference to simply the recording power (Pw), erasing power (Pe) or bottom power (Pb) means the recording power (Pw0), erasing power (Pe0) or bottom power (Pb0) when data are to be recorded in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and means the recording power (Pw1), erasing power (Pe1) or bottom power (Pb1) when data are to be recorded in the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>), in the case of recording a 2T signal in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> or the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>, the number of pulses is set to 1 and a cooling interval T<sub>cl </sub>is inserted thereafter. Here, the number of pulses is defined by the number of times the power of the laser beam is raised to the recording power (Pw). Further, in this specification, a first pulse is defined as a top pulse, a final pulse is defined as a last pulse and any pulse present between the top pulse and the last pulse is defined as a multi-pulse. However, in the case where the number of pulses is set to 1 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>), the pulse is the top pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At the cooling interval T<sub>cl</sub>, the power of a laser beam is set to the bottom power (Pb). In this manner, in this specification, a last interval during which the power of a laser beam is set to the bottom power (Pb) is defined as the cooling interval. Therefore, in the case of recording a 2T signal, the power of the laser beam is set to the erasing power (Pe) before the time t<sub>11</sub>, set to the recording power (Pw) during the period (T<sub>top</sub>) from the time t<sub>11 </sub>to the time t<sub>12</sub>, set to the bottom power (Pb) during the period (T<sub>cl</sub>) from the time t<sub>12 </sub>to the time t<sub>13 </sub>and set to the erasing power (Pe) after the time t<sub>13</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>b</i>), in the case of recording a 3T signal in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> or the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>, the number of pulses is set to 2 and a cooling interval is inserted thereafter. Therefore, in the case of recording a 3T signal, the power of the laser beam is set to the erasing power (Pe) before the time t<sub>21</sub>, set to the recording power (Pw) during the period (T<sub>top</sub>) from the time t<sub>21 </sub>to the time t<sub>22 </sub>and the period (T<sub>lp</sub>) from the time t<sub>23 </sub>to the time t<sub>24</sub>, set to the bottom power (Pb) during the period (T<sub>off</sub>) from the time t<sub>22 </sub>to the time t<sub>23 </sub>and the period (T<sub>cl</sub>) from the time t<sub>24 </sub>to the time t<sub>25 </sub>and set to the erasing power (Pe) after the time t<sub>25</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>c</i>), in the case of recording a 4T signal in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> or the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>, the number of pulses is set to 3 and a cooling interval is inserted thereafter. Therefore, in the case of recording a 4T signal, the power of the laser beam is set to the erasing power (Pe) before the time t<sub>31</sub>, set to the recording power (Pw) during the period (T<sub>top</sub>) from the time t<sub>31 </sub>to the time t<sub>32</sub>, the period (T<sub>mp</sub>) from the time t<sub>33 </sub>to the time t<sub>34 </sub>and the period (T<sub>lp</sub>) from the time t<sub>35 </sub>to the time t<sub>36</sub>, set to the bottom power (Pb) during the period (T<sub>off</sub>) from the time t<sub>32 </sub>to the time t<sub>33</sub>, the period (T<sub>off</sub>) from the time t<sub>34 </sub>to the time t<sub>35 </sub>and the period (T<sub>cl</sub>) from the time t<sub>36 </sub>to the time t<sub>37 </sub>and set to the erasing power (Pe) after the time t<sub>37</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>d</i>), in the case of recording any one of a 5T signal to an 8T signal in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> or the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>, the number of pulses is correspondingly set to one of 4 to 7 and a cooling interval T<sub>cl </sub>is inserted thereafter. Therefore, the number of multi-pulses is set to 2 to 5 correspondingly to a 5T signal to an 8T signal. In this case, the power of the laser beam is set to the recording power (Pw) during the period T<sub>top </sub>from the time t<sub>41 </sub>to the time t<sub>42</sub>, the periods T<sub>mp </sub>corresponding to those from the time t<sub>43 </sub>to the time t<sub>44</sub>, from the time t<sub>45 </sub>to the time t<sub>46 </sub>and the like and the period T<sub>lp </sub>from the time t<sub>47 </sub>to the time t<sub>48</sub>, set to the bottom power (Pb) during the off periods T<sub>off </sub>corresponding to those from the time t<sub>42 </sub>to the time t<sub>43</sub>, from the time t<sub>46 </sub>to the time t<sub>47 </sub>and the like and the cooling interval T<sub>cl </sub>from the time t<sub>48 </sub>to the time t<sub>49</sub>, and set to the erasing power (Pe) during the other periods.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As a result, at a region where one of recording signals among a 2T signal to a 8T signal is to be recorded, the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> or the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> melted by the irradiation with the laser beam of the recording power (Pw1) is quickly cooled during the cooling interval T<sub>cl </sub>and the phase thereof is changed to the amorphous phase. On the other hand, at the other regions, the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> or the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> is heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the crystallization temperature thereof and gradually cooled as the laser beam moves away, thereby being crystallized.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Here, in the case of recording data in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b>, each of the pulse width T<sub>top </sub>of the top pulse, the pulse width T<sub>mp </sub>of each of the multi-pulses, the pulse width T<sub>lp </sub>of the last pulse and the cooling interval T<sub>cl </sub>is set to be constant when any one of a 2T signal to a 8T signal is to be recorded. Hereinafter, the pulse width of the top pulse, the pulse width of each of the multi-pulses, the pulse width of the last pulse and the cooling interval in the case of recording data in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> are referred to as T<sub>top0</sub>, T<sub>mp0</sub>, T<sub>lpo </sub>and T<sub>cl0</sub>. Similarly, in the case of recording data in the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>, each of the pulse width T<sub>top </sub>of the top pulse, the pulse width T<sub>mp </sub>of each of the multi-pulses, the pulse width T<sub>lp </sub>of the last pulse and the cooling interval T<sub>cl </sub>is set to be constant when any one of a 2T signal to a 8T signal is to be recorded and, hereinafter, the pulse width of the top pulse, the pulse width of each of the multi-pulses, the pulse width of the last pulse and the cooling interval in the case of recording data in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> are referred to as T<sub>top1</sub>, T<sub>mp1</sub>, T<sub>lp1</sub>, and T<sub>cl1</sub>. However, reference to simply T<sub>top</sub>, T<sub>mp</sub>, T<sub>lp </sub>or T<sub>cl1 </sub>means T<sub>top0</sub>, T<sub>mp0</sub>, T<sub>lpo </sub>or T<sub>cl0 </sub>when data are to be recorded in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and means T<sub>top1</sub>, T<sub>mp1</sub>, T<sub>lp1 </sub>or T<sub>cl1 </sub>when data are to be recorded in the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As described above, the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> is provided with no reflective layer or only a very thin reflective film (3 to 15 nm) even if it includes a reflective film, while the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b> is provided with the reflective film <b>34</b> having a thickness of 20 to 200 nm. Therefore, the heat radiation characteristic of the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> is lower than that of the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b> and the phase change material contained in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> tends to be re-crystallized.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In view of this, in this embodiment, in order to prevent the phase change material contained in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> from being re-crystallized, the ratio (Pe0/Pw0) of the recording power (Pw0) and the erasing power (Pe0) when data are to be recorded in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> is set to be smaller than the ratio (Pe1/Pw1) of the recording power (Pw1) and the erasing power (Pe1) when data are to be recorded in the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>, thereby reducing thermal interference in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> in which only a low cooling effect is obtained to suppress the re-crystallization of the phase change material contained in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b>. In this case, if the ratio (Pe0/Pw0) is set too low with respect to the ratio (Pe1/Pw1), the erasing efficiency in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> becomes low. On the other hand, if the ratio (Pe0/Pw0) is set to be too close to the ratio (Pe1/Pw1), thermal interference cannot be reduced in a desired manner and it is difficult to prevent the phase change material contained in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> from being re-crystallized. Therefore, it is preferable to set the ratio (Pe0/Pw0) to be about 0.38 to 0.66 times the ratio (Pe1/Pw1), is more preferable to set it to be about 0.44 to 0.55 times the ratio (Pe1/Pw1) and is particularly preferable to set it to be about 0.50 times the ratio (Pe1/Pw1). If the relationship between the ratio (Pe0/Pw0) and the ratio (Pe1/Pw1) is set in this manner, the erasing efficiency can be maintained within a suitable range for practical use and thermal interference can be effectively reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">However, when data are to be recorded in the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>, since the laser beam is projected onto the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> via the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b>, the laser beam has been considerably attenuated when it reaches the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>. Therefore, in order to sufficiently melt the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>, it is necessary to set the recording power (Pw1) to be higher than the recording power (Pw0) used for recording data in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b>, namely, Pw0&lt;Pw1.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, in this embodiment, in order to prevent the phase change material contained in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> from being re-crystallized, the pulse width T<sub>top0 </sub>of the top pulse when data are to be recorded in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> is set to be shorter than the pulse width T<sub>top1 </sub>of the top pulse when data are to be recorded in the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b>, thereby further reducing thermal interference in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> in which only a low cooling effect is obtained to more effectively suppress the re-crystallization of the phase change material contained in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b>. In this case, if the pulse width T<sub>top0 </sub>is set too short with respect to the pulse width T<sub>top1</sub>, there is a risk of the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> not being heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point thereof.

If the relationship between the pulse width T<sub>top0 </sub>and the pulse width T<sub>top1 </sub>is set in this manner, it is possible to reliably heat the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> to a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point thereof and thermal interference can be effectively reduced.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Furthermore, in this embodiment, in order to prevent the phase change material contained in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> from being re-crystallized, the pulse width T<sub>mp0 </sub>of each of the multi-pulses when data are to be recorded in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> is set to be shorter than the pulse width T<sub>mp1 </sub>of each of the multi-pulses when data are to be recorded in the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b>, thereby further reducing thermal interference in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> in which only a low cooling effect is obtained to more effectively suppress the re-crystallization of the phase change material contained in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Moreover, in this embodiment, in order to prevent the phase change material contained in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> from being re-crystallized, the cooling interval T<sub>cl0 </sub>when data are to be recorded in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> is set to be longer than the cooling interval T<sub>cl1 </sub>when data are to be recorded in the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b>, thereby further reducing thermal interference in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> in which only a low cooling effect is obtained to more effectively suppress the re-crystallization of the phase change material contained in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b>.

Therefore, for example, when the user requests recording of data in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b>, the information recording apparatus sets the recording power, the erasing power and the bottom power to Pw0, Pe0 and Pb0, respectively, sets the pulse width of the top pulse, the pulse width of each of the multi-pulses, the pulse width of the last pulse and the cooling interval to T<sub>top0</sub>, T<sub>mp0</sub>, T<sub>lp0 </sub>and T<sub>cl0</sub>, respectively, and records data in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b>.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Further, in this embodiment, in the case of recording data in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> close to the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a</i>, since the pulse width T<sub>top0 </sub>of the top pulse, the pulse width T<sub>mp0 </sub>of each of the multi-pulses and the pulse width T<sub>lp0 </sub>of the last pulse are set to be shorter than the pulse width T<sub>top1 </sub>of the top pulse, the pulse width T<sub>mp1 </sub>of each of the multi-pulses and the pulse width T<sub>lp1 </sub>of the last pulse in the case of recording data in the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b> far from the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the cooling interval T<sub>cl0 </sub>is set to be longer than cooling interval T<sub>cl1 </sub>in the case of recording data in the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b> far from the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a</i>, it is possible to further reduce thermal interference in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> in which only a low cooling effect is obtained and it is possible to suppress the re-crystallization of the phase change material contained in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The present invention is in no way limited to the aforementioned embodiment, but rather various modifications are possible within the scope of the invention as recited in the claims, and these are naturally included within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">For example, in the preferred embodiment above, an optical recording medium having two recording layers was described, but the optical recording media to which the present invention applies are not limited thereto so the present invention is also applicable to optical recording media having three or more recording layers.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this case, when data are to be recorded in one of information recording layers other than an information recording layer farthest from the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a</i>, the ratio Pe/Pw can be set to be smaller than that when data are to be recorded in the information recording layer farthest from the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a</i>, for example, about 0.38 to 0.66 times the latter, and it is preferable to set the ratio Pe/Pw to decrease stepwise as the information recording layer in which data are to be recorded is closer to the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a</i>. Further, when data are to be recorded in one of information recording layers other than an information recording layer farthest from the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a</i>, the pulse width T<sub>top </sub>(and the pulse width T<sub>lp</sub>) can be set to be shorter than the pulse width T<sub>top </sub>when data are to be recorded in the information recording layer farthest from the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a</i>, for example, about 0.40 to 0.75 times the latter. Furthermore, when data are to be recorded in one of information recording layers other than an information recording layer farthest from the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a</i>, the pulse width T<sub>mp </sub>can be set to be shorter than that when data are to be recorded in the information recording layer farthest from the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a</i>, for example, about 0.48 to 0.58 times the latter. Moreover, when data are to be recorded in one of information recording layers other than an information recording layer farthest from the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a</i>, the cooling interval T<sub>cl </sub>can be set to be longer than that when data are to be recorded in the information recording layer farthest from the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a</i>, for example, about 1.25 to 2.00 times the latter. It is preferable to set the pulse width T<sub>top </sub>(and the pulse width T<sub>lp</sub>) and the pulse width T<sub>mp </sub>to decrease stepwise and set the cooling interval T<sub>cl </sub>to increase stepwise, as the information recording layer in which data are to be recorded is closer to the light incidence plane <b>13</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As described above, according to the present invention, recording marks having good shapes can be formed even when information in any one of the information recording layers is directly overwritten.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Here, the influence of thermal interference becomes pronounced as the wavelength of the laser beam used for recording data is shorter and the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens used for converging the laser beam is larger. Therefore, the present invention is particularly effective in the case where the quotient (λ/NA) of the wavelength λ of the laser beam used for reproducing data divided by the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens used to focus the laser beam is equal to or shorter than 700 nm, for example, where the numerical aperture NA is 0.7 (particularly, roughly 0.85) and the wavelength λ of the laser beam is about 200 to 450 nm.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Hereinafter, a Working Example will be described concretely.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Fabrication of an Optical Recording Medium <b>10</b></p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A stamper <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> was first used to perform injection molding of polycarbonate, thereby fabricating a substrate <b>11</b> having grooves <b>11</b><i>a </i>whose depth was 34 mm and whose pitch was 0.32 μm and a thickness of 1.1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Then, the substrate <b>11</b> was set in a sputtering apparatus (not shown) and an Ag alloy, a mixture of ZnS and SiO<sub>2 </sub>(mole ratio of 80:20), AgSbTeGe and a mixture of ZnS and SiO<sub>2 </sub>(mole ratio of 80:20) were sputtered in this order on nearly the entire surface of the side of the substrate <b>11</b> on which the grooves <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the lands <b>11</b><i>b </i>were formed, thereby forming an L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b>, namely, a reflective film <b>34</b> having a thickness of 100 nm, a fourth dielectric film <b>33</b> having a thickness of 15 nm, an L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b> having a thickness of 12 nm and a third dielectric film <b>31</b> having a thickness of 80 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Next, the substrate <b>11</b> formed with the L<b>1</b> layer was picked out from the sputtering apparatus and an ultraviolet ray curable resin was applied onto the third dielectric film <b>31</b> using a spin coating process. Further, an ultraviolet ray was shined on the surface of the spin-coated ultraviolet ray curable resin through a stamper <b>41</b> in the state with its surface covered with the stamper <b>41</b>, thereby forming an intermediate layer <b>12</b> having grooves <b>12</b><i>a </i>whose depth was 34 mm and whose pitch was 0.32 μm and a thickness of 20 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Then, the substrate <b>11</b> formed with the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b> and the intermediate layer <b>12</b> was set in the sputtering apparatus and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SbTe and a mixture of ZnS and SiO<sub>2 </sub>(mole ratio of 80:20) were sputtered in this order on nearly the entire surface of the side of the intermediate layer <b>12</b> on which the grooves <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the lands <b>12</b><i>b </i>are formed, thereby forming an L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b>, namely, a second dielectric film <b>23</b> having a thickness of 70 nm, an L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> having a thickness of 8 nm and a first dielectric film <b>21</b> having a thickness of 60 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further, after the substrate <b>11</b> formed with the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b>, the intermediate layer <b>12</b> and the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> was picked out from the sputtering apparatus, an ultraviolet ray curable resin was applied onto the first dielectric film <b>21</b> using a spin coating process and an ultraviolet ray was shined on the spin-coated ultraviolet ray curable resin, thereby forming a light transmission layer <b>13</b> having a thickness of 100 μm. Thus, an optical recording medium precursor was fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Next, the optical recording medium precursor was placed upon the rotary table of a laser irradiation apparatus (not shown) and rotated while being continuously irradiated with a rectangular laser beam having a shorter length in the direction along the track and a longer length in the direction perpendicular to the track. The irradiation position was shifted in the direction perpendicular to the track each time the optical recording medium precursor made one revolution, thereby crystallizing substantially the entire surface of the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b> and the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>. Thus, an optical recording medium <b>10</b> to be used in this Working Example was completed.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Setting the Power of a Laser Beam</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Data were recorded in the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> and the L<b>1</b> layer <b>30</b> of the thus fabricated optical recording medium <b>10</b> while the recording power (Pw) and the erasing power (Pe) are varied and jitter of the thus formed recording marks were measured. The jitter was calculated based on a formula: σ/Tw (%) where Tw was one clock period by measuring clock jitter using a time interval analyzer and obtaining the fluctuation σ the reproduced signal. Random signals in the (1,7) RLL modulation scheme were recorded as data by setting a clock frequency to 65.7 MHz (T=15.2 nsec) and a linear recording velocity to 5.7 m/sec. The wavelength of the laser beam used for recording data was 405 nm and the numerical aperture of an objective lens used for converging the laser beam was 0.85.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Further, in the case of recording data in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b>, T<sub>top0</sub>, T<sub>mp0</sub>, T<sub>lp0 </sub>and T<sub>cl0 </sub>were set to 0.2T, 0.2T, 0.2T and 1.0T, respectively, and in the case of recording data in the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>, T<sub>top1</sub>, T<sub>mp1</sub>, T<sub>lp1 </sub>and T<sub>cl1 </sub>were set to 0.4T, 0.4T, 0.5T and 0.8T, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The results of measurement of jitter of signals reproduced from the L<b>0</b> layer <b>20</b> are shown in Table 1.</p>

In this Working Example, since the pulse width T<sub>top </sub>of the top pulse and the pulse width T<sub>lp </sub>of the last pulse were set to be equal to each other, the pulse width T<sub>top </sub>of the top pulse will also be used to indicate the pulse width T<sub>lp </sub>of the last pulse below. Similarly to the above operation of setting the power of the laser beam, random signals in the (1,7) RLL modulation scheme were recorded as data by setting a clock frequency to 65.7 MHz (T=15.2 nsec) and a linear recording velocity to 5.7 m/sec. The wavelength of the laser beam used for recording data was 405 nm and the numerical aperture of the objective lens used for converging the laser beam was 0.85.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Further, when data were recorded in the L<b>0</b> recording film <b>22</b>, the recording power (Pw0), the erasing power (Pe0) and the bottom power (Pb0) were fixed to 5.0 mW, 1.5 mW and 0.1 mW, respectively, and when data were recorded in the L<b>1</b> recording film <b>32</b>, the recording power (Pw1), the erasing power (Pe1) and the bottom power (Pb1) were fixed to 10.0 mW, 6.0 mW and 0.1 mW, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">First, data were recorded with the pulse width T<sub>top </sub>of the top pulse and the pulse width T<sub>mp </sub>of each of the multi-pulses set to be equal to each other and varying the widths thereof while fixing the cooling interval T<sub>c,l</sub>, and jitter of the thus formed recording marks were measured.</p>
