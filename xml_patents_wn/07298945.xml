<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A polarization splitting grating coupler (PSGC) connects an optical signal from an optical element, such as a fiber, to an optoelectronic integrated circuit. The PSGC separates a received optical signal into two orthogonal polarizations and directs the two polarizations to separate waveguides on an integrated circuit. Each of the two separated polarizations can then be processed, as needed for a particular application, by the integrated circuit. A PSGC can also operate in the reverse direction, and couple two optical signals from an integrated circuit to two respective orthogonal polarizations of one optical output signal sent off chip to an optical fiber.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an apparatus for facilitating the connection of optical signals from optical fibers to optoelectronic integrated circuits.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Optical fibers have been widely used for the propagation of optical signals, especially to provide high speed communications links. Optical links using fiber optics have many advantages compared to electrical links: large bandwidth, high noise immunity, reduced power dissipation and minimal crosstalk. Optical signals carried by optical fibers are processed by a wide variety of optical and optoelectronic devices, including integrated circuits. Optical communications signals in optical fibers are typically in the 1.3 μm and 1.55 μm infrared wavelength bands. Optoelectronic integrated circuits made of silicon are highly desirable since they can be fabricated at low cost in the same foundries used to make VLSI integrated circuits. The optical properties of silicon are well suited for the transmission of optical signals, due to its transparency in the infrared wavelength bands of 1.3 μm and 1.55 μm and its high refractive index. As a result, low loss planar silicon optical waveguides have been successfully built in silicon integrated circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Optical signals traveling in optical fiber frequently need to be coupled to optoelectronic circuits and this can be done through a variety of known techniques and devices. Once an optical signal is on a chip, it can be processed either as an optical signal or converted to an electronic signal for further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The flat end of an optical fiber can be directly connected to the edge of an integrated circuit, so an optical signal can be coupled to a flat end of an integrated waveguide, but the fiber and the waveguide have different cross sectional geometries and are very different in size.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An optical signal in a fiber can be coupled to a waveguide through the top surface of an integrated circuit using a waveguide grating coupler, which is more effective as a fiber to chip connector. But there are difficulties in connecting an optical signal from a fiber to waveguide using a waveguide grating coupler, due to differences in cross sectional geometry, the number of optical modes and polarization characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A circular cross section with a core diameter of less than ten microns is typical for a single mode fiber (SMF). A nanophotonic waveguide is typically rectangular in cross section and can be substantially smaller than one micron in both cross sectional dimensions. A waveguide grating coupler can be designed to make a usable connection between a fiber and a waveguide, even with their inherently different cross sectional and size characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A typical SMF fiber can have a gaussian mode profile, with most of the power concentrated in the center of the light beam. A waveguide can be designed to support a gaussian type of mode profile with most of the power in the center of the waveguide. A waveguide grating coupler can provide a usable connection between a fiber and a waveguide, if they, have compatible gaussian mode profiles.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A waveguide grating coupler can be designed to connect a fiber to a waveguide, even when a fiber and a waveguide have very different cross sectional, size and mode profile characteristics. But connecting an optical signal from a fiber to a waveguide can cause significant signal loss and distortion due to the typically different and incompatible polarization characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An optical beam traveling in a single mode fiber (SMF) with circular cross section can typically be decomposed over an arbitrary basis of two orthogonal polarizations. These two orthogonal polarizations have approximately the same propagation constant and approximately the same group velocity in an optical fiber. Some refer to these two modes as a single mode with two polarization components. Within this discussion of the present invention, the two orthogonal polarizations are referred to as two modes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In theory and under ideal conditions, there is no exchange of power between the orthogonal polarizations in an SMF fiber. If an optical signal is directed into only one polarization, then all the power should remain in that polarization. But in actual practice, imperfections or strains in the fiber cause random power transfer between the two polarizations. The total power is thus divided between the two polarizations, and this may not be a problem in some applications, but in many situations, this can be a major problem. In some cases, there can be a great deal of fluctuation and power transfer between the two polarizations. Such random fluctuations can cause the power delivered on one polarization, to be close to zero, which would result in considerable loss of signal, if only that polarization is being received by a waveguide on a chip.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Similarly, two orthogonal polarization modes are present in standard forms of polarization maintaining fibers. These two modes have sufficiently different phase and group velocities to prevent light from coupling back and forth between the two modes. But a typical waveguide cannot usually propagate both of the modes, which would result in some signal loss in such a fiber to waveguide connection.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Typical integrated optical waveguides have a different type of modal configuration, where there are two types of modes: the transverse electric (TE) and the transverse magnetic (TM), which describe which field of the mode is oriented purely transversely to the direction of propagation. This is strictly true only for two dimensional ideal waveguides, however this naming convention is also used for real world three dimensional waveguides, which are only approximately TE or TM. Future references herein will make the common assumption that quasi-TE or quasi-TM modes are understood as TE or TM modes. A waveguide grating coupler can be designed to connect one polarization of an optical signal from a fiber to only one of the TE or TM modes. The other orthogonal polarization of the optical signal in the fiber would not be connected to the waveguide and any information transported by that polarization would be lost.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As a result of the differences in polarization characteristics between fibers and waveguides, it has been difficult to connect optical signals from one to the other.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">One embodiment of the present invention is a polarization splitting grating coupler (PSGC), which provides a means for connecting an optical signal from an optical fiber to an optoelectronic integrated circuit. The PSGC separates a received optical signal into two orthogonal polarizations and directs the two polarizations to separate waveguides on an integrated circuit. Each of the two separated polarizations can then be processed, as needed for a particular application, by the integrated circuit. A PSGC can also operate in the reverse direction, and couple two optical signals from an integrated circuit to two respective orthogonal polarizations of one optical output signal sent off chip to an optical fiber.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a top view of an integrated polarization splitting waveguide grating coupler, not to scale, according to one embodiment of the present invention. Polarization splitting grating coupler (herein “PSGC”) <b>100</b> is part of integrated circuit <b>101</b>, which has been built on substrate <b>130</b>. PSGC <b>100</b> connects light between optical element <b>105</b> and integrated circuit <b>101</b>.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The various waveguides in PSGC <b>100</b>, such as flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>, linear waveguide <b>113</b> and <b>123</b> and the waveguide portion of cross grating <b>102</b> are typically all fabricated of the same type of optical waveguide, which can include any one of the following: a strip loaded waveguide, a channel waveguide, a rib waveguide and a ridge waveguide. A strip loaded waveguide can be fabricated of a strip a slab and a low index transition layer between the lab. The cross grating <b>102</b> and PSGC <b>100</b> in their structure and operation can be understood as integrated waveguides disposed on substrate <b>130</b> and can be fabricated as one or a combination of the above mentioned types of waveguides.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The relatively small number of light scattering elements <b>106</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is merely illustrative and is not intended as limiting the number of light scattering elements in PSGC <b>100</b>. A PSGC <b>100</b> can typically have hundreds or even thousands of light scattering elements <b>106</b>. The light scattering elements <b>106</b> are positioned at the intersections of two sets of equally spaced rows <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>, which in preferred embodiments are approximately orthogonal or nearly orthogonal to each other.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In other embodiments, the characteristics of the light scattering elements that can vary include: width, height, length, spacing, depth, angle to the normal and index of refraction.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Elliptical rows <b>103</b> are positioned with their concave sides facing the flared waveguide <b>110</b>. The flared waveguide <b>110</b> includes curved sidewalls <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>.

Curved sidewalls <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> are curved to support the guided propagation of, non-planar, i.e., circularly cylindrical wavefronts in the flared waveguide <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Elliptical rows <b>104</b> are positioned with their concave sides facing flared waveguide <b>120</b>.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In other embodiments, the sides of elliptical rows <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> that face respective flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> can have other shapes, such as: convex, straight or irregular.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In preferred embodiments, the curved sidewalls <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> are substantially hyperbolically curved, and in alternate embodiments, the sidewalls can be defined by an elliptic curve, a parabolic curve, a quartic curve or other mathematical function</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The axis of propagation <b>114</b> of flared waveguide <b>110</b> is at an angle with respect to the axis of propagation <b>124</b> of flared waveguide <b>120</b>. In preferred embodiments, the angle between the flared waveguides is 90 degrees or close to 90 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are identical in shape and dimensions to each other and the following discussion with regard to waveguide <b>10</b> also pertains to waveguide <b>120</b>. Flared waveguide <b>110</b> can flare out at an arbitrary angle, but a flare angle Φ (half angle) is preferably selected to accommodate the in-plane “numerical aperture” of linear waveguide <b>113</b>. If this condition is substantially satisfied, the light in the evanescent field of the diverging beam can be substantially coupled into the optical element <b>105</b> or the waveguide <b>113</b> depending on the direction of propagation. The flare angle Φ may range from approximately 0 to 60° although the angle should not be limited to this range of values. In one preferred embodiment, the flare angle Φ is selected to be approximately 15 degrees to accommodate the numerical aperture of one type of linear waveguide <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> operate as focusing horns by focusing the respective two outputs of cross grating <b>102</b> to linear, waveguides <b>113</b> and <b>123</b>. Flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> can also be considered to operate as mode converters by converting the modal characteristics of the respective two, outputs of cross grating <b>102</b> to linear waveguides <b>113</b> and <b>123</b>. Flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> can also be considered to operate as spot size reducers by converting the relatively larger cross sectional size of the respective two outputs of cross grating <b>102</b> to the relatively smaller cross sectional size of the linear waveguides <b>113</b> and <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">PSGC <b>100</b> connects an optical element <b>105</b> and an optoelectronic integrated circuit <b>101</b> using three input/output ports: two in the plane of the substrate <b>130</b> and one at an angle to the plane of the substrate <b>130</b>. If an optical input is connected to the cross grating <b>102</b> from an off-chip optical element <b>105</b>, then two outputs are directed to the outputs of the cross grating <b>102</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the two outputs of the cross grating are connected to respective flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> and linear waveguides <b>113</b> and <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If two optical inputs are connected to the in-plane ports of cross grating <b>102</b> via linear waveguides <b>113</b> and <b>123</b> and flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>, then one optical output is propagated out of the cross grating <b>102</b> and off-chip to an optical element <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">PSGC <b>100</b> connects optical signal <b>140</b> from an optical element <b>105</b>, to optical devices, such as waveguides, on integrated circuit <b>101</b>. Waveguides <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> connect the outputs of PSGC <b>100</b> to waveguides or other optical devices, not shown, on integrated circuit <b>101</b>. Optical elements <b>105</b> can be optical sources, such as: a laser, a light emitting diode or another grating coupler, or transmission media such as an optical fiber or a lens. Optical elements can include photodetectors, which accept optical signals from PSGC <b>100</b> operating as an optical combiner. Optical signal <b>140</b> can be directed to the PSGC <b>100</b> at a normal or preferably nearly normal angle with respect to the integrated circuit <b>101</b>. An angle other than normal is preferred since it reduces the generation of reflections from the surface of integrated circuit <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A preferred angle for connecting an optical fiber to PSGC <b>100</b> is less than ten degrees to the normal. It is preferable to position an optical fiber in the near field of the light scattering elements. It is preferable to position light scattering elements within the Rayleigh range of the end of the optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">PSGC <b>100</b> provides a connection from an optical element <b>105</b>, such as an optical fiber to integrated waveguides on an optoelectronic integrated circuit. One of the difficulties in making such a connection is the difference in cross sectional geometry. An optical fiber typically has a diameter of less than 10 microns, while an integrated waveguide can have a rectangular cross section with a width and height measured in nanometers. A waveguide grating coupler, such as PSGC <b>100</b> can make the transition in shape and size.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Cross grating <b>102</b> accepts as input a light beam with plane wavefronts from an optical fiber. The light scattering elements <b>106</b> accept the light with plane wavefronts and convert the plane wavefronts to non-planar wavefronts, which are then directed to either of the two flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>, depending on their polarizations. The two flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> have flared and preferably hyperbolically curved sides to accommodate circularly cylindrical wave fronts of light propagating through them.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At the narrow ends of the flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>, the circularly cylindrical wavefronts of light are converted to planar wavefronts by the hyperbolically shaped sides and are output to the connected linear waveguides <b>113</b> and <b>123</b>. Linear waveguides <b>113</b> and <b>123</b> can be in the nanophotonic size range. The design of the cross grating <b>102</b>, especially the elliptical curvature of the rows of light scattering elements <b>106</b> can provide for the conversion of planar wavefronts to non-planar wavefronts.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The light in a typical SMF optical fiber can have a gaussian intensity profile and the design of the cross grating <b>102</b> can provide for accepting light with a gaussian intensity profile from a fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">PSGC <b>100</b> can also connect light traveling in the opposite direction, such as coupling two input light beams to two orthogonal polarizations into one optical signal sent to an optical fiber. Two in-phase orthogonal polarizations can be combined together into one output signal, without any destructive interference between the two polarizations. In such applications, flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> make the size transition from the typically much smaller waveguides on an integrated circuit. The flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> can propagate the light as non-planar wavefronts, such as circularly cylindrical wavefronts to the cross grating <b>102</b>, which can combine the two optical signals into one optical signal. Cross grating <b>102</b> can accept two input light beams with non-planar wavefronts and then output the combined light beam with planar wavefronts to an optical fiber. The design of the cross grating <b>102</b>, especially the arrangement of the light scattering elements <b>106</b> can provide for the conversion of non-planar wave fronts to planar wavefronts.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The light in a typical SMF fiber can have a gaussian intensity profile and the design of the cross grating <b>102</b> can provide for scattering light with a gaussian intensity profile up to an optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Optical signal <b>140</b> can couple to the grating coupler <b>102</b> at an azimuth of 45 degrees, so that the optical signal is spread out equally on both sides of the axis of symmetry <b>125</b> of the cross grating <b>102</b>.</p>

Two exemplary light scattering elements <b>601</b><i>a </i>and <b>601</b><i>b </i>are positioned longitudinally along a line <b>602</b> (in the x direction) along with other light scattering elements.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Above the cross grating <b>102</b>, optical element <b>105</b> is positioned at an angle θ to the normal <b>107</b>. These scatterers may correspond, for example, to the light scattering elements <b>106</b> of the cross grating <b>102</b> described previously. A normal line <b>107</b>, in the z direction, is perpendicular to the line <b>602</b> of scatterers <b>601</b><i>a, b. </i>As a wave <b>610</b> travels along the line <b>602</b>, it successively encounters the scatterers <b>601</b><i>a </i>and <b>601</b><i>b. </i>At each scatterer, portions of the wave <b>610</b> scatter in many directions. Two such scattered waves are depicted as parallel rays <b>611</b><i>a </i>and <b>611</b><i>b </i>directed at an angle θ with respect to the normal direction <b>107</b> and propagating in the direction of optical element <b>105</b>. As is generally understood, a difference in path length <b>612</b> between the two rays <b>611</b><i>a </i>and <b>611</b><i>b, </i>from their respective scatterers <b>601</b><i>a </i>and <b>601</b><i>b </i>to a given perpendicular to the rays, i.e., line <b>614</b>, can be expressed as D sin θ, where D is the spacing between the scatterers <b>601</b><i>a </i>and <b>601</b><i>b. </i>If the scatterers <b>601</b><i>a, b </i>are sources that emit waves in phase, a coherent wavefront is produced such as represented by the perpendicular line <b>614</b>. The dynamics of this wave are governed in part by the well known equation D sin θ=mλ, where λ is the wavelength, and m is an integer.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It is useful to consider the path length difference from a point before the scatterer <b>601</b><i>a </i>to the wavefront <b>614</b> of N<sub>CG</sub>D−N<sub>SD</sub>D sin θ, since the scattered waves originate from the same original wave <b>610</b>. In this equation, N<sub>CG </sub>and N<sub>SD </sub>correspond to the refractive indices of the cross grating <b>102</b> and of a typical silicon dioxide layer covering the cross grating, respectively. Thus, the condition N<sub>CG</sub>D−N<sub>SD</sub>D sin θ=mλ, is relevant to the coherent wavefronts produced by the cross grating <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the spacing D between two light scattering elements and the wavelength λ determines the angle θ of propagation of the resulting coherent wavefronts. The aforementioned condition for producing a coherent wavefront can also be expressed in terms of phases of the scattered waves as differing by multiples of 2 m π radians at the wavefront.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">It will be appreciated that the foregoing scattering principle can be extended into two dimensions, for example, along a direction (y) into the plane in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Thus, the scatterers <b>601</b><i>a, b </i>depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can represent a cross-sectional view of a cross grating described herein where many light scattering elements are disposed longitudinally along an axis of propagation of cross grating <b>102</b>. Furthermore, while the description above, in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> relates to a scattering process from the line <b>602</b>, coincident with the top of the substrate, the principle is also applicable to the reverse process where the scatterers receive the wave directed at an angle of θ and scatter light along the line <b>602</b>.</p>

Equation (8) provides the grating period, also known as the distance between the rows <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> of light scattering elements <b>106</b> of PSGC <b>100</b>. As discussed above, since |k<sub>FP</sub>| is very small, then equation (7) is a valid approximation, but the spatial positions of these vectors have to be considered, as is done graphically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. If vectors β<sub>1 </sub>and β<sub>2 </sub>are orthogonal, such as along the x and y axes, then vectors G<sub>1 </sub>and G<sub>2 </sub>are not orthogonal to each other. If vectors G<sub>1 </sub>and G<sub>2 </sub>are made orthogonal to each other, then vectors β<sub>1 </sub>and β<sub>2 </sub>are not orthogonal to each other.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Polarization selectivity by the PSGC <b>100</b> can be determined by an evaluation of coupling between the modes in the fiber and the modes in the waveguide. The k space selection rules, also known as the wavevector selection rules, discussed above can provide discrimination between the different modes in a waveguide by choosing the propagation constant to couple to. A “single mode” waveguide typically supports two modes known as the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM). The TE and TM modes usually have different propagation constants, β<sub>TE</sub>≠β<sub>TM </sub>so that a grating designed according to equation (3) will couple to only one of these modes.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Using only the k space selection rules, there is no polarization selectivity, since both fiber polarization modes E<sub>1 </sub>and E<sub>2 </sub>have the same wavevector k<sub>F </sub>and can thus couple to both waveguides β<sub>1 </sub>and β<sub>2 </sub>The fiber polarization basis can be chosen as:</p>

When the angle θ is small, E<sub>1 </sub>is primarily along x and E<sub>2 </sub>is primarily along y, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Thus modes E<sub>1 </sub>and E<sub>2 </sub>will primarily couple to waveguide modes of matching electric field orientation. Waveguide β<sub>1 </sub>is waveguide <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and it has its electric field in the x direction, and will primarily couple to mode E<sub>1</sub>. Waveguide β<sub>2 </sub>is waveguide <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and it has its electric field in the y direction, and will primarily couple to mode E<sub>2</sub>.
</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Polarization selectivity in this manner is not a selection rule, but a rule of thumb, and there could be some crosstalk. Crosstalk can occur for primarily two reasons. One reason is that each of the modes E<sub>1 </sub>and E<sub>2 </sub>are not exactly in alignment with the respective x and y axes. The second reason is that a guided wave in a waveguide grating is not a simple waveguide mode, but can be a much more complex Bloch wave with electric fields in all three directions.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> schematically illustrates an analysis of a section of PSGC <b>100</b>, which can be used to determine the shape of curved rows <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a PSGC <b>100</b>, with cross grating <b>102</b> with row <b>103</b><i>a, </i>flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> and linear waveguides <b>113</b> and <b>123</b>. For the purpose of simplifying the diagram, only one row <b>103</b><i>a </i>of the rows <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Lines <b>116</b> and <b>126</b> represent circularly cylindrical wavefronts of light propagating through respective flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. Lines <b>117</b> and <b>127</b> represent planar wavefronts of light propagating through respective linear waveguides <b>113</b> and <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Cross grating <b>102</b> can be designed to focus one polarization of light in-plane to linear waveguide <b>113</b> via flared waveguide <b>110</b>. The design of PSGC <b>100</b> can focus the other polarization of light to flared waveguide <b>120</b> and linear waveguide <b>123</b>. Cross grating <b>102</b> along with flared waveguides <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> can be considered as focusing horns.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The curvature of rows <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is defined by respective curved lines <b>118</b> and <b>128</b>. An analysis of a PSGC <b>100</b> with flared waveguide <b>110</b> can generate the set of curved lines <b>118</b>, which provide the shape of the curved rows <b>103</b> of PSGC <b>100</b>. Such an analysis is similarly applicable to flared waveguide <b>120</b>, curved lines <b>128</b> and curved rows <b>104</b>. The analysis presented is applicable to light propagating in either direction along either axis of propagation.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The phase map of the vector field expanding out of linear waveguide <b>113</b> from point A to point B is:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>φ<sub>1</sub>(<i>r</i>)=β<sub>1</sub><i>|r−r</i><sub>A</sub>|  (11)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where r is an in-plane position in the grating coupler. The phase map has to be matched to the fiber mode profile:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>φ<sub>F</sub>(<i>r</i>)=k<sub>FP</sub><i>·r</i>  (12)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

yielding the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>φ<sub>1</sub>(<i>r</i>)=φ<sub>F</sub>(<i>r</i>)+2<i>mπ</i>  (13)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where m is an integer. Equation 13 yields a family of ellipses with one of two foci at the input point A. A similar group of ellipses can be derived for the other waveguides <b>120</b> and <b>123</b>. A group of ellipses based on a pair of foci with the same shape and cross sectional proportions are known as concentric homothetic ellipses. Equation 13 can be used to generate such a group of ellipses.
</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Curved lines <b>118</b> are segments of equally spaced concentric homothetic elliptical curves as determined by equation 13 above for flared waveguide <b>110</b>. Similarly, curved lines <b>128</b> are segments of equally spaced concentric homothetic elliptical curves as determined by equation 13 above for flared waveguide <b>120</b>. The intersection of the two sets of curved lines <b>118</b> and <b>128</b> determines the location of light scattering elements <b>106</b>, which include rows <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>. The cross grating <b>102</b> is fabricated by placing light scattering elements such as pillars or by etching holes at the intersection of any two of the sets of ellipses, as shown, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The curved grating rows can be a source of crosstalk because the elliptical curvature of the phase fronts can introduce small components of the electric field of the in-plane waves.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In addition to the three main design parameters discussed above, there are other design parameters that one skilled in the art will be cognizant of and can be taken into consideration in the overall design of a PSGC. These parameters include: sizing and placement of the grating coupler with respect to the optical fiber in order to minimize the scattering of light out of any unilluminated light scattering elements which are not receiving light from the fiber. There is an optimum distance from the fiber core to the grating edge in both dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The periodicity and size and shape of the light scattering elements <b>106</b> can be modified to account for other phenomenon. Complex higher order effects, such as those caused by Bloch waves, can be considered to improve efficiency. The introduction of light scattering holes can decrease the effective index of the waveguide in the grating coupler, which can result in an increase in the grating period as compared to the grating period computed using the standard waveguide propagation constant β.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The shapes and sizes of the holes or pillars used as light scattering elements can be non-homogeneous, and they can be engineered to increase coupling efficiency and reduce crosstalk. Holes with different scattering cross sections in different directions, such as elongated holes, may be useful in some applications. The desired shape of the holes as compared to what is possible given the available fabrication techniques should also be taken into account during the design process. A square hole will typically be fabricated with rounded corners. A square hole with angular corners, could be made using a process such as optical proximity correction.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The eccentricity of the ellipses can be modified to account for the propagation constant mismatch between the grating and the flared waveguide. The curved rows can be designed as non-elliptic. The angle between the two flared waveguides can be non-orthogonal to try to reduce the crosstalk.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The layers within the structure of the grating coupler can be modified to increase efficiency. The waveguide in the grating coupler can include multiple high index layers. For example, the waveguide can include two high index layers, one of which is patterned while the other is not. Multiple layers can be patterned to form a multi-layered grating coupler.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBR) can also be fabricated below and/or above the grating coupler to enhance the efficiency of the grating. A single dielectric interface below the grating could block the absorption of some light into the substrate. A microcavity could improve the efficiency of a PSGC by using various elements such as: anti-reflection layers, buried mirrors, DBRs and other layers above and below the grating.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The design process for optical paths comprises construction of maskworks. Maskworks include shapes, layout, data structures, netlists, and alignment marks and other elements of the design which are typically stored as digital data on a computer system. In addition, these electronic representations of the designs are transferred to a set of many physical masks which are used during the fabrication of the components. These many masks are included in the definition of maskworks.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A particularly advantageous aspect of the present invention is that a PSGC can connect an optical signal to an optoelectronic integrated circuit. A PSGC splits the optical input signal into two orthogonal polarizations and connects the two polarizations to separate waveguides on the integrated circuit. The two polarizations can be processed by separate signal processing systems. These signal processing systems can process the two polarizations in an identical or non-identical manner, as needed for a particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Although the present invention has been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
