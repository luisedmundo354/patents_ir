<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a hybrid compressor for a vehicle where a vehicle engine is stopped when the vehicle is temporally stopped, a pulley, a motor and a compressor can be driven in independent from each other, and are connected to a sun gear, planetary carriers and a ring gear of a planetary gear. A rotational speed of the motor is adjusted by a controller, so that a rotational speed of the compressor is changed with respect to a rotational speed of the pulley. Accordingly, production cost of the hybrid compressor and the size thereof can be reduced, while a cooling function can be ensured even when the vehicle engine is stopped.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a hybrid compressor device suitable for a refrigerant cycle system mounted in an idling stop vehicle, where a vehicle engine is stopped when the vehicle is temporally stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, the market for an idling stop vehicle has been increased to save fuel consumption. In a case where a compressor is driven only by an engine of the vehicle, when the vehicle is temporarily stopped, its engine is stopped, so that the compressor, driven by the engine, is also stopped in a refrigerant cycle system. In order to overcome this problem, in a conventional hybrid compressor device disclosed in JP-A-2000-130323 (corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 6,375,436), driving force of the engine is transmitted to a pulley through a solenoid clutch, and one end of a rotational shaft of the compressor is connected to the pulley. Further, the other end of the rotational shaft of the compressor is connected to a motor. Accordingly, when the engine is stopped, the solenoid clutch is turned off, and the compressor is driven by the motor, so that the refrigerant cycle system can be operated regardless of the operation of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the hybrid compressor device requires the solenoid clutch for switching a driving source of the compressor between the engine in the operation of the engine, and the motor in the stop of the engine. Therefore, production cost of the hybrid compressor device is increased. Further, the compressor is operated by one of both the driving sources of the engine and the motor. Therefore, a discharge capacity of the compressor and a size thereof are need to be set based on a maximum heat load of the refrigerant cycle system in a driving force range of each driving source. For example, when a cool down mode (quickly cooling mode) is selected directly after the start of the vehicle in the summer, the heat load of the compressor becomes in maximum. Thus, the discharge capacity of the compressor and the size thereof are set so as to satisfy the maximum heat load, thereby increasing the size of the compressor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of the above problem, and its object is to provide a hybrid compressor device capable of reducing its production cost and its size, while ensuring cooling performance after the stop of a vehicle engine.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an another object of the present invention to provide a hybrid compressor device which has improved reliability while being produced in low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention, a hybrid compressor device includes a pulley rotated by a vehicle engine that is stopped when the vehicle is temporally stopped, a motor rotated by electric power from a battery of the vehicle, a compressor operated by driving force of the pulley and driving force of the motor, a transmission mechanism for changing and transmitting rotation force, and a control unit for adjusting the rotational speed of the motor. Here, the compressor is for compressing refrigerant in a refrigerant cycle system provided in the vehicle. The transmission mechanism is connected to a rotational shaft of the pulley, a rotational shaft of the motor and a rotational shaft of the compressor, so that a rotational speed of the pulley and a rotational speed of the motor are changed and transmitted to the compressor. In the hybrid compressor device, the pulley, the motor and the compressor are disposed to be rotatable independently. Further, the control unit changes the rotational speed of the compressor by adjusting the rotational speed of the motor with respect to the rotational speed of the pulley. Accordingly, the rotational speed of the compressor can be increased and decreased with respect to the rotational speed of the pulley, thereby changing a discharge capacity of the compressor. When the heat load of the refrigerant cycle system becomes maximum as in a cool down mode (quickly cooling mode), the discharge amount of the compressor can be effectively increased by increasing the rotational speed of the compressor than the rotation speed of the pulley by the adjustment of the rotation speed of the motor. Therefore, the size of the compressor and the discharge amount of the compressor can be set smaller. On the contrary, the discharge amount of the compressor can be reduced by reducing the rotational speed of the compressor than the rotation speed of the pulley by the adjustment of the rotation speed of the motor. Therefore, the compressor can quickly corresponds to the heat load of the refrigerant cycle system in a normal cooling mode after the end of the cool down mode. Furthermore, even when the engine is stopped due to idling stop and the rotational speed of the pulley becomes zero, the compressor can be operated by operating the motor. Therefore, even in the idling stop time, cooling operation can be maintained in low cost without using a solenoid clutch.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the transmission mechanism is a planetary gear including a sun gear, a planetary carrier and a ring gear, and the rotational shafts of the pulley, the motor and the compressor are connected to the sun gear, the planetary carrier and the ring gear of the planetary gear. Here, the connection between the rotation shafts of the pulley, the motor and the compressor, and the sun gear, the planetary carrier and the ring gear of the planetary gear can be arbitrarily changed. For example, the rotational shaft of the compressor is connected to the planetary carrier, the rotational shaft of the pulley is connected to the sun gear, and the rotational shaft of the motor is connected to the ring gear. Alternatively, the rotational shaft of the pulley is connected to the planetary carrier, the rotational shaft of the motor is connected to the sun gear, and the rotational shaft of the compressor is connected to the ring gear. Alternatively, the rotational shaft of the motor is connected to the sun gear, and the rotational shaft of the compressor is connected to the ring gear, and the rotation shaft of the compressor is connected to the planetary carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, a lock mechanism is provided for locking the rotational shaft of the motor when the motor is stopped. In this case, when the compressor is operated by driving force of the pulley while the motor is stopped, the control unit detects fluctuation of an induced voltage of the motor by detecting leakage fluctuation of magnetic flux of the motor generated due to rotation of the transmission mechanism connected to the compressor. Accordingly, when a trouble such as lock is caused in the compressor, the rotation of the transmission mechanism is reduced or becomes zero, so that the fluctuation of the induced voltage becomes smaller. Thus, an abnormal operation of the compressor can be readily detected by effectively using the fluctuation of the magnetic flux of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The hybrid compressor device of the present invention can be applied to a vehicle having an engine that is stopped in a predetermined running condition of the vehicle having a driving motor for driving the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">On the other hand, in a hybrid compressor where a compressor for compressing refrigerant in a refrigerant cycle system is operated by at least one of a driving unit and a motor, the compressor includes a suction area into which refrigerant before being compressed is introduced, a discharge area into which compressed refrigerant flows, and an oil separating unit for separating lubrication oil contained in refrigerant from the refrigerant and for storing the separated lubrication oil in the discharge area. Further, a transmission mechanism is disposed between the compressor and at least any one of the driving unit and the motor, for changing a rotational speed of the at least one of the driving unit and the motor, to be transmitted to the compressor. In addition, both of the motor and the transmission mechanism are disposed in a housing, an oil introducing passage is provided so that the lubrication oil stored in the discharge area is introduced into the housing through the oil introducing passage, and an inner space of the housing communicates with the suction area of the compressor through a communication passage.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, lubrication oil contained in refrigerant is separated from the refrigerant by the oil separating unit, and the separated lubrication oil is introduced into the housing. Further, the introduced lubrication oil is circulated from the housing into the suction area of the compressor. Therefore, lubrication oil can be always supplied to the transmission mechanism in the housing, thereby improving reliability of the transmission mechanism. Further, since the motor is also disposed in the housing, the motor can be cooled by the lubrication oil, thereby improving reliability of the motor. Because lubrication oil is separated from the refrigerant by the oil separating unit, refrigerant, circulated in the refrigerant cycle system, contains almost no lubrication oil. Therefore, lubrication oil is not adhered to a heat exchanger such as an evaporator provided in the refrigerant cycle system, thereby preventing heat-exchange efficiency of the heat exchanger from being reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the housing is disposed to accommodate the compressor, the motor and the transmission mechanism. Further, the housing has a suction port, from which the refrigerant is sucked into the compressor, at a side where the motor and the transmission mechanism are disposed. Therefore, the motor and the transmission mechanism can be effectively cooled by the refrigerant introduced into the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">More preferably, the oil introduction passage is a first decompression passage through which the discharge area of the compressor communicates with the inside of the housing while pressure is reduced from the discharge area of the compressor toward the inside of the housing, and the communication passage is a second decompression passage through which the inside of the housing communicates with the suction area of the compressor while the pressure is reduced from the inside of the housing toward the suction area of the compressor. Therefore, the lubrication oil can be smoothly circulated between the compressor and the housing.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the appended drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first embodiment of the present invention will be now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a hybrid compressor device <b>100</b> is typically applied to a refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b> mounted in an idling stop vehicle where a vehicle engine <b>10</b> is stopped when the vehicle is temporally stopped. The hybrid compressor device <b>100</b> includes a hybrid compressor <b>101</b> and a control unit <b>160</b>. The refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b> includes components such as a compressor <b>130</b>, a condenser <b>210</b>, an expansion valve <b>220</b> and an evaporator <b>230</b>. The components are sequentially connected by refrigerant piping <b>240</b>, to form a closed circuit. The compressor <b>130</b> constructs the hybrid compressor <b>101</b>. The compressor <b>130</b> compresses refrigerant, circulating in the refrigerant cycle system, to a high temperature and high pressure. The compressed refrigerant is condensed in the condenser <b>210</b>, and the condensed refrigerant is adiabatically expanded by the expansion valve <b>220</b>. The expanded refrigerant is evaporated in the evaporator <b>230</b>, and air passing the evaporator <b>230</b> is cooled due to the evaporation latent heat of the evaporated refrigerant. An evaporator temperature sensor <b>231</b> is disposed at a downstream air side of the evaporator <b>230</b>, for detecting a temperature of air cooled by the evaporator <b>230</b> (post-evaporator air temperature) Te. The post-evaporator air temperature Te is a representative value used for determining a heat load of the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The hybrid compressor <b>101</b> is mainly constructed by a pulley <b>110</b>, a motor <b>120</b> disposed in a housing <b>140</b> and the compressor <b>130</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pulley <b>110</b> includes a pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b> at a center of itself, and is rotatablly supported by the housing <b>140</b> through bearings <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>. Driving force of the engine <b>10</b> is transmitted to the pulley <b>110</b> through a belt <b>11</b>, so that the pulley <b>110</b> is rotated. The motor <b>120</b> includes magnets <b>122</b> constructing a rotor, and a stator <b>123</b>. The magnets <b>122</b> are fixed to an outer periphery of a ring gear <b>153</b> constructing a planetary gear <b>150</b> described later, and the stator <b>123</b> is fixed to an inner periphery of the housing <b>140</b>. The motor <b>120</b> has a motor rotational axis <b>121</b>, shown by a chain line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, at a center of the magnets <b>122</b>, that is, at a center of the ring gear <b>153</b>. Electric power is supplied to the stator <b>123</b> from a battery <b>20</b> as a power source, so that the magnets <b>122</b> are rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The compressor <b>130</b> is a fixed displacement compressor where a discharge capacity is fixed at a predetermined value. More specifically, the compressor <b>130</b> is a scroll type compressor. The compressor <b>130</b> includes a fixed scroll <b>136</b> fixed to the housing <b>140</b> and a movable scroll <b>135</b> revolved about a compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> by an eccentric shaft <b>134</b> provided at a top end of the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b>. The compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> is rotatablly supported by a partition plate <b>141</b> through a bearing <b>132</b> provided on the partition plate <b>141</b>. Refrigerant is sucked into the housing <b>140</b> from a suction port <b>143</b> provided on the housing <b>140</b>, and flows into a compressor chamber <b>138</b> through a through hole <b>144</b> provided in the partition plate <b>141</b>. Then, the refrigerant is compressed in the compression chamber <b>137</b>, and is discharged from a discharge port <b>139</b> through a discharge chamber <b>138</b>. Here, the sucked refrigerant contacts the motor <b>120</b>, so that the motor <b>120</b> is cooled by the sucked refrigerant, thereby improving durability of the motor <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the present invention, as described later, the compressor <b>130</b> is driven by operating both of the pulley <b>110</b> and the motor <b>120</b> in accordance with the heat load of the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b>. Therefore, the discharge capacity of the compressor <b>130</b> and its size can be smaller than those of a compressor driven by operation of any one of the pulley <b>110</b> and the motor <b>120</b>. For example, the discharge capacity and the size of the compressor <b>130</b> can be set at ½-⅓ of those of the compressor driven by the operation of one of the pulley <b>110</b> and the motor <b>120</b>. The pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b>, the motor <b>120</b>, and the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> are connected to the planetary gear <b>150</b> as a transmission mechanism disposed in the housing <b>140</b>. The rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b> and the rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b> are changed and transmitted to the compressor <b>130</b> by the planetary gear <b>150</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the planetary gear <b>150</b> includes a sun gear <b>151</b> at a center of itself, planetary carriers <b>152</b> connected to pinion gears <b>152</b><i>a, </i>and a ring gear <b>153</b> provided outside the pinion gears <b>152</b><i>a </i>at an opposite side of the sun gear <b>150</b>. Each pinion gear <b>152</b><i>a </i>rotates, and revolves about the sun gear <b>151</b>. When the planetary gear <b>150</b> is rotated, the following relationship is satisfied among the driving force of the sun gear <b>151</b> (sun gear torque), the driving force of the planetary carriers <b>152</b> (planetary carrier torque) and the driving force of the ring gear <b>153</b> (ring gear torque).
<br/>

</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Here, the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b> is connected to the sun gear <b>151</b>, and the motor <b>120</b> is connected to the ring gear <b>153</b>. The compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> is connected to the planetary carries <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The control unit <b>160</b> inputs an air-conditioning (A/C) requirement signal, a temperature signal from the evaporator temperature sensor <b>231</b>, an engine rotational speed signal and the like, and controls the operation of the motor <b>120</b> based on the input signals. Specifically, the control unit <b>160</b> changes a rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b> by changing electric power from the battery <b>20</b>. The control unit <b>160</b> determines a refrigerant discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> in accordance with the heat load of the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b>, based on a control characteristic shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. Similarly, the control unit <b>160</b> determined a rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> to ensure the refrigerant discharge amount, based on a control characteristic shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The discharge amount is defined by multiplying the discharge capacity per rotation of the compressor <b>130</b> and a the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> together. As the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> is increased, the discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> is increased. The control unit <b>160</b> determines the rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b> by using the rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b> and the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b>, based on the graph of the planetary gear <b>150</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, operation of the above structure according to the first embodiment will be described. In the hybrid compressor <b>101</b>, the compressor <b>130</b> is operated by the rotational driving force of the pulley <b>110</b>, and by the rotational driving force of the motor <b>120</b> through the planetary gear <b>150</b>. The rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b> is adjusted by the control unit <b>160</b>, and the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> is increased and decreased with respect to the rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the rotation speed of the sun gear <b>151</b>, the planetary carriers <b>152</b> and ring gear <b>153</b>. In the abscissa of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a position of the planetary carriers <b>152</b> is determined by a gear ratio of the ring gear <b>153</b> to the sun gear <b>151</b>. Here, the gear ratio is set at 0.5. The rotational speeds of the sun gear <b>151</b>, the planetary carriers <b>152</b> and ring gear <b>153</b> are located on a straight line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The control unit <b>160</b> calculates the rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b> from the rotational speed signal of the engine <b>10</b>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B, the control unit <b>160</b> determines the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> to ensure the discharge amount thereof required for the heat load of the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b>. In the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a straight line is drawn from the calculated rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b> to the determined rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b>. Since the rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b> is located on the extension line of the straight line, the rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b> is determined based on the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Thus, the motor <b>120</b> is operated at the determined rotational speed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, operational control of the motor <b>120</b> will be specifically described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In a cool down mode (quickly cooling mode) where the heat load of the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b> becomes maximum, as shown by the straight line A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b> is increased, so that the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> is made higher than the rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b>. Thus, the discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> is increased, and the compressor <b>130</b> can be operated to correspond to the high heat load of the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a normal cooling mode after the end of the cool down mode, the increased discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> is not required. Therefore, as shown by the straight line B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b> is reduced, and the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> is made lower than the rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b>. Thus, the discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> is reduced to a discharge amount required in the normal cooling mode.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the heat load of the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b> is further reduced and the discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> becomes surplus, the motor <b>120</b> is operated in an inverse rotational direction as shown by the straight line C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and the rotational speed of the compressor is set at zero. Thus, the discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> is set at zero. That is, the discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> can be set zero by adjusting the rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b> without using a solenoid clutch as in the conventional art. In this case, the motor <b>120</b> receives rotational force from the planetary carriers <b>152</b> connected to the compressor <b>130</b>, and is rotated in the inverse rotational direction to generate electric power.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the normal cooling mode, when the vehicle runs at a high speed, the motor <b>120</b> is operated in the inverse rotational direction as shown by the straight line D, and the compressor <b>130</b> is operated at the same rotational speed as in the straight line B. Thus, the normal cooling mode is maintained while ensuring the same discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> as in the normal cooling mode when the vehicle runs in a normal speed. In the cases of the straight lines C, D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the motor <b>120</b> is operated in the inverse rotational direction, and power generation can be performed, so that the battery <b>20</b> is charged. Further, when the idling stop vehicle is temporarily stopped and the engine <b>10</b> is stopped, that is, when the rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b> becomes zero as shown by the straight line E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the motor <b>120</b> is operated at an intermediate rotational speed level, and the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> is maintained at the same rotational speed as in the straight line B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Accordingly, even when the engine <b>10</b> stops, the required discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> is ensured, and operation of the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b> is continued.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, operational effects of the hybrid compressor device having the above structure will be described. The rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> can be increased and decreased with respect to the rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b> by the adjustment of the rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b>. Thus, the discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> is changed based on the rotation speed of the pulley <b>110</b> and the rotation speed of the motor <b>120</b>. Further, the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> can be increased than the rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b>, so that the discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> can be increased than the discharge amount of the compressor according to the prior art. Therefore, the size of the compressor <b>130</b> and the discharge amount thereof can be set smaller than those in the prior art. On the contrary, the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> can be reduced than the rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b>, so that the discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> can be reduced. Therefore, the compressor <b>130</b> can be operated to quickly correspond to the heat load of the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b> in the normal cooling mode after the end of the cool down mode. Furthermore, even when the engine <b>10</b> is stopped due to the idle stop and the rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b> becomes zero, the compressor <b>130</b> can be operated by operating the motor <b>120</b>. Therefore, in the idling stop time, the cooling mode can be maintained in low cost without using a solenoid clutch.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Since the rotational shaft <b>131</b> of the compressor <b>130</b> is connected to the planetary carriers <b>152</b>, both of the driving force of the pulley <b>110</b> and the driving force of the motor <b>120</b> can be applied to the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> through the planetary gear <b>150</b> including the sun gear <b>151</b>, the planetary carriers <b>152</b> and the ring gear <b>153</b>. Therefore, both of energy of the pulley <b>110</b> and energy of the motor <b>120</b> can be supplied to the compressor <b>130</b>, thereby reducing the load of the engine <b>10</b>. Further, the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b> is connected to the sun gear <b>151</b>, and the motor <b>120</b> is connected onto the ring gear <b>153</b>. Therefore, the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b>, the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> and the motor <b>120</b> can be connected to the sun gear <b>151</b>, the planetary carriers <b>152</b> and the ring gear <b>153</b>, respectively, with a simple structure. As a result, production cost of the hybrid compressor <b>101</b> can be reduced. Since the discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> can be changed by adjusting the rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b>, the hybrid compressor <b>101</b> can be constructed by using the fixed displacement compressor <b>130</b>, thereby further reducing production cost of the hybrid compressor <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the above-described first embodiment, the rotation axis <b>121</b> of the motor <b>120</b> is described. However, actually, the motor <b>120</b> is rotated by a motor shaft (<b>121</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The second embodiment of the present invention will be now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the second embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the planetary gear <b>150</b> is disposed in a rotor portion <b>120</b><i>a </i>of the motor <b>120</b>, and the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b>, the rotation shaft of the motor <b>120</b> and the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> are connected to the planetary gear <b>150</b>, as compared with the first embodiment. Further, a solenoid clutch <b>170</b> and a one-way clutch <b>180</b> are added to the hybrid compressor <b>101</b> as compared with the first embodiment. Here, a surface permanent-magnet motor (SP motor), where permanent magnets are provided on an outer periphery of the rotor portion <b>120</b><i>a, </i>is used as the motor <b>120</b>. The planetary gear <b>150</b> is disposed in a space of the rotor portion <b>120</b><i>a </i>on the inner periphery side. The pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b> is connected to the planetary carriers <b>152</b>, and the rotor portion <b>120</b><i>a </i>of the rotor <b>120</b> is connected to the sun gear <b>151</b>. The compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> is connected onto the ring gear <b>153</b>. The rotor portion <b>120</b><i>a </i>and the ring gear <b>153</b> can be rotated in independent from the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b> by a bearing <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The solenoid clutch <b>170</b> and the one-way clutch <b>180</b> are provided on the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b>. The solenoid clutch <b>170</b> is for interrupting the driving force from the engine <b>10</b> to the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b>, and is constructed by a coil <b>171</b> and a hub <b>172</b>. The hub <b>172</b> is fixed to the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b>. When the coil <b>171</b> is energized, the hub <b>172</b> contacts the pulley <b>110</b>, and the solenoid clutch <b>170</b> is turned on, so that the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b> is rotated together with the pulley <b>110</b>. When the coil <b>171</b> is de-energized, the hub <b>172</b> and the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b> are separated from the pulley <b>110</b>, and the solenoid clutch <b>170</b> is turned off. The on-off operation of the solenoid clutch <b>170</b> is performed by the control unit <b>160</b>. The one-way clutch <b>180</b> is disposed near the planetary gear <b>150</b> between the planetary gear <b>150</b> and the solenoid clutch <b>170</b> in the axial direction of the pulley rotation shaft <b>111</b>, and is fixed to the housing <b>140</b>. The one-way clutch <b>180</b> allows the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b> to rotate only in a regular rotational direction, and prevents the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b> from rotating in an inverse rotational direction.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, operation of the hybrid compressor having the above structure according to the second embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In the cool down mode where the maximum compression capacity is required, the solenoid clutch <b>170</b> is turned on, and the driving force of the pulley <b>110</b> is transmitted from the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b> to the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> through the planetary gear <b>150</b>. In this case, the compressor <b>130</b> is operated, and the one-way clutch <b>180</b> is in idling. At this time, as shown by the straight line F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the motor <b>120</b> is rotated in an inverse direction from the rotational direction of the pulley <b>110</b>, thereby increasing the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> than the rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b>, and increasing the discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b>. As the rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b> is increased, the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the normal cooling mode after the cool down mode, the solenoid clutch <b>170</b> is turned on, and the motor <b>120</b> and the compressor <b>130</b> are operated mainly by the driving force of the pulley <b>110</b> while the one-way clutch <b>180</b> is in idling. At this time, since the compressor <b>130</b> performs compression work, operation torque of the compressor <b>130</b> is larger than operation torque of the motor <b>120</b>. Therefore, as shown by the straight line G in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the compressor <b>130</b> is operated at a lower rotational speed than the pulley <b>110</b>, and the discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> is reduced. On the other hand, the motor <b>120</b> is operated as a generator at a higher rotational speed higher than the pulley <b>110</b>, and the motor <b>120</b> charges the battery <b>20</b>. Here, as the rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b> is reduced, the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the engine <b>10</b> is stopped, the solenoid clutch <b>170</b> is turned off, the compressor <b>130</b> is operated by the driving force of the motor <b>120</b>. At this time, as shown by the straight line H in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the motor <b>120</b> is operated in the inverse rotational direction, and driving force of the motor <b>120</b> is applied to the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b> in the inverse rotational direction. In this case, the pulley <b>110</b> is locked by the one-way clutch <b>180</b>, and the driving force of the motor <b>120</b> is transmitted to the compressor <b>130</b>. Here, as the rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b> is increased and reduced, the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> is increased and reduced. Even when the engine <b>10</b> is operated, if the solenoid clutch <b>170</b> is turned off, the compressor <b>130</b> can be operated by driving the motor <b>120</b> in the inverse rotational direction, as in the stop of the engine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As described above, since the SP motor is used as the motor <b>120</b>, the planetary gear <b>150</b> can be efficiently disposed in the space of the rotor <b>120</b><i>a, </i>thereby reducing the size of the hybrid compressor <b>101</b>. Further, the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b>, the motor <b>120</b> and the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> are connected to the planetary carriers <b>152</b>, sun gear <b>151</b> and the ring gear <b>153</b>, respectively. Therefore, a speed reduction ratio of the compressor <b>130</b> relative to the motor <b>120</b> can be made larger, and the motor <b>120</b> can have a high rotational speed and a low torque, thereby reducing the size of the hybrid compressor <b>101</b> and the production cost thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, in the second embodiment, the solenoid clutch <b>170</b> and the one-way clutch <b>180</b> are provided. Therefore, even when the engine <b>10</b> is operated, when the heat load of the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b> is low and sufficient electric power is stored in the battery <b>120</b>, the compressor <b>130</b> can be operated by the motor <b>120</b> using electric power from the battery <b>20</b>. Thus, an operational ratio of the engine <b>10</b> can be reduced, thereby improving fuel consumption performance. In the second embodiment, the other parts are similar to those of the above-described first embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The third embodiment of the present invention will be now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in the third embodiment, an another one-way clutch (second one-way clutch) <b>190</b> is added to the hybrid compressor <b>101</b>, as compared with the second embodiment. The second one-way clutch <b>190</b> allows the motor <b>120</b> to rotate only in the inverse rotational direction from the rotational direction of the pulley <b>110</b>. The second one-way clutch <b>190</b> is disposed between the rotor portion <b>120</b><i>a </i>of the motor <b>120</b> and the housing <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the third embodiment, the operation of the hybrid compressor <b>101</b> is different from the second embodiment in the normal cooling mode after the cool down mode, among the cool down mode, the normal cooling mode after the cool down mode, the cooling mode in the stop of the engine <b>10</b> and the cooling mode in the operation of the engine <b>10</b>. As shown by the straight line G in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG.9</figref> (corresponding to the straight line G in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG.7</figref>), in the above-described second embodiment, the motor <b>120</b> and the compressor <b>130</b> are operated by the driving force of the pulley <b>110</b>. However, in the third embodiment, as shown by the straight line I in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the motor <b>120</b> is locked and stopped by the second one-way clutch <b>190</b> in the rotational direction of the pulley <b>110</b>. Therefore, all of the driving force of the pulley <b>110</b> can be transmitted to the compressor <b>130</b>, and the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> is increased with respect to the rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Accordingly, driving force for driving the motor <b>120</b> to generate electric power is not required, the load of the engine <b>10</b> is reduced, thereby improving fuel consumption performance. Further, since the motor <b>120</b> does not perform power generation, control for the power generation is not required. Furthermore, electric power is not required from the motor <b>120</b> to the compressor <b>130</b>, and power consumption of the battery can be reduced. Even if the positions of the motor shaft <b>121</b> and the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> connected to the planetary gear <b>150</b> are interchanged from each other, the same operational effects as in the second embodiment can be obtained. In the third embodiment, the other parts are similar to those of the above-described second embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The fourth embodiment of the present invention will be now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>. In the fourth embodiment, an abnormal-operation detection function of the compressor <b>130</b> and a protection function for protecting the engine <b>10</b> are further added to the hybrid compressor device <b>100</b>, as compared with the third embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in the fourth embodiment, recess portions <b>150</b><i>a </i>and protrusion portions <b>150</b><i>b </i>are provided on an outer periphery of the ring gear <b>153</b> to which the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> is connected. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, magnetic flux is generated between the rotor portion <b>120</b><i>a </i>and the stator portion <b>123</b> to be turned. A very small amount of magnetic flux leaks to a radial inner side of the rotor portion <b>120</b><i>a, </i>and to a radial outer side of the stator <b>123</b>. When the ring gear <b>153</b> having the recess portions <b>150</b><i>a </i>and the protrusion portions <b>150</b><i>b </i>is rotated while the magnetic flux leaks, magnetic resistance is changed at the radial inner side of the rotor portion <b>120</b><i>a </i>every passing of the recess portions <b>150</b><i>a </i>and the protrusion portions <b>150</b><i>b. </i>Then, the magnetic flux is changed in the stator <b>123</b>. Thus, an induced voltage V defined by the following formula (1) is generated between both ends of one coil <b>123</b><i>a </i>of the stator <b>123</b>.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>V=N×dΦ/dt</i>  (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Here, N is the number of turns of the coil <b>123</b><i>a, </i>Φ is magnetic flux, and “t” is a time. The fluctuation of the induced voltage between both the ends of the coil <b>123</b><i>a </i>is calculated by a finite element method (FEM) analysis, and the calculated result is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the fluctuation of the induced voltage can be determined by the control unit <b>160</b> even at a lower operational state of the compressor <b>130</b>, such as the rotational speed of 2000 rpm, that is, the lower limit level in operation of the compressor <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, control operation for detecting the induced voltage V and for protecting the engine <b>10</b> will be described with reference to the flow diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. At step S<b>1</b>, it is determined whether or not an air conditioner (A/C) is turned on. That is, at step S<b>1</b>, it is determined whether or not an air-conditioning request signal is received. When the air conditioner is turned on, that is, when the determination at step S<b>1</b> is YES, it is determined at step S<b>2</b> whether or not the engine <b>10</b> is operated. When the determination at step S<b>1</b> is NO, the control program is ended, and is repeated from a start step. When it is determined at step S<b>2</b> that the engine <b>10</b> is operated, it is determined at step S<b>3</b> whether or not the compressor <b>130</b> is required to be operated only by the motor <b>120</b>. Here, this determination standard is set based on the heat load of the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b>. The heat load can be divided into a high heat load in the cool down mode, a middle heat load in the normal cooling mode and a low load, in this order. The compressor <b>130</b> is operated generally by the engine <b>10</b> and the motor <b>120</b> in the cool down mode, and is operated generally only by the engine <b>10</b> in the normal cooling mode. Further, the compressor <b>130</b> is operated generally only by the motor <b>120</b> in the low load mode.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When it is determined at step S<b>3</b> that the compressor <b>130</b> is not required to be driven only by the motor <b>120</b>, that is, when the determination at step S<b>3</b> is NO, a standby of the compressor <b>130</b> is maintained at step S<b>4</b>. Here, it is predetermined that the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> is increased and stabilized for 0.5 second, and the standby is maintained for 0.5 second at step S<b>4</b>. Then, at step S<b>5</b>, the solenoid clutch <b>170</b> is turned on. At step S<b>6</b>, it is determined whether or not the compressor <b>130</b> is required to be operated only by the engine <b>10</b>. When the heat load of the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b> is the heat load in the normal cooling mode, that is, when the it is determined at step S<b>6</b> that the compressor <b>130</b> is required to be operated only by the engine <b>10</b>, operation of the motor <b>120</b> is stopped at step S<b>7</b>. Specifically, as described in the third embodiment, when the motor <b>120</b> is locked by the second one-way clutch <b>190</b>, energization for the motor <b>120</b> is stopped. Then, the compressor <b>130</b> is operated only by the driving force of the engine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">At step S<b>8</b>, it is determined whether or not the fluctuation of the induced voltage V generated between both the ends of the coil <b>123</b><i>a </i>is larger than a predetermined value. When it is determined that the fluctuation of induced voltage is smaller than the predetermined value, it is determined that the compressor <b>130</b> connected to the ring gear <b>153</b> is not operated at an original rotational speed. At step S<b>9</b>, the solenoid clutch <b>170</b> is turned off. When it is determined at step S<b>8</b> that the fluctuation is larger than or equal to the predetermined value, it is determined that the compressor <b>130</b> is normally operated, and the compressor <b>130</b> is operated by the engine <b>10</b> as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">On the other hand, when it is determined at step S<b>2</b> that the operation of the engine <b>10</b> is stopped or it is determined at step S<b>3</b> that the compressor <b>130</b> is required to be operated only by the motor <b>120</b>, the solenoid clutch <b>170</b> is turned off at step S<b>10</b>. Then, at step S<b>11</b>, the motor <b>120</b> is turned on, and the compressor <b>130</b> is operated by the motor <b>120</b>. At step S<b>12</b>, operational abnormality (lock) of the compressor <b>130</b> is detected by a current value of the motor <b>120</b>. When it is determined at step S<b>6</b> that the compressor <b>130</b> is not required to be operated only by the engine <b>10</b>, the motor <b>120</b> is turned on at step S<b>11</b>, and the compressor <b>130</b> is operated by the engine <b>10</b> and the motor <b>120</b>. A step S<b>12</b>, the abnormality detection is performed by the current value supplied to the motor <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the compressor <b>130</b> is operated by the motor <b>120</b>, if the operational abnormality of the compressor <b>130</b> such as the lock thereof occurs, the operational abnormality can be detected by the current value of the motor <b>120</b> at step S<b>12</b>. In the fourth embodiment, when the operational abnormality of the compressor <b>130</b> such as the lock thereof occurs, the rotational speed of the ring gear <b>153</b> connected to the compressor <b>130</b> is reduced or becomes zero, and the induced voltage fluctuation of the coil <b>123</b><i>a </i>is reduced. Therefore, an another detection device is not required, and the operational abnormality of the compressor <b>130</b> can be detected by the induced voltage fluctuation. The compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> is connected to the ring gear <b>153</b> having the recess portions <b>153</b><i>a </i>and the protrusion portions <b>153</b><i>b </i>on the outer periphery of itself. Since the recess portions <b>153</b> and the protrusion portions <b>153</b><i>b </i>are disposed near the radial inner side of the magnets <b>122</b>, the induced voltage fluctuation can be readily detected. Further, when the detected fluctuation of the induced voltage is smaller than a standard value, that is, when the operational abnormality of the compressor <b>130</b> such as the lock thereof occurs, the solenoid clutch <b>170</b> is turned off. Therefore, it can be prevent an overload from being applied to the engine <b>10</b>, thereby protecting the engine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the motor <b>120</b> may be connected onto the ring gear <b>153</b>, and the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> may be connected to the sun gear <b>151</b>. In this case, the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> includes a second rotor portion <b>131</b><i>a, </i>and an outer periphery side of the second rotor portion <b>131</b><i>a </i>is located at an inner periphery side of the rotor portion <b>120</b><i>a. </i>Further, the second rotor portion <b>131</b><i>a </i>includes the recess portions <b>150</b><i>a </i>and the protrusion portions <b>150</b><i>b. </i>Even in this case, the same operational effect can be obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The compressor <b>130</b> is a fixed displacement compressor where a discharge capacity is set at a predetermined value. For example, the compressor <b>130</b> is a scroll type compressor. The compressor <b>130</b> includes a fixed scroll <b>344</b> forming a part of a compressor housing, and a movable scroll <b>343</b> rotated about the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> by the eccentric shaft <b>134</b> provided at the top end of the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b>. The fixed scroll <b>344</b> and the movable scroll <b>343</b> engage with each other, to form a suction chamber <b>347</b> at an outer peripheral side, and a compression chamber <b>345</b> at an inner side. The fixed scroll <b>344</b> is fixed to the motor housing <b>331</b> at an opposite side of the pulley <b>110</b>. The compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> is rotatablly supported by a protrusion wall <b>331</b><i>d </i>through a bearing <b>348</b> provided on the protrusion wall <b>331</b><i>d. </i>The protrusion wall <b>331</b><i>d </i>protrudes in parallel to the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> from a side wall <b>331</b><i>c </i>of the motor housing <b>331</b> at an opposite side of the pulley <b>110</b>. An end of the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> at an opposite side of the movable scroll <b>135</b> is connected to the ring gear <b>153</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Suction ports <b>372</b><i>a </i>are formed in the side wall <b>331</b><i>c </i>to face each other at two positions on the circumference, and are opened and closed by the movable scroll <b>343</b>. When one of the suction ports <b>372</b><i>a </i>is opened, the suction chamber <b>347</b> and an inner space of the motor housing <b>331</b> communicate with each other. By the suction ports <b>372</b><i>a, </i>the pressure in the motor housing <b>331</b> is made equal to the pressure in the suction chamber <b>347</b>, that is, sucked refrigerant pressure. In the present invention, the suction chamber <b>347</b> corresponds to a suction area of the compressor <b>130</b> in the present invention. An opening hole <b>331</b><i>e </i>is defined by the protrusion wall <b>331</b><i>d </i>at a lower side of the protrusion wall <b>331</b><i>d, </i>to be positioned at an upper side than the lowest end of the engagement portion between the pinion gear <b>152</b><i>a </i>and the ring gear <b>153</b> of the planetary gear <b>150</b>. Further, a storage wall <b>331</b><i>b </i>is provided for storing a predetermined amount of lubrication oil introduced into the motor housing <b>331</b>. Because the opening hole <b>331</b><i>e </i>is provided, lubrication oil can be stored in the storage wall <b>331</b><i>b </i>by the predetermined amount. The suction port <b>372</b><i>a </i>at the lower side is located lower than a top end of the storage wall <b>331</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A compressor cover <b>341</b> is fixed to the fixed scroll <b>344</b> at a side opposite to the motor housing <b>331</b>, and a space defined by the compressor cover <b>341</b> and the fixed scroll <b>344</b> is partitioned by a partition wall <b>341</b><i>c </i>into a discharge chamber <b>346</b> and an oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a. </i>The compression chamber <b>345</b> and a discharge chamber <b>346</b> communicate with each other through a discharge port <b>344</b><i>a </i>provided in the fixed scroll <b>344</b> at its center. A small-diameter discharge hole <b>341</b><i>d </i>is provided in the partition wall <b>341</b><i>c. </i>The discharge chamber <b>346</b> and the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a </i>communicate with each other through the discharge hole <b>341</b><i>d. </i>By the discharge hole <b>341</b><i>d, </i>the pressure in the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a </i>is made equal to refrigerant pressure in the discharge chamber <b>346</b>. In the present invention, the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a </i>corresponds to a discharge area of the compressor <b>130</b> in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a </i>is for storing therein lubrication oil separated from the refrigerant, and includes a centrifugal separator <b>360</b> for separating lubrication oil from refrigerant. The centrifugal separator <b>360</b> is a funnel-shaped member extending to a lower side. An outer periphery of a large diameter portion of the centrifugal separator <b>360</b> contacts an inner wall of the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a, </i>and is fixed thereto at a position higher than the discharge hole <b>341</b><i>d. </i>A discharge port <b>341</b><i>b </i>is provided in a side wall <b>341</b><i>e </i>of the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a </i>at a position higher than the centrifugal separator <b>360</b>, and is opened toward the condenser <b>210</b> of the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b>. The discharge port <b>341</b><i>b </i>and the discharge hole <b>341</b><i>d </i>communicate with each other through an inner space of the centrifugal separator <b>360</b>. A first decompression communication passage <b>371</b> is provided at a lower side position in the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a </i>and the motor housing <b>331</b>. The oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a </i>communicates with the inner space of the motor housing <b>331</b> through the first decompression communication passage <b>371</b> while the pressure in the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a </i>is reduced by the first decompression communication passage <b>371</b> using its orifice effect with a small diameter. In the present invention, the first decompression communication passage <b>371</b> corresponds to an oil introducing passage.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Next, operation of the hybrid compressor having the above structure according to the fifth embodiment will be described. As described in the first and second embodiments, the rotational speed of the compressor <b>130</b> is increased and decreased by adjusting the rotational speed of the motor <b>120</b> and the rotational direction of the motor <b>120</b> with respect to the rotational speed of the pulley <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">When the compressor <b>130</b> is operated, refrigerant is sucked into the motor housing <b>331</b> from the suction port <b>331</b><i>a, </i>and flows through around the motor <b>120</b> and around the planetary gear <b>150</b>. Then, the refrigerant flows into the suction chamber <b>347</b> from the suction port <b>372</b><i>a, </i>and is compressed by the scrolls <b>343</b>, <b>344</b> toward a center of the compression chamber <b>345</b>. The compressed refrigerant flows into the discharge chamber <b>346</b> from the discharge port <b>344</b><i>a, </i>and reaches the centrifugal separator <b>360</b> from the discharge hole <b>341</b><i>d. </i>At this time, a sliding portion such as the scrolls <b>135</b>, <b>344</b> and the eccentric shaft <b>134</b> is lubricated with lubrication oil contained in the refrigerant. The compressed refrigerant passes through the discharge hole <b>341</b><i>d </i>while its flow speed is increased, and spirally flows to a lower side of the centrifugal separator <b>360</b>. Since lubrication oil contained in refrigerant has larger specific gravity than refrigerant, the lubrication oil is separated from the refrigerant on the side wall of the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a, </i>and is stored in the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a </i>at the lower side. The refrigerant separated from the lubrication oil, flows through the inner space of the centrifugal separator <b>360</b>, and flows outside of the compressor <b>130</b> from the discharge port <b>341</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The lubrication oil, stored in the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a </i>at the lower side, is introduced into the motor housing <b>331</b> from the first decompression communication passage <b>371</b> due to the refrigerant pressure in the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a, </i>that is, compressed pressure of refrigerant. The introduced lubrication oil is stored in the motor housing <b>331</b> until the top end of the storage wall <b>331</b><i>b </i>in maximum, at lower side positions of the motor <b>120</b> and an engagement portion between the pinion gears <b>152</b><i>a </i>and the ring gear <b>153</b>. Further, since the pressure in the motor housing <b>331</b> is lower than that in the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a, </i>refrigerant contained in the lubrication oil is boiled in the motor housing <b>331</b>. Therefore, the lubrication oil, having the refrigerant, is splashed onto the motor <b>120</b> and the planetary gear <b>150</b>. When a liquid surface of the lubrication oil exceeds the top end of the storage wall <b>331</b><i>b, </i>the lubrication oil flows into the suction chamber <b>347</b> from the suction port <b>372</b><i>a </i>disposed lower than the top end of the storage wall <b>331</b><i>b, </i>so that the scrolls <b>135</b>, <b>344</b> and the eccentric shaft <b>134</b> are lubricated.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As described above, in the fifth embodiment, lubrication oil contained in refrigerant is separated from the refrigerant by the centrifugal separator <b>360</b> in the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a, </i>and the separated lubrication oil is introduced into the motor housing <b>331</b> through the first decompression communication passage <b>371</b>. Then, the introduced lubrication oil is circulated from the motor housing <b>331</b> into the suction chamber <b>347</b> of the compressor <b>130</b>. Therefore, lubrication oil can be always supplied to the planetary gear <b>150</b> in the motor housing <b>331</b>, thereby improving reliability of the planetary gear <b>150</b>. Further, since the motor <b>120</b> is also disposed in the motor housing <b>331</b>, the motor <b>120</b> can be cooled by the lubrication oil, thereby improving reliability of the motor <b>120</b>. Furthermore, the sizes of the planetary gear <b>150</b> and the motor <b>120</b> can be reduced in place of improving the reliability of the planetary gear <b>150</b> and the motor <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Since lubrication oil is separated from refrigerant by the centrifugal separator <b>360</b>, refrigerant, circulated in the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b>, contains almost no lubrication oil. Therefore, lubrication oil is not adhered to the heat exchanger such as the evaporator <b>230</b> provided in the refrigerant cycle system <b>200</b>, thereby preventing heat-exchange efficiency in the evaporator <b>230</b> from being reduced due to the lubrication oil. Further, since the suction port <b>331</b><i>a </i>is provided in the motor housing <b>331</b>, the planetary gear <b>150</b> and the motor <b>120</b> can be effectively cooled by low-temperature refrigerant before being compressed, thereby further improving the reliability of the motor <b>120</b> and the planetary gear <b>150</b>. Since the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a </i>and the space in the motor housing <b>331</b> communicate with each other through the first decompression communication passage <b>371</b>, the separated lubrication oil can be introduced into the motor housing <b>331</b> by the discharge pressure of refrigerant while it can prevent a large amount of the compressed refrigerant from returning to the motor housing <b>331</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Because the storage wall <b>331</b><i>b </i>is provided in the motor housing <b>331</b>, the liquid surface of lubrication oil is maintained higher than the engagement portion between the pinion gears <b>152</b><i>a </i>and the ring gear <b>153</b> of the planetary gear <b>150</b>. Therefore, the lubrication oil can be sufficiently supplied to the planetary gear <b>150</b> while the planetary gear <b>150</b> operates, and the planetary gear <b>150</b> can be surely lubricated. The lubrication oil, exceeding the top end of the storage wall <b>331</b><i>b, </i>is returned again to the compressor <b>130</b> through the suction port <b>372</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When the hybrid compressor <b>101</b> is not used, its temperature is reduced, and refrigerant is condensed in the motor housing <b>331</b> or in the compressor <b>130</b>. Then, lubrication oil in the motor housing <b>331</b> or the compressor <b>130</b> may be overflowed from the suction port <b>331</b><i>a </i>together with the condensed refrigerant. However, since the check valve <b>380</b> is provided in the suction port <b>331</b><i>a, </i>the lubrication oil is not overflowed from the suction port <b>331</b><i>a </i>together with the condensed refrigerant. Therefore, the hybrid compressor <b>101</b> is not restarted while the lubrication is not supplied to the planetary gear <b>150</b> and the compressor <b>130</b>, thereby preventing troubles of the hybrid compressor <b>101</b> such as the lock of the planetary gear <b>150</b> and the lock of the compressor <b>130</b> from being caused.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further, the compressor <b>130</b> is a scroll type compressor, and the motor housing <b>331</b> and the discharge port <b>341</b><i>b </i>are provided at both end sides of the compression portion of the compressor <b>130</b> in the axial direction of the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b>. Therefore, the hybrid compressor <b>101</b> can be readily constructed. Further, an another suction port directly communicating with the suction chamber <b>347</b> may be provided in addition to the suction port <b>331</b><i>a </i>provided in the motor housing <b>331</b>. When the suction port <b>331</b><i>a </i>is provided only in the motor housing <b>331</b>, refrigerant receives heat from the planetary gear <b>150</b> and the motor <b>120</b>. Therefore, the temperature of refrigerant is increased, refrigerant may be expanded. When the expanded refrigerant is compressed by the compressor <b>130</b>, compression efficiency of the compressor <b>130</b> is reduced. Therefore, if the suction ports <b>331</b><i>a </i>are provided on both of the motor housing <b>331</b> and a housing of the compressor <b>130</b>, it can restrict the refrigerant expansion while the planetary gear <b>150</b> and the motor <b>120</b> can be cooled. Even in the fifth embodiment, the rotation speed of the compressor <b>130</b> can be changed by the adjustment of the rotation speed of the motor <b>120</b> relative to the rotation speed of the pulley <b>110</b>. In the fifth embodiment, the compressor <b>130</b> can be also provided within the motor housing <b>331</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The sixth embodiment of the present invention will be now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In the sixth embodiment, a second decompression communication passage <b>372</b><i>b </i>is provided in place of the suction port <b>372</b><i>a </i>described in the fifth embodiment. Specifically, the suction port <b>331</b><i>a </i>is provided to directly communicate with the suction chamber <b>347</b>, but the suction port <b>372</b><i>a, </i>the storage wall <b>331</b><i>b </i>and the opening hole <b>331</b><i>e </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> are eliminated. That is, the space in the motor housing <b>331</b> is isolated from the compressor <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The second decompression communication passage <b>372</b><i>b </i>is provided as a communication passage for making the inner space of the motor housing <b>331</b> and the suction chamber <b>347</b> of the compressor <b>130</b> communicate with each other. The second decompression communication passage <b>372</b><i>b </i>has a predetermined small diameter as in the first decompression communication passage <b>371</b>. The inner space of the motor housing <b>331</b> is made to communicate with the suction chamber <b>347</b> through the second decompression communication passage <b>372</b><i>b </i>while the refrigerant pressure in the motor housing <b>331</b> is reduced in the second decompression communication passage <b>372</b><i>b </i>due to orifice effect. Thus, by the first and second decompression communication passages <b>371</b>, <b>372</b><i>b, </i>the pressure is reduced, in order, in the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a, </i>in the motor housing <b>331</b> and in the suction chamber <b>347</b>. That is, refrigerant in the motor housing <b>331</b> is set to a pressure between suction pressure in the suction chamber <b>347</b> and discharge pressure in the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a. </i>Accordingly, lubrication oil can be smoothly circulated in the oil storage chamber <b>341</b><i>a, </i>the motor housing <b>331</b> and the suction chamber <b>347</b>. Therefore, the lubrication oil can be sufficiently supplied to the planetary gear <b>150</b> and the motor <b>120</b>, so that the planetary gear <b>150</b> and the motor <b>120</b> are lubricated and cooled by the lubrication oil, thereby improving the reliability of the planetary gear <b>150</b> and the motor <b>120</b>. In the sixth embodiment, the other parts are similar to those of the above-described fifth embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Other Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">A planetary roller or a differential gear may be used in place of the planetary gear <b>150</b> in the above-described embodiments. Connection between the planetary gear <b>150</b> and the pulley <b>110</b>, the motor <b>120</b> and the compressor <b>130</b> may be performed by using other connection structure without being limited to the connection structure in the above-described embodiments. In the present invention, when the driving torque of the pulley <b>110</b> and the driving torque of the motor <b>120</b> are added, and the added driving torque is transmitted to the compressor <b>130</b>, the connection structure can be suitably changed. For example, the motor <b>120</b> can be connected to the sun gear <b>151</b>, and the pulley rotational shaft <b>111</b> can be connected to the ring gear <b>153</b>. In this case, the compressor rotational shaft <b>131</b> is connected to the planetary carriers <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the fixed displacement compressor, the compressor <b>130</b> may be a piston type compressor or a through vane type compressor without being limited to the scroll type compressor. Further, the compressor <b>130</b> may be a variable displacement compressor such as a swash plate type compressor, in place of the fixed displacement compressor. In this case, a variable discharge amount of the compressor <b>130</b> can be further increased. The present invention can be applied to a hybrid vehicle including a driving motor for driving the vehicle, where the vehicle engine <b>10</b> is stopped in a predetermined running condition of the vehicle.</p>
