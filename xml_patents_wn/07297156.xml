<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is generally related to endoluminal grafts and more particularly related to an endoluminal graft that is deployable in stages.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Endoluminal grafts, or endografts, are tubular grafts, widely used to repair body lumens, which are introduced to a lumen site in need of repair endoluminally from a distal lumen location. One application for such endografts is to exclude aneurysms in various body lumens. For procedural success, it is important to deploy the endograft such that its proximal and distal ends are fixed to relatively healthy tissue. It is also important to deploy the endograft such that it does not interfere with branch lumens or extend beyond the repair area. Thus, precise placement in the lumen is important. It is also desirable to maintain a flow of fluid during delivery and deployment of the endograft. Repair of aneurysms in high-pressure lumens, such as the thoracic aorta, is complicated by the force of fluid pressure acting on the endograft during deployment. This force makes it difficult to accurately place the endograft. Typically, the expansion of the endograft from a compressed configuration (in which it is delivered to the repair site) to its expanded deployed configuration is not instantaneous, but occurs longitudinally from one end of the graft to the other. As this occurs, fluid flow within the lumen causes a windsock effect, which applies longitudinal force to the endograft. This problem is exacerbated because typical endografts cannot be repositioned after deployment. It is believed that an endograft less susceptible to this problem would be useful.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention comprises an endograft with a plurality of separately expandable longitudinal portions. In one embodiment, the invention comprises a self-expanding stent scaffold, a covering affixed to the stent scaffold, and one or more releasable restraining members configured to constrain (i.e., resist expansion of) associated longitudinal portions of the stent scaffold along its length. The restraining members provide a flow channel to maintain fluid flow external the endograft and proximate the restraining members during deployment while allowing remaining portions of the stent scaffold to expand.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring now to the drawings, in which like reference numbers refer to like elements throughout, there is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> an endograft <b>103</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, endograft <b>103</b> comprises a stent scaffold <b>100</b> with a covering <b>120</b> attached to stent scaffold <b>100</b>. Covering <b>120</b> may be woven, knitted, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) or any combination thereof. Covering <b>120</b> may be attached to stent scaffold <b>100</b> by sutures, adhesive, rings, staples, or other connective elements. Stent scaffold <b>100</b> comprises woven stent members <b>101</b> that are wound in opposing helical directions. Stent members <b>101</b> may comprise a shape memory material, such as nitinol, making stent scaffold <b>100</b> self-expanding. Alternative self-expanding stent scaffold configurations (such as zig-zag stents, laser cut tubes, woven structures and the like), as well as balloon-expandable endograft configurations are contemplated within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref>, restraining members <b>200</b> extend longitudinally along stent scaffold <b>100</b> at diametrically opposed lines along the length of endograft <b>103</b>. These restraining members <b>200</b> are operatively associated with selected longitudinal portions of endograft <b>103</b>, such that they constrain (i.e., resist expansion of) the associated portions of endograft <b>103</b>. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 8</figref>, restraining members <b>200</b> are wires entwined in stent scaffold <b>100</b>. Restraining members <b>200</b> may alternatively extend over longitudinal portions of endograft <b>103</b> to constrain underlying portions of the endograft. As described hereafter, the restraining members alternatively may be tubes, sutures, or other structures suitable for constraining the associated lengthwise portions of stent scaffold <b>100</b>. In this embodiment, two restraining members are provided, to maintain stability of the endograft. Embodiments comprising one, three, four, or more restraining members are also contemplated within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">When endograft <b>103</b> is in its pre-deployed configuration (i.e., compressed for endoluminal delivery), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, restraining members <b>200</b> are releasable, meaning that they can be manipulated such that they cease to constrain stent scaffold <b>100</b>. Prior to release, restraining members <b>200</b> selectively constrain stent scaffold <b>100</b>, preventing the selectively constrained portions of stent scaffold <b>100</b> from expanding to a fully expanded configuration. This constraint is selective in that portions of endograft <b>103</b> not in direct contact with releasable restraining members <b>200</b> are not constrained by releasable restraining members <b>200</b> allowing those portions of endograft <b>103</b> to expand. Following release, restraining members <b>200</b> are removed from endograft <b>103</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, endograft <b>103</b>, together with releasable restraining members <b>200</b>, is loaded in a delivery system <b>300</b> in its compressed configuration ready for delivery endoluminally into a body lumen <b>1</b>. Delivery system <b>300</b> is sized to provide a fluid channel <b>10</b> between the loaded delivery system and the inner surface <b>2</b> of the body lumen <b>1</b> during endoluminal advancement of the delivery system. This fluid channel allows the endograft to be delivered without interrupting fluid flow in the body lumen.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Delivery system <b>300</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref>, comprises a catheter <b>310</b> for carrying endograft <b>103</b>. Catheter <b>310</b> is generally tubular in shape, having a longitudinal aperture for receiving a guide wire <b>340</b>. Catheter <b>310</b> is attached at its proximal end (i.e., the end first entering the body) to a nosecone <b>320</b>, which is tapered to assist in advancing delivery system <b>300</b> through body lumen <b>1</b>. A sheath <b>330</b> surrounds catheter <b>310</b> creating a cavity with an elongated torus shape for receiving endograft <b>103</b>. Sheath <b>330</b> is configured to be axially movable relative to catheter <b>310</b>, and more particularly to slide distally over endograft <b>103</b> carried on catheter <b>310</b>, when sheath <b>330</b> is withdrawn from the endograft. A stabilizer <b>350</b> (sometimes referred to as a pusher) surrounds catheter <b>310</b> distally of endograft <b>103</b> for pushing or holding endograft <b>103</b> while sheath <b>330</b> is axially withdrawn or moved distally relative to the endograft.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, sheath <b>330</b> constrains stent scaffold <b>100</b> (and covering <b>120</b> attached to scaffold <b>100</b>) in a collapsed or compressed configuration in which its diameter is smaller than the body lumen to be repaired. Restraining members <b>200</b> are associated with lengthwise or longitudinal portions of stent scaffold <b>100</b> as described above, and attached at their proximal end to nosecone <b>320</b>. At their distal end, restraining members <b>200</b> may extend inside sheath <b>330</b> to a control handle (not shown) which remains external the body. Tension is applied to restraining members <b>200</b> to provide the necessary restraining force to endograft <b>103</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, diametrically opposed restraining members <b>200</b> may be joined and pass or loop through an aperture in nosecone <b>320</b>, with both ends extending back to the handle (not shown). Tension is applied to restraining members <b>200</b> at the handle. In this configuration, restraining members <b>200</b> are released by releasing one end of the joined restraining members at the handle and removing the restraining members by pulling the other end of the joined restraining members back through the handle until the released end traverses the entire length of the delivery catheter <b>310</b> to nosecone <b>320</b> and back to the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Alternatively, each restraining member <b>200</b> may be secured in nosecone <b>320</b> with a bio-absorbable or dissolvable adhesive, such that restraining members <b>200</b> are released when the adhesive is absorbed or dissolved. In yet another alternative embodiment, joined restraining members may loop through catheter <b>310</b> proximal to endograft <b>103</b> with both ends extending distally to the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Restraining members <b>200</b> may alternatively extend between the stabilizer <b>350</b> and catheter <b>310</b>, then through a hypotube (not shown), which connects to stabilizer <b>350</b>, and catheter <b>310</b>. In an alternative configuration, catheter <b>310</b> may comprise a second and third longitudinal aperture (not shown), and restraining members <b>200</b> may extend through these apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, when endograft <b>103</b> is advanced to its desired location in body lumen <b>1</b>, it is partially deployed to a first deployed stage by withdrawing sheath <b>330</b> from endograft <b>103</b>. As sheath <b>330</b> is partially withdrawn, restraining members <b>200</b> constrain associated lengthwise portions of stent scaffold <b>100</b>, while circumferentially intermediate portions of stent scaffold <b>100</b> displaced circumferentially from restraining members <b>200</b> are allowed to self-expand. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, associated portions of stent scaffold <b>100</b> constrained by restraining members <b>200</b>, and portions of the covering <b>120</b> attached to those associated portions, remain in their compressed position. Intermediate or leaf portions of the stent scaffold <b>100</b> and portions of the covering <b>120</b> attached to those intermediate portions expand radially outward against inner surface <b>2</b> of body lumen <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As sheath <b>330</b> is withdrawn distally from the proximal end of endograft <b>103</b>, the distal end of endograft <b>103</b> is still constrained by sheath <b>330</b>. During this first partially deployed stage, the proximal end of endograft <b>103</b> takes on a leaf configuration between the radially constrained portions associated with restraining members <b>200</b>. A fluid channel <b>20</b> remains external to endograft <b>103</b> where it is constrained by restraining members <b>200</b>, while intermediate portions self-expand against inner surface <b>2</b> of body lumen <b>1</b>. While sheath <b>330</b> is being withdrawn, there is essentially no flow channel inside of endograft <b>103</b>, because the distal end of endograft <b>103</b> is still constrained by sheath <b>330</b>. However, flow channel <b>20</b>, external to endograft <b>103</b>, prevents pressure build-up on endograft <b>103</b> that would otherwise result from the wind sock effect.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">After sheath <b>330</b> is fully withdrawn from endograft <b>103</b>, the endograft expands to a second partially deployed configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. In this second partially deployed configuration, each of the plurality of restraining members <b>200</b> constrain self-expansion of an associated portion of stent scaffold <b>100</b> (and a portion of covering <b>120</b> attached to such associated portion) along the entire length of endograft <b>103</b>. Circumferentially intermediate portions of stent scaffold <b>100</b> (and portions of covering <b>120</b> attached to those intermediate portions) self-expand against inner surface <b>2</b> of body lumen <b>1</b>. In the second partially deployed configuration, fluid channel <b>20</b>, passing external endograft <b>103</b> and within body lumen <b>1</b>, extends between the intermediate or leaf portions of endograft <b>103</b> proximate restraining members <b>20</b> along the entire length of endograft <b>103</b>. Meanwhile, another fluid channel <b>21</b> is formed inside of endograft <b>103</b> in those leaf portions, when sheath <b>330</b> is fully withdrawn from the distal end of endograft <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">While endograft <b>103</b> is in the second partially deployed configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, small adjustments may be made to its position. Constraint of associated portions of stent scaffold <b>100</b> by restraining members <b>200</b> reduces the total outward force exerted by stent scaffold <b>100</b>. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the position of the partially deployed endograft is determined, such as by radiography. Then, the partially deployed endograft is repositioned as necessary by advancing or withdrawing catheter <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">After sheath <b>330</b> is fully withdrawn from endograft <b>103</b> and fluid flow through the partially deployed endograft is established, restraining members <b>200</b> are released, allowing endograft <b>103</b> to fully deploy. In this fully deployed configuration, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the portions of stent scaffold <b>100</b> previously constrained by restraining members <b>200</b> are allowed to self-expand against inner surface <b>2</b> of body lumen <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the fully deployed configuration of endograft <b>103</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, a fluid channel <b>30</b> extends through the inside of endograft <b>103</b>, and covering <b>120</b> is pressed against inner surface <b>2</b> of body lumen <b>1</b> sealing endograft <b>103</b> with body lumen <b>1</b> and preventing fluid flow between endograft <b>103</b> and inner surface <b>2</b> of body lumen <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Alternatively, restraining members <b>200</b> may be released, for example, by severing, absorbing or dissolving restraining member (<b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>) or by untying them from a restrained configuration or the like. In one specific alternative embodiment, restraining members <b>200</b> comprise stiff elements seated in nosecone <b>320</b> and attached to the proximal end of stabilizer <b>350</b>. Release of these restraining members is achieved by moving nosecone <b>320</b> proximally by proximal activation of catheter <b>310</b>. Upon proximal movement of nosecone <b>320</b> a sufficient distance to disengage restraining members <b>200</b> from stent members <b>101</b>, stent scaffold <b>100</b> is permitted to expand to its fully expanded configuration. Stabilizer <b>350</b> and attached restraining members <b>200</b> are then withdrawn, followed by nosecone <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another alternative embodiment, individual members of restraining members <b>200</b> may optionally be separately releasable to provide increased control of the self-expansion of stent scaffold <b>100</b>. This may be particularly advantageous where a larger number of restraining members <b>200</b> are provided and it is desirable to release them in a particular sequential order, due to lumen anatomy.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Barbs (not shown) may be provided on stent scaffold <b>100</b> for anchoring endograft <b>103</b> to lumen wall <b>1</b> when associated portions of stent scaffold <b>100</b> are released by the restraining members. If the placement of stent barbs is limited to areas adjacent restraining members <b>200</b>, the barbs may be prevented from contacting inner surface <b>2</b> of body lumen <b>1</b> while associated portions of the endograft are constrained. The barbs, however, are urged against inner surface <b>2</b> of body lumen <b>1</b> when restraining members <b>200</b> are released. This allows endograft <b>103</b> to be securely anchored in the fully deployed configuration, and to be repositioned in the partially deployed configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an alternative embodiment of the invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the restraining members are flexible tubes <b>201</b>. Flexible tubes <b>201</b> are sufficiently flexible to facilitate delivery through tortuous lumen anatomy but still provide some structural stiffness. The stiffness of flexible tubes <b>201</b> together with tension applied to flexible tubes <b>201</b> from the handle (not shown) may be used to provide the necessary restraining force to constrain associated longitudinal portions of endograft <b>199</b>. In this configuration, the delivery system is generally similar to the delivery system described above, except as noted below. Flexible tubes <b>201</b> extend between stabilizer <b>351</b> and sheath <b>331</b> over longitudinal portions of an endograft <b>199</b> and are seated in apertures <b>325</b> in a nosecone <b>321</b>. Alternatively, flexible tubes <b>201</b> may extend between catheter <b>311</b> and stabilizer <b>351</b>, over selected longitudinal portions of endograft <b>199</b>, and into apertures <b>325</b> in nosecone <b>321</b>. Flexible tubes <b>201</b> may be threaded at their distal end and apertures <b>325</b> may be threaded to removably receive flexible tubes <b>201</b> in threaded engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Endograft <b>199</b> may comprise a covered stent scaffold, a balloon-expandable stent-graft, or an unsupported graft. When sheath <b>331</b> is withdrawn from endograft <b>199</b>, flexible tubes <b>201</b>, supported by nosecone <b>321</b> and sheath <b>331</b> constrain associated longitudinal portions of endograft <b>199</b>, preventing them from expanding. Endograft <b>199</b> is disposed over catheter <b>311</b> and is radially constrained by a sheath <b>331</b> during endoluminal delivery. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in a partially deployed stage corresponding to the first partially deployed stage shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as sheath <b>331</b> is withdrawn distally over endograft <b>199</b>, portions of endograft <b>199</b> operatively associated with flexible tubes <b>201</b> remain in a compressed configuration, while circumferentially intermediate portions of endograft <b>199</b> are allowed to expand against inner surface <b>2</b> of body lumen <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In yet another alternative embodiment (not shown, but similar to the endograft and delivery system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> except as noted below), the restraining members may comprise rod-like elements extending over the endograft and slidably seated in bores formed in the nosecone. During first and second partially deployed stages, these rod-like elements are restrained by the sheath at their distal end and by the walls of the bores in the nosecone at their proximal end. The rod-like elements or tethers attached to the rod-like elements may extend back to the handle for actuation of the rod-like elements. After fluid flow is established within the partially deployed endograft, the rod-like elements are distally actuated to allow expansion of portions of the endograft previously underlying the rod-like elements and fully deploy the endograft.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thus, the present invention provides an apparatus and method for deploying an endograft in stages such that a fluid channel is maintained throughout deployment.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Although the invention is illustrated and described herein with reference to specific embodiments, the invention is not intended to be limited to the details shown. Rather, various modifications may be made in the details within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims and without departing from the invention.</p>
