<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates generally to methods and devices for stabilizing adjacent vertebral elements. More particularly, this disclosure relates to an expandable intervertebral implant.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A wide variety of configurations of intervertebral implants have been utilized for stabilizing adjacent vertebral elements and facilitating the development of bone union between the vertebral elements. In some configurations, the intervertebral implants are not adjustable by the surgeon during the surgical procedure. Therefore, the surgeon must choose the size that most closely matches the desired dimensions. Because these implants are of a pre-determined size and shape, the implant site must correspond to the implant configuration. This can require extensive site preparation to complete implantation. Extensive site preparation can compromise the success of the implantation procedure by causing excessive damage to the receiving vertebral elements. In addition, procedures requiring extensive site preparation can result in relatively long surgeries that may increase patient risk.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To address this problem, more recent intervertebral implants have been designed to expand from a first height to a second height. One such intervertebral implant is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,334. This implant includes a pair of shells that when assembled form an implant assembly. Teeth are formed on each shell so that the shells can be uni-directionally spaced apart.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, improvement has been sought with respect to implantation procedures and devices, generally to provide an expandable implant assembly that reduces the invasiveness of the procedure and to provide an expandable implant that is easily adjusted during an implantation procedure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One aspect of the present invention relates to an expandable intervertebral implant having a helical body and first and second securing pieces. The helical body has a first end and a second end, the first end of the helical body being connected to the first securing piece and the second end of the helical body being connected to the second securing piece. The implant further includes a locking arrangement configured to selectively lock the second securing piece in a rotational orientation relative to the first securing piece.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of expanding an expandable intervertebral implant. The method includes providing an implant having a helical body connected to a first end cap and a second end cap, and inserting the implant at an implant site. The implant is expanded by rotating the first end cap relative to the second end cap such that the helical body radially expands from a first configuration to a second configuration. The implant can be locked in the second configuration.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary aspects of the present disclosure that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, one embodiment of an expandable intervertebral implant <b>10</b> is shown, according to the principles of the present disclosure. The implant <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown inserted between two vertebral elements V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b> in a relaxed or non-expanded configuration. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the implant <b>10</b> is shown in an expanded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the implant <b>10</b> generally includes a helical body <b>12</b> having a first end <b>14</b> and a second end <b>16</b>. The first end <b>14</b> of the helical body <b>12</b> is attached to a first securing piece <b>18</b>, and the second end <b>16</b> is attached to a second securing piece <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the intervertebral implant <b>10</b> is configured to expand from a first dimension to a selected second dimension. The implant <b>10</b> includes a locking arrangement <b>50</b> that secures the implant at the selected second dimension. That is, the implant <b>10</b> is configured to permit expansion to, and be secured at, a selected one of a variety of second dimensions. Expansion is accomplished by rotating one end <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the helical body <b>12</b> in relation to the other end <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. As will be described hereinafter, the implant is also configured to permit contraction from the selected second dimension to a reduced dimension between the second dimension and the first dimension, or contraction back to the first dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the helical body <b>12</b> of the implant <b>10</b> is typically machined to provide the features herein disclosed. In one embodiment, the helical body is made of titanium, or other biocompatible materials such as stainless steel, graphite, carbon fiber materials, PEEK, nitinol, or various plastics and composites of the foregoing. Preferably, the helical body material provides the strength necessary to withstand forces from the intervertebral implant when positioned between two vertebral elements. In addition, the material preferably provides the flexibility to change shape or the dimension of the implant <b>10</b> by twisting or rotation, as will be described in greater detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first and second securing pieces <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> can also be machined, or may be molded to provide the features herein disclosed. Each of the pieces <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> may be made of the same material as the helical body <b>12</b>, or may be made of a different material than the helical body or one another. Representative materials typically include biocompatible materials such as stainless steel, graphite, carbon fiber materials, PEEK, nitinol, or various plastics and composites of the foregoing. In the preferred embodiment, the first and second securing pieces <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are made of titanium.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first securing piece <b>18</b> includes a first end cap structure <b>22</b>. The first end cap structure <b>22</b> has an inner surface <b>38</b> and an outer surface <b>42</b>. Retaining structure <b>46</b> is formed on the inner surface <b>38</b> of the first end cap structure <b>22</b>. Likewise, the second securing piece <b>20</b> includes a second end cap structure <b>26</b>. The second end cap structure has an inner surface <b>40</b> and an outer surface <b>44</b>. Retaining structure <b>66</b> is also formed on the inner surface <b>40</b> of the second end cap structure <b>26</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the retaining structures <b>46</b>, <b>66</b> of each of the first and second end cap structures <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> is a partial wall that projects axially outward from the inner surfaces <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> along a portion of the perimeter of the first and second end cap structures <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the helical body <b>12</b> includes a number of coils <b>62</b>, including first and second end coils <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>. An end <b>64</b> (only one shown) of each of the end coils <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> of the helical body <b>12</b> is permanently affixed to the retaining structures <b>46</b>, <b>66</b>. The ends <b>64</b> of the helical body <b>12</b> may be permanently affixed by welding or bonding the ends <b>64</b> to the retaining structures <b>46</b>, <b>66</b>. The end coils <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may also be affixed to the inner surfaces <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> of each of the first and second end cap structures <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>. In some embodiments, the ends <b>64</b> of each of the end coils <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> have a flattened surface (not shown) that abuts the inner surfaces <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> and is secured (e.g. by welding or bonding) to the end cap structures <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>. Alternatively, the helical body <b>12</b> may be otherwise permanently affixed or attached or temporarily affixed or attached to the first and second end cap structures <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> in accord with the principles disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the second end cap structure <b>26</b> is interconnected to a shaft <b>24</b>. The shaft <b>24</b> extends axially outward from the inner surface <b>40</b> of the second end cap structure <b>26</b>. The shaft has a first end <b>30</b> and a second end <b>32</b> that generally defines a longitudinal axis A-A of the implant <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The coils <b>62</b> of the helical body <b>12</b> turn about the shaft <b>24</b> along the longitudinal axis A-A of the implant <b>10</b>. The first end <b>30</b> of the shaft <b>24</b> is joined to the inner surface <b>40</b> of the second end cap structure <b>26</b>. The shaft <b>24</b> and second end cap structure <b>26</b> may be integrally formed or fastened together to form the overall second securing piece <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a bore <b>34</b> extends at least partially through the shaft <b>24</b>. The bore <b>34</b> includes a first region <b>80</b> and a second region <b>82</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the first region <b>80</b> of the bore <b>34</b> includes flats <b>84</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The flats <b>84</b> are configured for receipt of a tool (not shown), as will be described in greater detail hereinafter. The second region <b>82</b> of the bore <b>34</b> is threaded. In the illustrated embodiment, the threaded second region <b>82</b> extends through the second securing piece <b>20</b> to ease manufacture of the threaded second region <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the second end <b>32</b> of the shaft <b>24</b> of the second securing piece <b>20</b> includes shaped structure <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The first securing piece <b>20</b> includes interlock structure <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that corresponds to the shaped structure <b>36</b> of the shaft <b>24</b>. The shaped structure <b>26</b> and the interlock structure <b>28</b> prevent the first and second securing pieces <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> from rotating relative to one another. In the illustrated embodiment, the interlock structure <b>28</b> includes an aperture <b>56</b> formed in the first end cap structure <b>22</b>. The aperture <b>56</b> corresponds to the shaped structure <b>36</b> of the shaft <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The interlock structure <b>28</b> (i.e. the aperture <b>56</b>) and the shaped structure <b>36</b> of the shaft <b>24</b> define the locking arrangement <b>50</b> of the implant. In particular, the shaped structure <b>26</b> of the shaft <b>24</b> mates with the interlock structure <b>28</b> of the first end cap structure <b>22</b> to prevent the first and second securing pieces <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> from rotating or turning relative to one another. In the illustrated embodiment, the shaped structure <b>36</b> of the shaft <b>24</b> is a hex-shaped construction that corresponds to a hex-shape construction of the interlock structure <b>28</b>. When mated or coupled, the first and second securing pieces <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are in a fixed relation to one another. In alternative embodiments, the interlock structure <b>28</b> can include other differently shaped mating structures that prevent the first and second securing pieces from rotating relative to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the illustrated embodiment, the locking arrangement <b>50</b> also includes a fastener <b>58</b>, such as a setscrew, configured to secure the first and second securing pieces <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> in a relative axial position. The setscrew <b>58</b> has a first guiding portion <b>86</b> and a second threaded portion <b>88</b>. The guiding portion <b>86</b> is sized to fit within the first region of the bore <b>34</b> and guide the setscrew <b>58</b> during assembly or use. That is, the diameter of the guiding portion <b>86</b> fits within the flats <b>84</b> of the first region <b>80</b> to coaxially align the setscrew <b>58</b> with the shaft <b>24</b>. The second threaded portion <b>88</b> of the setscrew is configured to engage the second threaded region <b>82</b> of the bore <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the second threaded portion <b>88</b> of the setscrew <b>58</b> is engaged with the second threaded region <b>82</b> of the shaft <b>24</b>, a head <b>78</b> of the setscrew abuts or seats against the outer surface <b>42</b> of the first securing piece <b>18</b>. The head <b>78</b> maintains the relative axial position of the first and second securing pieces <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. A socket <b>90</b> is formed in the head <b>78</b> of the setscrew <b>58</b>. The socket <b>90</b> is configured to receive of a tool, such as an allen wrench, for threading and un-threading the setscrew, as will be discussed hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when assembled and in a relaxed configuration, the intervertebral implant <b>10</b> generally has an axial length L and a first outer diameter OD<b>1</b>. The length L of the implant <b>10</b> extends from the outer surface <b>42</b> of the first securing piece <b>18</b> to the outer surface <b>44</b> of the second securing piece <b>20</b>. The length L of the external member is preferably between 0.5 and 1.2 inches; more preferably the length L is between 0.7 and 0.9 inches; and most preferably the length L is about 0.8 inches. The length of the intervertebral implant <b>10</b> generally corresponds to the size of a patient's spinal anatomy.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the illustrated embodiment, the length L of the implant <b>10</b> is the same in both the non-expanded configuration and the expanded configuration. In alternative embodiments, it is contemplated that the axial length L of the implant can be adjustable. For example, the axial positioning of the first securing member <b>18</b> can be selectively positionable relative to the second securing member <b>20</b> by lengthening or shortening a setscrew configuration, or by varying the engagement depth of a setscrew.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The outer diameter OD of the implant is configured to expand (or contract from an expanded configuration) depending upon the direction of rotation of the first securing piece <b>18</b> relative to the second securing piece <b>20</b>. That is, with the end coils <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> of the helical body <b>12</b> permanently affixed to the first and second securing pieces <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, rotation of one securing piece relative to the other causes the coils of the helical body to “wind” or “unwind.”</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a relaxed or non-expanded configuration, the outer diameter OD<b>1</b> of the implant <b>10</b> is typically between 6 and 20 mm. The size depends upon the particular needs of the patient and the application, that is, the desired distraction height between the two vertebral elements V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>. In an expanded configuration, the outer diameter OD<b>2</b> expands by rotation of the helical body <b>12</b> in a direction that unwinds the helical body <b>12</b>. In the expanded configuration, the outer diameter OD<b>2</b> of the implant is preferably between 1 and 5 mm greater than the outer diameter OD<b>1</b> of the implant in the non-expanded configuration. Accordingly, the two vertebral elements V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b> may be spatially separated, in the direction of expansion represented by arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a distance generally equivalent to between 1 and 5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each of the outer diameters OD<b>1</b>, OD<b>2</b> in the non-expanded and expanded configuration is generally defined as the outer diameter at a central region <b>60</b> of the implant. As can be understood, the outer diameter OD<b>2</b> may, in some expanded configurations, be reduced at the first and second ends <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the helical body <b>12</b>, in comparison to the central region <b>60</b>, as the ends <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are permanently affixed to the caps.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the helical body <b>12</b> of the expandable implant <b>10</b> defines open regions <b>48</b> between the coils <b>62</b> of the helical body <b>12</b>. The open regions <b>48</b> encourage bone growth through the implant, and accordingly between the vertebral elements V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). In particular, the opening regions <b>48</b> provide access to the interior area <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the implant <b>10</b>. When the implant <b>10</b> has been inserted and expanded between two vertebral elements V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), bone growth material can be packed within the interior area of the implant through the open regions <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is contemplated that a particular open region arrangement can be configured for use in a particular application by providing helical bodies having different coil configurations. For example, the helical body <b>12</b> may include coils <b>62</b> having different cross-sectional shapes, such as a circular, square, or rectangular shape. In addition, the coils may be more compactly designed, i.e. includes more coils per length L, or more openly designed, i.e. includes less coils per length L. In the illustrated embodiment, the implant <b>10</b> has between 5 and 8 coils per inch of length L.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the implant <b>10</b> includes an implant handling arrangement <b>70</b>. The implant handling arrangement <b>70</b> is configured so that the implant <b>10</b> can be handled and manipulated by a surgical tool (not shown) during a surgical procedure. The implant handling arrangement <b>70</b> of the illustrated embodiment is formed in the first end cap structure <b>22</b> of the first securing piece <b>18</b>. The handling arrangement <b>70</b> includes first and second holes <b>72</b> sized to receive a distal end of the surgical tool.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In use, the intervertebral implant <b>10</b> is used to space and separate two vertebral elements V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>. The implantation procedure generally includes first selecting an implant <b>10</b> having the desired size and configuration. The selected implant is then grasped with the surgical tool via the implant handling arrangement <b>70</b>. At this point in the procedure, the helical body <b>12</b> of the selected implant <b>10</b> is in the relaxed or non-expanded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The implant <b>10</b> is inserted between the two vertebral elements V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b> in the relaxed configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The surgical tool is removed from the handling arrangement <b>70</b>, and the setscrew <b>58</b> is removed from the shaft <b>24</b>, for example, by applying an alien wrench to the socket <b>90</b> of the setscrew <b>58</b>. The user then inserts another tool (e.g. a second allen wrench) into the first region <b>80</b> of the bore <b>34</b> of the shaft <b>24</b>. The flats <b>84</b> of the first region <b>80</b> engage the wrench so that the second securing piece <b>20</b> can be held in a stationary position and prevented from rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The surgical tool is then re-attached to the handling arrangement <b>70</b> of the first securing piece <b>18</b> by inserting the tool into the holes <b>72</b> of the handling arrangement <b>70</b>. The helical body <b>12</b> preferably has a number of coils <b>62</b> configured such that the first securing piece <b>18</b> may be axially pushed toward the second securing piece <b>20</b> by the surgical tool. While the user is pushing the first securing piece <b>18</b> and compressing the helical body <b>12</b>, the user also maintains the second securing piece <b>20</b> in the stationary position with the wrench, which is engaged with the flats <b>84</b> of the shaft <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the shaft <b>24</b> includes an annular recess <b>54</b>. The annular recess <b>54</b> provides clearance such that the interlocking structure <b>28</b> of the first end cap structure <b>22</b> disengages from the shaped structure <b>36</b> of the shaft <b>24</b> when the interlocking structure <b>28</b> is pushed toward the second end cap structure <b>26</b> and positioned about the annular recess <b>54</b> of the shaft <b>24</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the first securing piece <b>18</b> may be axially pulled in a direction away from the second securing piece <b>20</b> such that the interlock structure <b>28</b> of the first end cap structure <b>22</b> disengages from the shaped structure <b>36</b> of the shaft <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the interlock structure <b>28</b> of the first securing piece <b>18</b> is disengaged from the shaped structure <b>36</b> of the shaft, the first securing piece <b>18</b> can then be rotated (un-wound), by the surgical tool, relative to the stationary second securing piece <b>20</b> to expand the outer diameter of the helical body <b>12</b>. In particular, the first securing piece <b>18</b> can be angularly rotated, or un-wound, relative to the second securing piece <b>20</b>, to a selected one of a plurality of rotational orientations. In the illustrated embodiment, each of the rotational orientations is incremental in that the degree of rotation is determined by the shaped structure <b>36</b> of the shaft <b>24</b> and interlock structure <b>28</b> of the first securing piece <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, the hex-shape of the shaped structure <b>36</b> and interlock structure <b>28</b> permit the securing pieces <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> to rotate and lock at 60-degree increments relative to one another. Other shaft <b>24</b> and interlock structure <b>28</b> configurations can be used to provide different increments of angular rotation. It is to be understood, that depending upon the helical body configuration, the securing pieces <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> may be configured to rotate relative to one another to a maximum angular position that is less than, equal to, or greater than 360 degrees from an initial angular position defined by the relaxed configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the desired expanded configuration of the implant <b>10</b> is achieved by rotation of the first securing piece <b>18</b> relative to the second securing piece <b>20</b>, the interlock structure <b>28</b> is re-engaged with the shaped structure <b>36</b> of the shaft <b>24</b> to lock the relative positions of the first and second securing pieces <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. The setscrew <b>58</b> is then reengaged with the shaft <b>24</b> to axially secure the implant in the expanded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As can be understood, the implant <b>10</b> may be contracted from an expanded configuration to a reduced dimension or a non-expanded configuration. This arrangement permits a user to adjust (i.e. expand or contract) the outer dimension of the implant <b>10</b> a number of times, as needed, during a surgical procedure. Likewise, the implant <b>10</b> may also be contracted for removal after installation and expansion.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>, a second embodiment of an expandable intervertebral implant <b>210</b> is illustrated. Similar to the previous embodiment, the implant <b>210</b> generally includes a helical body <b>212</b> having a first end <b>214</b> and a second end <b>216</b>. The first end <b>214</b> of the helical body <b>212</b> is attached to a first securing piece <b>218</b>, and the second end <b>216</b> is attached to a second securing piece <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The implant <b>210</b> may be introduced into an implant site in a compact or compressed configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> (i.e. wound down to reduce an outer diameter of the helical body <b>212</b>). The compact configuration of the implant <b>210</b> reduces the area and volume required for insertion, which further minimizes the invasiveness of an implant procedure. Once inserted, the compressed implant <b>210</b> may be released or expanded to an expanded configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> to achieve the desired distraction.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the intervertebral implant <b>210</b> is configured to expand from a first dimension to a selected second dimension. Similar to the previous embodiment, the implant <b>210</b> includes a locking arrangement <b>250</b> that secures the implant at the selected second dimension. That is, the implant <b>210</b> is configured to permit expansion to, and be secured at, a selected one of a variety of second dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Expansion is accomplished by permitting rotation of one end <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> of the helical body <b>212</b> in relation to the other end <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first securing piece <b>218</b> includes a first end cap structure <b>222</b> having a first exterior surface <b>243</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). The second securing piece <b>220</b> includes a second end cap structure <b>226</b> having a second exterior surface <b>245</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The helical body <b>212</b> includes a number of coils <b>262</b>, including first and second end coils <b>274</b>, <b>276</b>. Each of the end coils <b>274</b>, <b>276</b> of the helical body <b>212</b> is permanently affixed to the first and second exterior surfaces <b>243</b>, <b>245</b> of the first and second end cap structures <b>222</b>, <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The end coils <b>274</b>, <b>276</b> of the helical body <b>212</b> may be permanently affixed by welding or bonding the end coils to the exterior surfaces <b>243</b>, <b>245</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The second end cap structure <b>226</b> is interconnected to a shaft <b>224</b>. The shaft <b>224</b> extends axially outward from the second end cap structure <b>226</b>. The shaft generally defines a longitudinal axis A′-A′ of the implant <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The coils <b>262</b> of the helical body <b>212</b> turn about the shaft <b>224</b> along the longitudinal axis A-A of the implant <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An interlock structure (shown with respect to the first embodiment and referenced as number <b>28</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) formed in the first end cap <b>218</b> and the shaft <b>224</b> define the locking arrangement <b>250</b> of the implant <b>210</b>. As previously described, the shaft <b>224</b> mates with the interlock structure of the first end cap structure <b>222</b> to prevent the first and second securing pieces <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> from rotating or turning relative to one another. The locking arrangement <b>250</b> may also includes a fastener or setscrew (shown in the first embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) to secure the first and second securing pieces <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> in a relative axial position.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The outer diameter of the implant <b>210</b> is configured to expand or contract depending upon the direction of rotation of the first securing piece <b>218</b> relative to the second securing piece <b>220</b>. That is, with the end coils <b>274</b>, <b>276</b> of the helical body <b>212</b> permanently affixed to the first and second securing pieces <b>218</b>, <b>220</b>, rotation of one securing piece relative to the other causes the coils of the helical body to “wind” or “unwind.”</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the second embodiment of the implant <b>210</b> in the compact or non-expanded configuration, i.e. the coils have been wound down to reduce the outer diameter of the helical body <b>212</b>. In this configuration, the intervertebral implant <b>210</b> has a first outer diameter OD<b>1</b>′. The compact configuration of the implant <b>210</b> reduces the area and volume required for insertion at an implant site.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Once inserted, the non-expanded implant <b>210</b> may be released to expand. When released, the helical body <b>212</b> unwinds to a relaxed or expanded configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In the expanded configuration, the intervertebral implant <b>210</b> has a second outer diameter OD<b>2</b>′ that is greater the first outer diameter OD<b>1</b>′.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It is contemplated that in addition to permitting the implant <b>210</b> to expand from the compressed configuration to the relaxed or first expanded configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the helical coil <b>212</b> of the implant <b>210</b> may further be un-wound (as described with regards to the first embodiment) to further expand the helical body <b>212</b> to yet a larger, second expanded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In each of the first and second embodiment, the implants <b>10</b>, <b>210</b> are positionable in the non-expanded orientation and the expanded orientation; yet, the helical bodies <b>12</b>, <b>212</b> of the implants are in different states for each orientation. Specifically, in the non-expanded orientation, the first implant embodiment <b>10</b> is in a relaxed state, and the second implant embodiment <b>210</b> is in a wound or compact state. In the expanded configuration, the first implant embodiment <b>10</b> is in an un-wound state, and the second implant embodiment <b>210</b> is in a relaxed state. In either embodiment, rotation of the first securing piece <b>18</b>, <b>218</b> relative to the second securing piece <b>20</b>, <b>220</b> selectively adjusts the outer dimension of the implant <b>10</b>, <b>210</b> to provide a desired distraction height.</p>
