<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Application No. P2004-55107, filed on Jul. 15, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an image sensor, and more particularly, to a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) image sensor and a method for fabricating the same, to enhance the efficiency in condensing the light by forming a multi-layered micro lens with various materials having different refractive indexes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, an image sensor is a semiconductor device for converting an optical image into an electric signal. The image sensor can be broadly categorized into a charge coupled device (CCD) and a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The CMOS image sensor is provided with a photodiode PD for sensing the light, and a CMOS logic circuit for converting the sensed light to data of electric signals. At this time, as the amount of sensed light increases, photosensitivity of the image sensor improves.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to improve the photosensitivity, there is requirement for enhancing a fill factor of occupying a photodiode area in an entire area of the image sensor, or for condensing the light to the photodiode by changing the light-path of the light incident on the remaining areas except the photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, a micro-lens may be provided to condense the light. That is, a convex micro-lens is provided above the photodiode, wherein the convex micro-lens is formed of a material having great transmittance. As a result, the incident light is refracted by the convex micro-lens, whereby it is possible to provide more light to the photodiode. In this case, the light parallel to an optical axis of the micro-lens is refracted by the micro-lens, so that a focus is formed at a predetermined point of the optical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Hereinafter, a related art CMOS image sensor and a method for forming a micro-lens therein will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of a related art micro-lens of a CMOS image sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a related art CMOS image sensor includes photodiode areas <b>11</b>, an insulating interlayer <b>12</b>, a protective layer <b>13</b>, an R/G/B color filter layer <b>14</b>, a top-coating layer <b>15</b>, and a convex micro-lens <b>16</b>. At this time, at least one photodiode area <b>11</b> is formed on a semiconductor substrate (not shown) to generate electric charges dependent on the amount of incident light. Also, the insulating interlayer <b>12</b> is formed on an entire surface of the semiconductor substrate (not shown) including the photodiode areas <b>11</b>, and the protective layer <b>13</b> is formed on the insulating interlayer <b>12</b>. Then, the R/G/B color filter layer <b>14</b> is formed on the protective layer <b>13</b> so as to transmit the light by respective wavelengths, and the top-coating layer <b>15</b> is formed on the R/G/B color filter layer <b>14</b>. The convex micro-lens <b>16</b> having a predetermined curvature is provided on the top-coating layer <b>15</b>, so as to condense the light passing through the R/G/B color filter layer <b>14</b> to the photodiode areas <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Although not shown, an optical shielding layer is provided in the insulating interlayer <b>12</b>, wherein the optical shielding layer prevents the light from being incident to the remaining areas except the photodiode areas <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">At this time, it is possible to provide a photogate instead of the photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Herein, the curvature and the height (‘A’ of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the convex micro-lens <b>16</b> are determined in due consideration of the focus of the condensed light. Also, the micro-lens <b>16</b> is generally formed of polymer type resin, which is formed in a sequential process of deposition, patterning, and reflow. That is, the optimal size, curvature and thickness of the micro-lens <b>16</b> are determined in due consideration of position and shape of a unit pixel region, thickness of a photosensitive device, and height, position and size of the optical shielding layer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">On fabrication of the related art CMOS image sensor, the micro-lens <b>16</b> is a very important component for enhancing the light-condensing efficiency. The micro-lens <b>16</b> is provided to condense more light to the photodiode area <b>11</b> through the color filter layer <b>14</b> when the ambient light is irradiated.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The light incident on the image sensor is condensed by the micro-lens <b>16</b>, and then is filtered through the color filter layer. After that, the filtered light is incident on the photodiode area <b>11</b> provided below the color filter layer <b>14</b>. At this time, the optical shielding layer prevents the incident light from getting out of the path.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, the micro-lens of the related art CMOS image sensor has the following disadvantages.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The light parallel to the optical axis of the micro-lens is refracted and transmitted to the photosensitive device being opposite to the micro-lens, thereby operating the device. However, the light being not parallel to the optical axis of the micro-lens is refracted and transmitted to the photosensitive device not to receive the light, whereby the device has misoperation.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Also, the amount of light transmitted to the photosensitive device is varied on the kind and thickness of the lower layer positioned below the micro-lens, whereby the light-condensing efficiency lowers, thereby deteriorating the picture quality.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a CMOS image sensor and a method for fabricating the same that substantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An object of the present invention is to provide a CMOS image sensor and a method for fabricating the same, to enhance the efficiency in condensing the light by forming a multi-layered micro lens with various materials having different refractive indexes.</p>

Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Hereinafter, a CMOS image sensor and a method for fabricating the same according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the light-path dependent to changes of refractive indexes varied on the medium. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, if depositing material layers having different refractive indexes, it results in refraction of light. Supposing that one material layer of a first refractive index is deposited on another material layer of a second refractive index, wherein the first refractive index is lower than the second refractive index. In this state, when the light is incident from the material layer of the low refractive index to the material layer of the high refractive index, a transmission angle decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, on the assumption that a second micro-lens layer has a first refractive index (n<b>1</b>), a first micro-lens layer has a second refractive index (n<b>2</b>; n<b>2</b>&gt;n<b>1</b>), and a color filter layer has a third refractive index (n<b>3</b>; n<b>3</b>&gt;n<b>2</b>), the transmission angle of the light is changed in order of θ<b>1</b>&gt;θ<b>2</b>&gt;θ<b>3</b>. This means that the light is more condensed on the center axis.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A CMOS image sensor and a method for fabricating the same according to the present invention will be described as follows. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a CMOS image sensor according to the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> show cross sectional views of the fabrication process for a CMOS image sensor according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">First, for example, the CMOS image sensor includes a plurality of photosensitive devices, for example, photodiodes <b>31</b>, formed on a semiconductor substrate, an insulating interlayer <b>32</b>, a protective layer <b>33</b>, color filter layers <b>34</b>, a top-coating layer <b>35</b>, a first micro-lens layer <b>36</b>, and second micro-lens layers <b>37</b>. At this time, the insulating interlayer <b>32</b> is formed on the photodiodes <b>32</b>, and the protective layer <b>33</b> is formed on the insulating interlayer <b>32</b>. Also, the color filter layers <b>34</b> are formed on the protective layer <b>33</b> in correspondence with the photodiodes <b>31</b>, so as to irradiate the filtered light of particular wavelengths to the photodiodes <b>31</b>. Then, the top-coating layer <b>35</b> is formed to obtain a planar surface in the color filter layers <b>34</b>. The first micro-lens layer <b>36</b> is formed on an entire surface of the top-coating layer <b>35</b> on the color filter layers <b>34</b>. The second micro-lens layers <b>37</b> are formed on the first micro-lens layer <b>36</b> in correspondence with the respective photodiodes <b>31</b>, wherein the second micro-lens layers <b>37</b> have the different refractive index from that of the first micro-lens layer, so as to condense the light.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Herein, in case the refractive index of the color filter layers <b>34</b> is referred to as ‘n<b>3</b>’, the refractive index of the first micro-lens layer <b>36</b> is referred to as ‘n<b>2</b>’, and the refractive index of the second micro-lens layers <b>37</b> is referred to as ‘n<b>1</b>’, the refractive indexes are in the state of n<b>3</b>&gt;n<b>2</b>&gt;n<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The second micro-lens layers <b>37</b> are formed in shape of convex hemisphere, and the first micro-lens layer <b>36</b> is formed flat on the entire surface of the top-coating layer <b>35</b>. Also, the second micro-lens layers <b>37</b> are formed of photoresist, and the first micro-lens layer <b>36</b> is formed of an oxide layer, for example, TEOS (Tetra Ethyl Ortho Silicate).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the CMOS image sensor according to the present invention, the color filter layers <b>34</b>, the first micro-lens layer <b>36</b>, and the second micro-lens layers <b>37</b> are formed of the different materials having different refractive indexes, whereby the light incident on the photodiodes is refracted three times, thereby improving the efficiency in condensing the light.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The total thickness of the first micro-lens layer <b>36</b> and the second micro-lens layers <b>37</b> may be the same as the thickness of ‘A’ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (A=B), or may be smaller than the thickness of ‘A’ in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (A&gt;B), since it is possible to control the focal distance by improving the light-condensing efficiency even though the thickness of the micro-lens layer decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A method for fabricating the CMOS image sensor according to the present invention will be described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">On the fabrication process of the micro-lens on the surface of the semiconductor device of the CMOS image sensor, before forming the hemispherical micro-lens after the color filter layer formation process and the planarization process, the material layer having the higher refractive index than that of the photoresist for forming the hemispherical micro-lens is firstly formed, for example, the oxide layer, and then the hemispherical micro-lens are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At this time, the first and second micro-lens layers <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> may be respectively formed of the oxide layer and the photoresist. Or, the first and second micro-lens layers <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> may be formed of the oxide layers having the different refractive indexes, or of the photoresist having the different refractive indexes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">On the fabrication process, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, firstly, the plurality of photosensitive devices, for example, the photodiodes <b>31</b> are formed on the semiconductor substrate, and then the insulating interlayer <b>32</b> is formed thereon. At this time, the insulating interlayer <b>32</b> may have a multi-layered structure. Although not shown, after forming a single-layered insulating interlayer, an optical shielding layer may be formed to prevent the light from being incident on the remaining portions except the photodiodes <b>31</b>, and then the additional insulating interlayer may be formed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Subsequently, the protective layer <b>33</b> is formed flat on the insulating interlayer <b>32</b>, to protect the device from moisture and scratch. Then, the color filter layers <b>34</b> are formed on the protective layer <b>33</b>, wherein the color filter layers <b>34</b> filter the light by the respective wavelengths. At this time, the color filter layers <b>34</b> are formed of the dyeable photoresist by the coating and patterning process. After that, the top-coating layer <b>35</b> is formed on the color filter layers <b>33</b>, so as to obtain the planar surface of the color filter layers <b>34</b> for controlling the focal distance and forming the micro-lens layers.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the photoresist for forming the micro-lens layer, having the lower refractive index than that of the color filter layers <b>34</b>, or the oxide layer such as TEOS is formed on the top-coating layer <b>35</b>, thereby forming the first micro-lens layer <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the material layer for forming the micro-lens layer, having the different refractive index from that of the first micro-lens layer <b>36</b>, for example, the photoresist or the oxide layer, is deposited on the first micro-lens layer <b>36</b>, and then the patterning and reflowing process is performed thereon, whereby the second micro-lens layers <b>37</b> are formed in correspondence with the respective photodiodes <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Herein, in case the refractive index of the color filter layers <b>34</b> is referred to as ‘n<b>3</b>’, the refractive index of the first micro-lens layer <b>36</b> is referred to as ‘n<b>2</b>’, and the refractive index of the second micro-lens layers <b>37</b> is referred to as ‘n<b>1</b>’, the refractive indexes are in the state of n<b>3</b>&gt;n<b>2</b>&gt;n<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The CMOS image sensor according to the present invention uses the principle of light having the smaller transmission angle as progressing from the low refractive index material to the high refractive index material.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Accordingly, the light-condensing efficiency improves as the light passes through the second micro-lens layers <b>37</b> and the first micro-lens layer <b>36</b>. Further, according as the light passes through the second micro-lens layers <b>37</b> and the first micro-lens layer <b>36</b>, it is possible to improve the resolution in the color filter layers <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Also, if there is any problem after the reflow thermal process to form the micro-lens layer, it is necessary to perform a rework process. In this case, since the micro-lens layer is formed in the multi-layered structure, the rework process is performed from the micro-lens formation process, thereby realizing the simplified fabrication process and the decreased fabrication cost.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, the CMOS image sensor and the method for fabricating the same according to the present invention have the following advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">First, the micro-lens layer is formed in the multi-layered structure using the different medium of the different refractive indexes, whereby it is possible to obtain the higher light-condensing efficiency than that of a related art single-layered micro-lens layer.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Also, it is possible to increase the amount of light passing through the color filter layers and being incident on the photodiodes, thereby improving the resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, the micro-lens layer is formed in the multi-layered structure. Accordingly, even if there is requirement for the rework process due to the thermal process, the rework process is performed not from the color filter formation process but from the micro-lens formation process, thereby realizing the simplified fabrication process and the decreased fabrication cost.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
