<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a device that is remotely enabled and disabled. In particular, it relates to a device that is unlocked remotely by means of an electronic key for a predetermined period of time, after which the device is automatically disabled.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Easily carried, but expensive devices, such as digital cameras, video cameras, laptop computers, electronic instruments, and power tools, are very tempting to thieves. Currently, there is no effective, easy-to-use method of protecting such devices from theft. For example, while cell phones have a built-in electronic combination lock that prevents calls when activated, virtually no one uses it because the procedure for activating and deactivating it is cumbersome and time-consuming.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to thieves, devices may also be vulnerable to use by unauthorized persons, such as people who have not been trained to use the device properly or small children. For example, a child who thinks he can use the family's lawn mower, hedge trimmer, or table saw without training may inflict serious bodily injury to himself or others or damage property. While smaller tools can be locked away to prevent unauthorized usage, that may not be possible for larger tools.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is common practice to place unique identification, such as an alphanumeric serial number, on devices so that if a device is stolen and recovered it can be identified and claimed. The owner of a device can also keep a record of the serial number of the device or register it with its manufacturer. However, identification can be removed or adulterated and registration requires the manufacturer to maintain a list that links the owner's name to that serial number. It is both time consuming and difficult to find rightful owners of stolen property and, unless the property has a high value, the cost of recovering it may exceed its value.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Previous inventions, such as U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,489, have tried to eliminate battery operated tool theft from a predetermined and fixed work area by using a fixed transmitter that sent out an enable code to all the tools within signal range. When a battery is inserted into the tool, the tool is enabled until the battery is either drained or removed. Although that invention may operate successfully for a fixed work area, it is not intended to be a solution that could be applied to a wide range of different devices.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">German patent DE10630766/US2004/0108120A1 implemented a remote keyless entry (RKE) system for tools. This approach is most commonly used as a method of locking and unlocking a passenger vehicle by means of a small electronic transmitter. As soon as the tool is unpowered, it would need to be reauthorized in order to function. In an industrial construction site, this simply isn't an acceptable solution as it requires the operator to carry the key with him and it provides more of an effort rather than a value, analogous to the cell phone example cited hereinabove. It lacks the needed utility to be acceptable to users.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Canadian patent CA02283552 tried to address the problem of portable tool theft by putting a keypad and an LCD display on the tool. The owner inserts a particular unlock code on the keypad and the tool functions until the power is removed. Again, this is not a practical solution as tools receive rough handling and a keypad and display simply would not last.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object of this invention is to provide a device that can be enabled for a predetermined period of time by means of an electronic key.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A coded signal is transmitted from the electronic key to a receiver within the device and, if the code is authenticated, the device is enabled and can be operated; unauthorized codes are ignored.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Once enabled, the device will operate for only the specified time period. The enabled time period would be set by the manufacturer or user for the device. After the expiration of the time period, the device could not be operated without re-enabling it by means of the electronic key.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">If the device has a manually operable on-off switch, such as on a digital camera, the user can turn the device on and off as needed without affecting the timing circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">If the enabled time period concludes while the user is in the middle of an operation, the disabling of the device can be delayed. This permits a digital camera to complete the processing of an image into memory or a tool in the middle of drilling a hole to complete the task.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">If the device is stolen, it would have little value since it will not operate. The lack of an electronic key to enable the device would be a sure sign that it was stolen and acts as a deterrence to both the thief and potential buyer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Even if the power source is removed, the device will retain its enabled state for a specified duration. This permits moving an AC powered device, changing the battery, or other user activity.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">If the use of the apparatus is completed before the disable time period is reached, the user can manually disable the apparatus by sending a disable signal via the “off” button on the electronic key. The enabled or disabled status of the apparatus can optionally be presented audibly and/or visually such as through the use of a display, LED(s), or a speaker on the apparatus. For example, a green-lit LED could indicate an enabled status while a blinking red LED could indicate 15 minutes left before the apparatus is disabled and an unlit LED could indicate a disabled status. A series of informational or warning beeps could also be used to convey the information.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The apparatus control circuit would contain a unique identifier matched to the electronic key thus permitting only the correct identifier match to activate the device. This will reduce theft since stealing the device without possessing the correct electronic key will make the item inoperable and valueless and readily identifiable as stolen.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The control circuit in the device may contain a unique identification code and have a means of communicating that identification code to an authorized identification device, which could be part of the electronic key. This permits the identification of the device's owner so that it can be returned if it is lost or stolen.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The apparatus according to the present invention will also prevent unauthorized users from operating the device even when it has not been stolen. This is the most likely case with children or work environments where many devices may be accessible but where restricted operation is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The device may include an optional electronic combination lock so that, should the user forget his electronic key, he can enter enable the device by entering a code on the combination lock with a sequence of key presses on a series of switches rather than a traditional keypad. The results can be shown on a visual indicator, such as a display. With the correct activation code, the device unlocks as if an enabling signal from the electronic key was received. After a successful key press activation sequence, the enabling key press activation sequence could remain unchanged or be modified based on security requirements. There are many electronic combination lock implementation options to suit the particular device design requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition to controlling the enabling and disabling of a device, the timing circuit could have the means to optionally control the operation of the device based on the date and time of day rather than simply a set time duration from an activation sequence. For example, an authorized user can program a tool to activate at 8 AM and deactivate at 6 PM. This can be accomplished prior to the time of use to add flexibility</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The electronic key could be reconfigured to operate multiple electronically controlled devices in different locations. This reconfiguration would permit one operator to control a number of devices with the use of a single electronic key, rather than having to use multiple individual electronic keys.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The reconfiguration of an electronic key is possible either by ordering the desired combination in a new electronic key from the manufacturer or by reconfiguring the key by logging into a secure database containing all of the key information via a network and specifying the specific device that a particular electronic key would control. Optionally, the electronic key function could be combined with other electronic keys, such as an automobile electronic key, in a single key.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An alternative to wireless communications would include a means of device control via a wired connection. Communications could be transmitted via AC power wiring permitting the control operator to set the parameters in the device.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With the development and standardization of ad hoc wireless networking now taking place, the device could optionally have the means of communication with such a network. These new network topologies, such as Star or Mesh and combinations thereof, have no central orchestrating device. Instead, each network node has the means of identifying itself and acting as a relay point for other network nodes. This means of communication permits the device to fix its location within such networks and allow for reprogramming of its function by remote authorized users.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a device <b>1</b> according to this invention comprises tool <b>2</b> and remote wireless electronic key <b>3</b> that can communicate with tool <b>2</b>. Tool <b>2</b> may be a power tool, such as a drill or saw, a lawn mower, a digital camera, computer, digital music players, video cameras, digital projectors or video game player. It may be stationary or portable. When tool <b>2</b> is activated it can turn on an electric motor, gasoline engine, diesel engine, compressed air tool, chemical tool (e.g., a tool operated by firing blank ammunition), close an electric circuit, or another operation. Tool <b>2</b> has an on/off switch <b>4</b> that enables the operator of the tool to turn the tool on and off as it is needed. On/off switch <b>4</b> will typically close an electric circuit, but may also turn the tool on and off by other means. Tool <b>2</b> is further provided with a transceiver <b>5</b> that can send and receive coded wireless signals to and from electronic key <b>3</b>. A control circuit <b>6</b> within tool <b>2</b> compares a coded electronic signal received from electronic key <b>3</b> to a coded signal stored within tool <b>2</b> and, if the coded signal matches the stored signal, closes locking switch <b>7</b>. Locking switch <b>7</b> is in series with on/off switch <b>4</b>, so on/off switch <b>4</b> is operable only if locking switch <b>7</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Electronic key <b>3</b> transmits a unique identification code <b>8</b> to transceiver <b>5</b> in tool <b>2</b>. Once the identification code <b>8</b> is authenticated, timer <b>9</b> is activated for the desired time period. Control circuit <b>6</b> then turns on visual indicator <b>10</b>, which gives a visual signal (an audible signal could also be used), indicating the command has been received. For example, a green LED (light emitting diode) may be blinked for a period of about 5 seconds. The sequence, duration, and annunciation of the signal may be determined by the manufacturer. Actuator <b>11</b> then turns on the application power control <b>12</b>, thereby permitting the user to control the device's on/off switch <b>4</b> until the enabled time period has expired. A power source <b>13</b>, such as a battery or AC current, provides power for the electronics and the device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At the end of the time period specified by timer <b>9</b>, tool <b>2</b> turns on visual indicator <b>10</b> (or annunciates an audible signal), indicating the time period has expired, and deactivates actuator <b>11</b>, which disables tool <b>2</b>. Alternatively, a time period, say one minute, could be programmed into the tool <b>2</b> so that prior to the expiration of the time period specified by timer <b>9</b>, the visual indicator <b>10</b> illuminates a visual signal (or annunciates an audible signal) to indicate there is only one minute remaining before tool <b>2</b> is deactivated. This might be advisable for safety, performance, or user convenience purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A second alternative could be that at the expiration of the time period specified by timer <b>9</b>, tool <b>2</b>, is not deactivated as long as on/off switch <b>4</b> is held in the “on” position by the user. This would allow the user to complete the task at hand and might be advisable for safety, performance, or user convenience purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">After tool <b>2</b> is enabled, and the user wishes to extend the operation cycle of tool <b>2</b> by resetting timer <b>9</b>, the electronic key <b>3</b> can be used a second time. The operation of the tool <b>2</b> can be altered by having the electronic key <b>3</b> reprogram the operation of the tool <b>2</b>. When tool <b>2</b> detects a unique sequence of electronic key signals from the electronic key signal <b>3</b>, visual indicator <b>10</b> illuminates a visual signal (or annunciates an audible signal), for example flashing a green LED or providing a tone, to indicate it is now in a mode in which timer <b>9</b> can be reprogrammed. This time period for this mode would last for short time duration, such as about 30 seconds. This time period could be specified by the manufacturer of the apparatus based on market or customer requirements. If during this second time period, no further communication between electronic key <b>3</b> and control circuit <b>6</b> is received, tool <b>2</b> would exit this mode and resume normal operation for the remaining activation time period. If, during this 30-second interval, the user activates the electronic key <b>3</b> to communicate with control circuit <b>6</b>, the duration of timer <b>9</b> or other control function would be adjusted based on the command sent to control circuit <b>6</b>. The second time interval would then be reinitialized by the control circuit <b>6</b>. Alternatively, electronic key <b>3</b> could transmit a command to the control circuit <b>6</b> to terminate this mode immediately.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition to sending “enable” and “disable” commands to the tool, the electronic key <b>3</b> may contain switches for sending a variety of other commands to the unit. For example, during the assembly of the apparatus, a single unique identification code <b>8</b> may be inserted into tool <b>2</b>. In this way, the tool can be interrogated as to its unique identification code or all the tools within an area can be interrogated to determine if any of them has a particular code in order to locate it. Stolen tools that have been recovered can be interrogated to obtain their identification code, which can then be used to identify the owner. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) <b>37</b> is a handheld device that combines computing, networking, and personal organizer features. Such an auxiliary device could possess the means of establishing authorized communications with the device <b>38</b> and retrieving the unique identification code. An auxiliary device could also perform the task via a network connection.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the process that occurs within tool <b>2</b> during operation of the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. When tool <b>2</b> first receives power by, for example, being connected to a battery or AC outlet, the control system determines whether a time period is active (block <b>14</b>). The existence of a valid time period indicates that the tool had been activated before power was lost, perhaps due to changing a battery or a disconnection.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">If there is no active time period (block <b>14</b>), the tool will be disabled (block <b>15</b>), to ensure its inoperability. But if a time period is already active (block <b>14</b>), the control system proceeds to check to see if a wireless signal is present (block <b>18</b>). If a wireless signal is detected (block <b>18</b>), the control circuit determines whether the wireless signal transmitted by the electronic key contains the unique identification code <b>8</b> which matches the tool's identification code (block <b>19</b>). If a match is found, the control circuit determines whether a disable signal is present (block <b>20</b>). If so, the device is disabled (block <b>15</b>). If there is no identification code match (block <b>19</b>), the control transfers to where the time period is checked to see if it is still valid (block <b>16</b>). If a disable signal is not present (block <b>20</b>), an analysis is performed to determine whether an enable signal is present (block <b>21</b>). If an enable signal (block <b>20</b>), is present, the timer is reset, resulting in the activation of the tool (block <b>22</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If neither a disable signal (block <b>20</b>), nor an enable signal (block <b>19</b>), is present, a check is made to determine whether the time period has expired (block <b>16</b>). If the time period has expired (block <b>16</b>), an analysis is made to see if the in-use flag (block <b>17</b>), is active. The in-use flag determines if the device is performing a function that should not be stopped. Device activation is delayed until the in-use flag is no longer active.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a mesh network has a variety of wireless access points <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, and <b>28</b> that are able to communicate among themselves. Some, but not all wireless access points have a connection to a network access point <b>29</b>. The network access point <b>29</b> has access to a network, such as the internet <b>30</b>. This architecture permits network access to systems that would not normally have network access.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A tool <b>31</b>, which has the means of communicating with a wireless network, could have its operation reprogrammed, security code changed, and location identified. Location identification is possible as each wireless access point <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, and <b>28</b> knows its physical location and can determine the general location of the transmitting device by using a variety of currently known frequency analysis and positioning techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram for a process for modifying the electronic key. The electronic key is capable of being reprogrammed in order to control additional tools or change the operation of any tool, such as the time of activation or duration of activation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Electronic key <b>32</b> is attached to a personal computer (PC) <b>33</b> by either wired or wireless means. PC <b>33</b> has a connection to a service provider's host computer <b>34</b> in order to communicate with the network. The PC <b>33</b> also runs a program that permits an authorized user to log in to remote secure database <b>36</b> via network connection <b>35</b>, such as the internet. The PC program and its connection to secure database <b>36</b> provide the means of allowing the authorized user to make the needed changes to electronic key <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A manufacturer may want to offer the user the opportunity to combine a number of electronic keys <b>3</b> into a single physical key. This may be desirable by users who purchase a variety of devices utilizing the control function described herein. If a manufacturer so desired, a user could contact the manufacturer and provide appropriate proof of ownership, such as the serial number for all of the devices he owns. The manufacturer could send him a single electronic key <b>3</b> or multiple electronic keys <b>3</b> that would work with all of his devices. The authorized user could make the needed changes himself by accessing the secure database and reprogramming the electronic key or the device himself.</p>
