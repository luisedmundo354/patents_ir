<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from a Japanese application JP 2003-176293 filed on Jun. 20, 2003, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to laminated magnetoresistance devices containing a ferromagnetic layer, nonmagnetic layer, ferromagnetic layer and to electronic devices using these magnetoresistance devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The magnetoresistance effect is generally a physical phenomenon wherein a magnetic field is applied to a magnetic material to vary the electrical resistance. The GMR device that utilizes the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect discovered in metallic multilayer film structures comprised of laminations of ferromagnetic metal layers/nonmagnetic metal layers/ferromagnetic metal layers is already utilized in magnetic read-out heads. In recent years, the application of magnetic random access memory (MRAM) devices as nonvolatile memories is under study. However, due to the tremendous advances made in magnetic recording density, utilizing magnetoresistance devices in next generation magnetic heads and large capacity MRAM requires making the magnetoresistance ratio (MR ratio) even larger, and making further increases in the sensitivity response to external magnetic fields.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, magnetoresistance devices (tunneling magneto-resistance devices: TMR devices) that utilize the tunnel current flowing between both ferromagnetic layers have been discovered. In other words, these TMR devices use the tunnel current that flows when a tunnel junction with an insulating layer is inserted between two ferromagnetic layers namely, a ferromagnetic tunnel junction. The magnetoresistance ratio in these ferromagnetic tunnel junction devices exceeds 20 percent (Non-patent Document 1) so there is increasing potential for applications in magnetic heads and magnetoresistance effect memories. The magnetoresistance ratio at room temperature is approximately 40 percent; however an even larger magnetoresistance ratio is needed in order to obtain the output voltage needed for magnetic read-out heads of high density magnetic recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In MRAM applications using TMR devices, an external magnetic field (an electromagnetic field) is applied to ferromagnetic layer without a fixed magnetic direction (freely magnetized layer) by making an electrical current flow in the external wiring to reverse the magnetic direction of the free layer of magnetization. However, the constantly shrinking size of the memory cell brings about an increase in the magnetic field (magnetic switching field) required for magnetic reversal of the freely magnetized layer that causes an unavoidable increase in the wiring current for writing. Therefore, increasing the capacity of the MRAM causes an unavoidable increase in electrical power consumption. The increased electrical current in the wiring brings the potential problem of the wiring melting. One method for resolving this problem is to cause a magnetic reversal by injecting a spin-polarized spin current (Non-patent Document 2). However, this method for inducing a magnetic reversal by injecting a spin current, increases the electrical current density flowing in the TMR device. This increase in electrical current density might possibly cause the wiring to deteriorate or induce a ferroelectric breakdown in the tunnel insulation (dielectric) due to electro-migration.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, on the other hand, much attention has been focused on new magnetic material capable of being utilized in magnetoresistive devices. These are diluted magnetic semiconductors such as type III-IV semiconductors typically of GaAs, InAs or type IV semiconductors of germanium, substituted in part with the magnetic atom manganese. In particular, structures of field effect transistors (FET) fabricated using a magnetic semiconductor as the substrate are capable of inducing a magnetic phase transition from a non-magnetic phase to a ferromagnetic phase by applying an external voltage from the gate electrode to the internal portion of the magnetic semiconductor substrate (Non-patent Document 3).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This electric field-induced magnetic phase transition is caused by the fact that the ferromagnetic transition temperature of the magnetic semiconductor is strongly dependent on the carrier (hole) concentration. The above FET device is an innovative device that utilizes this physical effect to cause shifts in the bulk magnetic state (ferromagnetic state/non-magnetic state) even under fixed temperature conditions, by effectively injecting (doping) carriers the semiconductor internally by applying an electrical field externally. Besides diluted magnetic semiconductors, another material known to be capable of this type of electric field-induced magnetic phase transition is manganese oxides having a perovskite crystalline structure. However, the internal magnetic semiconductor substrate of this FET is not comprised of a ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic/ferromagnetic junction structure, and so no improvement in the MR ratio can be expected even in the vicinity of the magnetic phase transition. This FET structure is therefore not suited for use as a magnetoresistive device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The diluted magnetic semiconductors are predicted to be a half metal (spin polarization of the fermi surface equals 100%) by an elaborate calculation of electronic states. Based on this prediction, the laminated magnetoresistive device with a nonmagnetic semiconductor layer inserted between the magnetic semiconductor layers is expected to have an MR ratio in excess of 100%. Even though, trial fabrication of ferromagnetic junction type magnetoresistive devices using magnetic semiconductor has also begun very recently, a magnetoresistive device having an MR ratio in excess of 40 percent at room temperature has not been achieved.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The magnetoresistive device of the related art typically contains a three-layer laminated heterogeneous junction structure comprised of a ferromagnetic layer, nonmagnetic layer, and ferromagnetic layer. However fabricating a satisfactory heterogeneous interface/junction and a uniformly thin intermediate layer is extremely difficult. Microscopic irregularities at the crystal boundaries of the heterogeneous junction and the effects of microscopic pin holes formed unintentionally in the nonmagnetic intermediate layer create the problem that the MR ratio of the magnetoresistance device drastically deteriorates from the theoretically expected value. Further, the MR ratio in the magnetoresistive device, varies according to the film thickness of the nonmagnetic intermediate layer so that obtaining a large improvement in the MR ratio and optimizing with the peripheral circuits could only be achieved by experimentally fabricating large numbers of devices with nonmagnetic layers of different film thickness.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In order to resolve the above problems with the related art, a first object of the present invention is to provide an optimized, electrically-controlled magnetoresistance device, further having an improved MR ratio only by using the field effect in FET structures using magnetic materials (for example, diluted magnetic semiconductor) capable of electric-field type of carrier-doping of the substrate, and further provide magnetic sensors of different types or high sensitivity magnetic heads for high density magnetic recording medium utilizing these magnetoresistive devices. A second object of the present invention is to provide an MRAM device having low power consumption and an adequate output signal by utilizing a field effect magnetoresistive device as the means for writing the MRAM memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The magnetoresistance device utilizing the field effect of the present invention is a device containing a substrate capable of being doped with carriers (holes) in an electric field, wherein a patterned dielectric (insulating) layer is laminated in a flat shape on this substrate and by forming an FET structure with gate electrodes on that dielectric layer, a non-uniform spatially modulated electrical field is applied to the substrate. This field effect is essentially characterized by inducing a strongly electric-doped domain (first ferromagnetic domain), a weakly doped domain (nonmagnetic domain), and a strongly doped electrical field domain (second ferromagnetic domain).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention further provides a magnetoresistive device with an MR ratio equal to or higher than the three-layer laminated heterogeneous junction device of the related art and is characterized by containing a means to control the magnetoresistive value or MR ratio accompanying the electrical current flowing between the first and the second ferromagnetic domains magnetically coupled via a nonmagnetic domain, by applying an external voltage to the gate electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The field effect spin-controlled device of the present invention is characterized essentially in actively controlling the direction of magnetization of the first through the second ferromagnetic domains in magnetoresistive devices with the above described structure by utilizing the electric field effect. Here, the magnetic exchange interaction between both ferromagnetic domains inducing positive and negative oscillations as a function of the particular voltage, is utilized based on the RKKY (Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida) mechanism or quantum well mechanism functioning via the intermediate nonmagnetic domain in both the ferromagnetic domains. The present invention therefore provides a technology for magnetic reversals by electric field carrier doping.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The above described device utilizes the same material in the substrate and therefore has the advantages of no crystal irregularities or defects in the magnetic junction boundary effective in inducing the field effect. In the device structure of the present invention, the MR ratio can be controlled and optimized just by applying a voltage from the gate electrode. Another advantage is that the power consumption required for device operation can be significantly lowered by utilizing the electrical field effect. Further, utilizing a magnetic semiconductor in the substrate will provide good compatibility with conventional semiconductor manufacturing process technology and make integration with peripheral semiconductor circuits simpler.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The magnetic read-out head and magnetic sensor of the present invention are characterized in containing a field effect magnetoresistive device. The magnetic random access memory of the present invention is characterized in containing a field effect spin-controlled device.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a cross sectional view showing the FET structure of the field effect magnetoresistance device of the first embodiment. An electrical insulating layer <b>12</b> whose structure is patterned in a convex shape is formed on the upper part of the nonmagnetic substrate <b>11</b> capable of being doped with electric field carriers. A first metallic electrode (gate electrode) <b>13</b> is formed on the insulating (film) layer <b>12</b>. When an external section applies a positive voltage of Vg&gt;0 to the gate electrode <b>13</b> from the power supply <b>17</b>, a strong electrical field is applied locally to the substrate directly below the region where the insulating film layer is thin and that part of the substrate can be doped with a high concentration of hole carriers (doped region with high concentration of carriers is formed). On the other hand, when a weak electrical field is applied to the region on the substrate directly below region where the insulating film is thick, then that part of the substrate can be doped with a low concentration of hole carriers (doped region with a low concentration of carriers is formed).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a cross sectional view of a typical junction structure for the ferromagnetic domain/nonmagnetic domain/ferromagnetic domain patterned in a flat shape (on the substrate).

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The basic structure and the operating principle of the field effect spin-controlled device of the fourth embodiment is described next while referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross sectional view of the field effect spin-controlled device of the fourth embodiment. Here, the structure of the substrate <b>11</b>, insulating layer <b>12</b>, gate electrode <b>13</b> and the gate electrode <b>14</b> for applying a gate voltage Vg is the same structure as the field effect magnetoresistance device of the first embodiment. In the fourth embodiment, the antiferromagnetic layer <b>34</b> is formed on the surface opposite the surface formed by the gate electrode <b>13</b> of substrate <b>11</b> at a position matching the left half of the gate electrode <b>13</b>. The presence of the antiferromagnetic layer <b>34</b> fixes (pins) the magnetic orientation (spin) of the first ferromagnetic domain (left side of substrate <b>11</b> in drawing) induced when the gate voltage Vg is applied to the gate electrode <b>13</b>. The first ferromagnetic domain therefore becomes a fixed magnetized layer. This fixed magnetized layer is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by the thick black arrow on the left side of the substrate <b>11</b>. However, the magnetism (spin) of the second ferromagnetic domain (right side of substrate <b>11</b> in drawing) is not fixed, and the second ferromagnetic domain layer becomes a freely magnetized layer. This freely magnetized layer is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by the thick arrows with the solid line and or broken lines on the right side of the substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The effective width of the nonmagnetic domain narrows as the gate voltage Vg increases so the magnetic exchange interaction J between the first ferromagnetic domain and the second ferromagnetic domain as a function of the gate voltage Vg is expressed by the positive and negative swings (oscillation) with a shape such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the conventional GMR device comprised of laminations of a ferromagnetic metal layer/nonmagnetic layer/ferromagnetic metal layers, the magnetic exchange interaction J that acts across both ferromagnetic layers is known to have positive/negative swings (oscillations) that are a function of the increasing film thickness of the nonmagnetic layer. This same effect of this phenomenon can be achieved in the field effect spin-controlled device of the fourth embodiment by controlling the gate voltage Vg. This phenomenon is physically explained by the interaction effect of the RKKY mechanism or the quantum well mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">From the above description, with a gate voltage Vg value (3 volts in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) for the magnetic exchange interaction J&gt;0, the freely magnetized layer has a spin position parallel to the magnetic direction of the fixed magnetic layer (solid line arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). On the other hand, with a gate voltage Vg for the magnetic exchange interaction J&lt;0, (5 volts in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) the freely magnetized layer has a spin position that is antiparallel to the magnetization (arrow with broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the fixed magnetized layer. Therefore the magnetization of the second ferromagnetic domain can be set as needed by controlling the gate voltage Vg.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The nonmagnetic substrate <b>11</b> shown for the field effect magnetoresistance device of the first embodiment can therefore be formed with the junction structure of the ferromagnetic domain/nonmagnetic domain/ferromagnetic domain patterned in a flat shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. This magnetoresistance device possesses substantially the same characteristics of the field effect magnetoresistance device of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The field effect magnetoresistance device of the present invention outputs a sufficiently strong output signal with an MR ratio larger than the TMR device of the related art and so can therefore be used with different types of magnetic sensors and read/write heads of high density magnetic recording media. A field effect spin-controlled device is also provided that performs magnetic reversal with low electrical power consumption. By utilizing this electrically-driven magnetic reversal technology, the present invention can provide an electrically-driven MRAM with a large storage capacity and low power consumption.</p>
