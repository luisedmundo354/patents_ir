<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is generally directed to arc welding assemblies, and is specifically directed to arc welding assemblies comprising bypass torches used to divert current away from the work piece.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In conventional gas metal arc welding (GMAW) assemblies, the welding speed depends on the speed of formation of the weld pool used to form the weld join. In GMAW assemblies, a power source delivers current to melt a consumable electrode wire to produce the weld pool. As a result, some arc welding assemblies increase the amount of welding current provided to the consumable electrode wire and work piece to be welded, consequently increasing the melting rate and the welding speed. Providing heat to the work piece is important, because it may facilitate greater penetration of the weld pool inside the work piece, thereby improving the weld strength. However, too much welding current delivered to the work piece may overheat the work piece, and weaken the weld strength.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To reduce overheating of the work piece, a double electrode gas metal arc welding (GMAW) assembly <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has been utilized. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the assembly <b>1</b> comprises a welding contact tip <b>10</b> having a consumable wire electrode <b>12</b> at its end. The assembly further comprises a bypass torch <b>20</b> with a tip <b>22</b>, which is configured to divert a portion of the welding current away from the work piece. The assembly <b>1</b> is configured to provide enough current to increase the melting rate of the consumable wire <b>12</b> and the weld speed, while diverting current that would result in the overheating of the work piece.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">These benefits notwithstanding, the large size and configuration of the double electrode arc welding assembly <b>1</b> and its components prevent the user from accessing the weld joints and work piece, especially for narrower joints. As welding demands increase, the need arises for improvements in bypass torch configurations and components thereof, which provide the user with increased access to the weld joints and work piece, increased maneuverability, and/or lower cost.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a first embodiment of the present invention, an arc welding assembly is provided. The arc welding assembly comprises a power source configured to provide a welding current, and a single weld housing. The weld housing comprises a welding torch, which comprises a consumable electrode wire. The welding torch defining an elongated member configured to utilize the welding current to melt at least part of the consumable electrode wire and provide welding current to the work piece. The weld housing further comprises a bypass torch defining an elongated member configured to divert a portion of the welding current away from the work piece while allowing other portions of the current to flow to the work piece.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a second embodiment of the present invention, an arc welding assembly is provided. The arc welding assembly comprises a power source configured to provide a welding current, and a single weld housing. The single weld housing comprises a welding torch, which comprises a consumable electrode wire. The welding torch defines an elongated member disposed inside the housing, and configured to utilize the welding current to melt at least part of the consumable electrode wire and provide welding current to the work piece. The single weld housing further comprises a bypass torch defining an L-shaped member substantially parallel to the welding torch and coupled to the weld housing. The bypass torch is configured to intersect with the welding torch and divert a portion of the welding current away from the work piece while allowing other portions of the current to flow to the work piece.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a third embodiment of the present invention, a method of arc welding is provided. The method comprises providing an arc welding assembly comprising a power source configured to provide a welding current, and a single weld housing comprising a welding torch and a bypass torch. The method further comprises delivering a welding current from the power source to the welding torch, diverting a portion of the welding current through the bypass torch, and delivering the non-diverted welding current to a work piece.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>), the weld housing <b>110</b> may further comprise a bypass torch <b>130</b> configured to divert a portion <b>174</b> of the welding current <b>170</b> back to the arc welding assembly, while allowing other portions <b>172</b> of the current to flow to the work piece. As shown in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, it is readily apparent that bypass torches may comprise various configurations, shapes and dimensions in the arc welding assembly. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>), the bypass torch <b>130</b> may occupy at least part of the outer surface of the weld housing <b>110</b>. In another embodiment, the bypass torch <b>130</b> may define an elongated member substantially parallel to the welding torch <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to an embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bypass torch <b>130</b> may define a substantially elongated rod <b>132</b> with a slanted end portion. The slanted end portion may comprise a bypass electrode wire <b>131</b> coupled to the elongated rod <b>132</b>. As shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bypass electrode wire <b>131</b> is arranged at an angle, for example, an acute angle, relative to the elongated rod <b>132</b>. The bypass electrode wire <b>131</b> may be coupled to the elongated rod <b>132</b> via various coupling mechanisms familiar to one of ordinary skill in the art, for example, screw, bolt, etc. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the coupling mechanism is a spring plunger <b>180</b>. The elongated rod <b>132</b> and bypass electrode wire <b>131</b> both comprise a conductive metal material, for example, steel, tungsten, copper, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the rod <b>132</b> comprises steel, and the bypass electrode wire <b>131</b> comprises tungsten.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The bypass torch <b>130</b> may, in a further embodiment, comprise an electrical contact <b>190</b> for delivering the current back to the power source <b>160</b>. The electrical contact <b>190</b>, which typically is adjacent or coupled to the elongated rod <b>132</b>, may comprise any suitable conductive material, for example, copper. The bypass electrical contact <b>190</b> may be coupled to the power source <b>160</b> via an electrical cable <b>192</b>. In operation, the diverted current <b>174</b> passes through the bypass electrode wire <b>131</b> and elongated rod <b>132</b>, and is then conducted through the electrical contact <b>190</b> to the power source <b>160</b> via the electrical cable <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to another embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the bypass torch <b>230</b> defines a substantially elongated member having a curved edge portion. In a further embodiment, the bypass torch <b>230</b> may be coupled to or bonded to the gas nozzle <b>242</b>. In this embodiment, the gas nozzle <b>242</b> would, in addition to maintaining shielding gases in the weld area, constitute a component of the bypass torch <b>230</b>. The gas nozzle <b>242</b> acts as a conductive member configured to deliver diverted current <b>274</b> to the bypass contact <b>290</b>. Consequently, the gas nozzle <b>242</b> is preferably comprised of conductive material, such as a conductive tungsten based ceramic material. Referring to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> embodiment, the weld housing <b>210</b> may define a coaxial arrangement wherein the welding torch <b>220</b> extends through the center of the weld housing <b>210</b> and the bypass torch <b>230</b> extends along the outer circumference of the housing <b>210</b>, thereby at least partially surrounding the welding torch <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to another embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the bypass torch <b>330</b> defines a removable L shaped member <b>330</b> coupled to the weld housing <b>310</b>. In addition to the illustrated L shaped member in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, other suitable shapes, configurations, and dimensions for the bypass torch <b>330</b> are contemplated herein. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the bypass torch <b>330</b> may be coupled to the weld housing <b>310</b>, specifically by coupling with the gas nozzle <b>342</b>. Similar to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> embodiment, the gas nozzle <b>342</b> may act as a component of the bypass torch <b>330</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the bypass torch <b>330</b> is coupled to the weld housing via a spring plunger <b>380</b> as shown; however, other coupling mechanisms are also contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In each of the examples provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the bypass torch <b>130</b>/<b>230</b>/<b>330</b> is connected (directly or indirectly) to the welding torch <b>120</b>/<b>220</b>/<b>320</b>. In one embodiment, the bypass torch <b>130</b>/<b>230</b>/<b>330</b> may intersect with the welding torch, or specifically the consumable electrode wire <b>122</b>/<b>222</b>/<b>322</b>. In another embodiment, the bypass torch <b>130</b>/<b>230</b>/<b>330</b> and welding torch <b>120</b>/<b>220</b>/<b>320</b> do not intersect, but maintain a distance close enough to allow the bypass torch <b>130</b>/<b>230</b>/<b>330</b> to divert a portion of the welding current <b>170</b>/<b>270</b>/<b>370</b> from the welding torch <b>120</b>/<b>220</b>/<b>320</b>. In a few exemplary embodiments, the largest distance between a portion of the bypass torch <b>130</b>/<b>230</b>/<b>330</b> and the welding torch <b>120</b>/<b>220</b>/<b>320</b> is less than about 2 mm to about 3 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The amount of current provided to the work piece or diverted through the bypass torch may vary depending on the work piece material and the weld material i.e. the composition of the consumable electrode wire <b>122</b>. In a further embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the welding current <b>170</b>, the diverted current <b>174</b>, and the non-diverted current <b>172</b> may be regulated by a control component <b>162</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the control component <b>162</b> is part of the power source <b>160</b>; however a separate control component is contemplated herein. In a few exemplary embodiments, the control component <b>160</b> may comprise a processor, a computer, programmable logic controller or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For illustration of how welding current <b>170</b> is diverted, the following numerical example is provided. As a threshold, the welding current <b>170</b> approximately equals the sum of the diverted current <b>174</b> and non-diverted current <b>172</b>. The power source provides 250 amps of welding current to melt the wire <b>122</b>. The bypass torch <b>130</b> may divert as much or as little current as desired. For example, the bypass torch <b>130</b> may divert <b>125</b> amps back to the power, so that the remaining <b>125</b> amps flow to the work piece.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a further embodiment, the arc welding assembly may further comprise a water cooling attachment <b>150</b>, for example, a water cooled fixture, operable to cool the arc welding assembly <b>100</b>. The water cooled fixture <b>150</b> may comprise any suitable material known to one of ordinary skill in the art, for example, copper or stainless steel. The water cooled fixture <b>150</b> may be placed in various locations on the arc welding assembly <b>100</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the water cooled fixture <b>150</b> is provided adjacent the bypass torch <b>130</b> for cooling the bypass torch components <b>130</b> as well as the weld housing <b>110</b> as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the arc welding assemblies comprise the single weld housing <b>110</b> configuration, which include the welding torch <b>120</b> and the bypass torch <b>130</b>. This single weld housing configuration can be more easily maneuvered and can be brought close to a variety of weld joints and work pieces, especially those with narrow weld openings. The assembly <b>100</b> increases access to the weld joints and the work piece, while also reducing costs.</p>
