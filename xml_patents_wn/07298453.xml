<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed toward methods and apparatuses for irradiating a microlithographic substrate, and in particular, methods and apparatuses for irradiating the microlithographic substrate while moving it axially relative to a radiation source. Microelectronic features are typically formed in microelectronic substrates (such as semiconductor wafers) by selectively removing material from the wafer and filling in the resulting openings with insulative, semiconductive, or conductive materials. One typical process includes depositing a layer of radiation-sensitive photoresist material on the wafer, then positioning a patterned mask or reticle over the photoresist layer, and then exposing the masked photoresist layer to a selected radiation. The wafer is then exposed to a developer, such as an aqueous base or a solvent. In one case, the photoresist layer is initially generally soluble in the developer, and the portions of the photoresist layer exposed to the radiation through patterned openings in the mask change from being generally soluble to become generally resistant to the developer (e.g., so as to have low solubility). Alternatively, the photoresist layer can be initially generally insoluble in the developer, and the portions of the photoresist layer exposed to the radiation through the openings in the mask become more soluble. In either case, the portions of the photoresist layer that are resistant to the developer remain on the wafer, and the rest of the photoresist layer is removed by the developer to expose the wafer material below.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The wafer is then subjected to etching or metal disposition processes. In an etching process, the etchant removes exposed material, but not material protected beneath the remaining portions of the photoresist layer. Accordingly, the etchant creates a pattern of openings (such as grooves, channels, or holes) in the wafer material or in materials deposited on the wafer. These openings can be filled with insulative, conductive, or semiconductive materials to build layers of microelectronic features on the wafer. The wafer is then singulated to form individual chips, which can be incorporated into a wide variety of electronic products, such as computers and other consumer or industrial electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the size of the microelectronic features formed in the wafer decreases (for example, to reduce the size of the chips placed in the electronic devices), the size of the features formed in the photoresist layer must also decrease. This requires focusing the radiation impinging on the photoresist layer more sharply. However, as the radiation is more sharply focused, it loses depth of focus. As a result, only the top stratum of the photoresist layer may be adequately exposed to the sharply-focused radiation, and the lower strata of the photoresist layer may not be adequately exposed. Accordingly, the edges of those portions of the photoresist layer that remain on the wafer after the wafer is exposed to the solvent can become indistinct. This in turn can adversely affect the definition of the microelectronic features formed on the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One approach to addressing the foregoing problem (a “stepper” approach) has been to expose one or more relatively large fields of the wafer to the incoming radiation, and then move the wafer axially relative to the incoming radiation so that the focal plane of the radiation passes through several strata of the photoresist layer. This process is generally referred to as “focus drilling.” In one specific application of this principle (termed focus latitude enhancement exposure or “FLEX”), the wafer is placed on a stepper stage and one field of the wafer is exposed to light passing through a mask and focused at a given depth. The focal plane is then changed to be at a different depth, and the field is re-exposed. This process is repeated sequentially for a number of focal plane depths. Alternatively, the wafer can be moved axially as it is being exposed. In either case, the stepper then moves the wafer to expose another field of the wafer and the process is repeated until all the fields of the wafer are exposed. Further details of the FLEX process are disclosed in a publication titled “Improvement of Defocus Tolerance in a Half-Micron Optical Lithography by the Focus Latitude Enhancement Exposure Method: Simulation and Experiment” (Hiroshi Fukuda et al., July 1989). One drawback with the foregoing method is that it is performed on a stepper apparatus. Accordingly, the resolution of the features may be limited because an entire field of the wafer must be accurately imaged with each exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another approach to addressing the foregoing problem (a “scanner” approach) is to move the wafer along an inclined path as the wafer and the mask scan past each other to align successive portions of the mask with corresponding successive portions of the wafer passing below. U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,893 to Nishi discloses a scanner method for altering the axial position of the depth of focus relative to the photoresist layer as the wafer moves relative to the mask. According to this method, the wafer is canted relative to the incoming radiation so that the focal plane passes through more than one strata of the photoresist layer as the wafer and the mask move relative to each other. The scanner approach can be more accurate than the stepper approach because only a small portion of the mask must be imaged at any given time. However, a drawback with the foregoing approach is that it may not provide the desired level of control over the position of the focal plane.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed toward methods and apparatuses for exposing a radiation-sensitive material of a microlithographic substrate to a selected radiation. In one embodiment, the method can include directing the radiation along a reticle radiation path segment toward a reticle. The method can further include passing the radiation from the reticle and to the microlithographic substrate along a substrate radiation path segment. The reticle is then moved along a reticle path generally normal to the reticle radiation path segment, and the microlithographic substrate is moved along a substrate path. The substrate path has a first component generally parallel to the substrate radiation path segment and a second component generally perpendicular to the substrate radiation path segment. The microlithographic substrate moves generally parallel to and generally perpendicular to the substrate radiation path segment toward and away from the reticle while the reticle moves along the reticle path. In a further aspect of this embodiment, the method can include oscillating the microlithographic substrate toward and away from the reticle along an axis generally parallel to the substrate radiation path segment in a periodic manner. In yet a further aspect of this method, the radiation can include a beam having a beam width at the microlithographic substrate and the microlithographic substrate can be moved for one period during the time the microlithographic substrate moves transverse to the beam by a distance of one beam width or about one beam width.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention is also directed toward apparatuses for exposing a radiation-sensitive material of a microlithographic substrate to a selected radiation. In one aspect of the invention, the apparatus can include a source of radiation positioned to direct a selected radiation along a radiation path. The apparatus can further include a reticle positioned in the radiation path with the reticle being configured to pass the radiation toward a microlithographic substrate. The reticle is coupled to at least one actuator to move relative to the radiation path in a direction generally perpendicular to the radiation path. The apparatus can further include a substrate support having a support surface positioned to support a microlithographic substrate in the radiation path with the microlithographic substrate receiving radiation passing from the reticle. The substrate support can be coupled to at least one actuator to move relative to the radiation path along a substrate support path having a first component generally parallel to the radiation path and a second component generally perpendicular to the radiation path. The substrate support can be movable along both the first and second components of the substrate support path while the reticle moves along the reticle path.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In further embodiments, the apparatus can include a substrate support having a support surface positioned to support a microlithographic substrate in the radiation path with a surface of the microlithographic substrate at least approximately normal to the radiation path. The apparatus can further include a reticle positioned in the radiation path and oriented at a first non-normal angle relative to the radiation path. The reticle can be coupled to an actuator to move along a reticle path inclined relative to the substrate path by a second non-normal angle approximately equal to the first non-normal angle. Alternatively, the substrate support can be configured to support the microlithographic substrate at a first non-normal angle relative to the radiation path, and the reticle can be configured to move along a reticle path oriented at a second non-normal angle relative to radiation path.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure describes methods and apparatuses for controllably exposing a radiation-sensitive material of a microlithographic substrate to a selected radiation. The term “microlithographic substrate” is used throughout to include substrates upon which and/or in which microelectronic circuits or components, data storage elements or layers, vias or conductive lines, micro-optic features, micromechanical features, and/or microbiological features are or can be fabricated using microlithographic techniques. Many specific details of certain embodiments of the invention are set forth in the following description and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> to provide a thorough understanding of these embodiments. One skilled in the art, however, will understand that the present invention may have additional embodiments, and that the invention may be practiced without several of the details described below.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates an apparatus <b>110</b> for controllably irradiating a microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The apparatus <b>110</b> can include a radiation source <b>120</b> that directs an electromagnetic radiation beam <b>128</b> along a radiation path <b>180</b> toward the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b>. Optionally, the radiation beam <b>128</b> can pass through one or more diffractive elements <b>122</b> (two are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as diffractive elements <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b</i>), and through a lens system <b>123</b> configured to shape and/or magnify the radiation emitted by the source <b>120</b>. Optionally, the apparatus <b>110</b> can further include a light tube <b>124</b> positioned to generate a plurality of images of the radiation source <b>120</b>. The light tube <b>124</b> and/or a sizing lens <b>125</b> can size the radiation beam <b>128</b>, which is then directed by a mirror <b>126</b> in a first direction <b>181</b> through a focusing lens <b>127</b> and to a reticle or mask <b>130</b> along a reticle radiation path segment <b>181</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The reticle <b>130</b> can include reticle apertures <b>131</b> through which the radiation passes to form an image on the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b>. Before the radiation reaches the substrate <b>160</b>, it passes through a reduction lens system <b>140</b>, which reduces the image pattern defined by the reticle <b>130</b> to a size corresponding to the size of the features to be formed on the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b>. The radiation exiting the reduction lens system <b>140</b> travels along a substrate radiation path segment <b>182</b><i>a </i>and impinges on a radiation-sensitive material (such as a photoresist layer <b>161</b>) of the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> in a second direction <b>182</b> to form an image on the layer <b>161</b>. In one embodiment, the beam <b>128</b> impinging on the layer <b>161</b> can have a generally rectangular shape with a width of from about 5 mm. to about 8 mm. and a length of about 26 mm. at the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b>. In other embodiments, the beam <b>128</b> incident on the layer <b>161</b> can have other shapes and sizes. In one embodiment, the radiation can have a wavelength in the range from about 157 nanometers or less (for example, 13 nanometers) to a value of about 365 nanometers or more. For example, the radiation can have a wavelength of 193 nanometers. In other embodiments, the radiation can have other wavelengths, such as 248 nanometers, suitable for exposing the layer <b>161</b> on the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> is supported on a substrate support <b>150</b>. The substrate support <b>150</b> moves along a substrate support path <b>151</b> and the reticle <b>130</b> moves in the opposite direction along a reticle path <b>132</b> to scan the image produced by the reticle <b>130</b> across the layer <b>161</b> while the position of the radiation beam <b>128</b> remains fixed. Accordingly, the substrate support <b>150</b> can be coupled to a support actuator <b>154</b> and the reticle <b>130</b> can be coupled to a reticle actuator <b>137</b>. As the reticle <b>130</b> moves opposite the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b>, the radiation source <b>120</b> flashes to irradiate successive portions of the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> with corresponding successive images produced by the reticle <b>130</b> until an entire field of the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> is scanned. In one embodiment, the radiation source <b>120</b> can flash at a rate of about 20 cycles during the time required for the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> to move by one beam width (e.g., by from about 5 mm. to about 8 mm.). In other embodiments, the radiation source <b>120</b> can flash at other rates. In any of these embodiments, the radiation source <b>120</b> can flash at the same rate throughout the scanning process (assuming the reticle <b>130</b> and the substrate support <b>150</b> each move at a constant rate) to uniformly irradiate each field of the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b>. In still further embodiments, the radiation source <b>120</b> can deliver a continuous radiation beam <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, each field of the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> can correspond to one or more chips or dice, and in other embodiments, the field can have other sizes. After a field is exposed, the substrate support <b>150</b> can “step” the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> laterally to align another field with the radiation beam <b>128</b>, and the scan process described above can be repeated until the entire microlithographic substrate layer <b>161</b> has been exposed to the radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a further aspect of this embodiment, a controller <b>170</b> is operatively coupled to the reticle <b>130</b> (or the reticle actuator <b>137</b>) and the substrate support <b>150</b> (or the support actuator <b>154</b>). Optionally, the controller <b>170</b> can also be coupled to the reduction lens system <b>140</b>. Accordingly, the controller <b>170</b> can control and coordinate the relative movement between these elements, as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged schematic view of a portion of the apparatus <b>110</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The radiation beam <b>128</b> incident on the reticle <b>130</b> has a width W<sub>1</sub>. The portion of the reticle <b>130</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has an aperture <b>131</b> with a width W<sub>2 </sub>through which the radiation passes. For purposes of illustration, only one aperture <b>131</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, although it will be understood that the reticle <b>130</b> typically includes many apertures. The reduction lens system <b>140</b> reduces the size of the beam passing through the aperture <b>131</b> (for example, by a factor of 4) so that the beam and corresponding image have a width W<sub>3 </sub>at the layer <b>161</b> of the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As the reticle <b>130</b> moves along the reticle path <b>132</b> in a direction approximately normal to the first direction <b>181</b> of the incident radiation, the substrate support <b>150</b> moves along the substrate support path <b>151</b>, carrying the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> along a parallel substrate path. The substrate support path <b>151</b> can have a first component <b>152</b> generally aligned with the second direction <b>182</b> of the radiation. The substrate support path <b>151</b> can also have a second component <b>153</b> generally perpendicular to the first component <b>152</b> and generally parallel to (but opposite) the reticle path <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one aspect of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first component <b>152</b> of the substrate support path <b>151</b> oscillates in a periodic manner so that the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> moves toward and away from the reticle <b>130</b> as the reticle <b>130</b> and the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> scan past each other. Accordingly, the focal plane of the radiation beam <b>128</b> impinging on the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> can pass through several depth-wise planes within the thickness of the layer <b>161</b> as the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> and the reticle <b>130</b> move relative to each other. For example, the focal plane can move from a position at or proximate to an outer surface <b>164</b> of the layer <b>161</b> to a position at or proximate to an inner surface <b>165</b> of the layer <b>161</b>, thereby exposing the entire thickness of the layer <b>161</b> to focused radiation. In other embodiments, the focal plane can move axially by less than the entire thickness of the layer <b>161</b> while exposing a greater depth-wise portion of the layer <b>161</b> than is possible with a scanner apparatus having a fixed focal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-F</figref> include traces of the axial position of the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> (on the ordinate axis) as a function of transverse distance (on the abscissa axis) for several substrate support paths <b>151</b> (shown as paths <b>151</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>) in accordance with several embodiments of the invention. The ordinate axis can also represent the degree of focus for a selected plane in the layer <b>161</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), with zero indicating coincidence of the radiation focal plane and the selected plane of the layer <b>161</b>. The transverse distance is normalized to correspond to a movement of the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> by one beam width W<sub>3 </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), measured at the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b>. Accordingly, a value of “1” on the abscissa axis corresponds to a movement of the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> by one beam width W<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Substrate support path <b>151</b><i>a </i>is a generally sinusoidal path describing a sine function. In this embodiment, the substrate support <b>150</b> and the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) complete one full cycle during the time the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> moves by one beam width or about one beam width (referred to hereinafter as a “normalized period”). Accordingly, the substrate support <b>150</b> moves from a neutral position to its position closest to the reticle <b>130</b>, then to its position furthest from the reticle <b>130</b> and back to the neutral position in the amount of time required for the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> to move by the beam width W<sub>3</sub>. Path <b>151</b><i>b </i>describes a modified cosine motion in which the substrate support <b>150</b> dwells at the position furthest from the reticle <b>130</b> for a slightly extended period of time. Path <b>151</b><i>c </i>describes a straight-line triangular or saw-tooth function for which one cycle is completed within one normalized period.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In other embodiments, the substrate support path <b>151</b> can have other shapes. For example, path <b>151</b><i>d </i>describes an approximately square wave pattern. Path <b>151</b><i>e </i>describes a repeated, non-sinusoidal curvilinear function. Path <b>151</b><i>f </i>is a cosine wave that completes two cycles in one normalized period.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other embodiments, the substrate support path <b>151</b> can have other shapes. In a further aspect of these embodiments, the paths <b>151</b> can be tailored to particular characteristics of the radiation and/or the layer <b>161</b> upon which the radiation impinges. For example, (referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), it may be desirable to expose the inner strata of the layer <b>161</b> (proximate to the inner surface <b>165</b>) for a longer period of time than the outer strata (proximate to the outer surface <b>164</b>). Accordingly, the travel path <b>151</b> can “dwell” at a lower focal plane, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> by path <b>151</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In general, it may be desirable to complete an integer number of path cycles within one normalized period to uniformly expose each successive strip of the layer <b>161</b> in the same manner. Accordingly, the path <b>151</b> can complete one or two cycles in one normalized period (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-F</figref>), or other integer number of cycles in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one or more elements of the reduction lens system <b>140</b> can be coupled to a lens actuator <b>141</b> to move axially relative to the reticle <b>130</b> and the substrate support <b>150</b> under the control of the controller <b>170</b>. Moving elements of the reduction lens system <b>140</b> can provide another degree of freedom for positioning the focal plane of the radiation beam <b>128</b> relative to the layer <b>161</b> on the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b>. Accordingly, the reduction lens system <b>140</b> can move in combination with or in lieu of moving the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> to vary the axial position of the focal plane relative to the layer <b>161</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">One feature of an embodiment of an apparatus and method described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3F</figref> is that the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> (and the substrate support <b>150</b>) can move axially relative to the reticle <b>130</b> while the reticle <b>130</b> and the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> scan past each other. An advantage of this arrangement is that the focal plane of the radiation passing through the reticle <b>130</b> can move axially relative to the layer <b>161</b> to effectively increase the depth of focus of the radiation and more thoroughly expose the strata of the layer <b>161</b> to the radiation. A further advantage of this arrangement is that the axial motion can be implemented on a scanning apparatus which, because only a portion of the reticle pattern need be focused at any point in time, can produce microlithographic features with a higher degree of resolution than are available by conventional focus drilling methods.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Another feature of this arrangement is that the motion of the substrate support <b>150</b> can follow an infinite number of controlled, periodic paths. Accordingly, the motion of the substrate support <b>150</b> can be tailored to a particular microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> or class of microlithographic substrates <b>160</b>. For example, if the inner portions of the layer <b>161</b> on the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> require additional exposure time, the path can be selected such that the focal plane dwells on the inner portions of the layer <b>161</b> for longer than it dwells on the outer portions.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a partially schematic illustration of a portion of an apparatus <b>410</b> that includes a substrate support <b>450</b> carrying the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b>. The apparatus <b>400</b> further includes a reticle <b>430</b> oriented at a non-normal (i.e., oblique) tilt angle <b>433</b> relative to a radiation beam <b>428</b> traveling along a radiation path <b>480</b> in a first direction <b>481</b>. The radiation passes through the reticle <b>430</b> and through a reducing lens <b>440</b> to impinge on the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> in second direction <b>482</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a further aspect of this embodiment, the substrate support <b>450</b> and the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> travel along a substrate support path <b>451</b>, and the reticle <b>430</b> travels in the opposite direction along a reticle path <b>432</b> that is inclined relative to the radiation path <b>480</b> by the tilt angle <b>433</b> that is generally slightly less than a normal angle. In one aspect of this embodiment, the tilt angle <b>433</b> can have a value of about 400 microradians less than a normal angle, and in other embodiments, the tilt angle <b>433</b> can have other values. In either embodiment, the reticle <b>430</b> can travel along the reticle path <b>432</b> at a higher rate of speed than the substrate support <b>450</b> travels along the substrate support path <b>451</b> to account for the effect of the reduction lens <b>440</b>. For example, when the reduction lens <b>440</b> reduces the size of the image passing through the reticle <b>430</b> by a factor of four, the speed of the reticle <b>430</b> can be four times as great as the speed of the substrate support <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Because the reticle <b>430</b> is inclined at the non-normal angle <b>433</b> and moves relative to the incoming radiation along the reticle path <b>432</b> inclined at the non-normal angle <b>433</b>, the focal plane of the radiation beam changes axial position relative to the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> as the reticle <b>430</b> and the substrate support <b>450</b> move past each other. As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3F</figref>, an advantage of this arrangement is that the radiation focal plane can pass through several strata within the layer <b>161</b> to more thoroughly expose the layer <b>161</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a partially schematic illustration of a portion of an apparatus <b>510</b> that includes a substrate support <b>550</b> carrying the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b>. In a further aspect of this embodiment, the substrate support <b>550</b> travels along a substrate support path <b>551</b> that is oriented approximately normal to radiation traveling along a radiation path <b>580</b> in a second direction <b>582</b>. In a further aspect of this embodiment, the substrate support <b>550</b> carries the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> at a non-normal angle <b>563</b> relative to the second direction <b>582</b> of the incident radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The apparatus <b>510</b> further includes a reticle <b>530</b> positioned to move in the opposite direction as the substrate support <b>550</b>. The reticle <b>530</b> is positioned approximately normal to an incident radiation beam <b>528</b> traveling in a first direction <b>581</b>, and moves along a reticle path <b>532</b> that is inclined at a reticle path angle <b>536</b> relative to the first direction <b>581</b>. In one aspect of this embodiment, the value of the reticle path angle <b>536</b> and the substrate tilt angle <b>563</b> can be related and can both be slightly less than a normal angle. For example, the complement of the substrate tilt angle <b>563</b> can be less than the complement of the reticle path angle <b>536</b> by a factor corresponding to the reduction factor of a reduction lens <b>540</b> positioned between the reticle <b>530</b> and the substrate support <b>550</b>. In one specific embodiment, the substrate tilt angle <b>563</b> can have a value of about 100 microradians less than a normal angle (with a complement of about 100 microradians), the reticle path angle <b>536</b> can have a value of about 400 microradians less than a normal angle (with a complement of about 400 microradians), and the reduction lens <b>540</b> can reduce the size of an incoming image by a factor of four. In other embodiments, these angles can have different values depending for example, on the power of the reduction lens <b>540</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An advantage of any of the embodiments described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is that the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> can pass through radiation focused at a variety of focal planes as it moves relative to the reticle <b>530</b>. Accordingly, more than a single depth-wise plane of the layer <b>161</b> disposed on the microlithographic substrate <b>160</b> can be exposed to focused radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, but that various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, any of the refractive elements described above, including the reticle, can be replaced with reflective elements that perform generally the same function. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims.</p>
