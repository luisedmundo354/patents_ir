<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a data distribution device for a memory device, and more particularly to a data distribution device which determines a scheme for distributing data applied when a write command is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As generally known in the art, a synchronous memory device (such as a DDR SDRAM, a DDR2 SDRAM, etc.) receives and outputs data in synchronization with a clock signal. For example, in the case of a write operation in the DDR2 SDRAM, a write command and a column address are applied in synchronization with the rising edge of a clock signal, first data and second data are inputted in synchronization with the rising edge and the falling edge of the next clock signal, respectively, and then in a similar way, data as long as a burst length are continuously applied in synchronization with the rising edges and the falling edges of the clock signals consecutively following. Data continuously-applied as described above are inputted through each of data pins. For convenience of description, it is assumed that a memory device discussed in this document has a burst length of ‘4’.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, in a write operation, 4-bit data (e.g., din<b>0</b>r&lt;<b>0</b>&gt;, din<b>0</b>f&lt;<b>0</b>&gt;, din<b>1</b>r&lt;<b>0</b>&gt; and din<b>1</b>f&lt;<b>0</b>&gt;), which have been sequentially (serially) applied through a specific data pin in synchronization with rising and falling edges of clock signals, are stored in four registers in one-to-one correspondence, and then are inputted to four input lines in one-to-one correspondence in synchronization with a clock signal. That is, the four registers function as a serial-to-parallel converter. The data din<b>0</b>r&lt;<b>0</b>&gt;, din<b>0</b>f&lt;<b>0</b>&gt;, din<b>1</b>r&lt;<b>0</b>&gt; and din<b>1</b>f&lt;<b>0</b>&gt; applied to the four input lines are transferred to four global input/output lines, respectively, and are then stored in a memory cell array. Herein, the data din<b>0</b>r&lt;<b>0</b>&gt;, din<b>0</b>f&lt;<b>0</b>&gt;, din<b>1</b>r&lt;<b>0</b>&gt; and din<b>1</b>f&lt;<b>0</b>&gt; represent data applied sequentially through a data pin DQ0 in synchronization with rising and falling edges of clock signals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, before the four pieces of data are transferred to the global input/output lines, an operation of determining the sequence and positions for storing the four pieces of data in the memory cell array is performed. In this document, this operation is called ‘data distribution operation’ for convenience of description. Generally, the data distribution operation is determined according to a burst type and a starting column address. Herein, the burst type includes a sequential mode and an interleave mode, which are modes for determining a data application sequence. A starting column address used in this document represents the lowest two bits (A<b>1</b> and A<b>0</b>) of a column address, which is also defined in the JEDEC standard. As generally known in the art, the above-mentioned four global input/output lines corresponds to the decoding values 0, 1, 2 and 3 of the starting column address, respectively. Therefore, data are transferred to the four global input/output lines in one-to-one correspondence according to the starting column address and the burst type.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a data distribution device for a memory device which can reduce the number of control lines required for a control signal to perform a data distribution operation, thereby reducing the layout area for disposition of the control lines.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can be understood that the data distribution device according to the present invention uses only four control signals, thereby having a more efficient layout than the conventional device using a 16-bit control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Hereinafter, how to function as a data distribution section using only a 4-bit control signal will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the detailed configuration of a data distribution section shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Herein, reference numeral ‘<b>300</b>’ represents one of data distribution sections shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For reference, data q<b>0</b>, q<b>1</b>, q<b>2</b> and q<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> correspond to 4-bit data applied to each data distribution section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and global input/output lines gio_r<b>0</b>, gio_f<b>0</b>, gio_r<b>1</b> and gio_f<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> correspond to global input/output lines of each data distribution section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the data distribution section <b>300</b> includes a decoding section <b>301</b>, control sections <b>302</b> and <b>303</b>, and switching sections <b>304</b>, <b>305</b>, <b>306</b> and <b>307</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The decoding section <b>301</b> receives a starting column address (A<b>0</b>, A<b>1</b>), and outputs first decoding signals a<b>1</b>_<b>00</b> and a<b>0</b>_<b>00</b>, second decoding signals a<b>1</b>_<b>01</b> and a<b>0</b>_<b>01</b>, third decoding signals a<b>1</b>_<b>10</b> and a<b>0</b>_<b>10</b>, and fourth decoding signals a<b>1</b>_<b>11</b> and a<b>0</b>_<b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in this drawing, the logic levels of the first decoding signals a<b>1</b>_<b>00</b> and a<b>0</b>_<b>00</b> are equal to those of (A<b>1</b>, A<b>0</b>), the logic levels of the second decoding signals a<b>1</b>_<b>01</b> and a<b>0</b>_<b>01</b> are equal to those of (A<b>1</b>, /A<b>0</b>), the logic levels of the third decoding signals a<b>1</b>_<b>10</b> and a<b>0</b>_<b>10</b> are equal to those of (/A<b>1</b>, A<b>0</b>), and the logic levels of the fourth decoding signals a<b>1</b>_<b>11</b> and a<b>0</b>_<b>11</b> are equal to those of (/A<b>1</b>, /A<b>0</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A burst type determination signal seq_intb and the signal a<b>0</b>_<b>01</b>, which are applied to the control section <b>302</b>, are used as control signals. When signal a<b>1</b>_<b>01</b> is applied through an input node D of the control section <b>302</b>, the control section <b>302</b> outputs either a signal having a logic level equal to that of the signal a<b>1</b>_<b>01</b> or a signal having a logic level opposite to (i.e., a logic level inverted from) that of the signal a<b>1</b>_<b>01</b>, through its output node Q, according to logical levels of the control signals a<b>0</b>_<b>01</b> and seq_intb.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Similarly, a burst type determination seq_intb and a signal a<b>0</b>_<b>11</b> applied to the control section <b>303</b> are used also as control signals. When signal a<b>1</b>_<b>11</b> applied through an input node D of the control section <b>303</b>, the control section <b>303</b> outputs either a signal having a logic level equal to that of the signal a<b>1</b>_<b>11</b> or a signal having a logic level opposite to (i.e., a logic level inverted from) that of the signal a<b>1</b>_<b>11</b>, through its output node Q, according to logical levels of the control signals a<b>0</b>_<b>11</b> and seq_intb.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For reference, the burst type determination signal seq_intb applied to the control sections <b>302</b> and <b>303</b> is a signal to determine whether the burst type is a sequential type or an interleave type. In this document, a burst type determination signal seq_intb having a high level represents the sequential type, and a burst type determination signal seq_intb having a low level represents the interleave type. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> which illustrates a detailed configuration of the control section <b>302</b> or <b>303</b>, a level of a signal outputted from each of the control sections <b>302</b> and <b>303</b> is determined depending on whether the burst type is the sequential type or the interleave type.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Each of the switching sections <b>304</b>, <b>305</b>, <b>306</b> and <b>307</b> functions as a multiplexer which selects and outputs one of the input data q<b>0</b>, q<b>1</b>, q<b>2</b> and q<b>3</b>. Herein, the input data q<b>0</b> to q<b>3</b> inputted commonly to the switching sections represents 4-bit data inputted sequentially through one data pin. Therefore, in the case of X4 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it should be noted that three circuits equal to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are further included.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The switching section <b>304</b> selects one of the input data q<b>0</b> to q<b>3</b> and transfers the selected datum to a global input/output line gio_r<b>0</b>. In this case, the datum selected and outputted by the switching section <b>304</b> is determined by signals a<b>1</b>_<b>00</b> and a<b>0</b>_<b>00</b>. The switching section <b>304</b> operates in synchronization with a clock signal dinclk. The switching sections <b>305</b>, <b>306</b> and <b>307</b> described later in this document also operate in synchronization with the clock signal dinclk.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The switching section <b>305</b> selects one of the input data q<b>0</b> to q<b>3</b> and transfers the selected datum to a global input/output line gio_f<b>0</b>. In this case, the datum selected and outputted by the switching section <b>305</b> is determined by a signal a<b>0</b>_<b>01</b> and an output signal a<b>1</b>_<b>01</b>_out of the control section <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The switching section <b>306</b> selects one of the input data q<b>0</b> to q<b>3</b> and transfers the selected datum to a global input/output line gio_r<b>1</b>. In this case, the datum selected and outputted by the switching section <b>306</b> is determined by signals a<b>1</b>_<b>10</b> and a<b>0</b>_<b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The switching section <b>307</b> selects one of the input data q<b>0</b> to q<b>3</b> and transfers the selected datum to a global input/output line gio_f<b>1</b>. In this case, the datum selected and outputted by the switching section <b>307</b> is determined by a signal a<b>1</b>_<b>11</b> and an output signal a<b>1</b>_<b>11</b>_out of the control section <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The operation of the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> will now be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to an embodiment, it is assumed that the input data (q<b>0</b>, q<b>1</b>, q<b>2</b>, q<b>3</b>) are (1, 0, 1, 1), the burst type is the sequential type, and a starting column address (A<b>1</b>, A<b>0</b>) is (1,0).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this case, as shown in Table 1, the starting column address (A<b>1</b>, A<b>0</b>) has a value of ‘2’, and a data access sequence is a sequence of 2, 3, 0 and 1. Therefore, the switching section <b>304</b> selects and outputs ‘q<b>2</b>’, the switching section <b>305</b> selects and outputs ‘q<b>3</b>’, the switching section <b>306</b> selects and outputs ‘q<b>0</b>’, and the switching section <b>307</b> selects and outputs ‘q<b>1</b>’. Accordingly, data q<b>2</b>, q<b>3</b>, q<b>0</b> and q<b>1</b> are transferred to the global input/output lines gio_r<b>0</b>, gio_f<b>0</b>, gio_r<b>1</b> and gio_f<b>1</b>, respectively. That is, data applied to the global input/output lines gio_r<b>0</b>, gio_f<b>0</b>, gio_r<b>1</b> and gio_f<b>1</b> are (1,1,1,0), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to another embodiment, it is assumed that the input data (q<b>0</b>,q<b>1</b>,q<b>2</b>,q<b>3</b>) are (1,0,1,1), the burst type is the interleave type, and a starting column address (A<b>1</b>, A<b>0</b>) is (1,0).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this case, as shown in Table 1, a data access sequence is equal to that in the case of the sequential type. Therefore, data q<b>2</b>, q<b>3</b>, q<b>0</b> and q<b>1</b> are transferred to the global input/output lines gio_r<b>0</b>, gio_f<b>0</b>, gio_r<b>1</b> and gio_f<b>1</b>, respectively. That is, data applied to the global input/output lines gio_r<b>0</b>, gio_f<b>0</b>, gio_r<b>1</b> and gio_f<b>1</b> are (1,1,1,0), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to still another embodiment, it is assumed that the input data (q<b>0</b>,q<b>1</b>,q<b>2</b>,q<b>3</b>) are (1,0,0,1), the burst type is the sequential type, and a starting column address (A<b>1</b>, A<b>0</b>) is (0,1). In this case, data q<b>1</b>, q<b>2</b>, q<b>3</b> and q<b>0</b> are transferred to the global input/output lines gio_r<b>0</b>, gio_f<b>0</b>, gio_r<b>1</b> and gio_f<b>1</b>, respectively. That is, data applied to the global input/output lines gio_r<b>0</b>, gio_f<b>0</b>, gio_r<b>1</b> and gio_f<b>1</b> are (0,0,1,1), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In contrast, when the input data (q<b>0</b>,q<b>1</b>,q<b>2</b>,q<b>3</b>) are (1,0,0,1), the burst type is the interleave type and a starting column address (A<b>1</b>, A<b>0</b>) is (0,1), data q<b>1</b>, q<b>0</b>, q<b>3</b> and q<b>2</b> are transferred to the global input/output lines gio_r<b>0</b>, gio_f<b>0</b>, gio_r<b>1</b> and gio_f<b>1</b>, respectively. That is, data applied to the global input/output lines gio_r<b>0</b>, gio_f<b>0</b>, gio_r<b>1</b> and gio_f<b>1</b> are (0,1,1,0), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating a control section <b>302</b> or <b>303</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the control section outputs either a signal having the logic level equal to that of an input signal (e.g., a<b>1</b>_<b>01</b> or a<b>1</b>_<b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) applied to its input node D or a signal having the inverted logic level of the input signal (e.g., a<b>1</b>_<b>01</b> or a<b>1</b>_<b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) through its output node Q, depending on the logic levels of control signals in<b>1</b> and in<b>2</b>. The reason will be described with reference to table 1. Referring to Table 1, when a burst length is ‘4’ and a starting column address is ‘0’, data are distributed in a sequence (access sequence) of 0, 1, 2 and 3 regardless of burst types. Also, when a burst length is ‘4’ and a starting column address is ‘2’, the data are distributed in a sequence of 2, 3, 0 and 1 regardless of burst types.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">However, when a burst length is ‘4’ and a starting column address is ‘1’, the data are distributed in a sequence of 1, 2, 3 and 0 in the case of the sequential type, and the data are distributed in a sequence of 1, 0, 3 and 2 in the case of the interleave type. It can be understood in this case that the data distribution sequence changes depending on the burst types. Similarly, when a burst length is ‘4’ and a starting column address is ‘3’, the data distributed in a sequence of 3, 0, 1 and 2 in the case of the sequential type, and the data are distributed in a sequence of 3, 2, 1 and 0 in the case of the interleave type. That is it can be understood in this case that the data distribution sequence changes depending on the burst types. As described above, the control section is a circuit for compensating a data distribution sequence which changes depending on burst types. For reference, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the switching sections <b>305</b> and <b>307</b> receives an output signal of a corresponding control section <b>302</b> or <b>303</b>, and selects and outputs one of the data q<b>0</b>, q<b>1</b>, q<b>2</b> and q<b>3</b> by using a starting column address.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a block diagram illustrating one of the switching sections <b>304</b> to <b>307</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating one of switch elements <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Since the operation of the switching section as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is described above, an additional description thereof will be omitted. For reference, a clock signal dinclk applied to the switching section functions to determine a time point at which selected data is transferred to global input/output lines.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating an amplifier <b>54</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. The amplifier shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is only an example, and those skilled in the art may use various amplification circuits to achieve the same function as that of the amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref> show only examples of circuits for achieving the function of the data distribution section shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Those skilled in the art may use various types of circuits to achieve the same functions as those of circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to the method described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in the present invention, 4-bit data applied sequentially through one data pin are transferred to global input/output lines by using 4 control signals A<b>1</b>, A<b>0</b>, seq_intb and dinclk.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As described above, the present invention discloses a configuration for distributing input data to global input/output lines by using only four control signals A<b>1</b>, A<b>0</b>, seq_intb and dinclk.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the number of control signals required in a device, which determines a distribution sequence of data inputted through one data pin, is reduced, thereby significantly reducing the layout area for disposition of control lines.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.</p>
