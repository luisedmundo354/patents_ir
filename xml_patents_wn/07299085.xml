<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to remote monitoring of medical patients and implanted medical devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Implanted medical devices, such as pacemakers, typically include wireless telemetry circuitry to permit monitoring and programming of the device by an external monitor or programmer. In addition, some monitors and programmers include a telecommunication interface to communicate remotely with a remote monitoring station. In this manner, some monitors and programmers support remote monitoring and programming of implanted medical devices, e.g., via a dial-up telephone connection or network connection.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, to commence monitoring, a remote monitoring station operator calls a patient and establishes a two-way telephone connection. A person at the remote monitoring station guides the patient to set up the connection, place surface electrodes on the patient's chest for surface ECG recording, and turn on the monitor or programmer to interrogate the pacemaker implanted within the patient. In particular, the patient places a wand that contains a radio frequency (RF) antenna in proximity with the implanted pacemaker.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The monitor or programmer receives data from the implanted pacemaker and stores the data for communication to the remote monitoring station, e.g., via a telephone or network connection. In addition, data collected from the surface ECG recording is transmitted to the remote monitoring station, typically using transtelephonic frequency modulation (FM). Collection and transmission of implanted medical device data and surface ECG data in this manner is useful in providing the remote monitoring station with remote access to critical patient information.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Existing systems place great reliance, however, on the patient to take certain actions in a timely and accurate manner. To ensure accurate data recording, for example, the patient must be trained to quickly and accurately position the wand and ECG monitoring electrodes. If the patient is not sufficiently adept in handling wand or electrode placement, interrogation may take longer than desired, possibly resulting in undue depletion of the pacemaker battery.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, inappropriate actions on the part of the patient can be a significant problem in affecting longevity of a pacemaker. With implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICD), it is even more important to interrogate the device as well as assess surface ECG simultaneously. Collecting the surface ECG recording in combination with retrieving the contents of the implanted medical device can yield additional clinical information in the assessment of the operation of the implanted medical device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, the invention is directed to an integrated device for remote monitoring of implanted medical devices and surface ECG information. The integrated device includes components for collection of information from an implanted medical device, collection of surface ECG information, and remote communication of the collected information to a remote monitoring station. In some embodiments, the remote monitoring station controls operation of the integrated device to automatically acquire the information without substantial patient intervention. In this manner, the device promotes accurate and timely collection of the information, and reduced depletion of battery resources within the implanted medical device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the invention provides a patient monitoring device comprising a telemetry interface to collect device information from an implanted medical device within a patient, a surface electrocardiogram (ECG) interface to collect surface ECG information from the patient, a telecommunication interface to transmit the device information and the surface ECG information to a remote monitoring station.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, the invention provides a method comprising collecting device information from an implanted medical device within a patient, collecting surface electrocardiogram (ECG) information from the patient, and transmitting the device information and the surface ECG information to a remote monitoring station via a common telephone interface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an added embodiment, the invention provides a patient monitoring system comprising a remote monitoring station, and a patient monitoring device including a telemetry interface to collect device information from an implanted medical device within a patient, a surface electrocardiogram (ECG) interface to collect surface ECG information from the patient, a telecommunication interface to transmit the device information and the surface ECG information to the remote monitoring station.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and inventive aspects of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.</p>

As will be described, the integrated patient monitoring device includes a telecommunication interface for remote transmission of the collected information to a remote monitoring station. In some embodiments, the remote monitoring station controls operation of the integrated device to automatically acquire the information without substantial patient intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">IMD <b>10</b> delivers pacing pulses or other stimulation therapy to heart <b>12</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, IMD <b>10</b> is an implantable, multi-chamber pacemaker that includes cardioversion and defibrillation capabilities. The invention is not limited to the particular IMD and configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, however, but may be practiced with a variety of implantable medical devices. The invention may be practiced, for example, with IMDs that pace a single cardiac chamber or several chambers, including one or more atria or one or more ventricles, as well as IMDs that lack cardioversion and defibrillation capability.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">IMD <b>10</b> includes an implantable pulse generator (IPG) to generate pacing stimuli to administer one or more therapies to heart <b>12</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, pacing stimuli are applied to the right atrium <b>14</b> or the right ventricle <b>16</b>, or both. IMD <b>10</b> also includes circuitry to sense atrial and ventricular activations. Atrial and ventricular bipolar pace/sense electrode pairs at the distal ends of leads <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>, respectively, carry out the pacing and sensing functions. IMD <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>52</b> that may serve as a “can” electrode. A connector block <b>24</b> receives proximal ends of leads <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In operation, IMD <b>10</b> senses and records EGM information obtained via electrodes carried by leads <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and, optionally, the can electrode provided by housing <b>22</b>. IMD <b>10</b> stores the EGM information and IMD parameters in a memory associated with the IMD. IMD <b>10</b> also stores program instructions for delivery different pacing therapies to heart <b>11</b>. In addition, IMD <b>10</b> includes an RF telemetry interface that permits programming of the IMD and interrogation of the IMD to collect device information including the EGM information or IMD parameters. The EGM information may be associated with particular episodes recorded by IMD <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a system <b>28</b> for remote communication with patient <b>11</b> and IMD <b>10</b> within the patient. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, system <b>28</b> includes a remote monitoring station <b>30</b> and a patient monitoring device <b>32</b>. Patient monitoring device <b>32</b> integrates features for collection of device information from IMD <b>10</b> and collection of surface ECG information from patient <b>11</b>. In this manner, patient monitoring device <b>32</b> performs dual functions in a single device, providing the operator with convenience and simplicity. In addition, in some embodiments, patient monitoring device <b>32</b> is responsive to control signals transmitted by remote monitoring system <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, remote monitoring station <b>30</b> and patient monitoring device <b>32</b> communicate with one another via public switched telephone network (PSTN) <b>34</b>. Patient monitoring device <b>32</b> includes a telephone base station <b>36</b> including a telecommunication interface for communication with PSTN <b>34</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, patient monitoring device <b>32</b> includes a telephone handset <b>38</b> coupled to telephone base station <b>36</b>, e.g., via a wired connection <b>37</b> or wireless connection.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Handset <b>38</b> includes an integrated RF telemetry wand <b>40</b> for communication with IMD <b>10</b> to collect device information including EGM information and device parameters. In addition, handset includes a surface ECG interface to collect surface ECG information from ECG electrodes <b>44</b>. ECG electrodes <b>44</b> are placed in contact with patient <b>11</b> to collect ECG information.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Handset <b>38</b> communicates the collected information to telephone base station <b>36</b>, which then relays the information to remote monitoring station <b>30</b> via PSTN <b>34</b>. As will be described, telephone base station <b>36</b> transmits the surface ECG information using transtelephonic frequency modulation (FM) in real time. Telephone base station <b>36</b> transmits the device information using a data modem. The device information and surface ECG information can be communicated during the course of a single telephone call.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Remote monitoring station <b>30</b>, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, includes a computer workstation <b>46</b> coupled to a transtelephonic interface <b>48</b> and a modem <b>50</b>. Remote monitoring station <b>30</b> also includes a telephone <b>52</b>. A remote monitoring station operator uses telephone <b>52</b> to communicate with patient <b>11</b>. For example, the operator initiates a telephone call to patient <b>11</b> to guide the patient through set-up procedures to establish a call for transfer of collected device information and surface ECG information.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Transtelephonic interface <b>48</b> receives and demodulates the surface ECG information transmitted by patient monitoring device <b>32</b>. Modem <b>50</b> receives and demodulates the device information transmitted by patient monitoring device <b>32</b>. Computer workstation <b>46</b> processes the demodulated surface ECG information and device information to archive and display the information for review by an operator associated with remote monitoring station <b>30</b>. For example, computer workstation <b>46</b> may generate a patient database record containing the device information and the surface ECG information.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Remote monitoring station <b>30</b> and patient monitoring device <b>32</b>, in some embodiments, coordinate transmission of device information and surface ECG information. For example, patient monitoring device <b>32</b> is responsive to control signals transmitted by remote monitoring station <b>30</b> to transmit surface ECG information in real time via transtelephonic modulation. When a sufficient amount of surface ECG information has been collected, patient monitoring device <b>30</b> transmits buffered device information to remote monitoring station <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, patient monitoring device <b>32</b> includes time markers in the surface ECG information transmitted to remote monitoring station <b>30</b>. Patient monitoring device <b>32</b> generates the time markers every few seconds to indicate that, during transmission of the surface ECG information in real time, the device information continues to be collected and buffered. In this manner, an operator associated with remote monitoring station <b>30</b> can view the real time surface ECG information and verify, by observing the time markers, that patient monitoring device <b>32</b> is collecting the device information.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If the time markers are not present in the real-time surface ECG information, the operator determines that patient monitoring device <b>32</b> is not collecting device information. In this case, the operator may instruct patient <b>11</b>, via the telephone interface, to more accurately position handset <b>38</b> and wand <b>40</b> relative to IMD <b>10</b>. Consequently, the operator can verify accurate and timely collection of the device information, and thereby avoid undesirable depletion of battery resources within the implanted medical device. In particular, the operator can reduce the number of ineffective data collection attempts, and hence the number of power-draining telemetry sessions initiated with IMD <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram of a telephone handset <b>38</b> forming part of a patient monitoring device <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, handset <b>38</b> includes a housing <b>56</b>, a microphone <b>58</b>, a speaker <b>60</b>, and an RF telemetry wand <b>62</b>. Microphone <b>58</b> and speaker <b>60</b> may be entirely conventional telephone components capable of transmitting and receiving voice information. RF telemetry wand <b>62</b> is designed to communicate with IMD <b>10</b> when placed in proximity with the IMD. Accordingly, handset <b>38</b> or telephone base station <b>36</b> includes appropriate telemetry interface circuitry to drive RF telemetry wand <b>62</b> for communication with IMD <b>10</b>. As an alternative, handset <b>38</b> may be entirely self-contained in the form of a mobile telephone such as a cellular phone, personal digital assistant, or other devices with wireless telecommunication capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Handset <b>38</b> also includes a first set of surface ECG electrodes <b>64</b>A, <b>64</b>B (collectively electrodes <b>64</b>) and a second set of electrodes <b>66</b>A, <b>66</b>B, <b>66</b>C, <b>66</b>D (collectively electrodes <b>66</b>). Handset <b>38</b> obtains surface ECG information sensed across electrodes <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>. Electrodes <b>64</b> may be coupled to one another. Similarly, electrodes <b>66</b> may be coupled to one another. In this manner, electrodes <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> present multiple electrode surfaces for contact with the chest of patient <b>11</b>. As an alternative to electrodes <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, handset <b>38</b> includes a port <b>68</b> to receive an electrode cable coupled to external, adhesive- or gel-backed surface electrodes (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram illustrating placement of the telephone handset <b>38</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> over the chest of a patient.

In particular, handset <b>38</b> places electrodes <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> in contact with the chest to obtain the surface ECG information. In addition, handset <b>38</b> places RF telemetry wand <b>62</b> in proximity with IMD <b>10</b>, which may be implanted in the upper chest area near one of the patient's clavicles, e.g., in a subpectoral pocket. Thus, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, handset <b>38</b> simplifies the patient's task in placement of electrodes <b>64</b>, <b>66</b> and RF telemetry wand <b>62</b>. The patient simply brings handset <b>38</b> into contact with the chest near heart <b>12</b>, and then commences collection of device information and surface ECG information via RF telemetry wand <b>62</b> and electrodes <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram of a wrist electrode arrangement <b>77</b> forming part of patient monitoring device <b>32</b>.

A connector plug <b>73</b> is designed to mate with port <b>68</b> in handset <b>38</b> to coupled electrodes <b>72</b>A, <b>72</b>B to surface ECG interface circuitry within the handset. Cable <b>74</b> carries two conductors that are separated in bifurcator <b>75</b> to form two cables <b>76</b>A, <b>76</b>B that are electrically coupled to electrodes <b>72</b>A, <b>72</b>B. In this manner, wrist electrode arrangement <b>77</b> serves as an alternative means for collection of surface ECG information from patient <b>11</b>. If electrodes <b>64</b>, <b>66</b> are ineffective in obtaining the surface ECG information, for example, the operator of remote monitoring station <b>30</b> may instruct patient <b>11</b> to instead use wrist electrode arrangement <b>77</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram of an alternative telephone handset <b>38</b>′ with another wrist electrode arrangement.

In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, TTM interface <b>48</b> supports transtelephonic frequency modulation. EGM monitor module <b>86</b> manages processing of EGM information collected from IMD <b>10</b> and received via modem <b>50</b>. Parameter decoding module <b>88</b> manages processing and storage of device parameter information collected from IMD <b>10</b> and received via modem <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, remote monitoring station <b>30</b> includes a user interface <b>80</b> to receive user input and present information based on the device information or surface ECG information, e.g., via a display device.

The patient test reports are generated by modules <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> and contain both surface ECG information and device information, such as device parameters of EGM information.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, handset <b>38</b> includes an RF transmit/receive (TX/RX) interface <b>90</b> to drive communication with IMD <b>10</b> via RF telemetry wand <b>40</b>. In addition, handset <b>38</b> includes ECG input interface <b>92</b> to receive surface ECG information obtained via ECG electrodes <b>44</b>. ECG input interface <b>92</b> includes amplifiers to amply the signals received by ECG electrodes <b>44</b>. Telephone base station <b>36</b> further includes a parameter/EGM buffer <b>93</b> to store collected device information prior to transmission of the information to remote monitoring station <b>30</b>. A controller <b>94</b> directs memory transfers for transmission of the device information, and controls a modem <b>96</b> to direct the transmission via PSTN <b>34</b>. In addition, controller <b>94</b> directs a transtelephonic modulator (TTM) <b>98</b> to control real-time modulation and transmission of surface ECG information to remote monitoring station <b>30</b> via telephone interface <b>100</b> and PSN <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In operation, an operator associated with remote monitoring station <b>30</b> places a telephone call to patient <b>11</b>. Patient <b>11</b> is instructed to place ECG electrodes over his chest via handset <b>36</b> or on his wrists via wrist bands <b>70</b>A, <b>70</b>B. The patient is also required to place wand <b>40</b> for telemetry with IMD <b>10</b>. During this procedure, the operator may communicates with the patient <b>11</b> by voice via handset <b>38</b> or a speaker phone integrated with telephone base station <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The process of communicating with the patient during the implant interrogation would allow obtaining a better quality records while a patient is still on the phone. The improper placement of electrodes and wand could be corrected while the patient is on the phone in the process of monitoring the surface ECG. Additional commands that are sent from the telephone or the keyboard of the remote monitoring station <b>30</b> may allow resetting of the modem, instruct the patient via a speaker or provide an alert signal advising the patient to seek medical attention via a patient alert device.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram illustrating integrated patient monitoring device <b>32</b> in greater detail. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, patient monitoring device <b>32</b> generally conforms to the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> further depicts, however, a touch tone decoder <b>106</b> that receives a DTMF (dual tone multi frequency) signal when the operator of remote monitoring station <b>30</b> presses a key on the touch-tone type telephone <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Each key or sequence of keys corresponds to a command for controller <b>94</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> also shows a patient alert device <b>108</b> and a speaker <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In operation, RF TX/RX interface <b>90</b> receives device parameters and EGM information from IMD <b>10</b>. Controller <b>94</b> controls RF TX/RX interface <b>90</b> and parameter/EGM buffer <b>93</b> to transfer the information into the parameter/EGM buffer pending completion of transmission of the surface ECG information. The surface ECG information flows from ECG input interface <b>92</b> through TTM <b>98</b> and telephone interface <b>100</b> and across PSTN <b>34</b> to remote monitoring station <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">RF TX/RX interface <b>90</b> also supplies time markers that are superimposed on the ECG signal at the output of ECG input interface <b>92</b>. Again, the time markers indicate to an operator at remote monitoring station <b>30</b> that the device information, i.e., parameters and EGM information, are being collected as transmission of the surface ECG information continues. When a sufficient amount of surface ECG information has been transferred to remote monitoring station <b>30</b>, controller <b>94</b> controls ECG input interface <b>92</b> to stop transmission of the surface ECG information. After the transtelephonic transmission of surface ECG information is stopped, controller <b>94</b> controls parameter/EGM buffer <b>93</b> to transfer its contents to modem <b>96</b> for transmission to remote monitoring station <b>30</b> via PSTN <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The operator at remote monitoring station <b>30</b> issues commands to patient monitoring device <b>32</b> via transtelephonic transmission.

The Real Time ECG On/Off command causes controller <b>94</b> to stop or start collection of surface ECG information. The Real Time EGM On/Off command causes controller <b>94</b> to start or stop collection of device EGM information from IMD <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The Memory transfer On/Off command causes controller <b>94</b> to start or stop transfer of device information to and from Parameter/EGM buffer <b>93</b>. The TTM transfer On/Off command causes controller <b>94</b> to stop or start transtelephonic transmission. The Speaker On/Off command causes controller <b>94</b> to turn speaker <b>110</b> on or off. The Patient Alert On/Off command causes controller <b>94</b> to turn speaker <b>108</b> on or off. The System Reset command causes controller <b>94</b> to reset patient monitoring device <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In operation, the operator of remote monitoring station <b>30</b> speaks on the telephone with patient <b>11</b>, and instructs the patient to place handset <b>38</b> proximate the implant area on the patient's chest. As soon as the patient palaces electrodes properly on the chest, the surface ECG can be transferred to remote monitoring station <b>30</b>. The operator observes the surface ECG information, which may be a waveform, on a display device. The surface ECG waveform may include regular spikes every few seconds, which represent the time markers generated by RF TX/RX interface <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The time markers indicate that RF telemetry wand <b>40</b> is properly placed relative to IMD <b>10</b> and that RF transmission is taking place. A touch tone command sent by the operator will start collection of device parameters and EGM information. When the operator determines that a sufficient, artifact free sample of the surface ECG is collected in the presence of the EGM, the operator sends another command to transfer the stored implant parameters and stored EGM records from patient monitoring device <b>32</b> to remote monitoring station <b>30</b> via PSTN <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a chart illustrating collection of device information and surface ECG information.

ECG waveform <b>113</b> is preceded by a synchronization marker <b>115</b> and followed by a synchronization marker <b>117</b>. While the real-time surface ECG information is being transmitted, patient monitoring device <b>32</b> also obtains real-time EGM information from IMD <b>10</b> via RF telemetry, as indicated by reference numeral <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Then, patient monitoring device <b>32</b> obtains stored parameters and stored EGM information from IMD <b>10</b>, as indicated by reference numeral <b>121</b>. Transmission of the surface ECG information from patient monitoring device <b>32</b> to remote monitoring device <b>30</b> can be referred to as real-time. Transmission of real-time and stored device information from IMD <b>10</b> to patient monitoring device <b>32</b> can be referred to as import time.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Patient monitoring device <b>32</b> generates time markers <b>123</b> and superimposes the time markers on the TTM channel transmitted to remote monitoring station <b>30</b>. The time markers <b>123</b> on the TTM channel indicate that the telemetry process is taking place between patient monitoring device <b>32</b> and IMD <b>10</b>. Once the time markers stop appearing on the transtelephonic transmission of ECG information, the operator at remote monitoring station <b>30</b> determines that the telemetry is over, and that the device information has been successfully transferred to patient monitoring device <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A synchronization marker <b>125</b> is placed at the end of the time markers <b>123</b>.

This first synchronization marker will allow synchronizing the real time surface ECG recording with the EGM recording transmitted by RF TX/RX interface <b>90</b>. The final synchronization can be done by remote monitoring station <b>30</b>. The purpose for such synchronization is to be able to display surface ECG and device EGM in the same time domain for clinical evaluation.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the operator is satisfied that an acceptable sample of surface ECG has been obtained, along with a steady stream of time marker pulses, the operator issues a Stored parameters and Stored EGM On command. This command stops the real time EGM telemetry. This command also indicate to RF TX/RX interface <b>90</b> to send another synchronization pulse that will indicate the start of transfer of stored device parameters and stored EGM information. A stream of Time Markers will continue appearing on the TTM channel during importation of the stored parameters and stored EGM information from IMD <b>10</b> to patient monitoring device <b>32</b>. These time markers will appear on the TTM channel for as long as the parameters and stored EGM information take to transfer. When the transfer of parameters and stored EGM information stops, the time markers stop appearing on the TTM channel. At this point, remote monitoring station <b>30</b> issues the Memory transfer On/Off command to cause patient monitoring device <b>32</b> to transmit the real time EGM, stored parameters and stored EGM information.</p>

Upon the end of the transmission, a modem interface software end of digital transmission signal <b>116</b> is sent to buffers <b>130</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>142</b> to initiate software <b>120</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> for displaying surface ECG, real time EGM and stored parameters. The synchronization maker permits the operator to verify and, if necessary, adjust the relative position of the surface ECG and the real time EGM on a display device. The operator will have the opportunity to review the stored EGM as well as stored device parameters in conjunction with the real-time EGM and surface ECG information. Remote monitoring station <b>30</b> then stores the pertinent information, e.g., via ECG-EGM storage software <b>124</b>, stored EGM storage software <b>138</b>, and parameter storage software <b>148</b>. The stored information can be stored in a database in a patient record <b>128</b>, as prepared by patient database ECG-EGM record software <b>126</b>, patient database EGM record software <b>140</b>, patient database parameter software <b>150</b>. Upon storing the result of test the system operator can generate reports that summarize patient test results.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a process for remote monitoring of implanted medical devices and surface ECG information. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the process involves initiating a telephone call (<b>164</b>), collecting device information (<b>166</b>) from IMD <b>10</b> and buffering the device information (<b>168</b>). The process also involves collecting surface ECG information (<b>170</b>), and transmitting the surface ECG information from patient monitoring device <b>32</b> to remote monitoring station <b>30</b> using a TTM interface (<b>172</b>). When the surface ECG transmission is complete (<b>174</b>), the process further involves transmitting the buffered device information from patient monitoring device <b>32</b> to remote monitoring station <b>30</b> using a modem (<b>176</b>). Once the transmission of device information is complete (<b>178</b>), the telephone call is terminated (<b>180</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating additional details of the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, upon initiation of a telephone call (<b>182</b>), instructions are received from remote monitoring station <b>30</b> (<b>184</b>). Patient monitoring device <b>32</b> presents the instructions to patient <b>11</b> (<b>186</b>), e.g., visually or audibly. The instructions may include instructions for proper positioning of electrodes, an RF telemetry wand, or both. Upon verification of proper RF wand and electrode positioning (<b>188</b>), patient monitoring device <b>32</b> receives a control signal from remote monitoring station <b>30</b> to commence collection of information (<b>190</b>). Then, remote monitoring station <b>30</b> receives a control signal to transmit the collected information (<b>192</b>), and responds by transmitting the information (<b>194</b>). The transmission of the information may be in an order and format as described above with reference to the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
