<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a device for opening and closing a pivotally mounted door leaf or the like, in technical language also called a door opener. Devices of this kind are usually operated by an electric motor, but must also allow manual operation, see for instance U.S. Pat. No. 5,513,467.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">GB-A-2,020,734 discloses a prior-art door opener, the purpose of which is to provide both motor-driven and manual operation of, for example, door leafs. A motor-driven opening or closing may, for instance, be initiated by someone passing a detection sensor, or by the person who desires to open the door pressing a button which activates the drive motor of the opener. For safety reasons, it is important that the door leaf can be opened manually. For example, if a power failure should occur, it must be possible to open the door leaf manually. Door openers of this type are often used in doors in public buildings such as hospitals, libraries, banks and shops. Such door openers are also used when tailoring buildings to the needs of disabled people.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One disadvantage associated with a door opener of this kind is that it has many components. It is, therefore, both complex and expensive to manufacture as well as bulky, which makes the installation difficult. The door opener is mounted either directly on the door leaf or on the wall above the door leaf. If the space between the upper edge of the door leaf and the ceiling is small, the door opener has to be mounted in a recess in the ceiling, which is a lengthy and expensive procedure. Moreover, in operation the complex structure causes an annoying sound level.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although door openers of this kind allow manual conveniencing especially elderly and disabled people.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, if the door is opened manually in a violent manner, either intentionally or by vandalizing kicks and violent blows, the door opener drive motor risks being damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further examples of prior art are the devices disclosed in DE-A 3 730 114, EP-A-169 296, EP-A-632 181, U.S. Pat. No. 2,371,336, U.S. Pat. No. 2,075,000, U.S. Pat. No. 3,886,425 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,653,154, which, however, also suffer from drawbacks described above.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object of the present invention is to provide a solution to the above problems.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This and other objects, which will be obvious from the following description, have now been achieved by means of a device presenting the features defined in claim <b>1</b>, with preferred embodiments in dependent claims <b>2</b>-<b>12</b>. The objects are also achieved by means of a door structure having the features defined in the appended claims <b>13</b>-<b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, the two elements of the actuator included in the inventive device are interconnected by means of a biased spring means in such manner that the movement of the door leaf and the rotary movement of the drive motor, respectively, can be taken up by and stored in the spring means independently of each other.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The inventive device is particularly advantageous in that it consists of only a few components. Thus, the device is less expensive and less bulky than prior-art door openers. Owing to its reduced dimensions, the device may be easily mounted both on the door leaf itself and on the door frame above, or, alternatively, be built into the door leaf or the door frame. Consequently, no complicated installations in the ceiling or walls are needed. Furthermore, according to the invention, there is no connection between the actuating shaft and the drive motor, which means that the forces acting on the elements of the actuator can be absorbed independently of each other.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first aspect of the invention, the two elements are telescopically interconnected, the biased spring means being contained in the two elements. This provides for a compact and space-saving solution.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, the first element is axially displaceable in the casing, the second element being contained in the first element and axially displaceable therein.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the first element has engaging means which engage corresponding engaging means of an actuating shaft projecting from the casing (<b>10</b>) and being adapted to actuate the door leaf, the drive motor being connected to the second element, which is contained in the first element.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, according to this first aspect, the actuator is axially displaceable in the casing. The telescopic movements occurring in this embodiment between the two elements contained in the casing imply numerous advantages. First, a movement of the actuating shaft will not interfere with the motor. Instead, the movement of the actuating shaft causes the outer element to be axially displaced relative to the inner element, which through its connection to the motor will remain immobile. Thus, the drive motor will not be affected by a manual opening, as is the case in prior-art door openers, and, consequently, manual opening of the door leaf will be easier. Moreover, the risk of the motor being damaged or, at worst, breaking down as a result of an altogether too violent manual opening is eliminated. Second, the output of the motor can be reduced, since the action of the motor only results in the elements being jointly displaced in the casing, which actuates the actuating shaft and, thus, the door leaf. In this case, no components need to be compressed and the full output of the motor is used for the opening operation.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, the spring means suitably comprises an axially biased pressure spring contained in the second element.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a second aspect of the invention, the first element comprises a trunnion, which is contained in the casing and enclosed by the second element and with the spring means arranged therebetween, the spring means comprising a torsion spring which at either end is connected to the elements.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Thus, the actuator is rotatably arranged in the casing, which basically gives the same advantages as stated above. This embodiment allows the dimensions of the device to be further reduced and makes it possible to mount the device directly on the door in a particularly simple manner. In special cases, the device may be arranged to operate directly adjacent the door leaf mounting, for instance adjacent to its hinges. A further advantage is that said reduction of the dimensions allows the door opener to be built into the door leaf or the door frame itself, which in turn is advantageous from an aesthetic point of view, since the door opener will not mar the overall appearance of the door and the surrounding environment.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the spring means is arranged between and connected to the two elements included in the actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The advantage thereof is that an effective action of the inventive device is easily obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a third aspect of the invention, the elements of the actuator are intended for both axial displacement and rotation, the advantage thereof being simplified manufacture. Furthermore, the same advantages are obtained as described above in connection with the second aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to this third aspect of the invention, the spring means of the actuator serves both as a pressure spring and as a torsion spring. Since the pressure spring thus causes a rotary movement of the actuating shaft, the construction and manufacture are simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Advantageously, a damper means is provided in the device to dampen the movements of the actuator. This prevents the closing speed of the door leaf from getting too high.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the drive motor has a threaded motor shaft threadably engaging a threaded bearing at one end of the inner element. Consequently, no gear steps are needed between the motor and the actuator and, thus, the sound level of the device is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, two sensors in the form of an angle sensor and a position sensor are preferably arranged adjacent to the motor shaft and along the first element, respectively. Thus, a relationship between the angle of rotation of the motor shaft, and thereby the axial position of the slide, and the axial position of the element can be established to improve the control of the door opener.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The above advantages are also obtained by means of a door structure according to the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A device according to a first embodiment of the invention for operating a door leaf or the like will be described below and referred to as a door opener in accordance with common technical language. Door opener here implies that both opening and closing of the associated door leaf is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of a door opener <b>1</b> which is mounted above a pivotally mounted door leaf <b>2</b> for operation thereof. The door opener <b>1</b> is mounted on a door frame <b>3</b> associated with the door leaf <b>2</b>. First and second mounting means <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, allow attachment of the door opener <b>1</b> to the door frame <b>3</b>. A perpendicularly (vertically) projecting actuating shaft <b>6</b> associated with the opener <b>1</b> is connected to the door leaf <b>2</b> by means of an arm system <b>7</b>. The arm system <b>7</b> comprises an arm <b>8</b> extending parallel to the upper edge of the door leaf <b>2</b> and a fastening means <b>9</b> arranged on the door leaf <b>2</b> for securing one end of the arm <b>8</b> to the door leaf <b>2</b>. The opposite end of the arm <b>8</b> is nonrotatably connected to the actuating shaft <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the door opener <b>1</b> comprises an elongate casing or housing <b>10</b>, a first elongate element <b>11</b> being slidably arranged therein by means of a bearing and, thus, axially displaceable in the housing <b>10</b>. The element <b>11</b>, which is cylindrical in shape, has on its outer surface first engaging means in the form of a gear rack <b>12</b>, which meshes with second engaging means in the form of a gear rim <b>13</b> arranged on the actuating shaft <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the element <b>11</b> has an axially extending bore <b>11</b><i>a, </i>in which two diametrically opposed grooves <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> that extend in parallel along the whole length of the element <b>11</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). In the grooves <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, a second elongate element, in the form of a slide <b>16</b>, is slidably arranged by means of a bearing and, thus, axially displaceable in the bore <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the element <b>11</b>. The slide <b>16</b> has an elongate cavity <b>16</b><i>a </i>and has the form of a rectangular frame structure having opposite first and second side faces <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> and two transverse first and second end pieces <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> located axially at a distance from each other and having stop faces <b>19</b><i>a, </i><b>20</b><i>a</i>. The side faces <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> and the stop faces <b>19</b><i>a, </i><b>20</b><i>a </i>define the rectangular cavity <b>16</b><i>a</i>. The axial displacement of the slide <b>16</b> in the grooves <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of the element <b>11</b> is thus effected by a displacement of the side faces <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> of the slide <b>16</b> in said grooves <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. The grooves <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> and the two side faces <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> of the slide <b>16</b> located therein are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The elements <b>11</b> and <b>16</b> thus form an axially displaceable actuator which is contained in the housing <b>10</b> and connected to the door leaf <b>2</b> via the actuating shaft <b>6</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-7</figref>, the elements <b>11</b> and <b>16</b> are coaxially arranged in the housing <b>10</b> relative to a centre axis C.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A biased spring means is arranged between the first and second stop faces <b>19</b><i>a, </i><b>20</b><i>a, </i>here in the form of a pressure spring <b>23</b> (helical spring) located between associated first and second washers <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>. The washers <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> abut against the ends of the spring <b>23</b>, which are axially biased in the direction of the first and second stop faces <b>19</b><i>a, </i><b>20</b><i>a. </i>Accordingly, the washers <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> are located between the ends of the spring <b>23</b> and the stop faces <b>19</b><i>a, </i><b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The washers <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> are flat, circular disc elements with a diameter that is slightly smaller than that of the bore in the element <b>11</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the above-mentioned second washer <b>22</b> and the end piece <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> further illustrates stop means in the form of screws <b>24</b> arranged at the end of the element <b>11</b>. Similar screws <b>24</b> are to be found at the opposite end of the element <b>11</b>, as shown clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The screws <b>24</b> are attached to the ends of the element <b>11</b> in such manner that the heads of the screws <b>24</b> partially overlap and abut against the washers <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>. Thus, the washers <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> cannot move past the screws <b>24</b>, and the spring <b>23</b> and the washers <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> will thereby be maintained inside the bore <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the element <b>11</b>. The slide <b>16</b>, however, is axially displaceable also outside the bore <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the element <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first end piece <b>19</b> is provided with a threaded bearing <b>25</b> extending therethrough and arranged at the centre axis C of the element <b>11</b>. The washer <b>21</b> abutting against the stop face <b>19</b><i>a </i>is provided with a corresponding through hole <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). A motor shaft <b>28</b> connected to a drive motor <b>27</b> is rotatably arranged in the threaded bearing <b>25</b>. Thus, during operation of the drive motor <b>27</b>, its motor shaft <b>28</b> will rotate in the threaded bearing <b>25</b> and pull the slide <b>16</b> axially back and forth along the motor shaft <b>28</b> in the bore <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the element <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The door opener <b>1</b> also comprises a damper means <b>29</b>, which is shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The damper means <b>29</b> is arranged inside the slide <b>16</b> and comprises an elongate damper housing <b>30</b> in the form of a first and a second housing portion <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> connected to each other The division of the damper housing <b>30</b> into two portions <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> is advantageous from a manufacturing perspective. The washer <b>21</b> is attached to the housing portion <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The damper means <b>29</b> further comprises a rod <b>33</b>, one end of which is attached to the second washer <b>22</b> associated with the spring means <b>23</b>. The attachment is carried out by means of a screw <b>34</b>. The rod <b>33</b> is mounted by means of sealing rings <b>35</b> along the inner wall of said first portion <b>31</b>. The sealing rings <b>35</b> have O-rings adapted to prevent leakage between on the one hand the rod <b>33</b> and the sealing rings <b>35</b> and, on the other, the sealing rings <b>35</b> and the second portion <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The rod <b>33</b> is displaceable in the second portion <b>32</b> of the damper housing <b>30</b>. A piston <b>36</b> is fixedly mounted on the rod <b>22</b> and locked by means of locking rings <b>37</b> and abuts against the inner wall of the second portion <b>32</b>. The piston <b>36</b> comprises a number of through holes which are parallel to the rod <b>33</b>. A throttle washer <b>38</b> is arranged on the piston <b>36</b>, said throttle washer <b>38</b> being pressed against the piston <b>36</b> by means of a spring washer. The surface between the piston <b>36</b> and the throttle washer <b>38</b> is formed with ducts (not shown) which extend from the above-mentioned through hole to the outer periphery of the piston <b>36</b>. Hydraulic oil is provided in a space <b>40</b> between the sealing rings <b>35</b>. When the rod <b>33</b> is axially displaced, the hydraulic oil will flow through the ducts and the holes from one side of the piston <b>36</b> to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The use of the door opener <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment will now be described in more detail. The door opener <b>1</b> can be operated either manually by acting directly on the door leaf <b>2</b> or by means of the drive motor <b>27</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a starting position for the actuator comprising the two elements <b>11</b> and <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a situation in which the motor shaft <b>28</b> is rotating and the actuating shaft <b>6</b> is immobile (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a situation in which the motor shaft <b>28</b> is immobile and the actuating shaft <b>6</b> is rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the door is opened manually, the door leaf <b>2</b> will be directly acted upon by someone either pulling or pushing it. The arm <b>8</b> connecting the door leaf <b>2</b> to the door opener <b>1</b> will thus be pivoted and will thereby act on the actuating shaft <b>6</b>. The rotation of the gear rim <b>13</b> of the actuating shaft <b>6</b>, which gear rim meshes with the gear rack <b>12</b> of the element <b>11</b>, will then cause an axial movement of the element <b>11</b> in the housing <b>10</b>. The slide <b>16</b> connected to the here idle motor <b>27</b> will remain immobile and the element <b>11</b> will be axially displaced relative to the immobile slide <b>16</b>. This displacement is shown in particular in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in which the element <b>11</b> has been displaced in the direction indicated by the arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As described above, the spring means <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> is permanently retained inside the element <b>11</b> by the stop means <b>24</b> abutting against the washers <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> of the spring means. Thus, during said displacement of the element <b>11</b>, the pressure spring <b>23</b> is compressed as the stop means <b>24</b>, which abut against the slide's <b>16</b> second washer <b>22</b>, advances the washer <b>22</b> and the spring <b>23</b> together with the element <b>11</b>. Accordingly, the force used in manual opening is equivalent to the force required to compress the spring <b>23</b>. Because there is no direct connection to the motor <b>27</b>, which, thus, is not affected by a manual opening, as is the case in prior-art door openers, the door leaf <b>2</b> will open easily. After a manual opening, the door leaf <b>2</b> is closed by the force of the compressed spring <b>23</b>. Consequently, the door leaf <b>2</b> does not have to be closed manually, but is closed by its own spring force. The speed of the rotary movement of the actuating shaft <b>6</b> during closing is reduced by the damper means <b>29</b>. This prevents the door leaf <b>2</b> from ‘slamming’ close.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In motor-driven opening, the motor shaft <b>28</b> is rotated in the threaded bearing <b>25</b> in the first end piece <b>19</b> of the slide <b>16</b>. During said rotation, the slide <b>16</b> will thus be partially displaced along the motor shaft <b>28</b>. The power of the motor <b>27</b> is transmitted to the actuating shaft <b>6</b> by the elongate element <b>11</b> moving axially together with the slide <b>16</b>. Therefore, the spring <b>23</b> will not be compressed and, thus, the power of the motor <b>27</b> will be used exclusively to operate the door leaf <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">If, in motor-driven opening or closing, there is any object obstructing the door leaf <b>2</b>, for example a person, the door leaf <b>2</b> and the actuating shaft <b>6</b> as well as, in turn, said element <b>11</b> will be maintained in their positions. The motor <b>27</b> will then displace the slide <b>16</b> in relation to the element <b>11</b>, the force exerted on the obstacle (person) by the door leaf <b>2</b> being equivalent only to the force of compression of the spring <b>23</b>. Thus, the power of the motor <b>27</b> will not be transmitted to a person getting in the way of the door leaf <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref> show a device according to a second embodiment of the invention, which is based on rotary movement instead of axial movement as described above. In this case, the actuator arranged in a casing or housing <b>50</b> consists of a cylindrical element <b>51</b> which is rotatingly arranged in a bearing and which houses a trunnion <b>52</b> that is connected to the arm <b>8</b>. The element <b>51</b> and the trunnion <b>52</b> are coaxially arranged in the housing <b>50</b> relative to the centre axis C. In terms of function, the element <b>51</b> corresponds to the slide <b>16</b> of the axial embodiment, while the trunnion <b>52</b> corresponds to the elongate element <b>11</b>. In this embodiment, the axially acting pressure spring is replaced by a torsion spring <b>53</b> which is contained in the housing <b>50</b> and encloses the trunnion <b>52</b> and which, in turn, is enclosed by the rotatingly mounted element <b>51</b>. Rotation of the element <b>51</b> via the motor shaft <b>28</b> driven by the motor <b>27</b> is made possible by a planetary gear <b>54</b> connected to the motor shaft <b>28</b> and the inside of the element <b>51</b>. The trunnion <b>52</b> is non-rotatably connected to the arm <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The torsion spring <b>53</b> is adapted, via special stop means <b>55</b>, to allow both motor-driven and manual operation of the door leaf <b>2</b> by analogy with that described above. In motor-driven opening, the motor <b>27</b> rotates the motor shaft <b>28</b>, which rotates the two elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> jointly via the planetary gear so that the arm <b>8</b> is pivoted and the door leaf <b>2</b> opened In this connection, the function of the torsion spring <b>53</b> is to hold the elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> together. In manual opening, the arm <b>8</b> is pivoted by the door leaf <b>2</b> against the action of the torsion spring <b>53</b>, which is tightened without affecting the motor shaft <b>28</b>. Thus, the torsion spring <b>52</b> is rotated whereas the element <b>51</b> remains immobile.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to a further embodiment, the two embodiments described above may be combined by the elements of the actuator being arranged so as to be both axially displaceable and rotatable in the housing. Such a further embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-12</figref>, in which the equivalent of the actuating shaft <b>6</b> of the first embodiment is an actuating shaft <b>60</b> which is arranged coaxially with the centre line C. On the inside, the actuating shaft <b>60</b> is provided with a thread <b>60</b><i>a, </i>which in terms of function corresponds to the gear rim <b>13</b> of the first embodiment. Furthermore, the actuating shaft <b>60</b> is mounted in a bearing <b>63</b>, which in turn is attached to the housing <b>10</b>. On its outer surface, the element <b>11</b> has a thread <b>61</b>, which in terms of function corresponds to the gear rack <b>12</b>. The element <b>11</b> is further provided with a key way <b>64</b>, in which a rotation-preventing means <b>62</b> is contained. The rotation-preventing means <b>62</b> is attached to the housing <b>10</b>. The pitch of the thread <b>61</b> is so great that when the element <b>11</b> is displaced in the axial direction between its end positions, the actuating shaft <b>60</b> will rotate between its end positions.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">To summarize the above described embodiments, the door opener has an actuating means comprising two elements which are spring-loaded with the aid of a biased spring means in such manner that both elements are either displaceable/rotatable jointly by means of the drive motor for operating the door leaf or displaceable/rotatable relative to each other upon external activation of the door leaf.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The elements are interconnected via the spring means in such manner that the pivoting motion of the door leaf and the rotation of the drive motor (via the motor shaft), respectively, can be absorbed by and stored up in the spring means independently of each other.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Controlling the Operation of the Door Opener</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The door opener according to the invention may be provided with a control function, which means that certain predetermined parameters can be varied. Examples of variable parameters are the position of the door leaf when closed and fully opened, respectively. The opening speed and closing speed of the door leaf can also be set. A further parameter that may be set is the hold-open time.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The control function is also regulated so that certain signals to the door opener will result in certain predetermined operations of the door. For example, a signal from an opening button to be used by disabled people will result in a specific hold-open time.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The control is further regulated by two sensors associated with the door. One of the sensors is a position sensor indicating the position of the element in the housing, while the other is an angle sensor indicating the angle of rotation of the motor shaft. By means of said sensors, a relationship between the number of revolutions of the motor shaft a and the position of the element γ (mm) is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the door opener moves without the helical spring being compressed, i.e. in motor-driven unobstructed opening of the door, the relationship γ=constant×α applies. If, however, the door leaf is manually operated, γ will change while α will remain unchanged. In the preferred embodiment, the following applies: If −2&lt;γ−constant*a&lt;2, the motor is not affected. If (γ−constant*a) lies outside the above range, the motor will start and run until
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>|γ−constant*<i>a|&lt;</i>0.5.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Thus, by means of the above-mentioned sensors, a combined manual and motor-driven opening can be carried out. If the door leaf is pivoted manually through the first degrees (about 5 degrees), the motor can then be started. Because the spring will be somewhat compressed by the partial manual opening, the manual opening can continue without the spring having to be compressed further, and the door leaf will thus swing freely and open very easily.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Alternative Embodiments of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">It should be pointed out that the invention is applicable to many types of doors, such as hinge doors, swing doors, folding doors and balance doors, as well as covers and gates of different kinds (including windows). In addition, the door opener can be mounted directly on the door leaf, alternatively integrated therein. Furthermore, it will be apparent that the connection between the door leaf and the door opener can be made by means of different arm systems. The invention may also be applied to so-called pivot hinged doors, in which there is no arm system but the actuating shaft arranged on the door opener acts directly on a hinge on the door leaf to be operated. This action may take place via a gear step.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">To conclude, it should be observed that further modifications of the above door opener according to the invention are possible within the scope of the invention, as defined in the appended claims. The spring means may, for instance, be of a design other than the one described above.</p>
