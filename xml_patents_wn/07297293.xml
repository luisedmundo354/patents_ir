<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an illumination such as a light emitting device, a fluorescent lamp and the like, and relates to a display, a back light for liquid crystal and the like which is used for a semiconductor light emitting element, and specifically relates to a nitride phosphor which is used for the light emitting device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A light emitting device using a semiconductor light emitting element has advantages that it is a small size, has good electrical efficiency and can emit a bright color, and there is no fear of burning out an electric bulb because the light source is a semiconductor element. Further, it has characteristics that it is excellent in initial driving property and tough in vibration and the repetition of on-off lighting.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, for the light emitting device using a semiconductor light emitting element, there is developed a light emitting device which has a light emitting color which is different from the light of the light emitting element by carrying out a wavelength conversion of the portion of the semiconductor light emitting element by a phosphor, and by mixing said wavelength-converted light and no wavelength-converted light to be emitted. Specifically, the light emitting device which emits light in a white color can be used in wide fields such as a general illumination, a display and a back light for liquid crystal, by the constitution.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the white color light emitting device, a blue light emitting element using an InGaN-base material is used as a light emitting element, a YAG-base phosphor which is represented by the composition formula of (Y, Gd)<sub>3</sub>(Al, Ga)<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12 </sub>is used as a phosphor, and a white light emitting color is obtained by the theory of color mixture of light. Namely, after blue light which was discharged from a light emitting element is emitted in the phosphor layer, it is discharged outside after repetition of absorption and scattering in the layer. On the other hand, the blue light absorbed in the phosphor works as an excitation source and emits yellow fluorescence. The yellow light and the blue light are mixed and the mixture is recognized as a white color by human eyes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the above-mentioned white color light emitting device has defects that there is little red component in luminescence, color temperature is high, and only illumination light having low color rendering property which is deficient in red is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Namely, a conventional light emitting device which emits white light can hardly obtain a long wavelength side luminance at a visible light region, therefore it has been a light emitting device which exhibits a slightly bluish white color. On the contrary, there has been strongly required a light emitting device which exhibits a slightly reddish warm color-base white color, in the illumination for a window display, illumination for a medical spot and the like. Further, there has been strongly required a light emitting device which exhibits a white color which is soft for human eyes and near to an electric bulb color, also for general illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, since a conventional phosphor emitting reddish light has low efficiency caused by near ultra violet to blue light excitation and low chemical and thermal stabilities, durability is not adequate, therefore it is not practically used. Further, human eyes feel that the wave length region of a reddish component is dark. Accordingly, it is required that a red color region has higher brightness so that eyes feel the same level brightness as a green region and a blue region.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Under these circumstances, in the pamphlet of International Open Patent No. 01/40403, there is disclosed an M<sub>x</sub>Si<sub>y</sub>N<sub>z</sub>:Eu nitride phosphor (wherein M is at least one of alkali earth metals at least selected from a group of Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn. z=(2/3)x+(4/3)y) which increased a red component in comparison with a conventional phosphor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the nitride phosphor disclosed in the pamphlet of International Open Patent No. 01/40403 obtains a slightly reddish white color light, for example, by combination with a blue light emitting diode, but the improvement of brightness is further required.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, a conventional phosphor emitting red light has inadequate efficiency caused by near ultra violet to blue light excitation and inadequate durability, therefore it is not practically used.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, it is the first purpose of the present invention to solve the above-mentioned problems and to provide a phosphor containing a comparatively much red component and having high light emitting efficiency, high brightness and further high durability; and a production process thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, it is the second purpose of the present invention to provide a light emitting device which can emit reddish warm color-base white color light and can emit light having the color rendering property.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the nitride phosphor related to the present invention is a nitride phosphor (base nitride phosphor) which is represented by the general formula L<sub>X</sub>M<sub>Y</sub>N<sub>((2/3)X+(4/3)Y)</sub>:R or L<sub>X</sub>M<sub>Y</sub>O<sub>Z</sub>N<sub>((2/3)X+(4/3)Y−(2/3)Z)</sub>:R (wherein L is at least one or more selected from the Group II Elements consisting of Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn, M is at least one or more selected from the Group IV Elements in which Si is essential among C, Si and Ge, and R is at least one or more selected from the rare earth elements in which Eu is essential among Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er and Lu.), and absorbs at least the portion of light having the first luminescence spectrum in which a peak wave length is 500 nm or less and emits light having the second luminescence spectrum which has at least one or more of peaks at a range of 520 to 780 nm; and further contains the elements (hereinafter, referred to as different elements) below.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Namely, the first nitride phosphor related to the present invention is characterized in further containing at least one or more of different elements selected from the Group I Element consisting of Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first nitride phosphor containing the Group I Element consisting of Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs has a higher luminescence efficiency in comparison with a nitride phosphor not containing the Group I Element. This is considered because the above-mentioned Group I Element works as a flux during synthesis and then the Group I Element which worked as the flux exists between phosphor particles, or the luminescence itself of the phosphor is hardly inhibited because the Group I Element is scattered during its production steps. Further, the particle diameter of the nitride phosphor can be controlled by containing the Group I Element in the nitride phosphor.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, the second nitride phosphor related to the present invention is characterized in further containing at least one or more of elements selected from the Group V Element consisting of V, Nb and Ta, the Group VI Element consisting of Cr, Mo and W, the Group VII Element consisting of Re and the Group VIII Element consisting of Fe, Co, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Ru, in the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">When the second nitride phosphor related to the present invention to which the Group V Element, the Group VI Element, the Group VII Element and the Group VIII Element were added is compared with a nitride phosphor to which those elements are not added, the second nitride phosphor has an effect capable of shortening afterglow. Further, these elements can adjust brightness. Hereat, it is preferable that the Group V Element, the Group VI Element, the Group VII Element and the Group VIII Element which are different from the elements contained in the above-mentioned nitride phosphor composition are 100 ppm or less based on the weight of the elements contained in the above-mentioned nitride phosphor composition. This is because the Group V Element, the Group VI Element, the Group VII Element and the Group VIII Element are killer elements inhibiting the luminescence of the present nitride phosphor therefore they are preferably removed to the outside of a system. To the contrary, since Cr, Ni and the like have an effect of shortening afterglow, about 0.1 ppm to several tens ppm may be contained.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, in the first nitride phosphor too, it is preferable that elements which are different from the elements contained in the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor are 1000 ppm or less based on the weight of the elements contained in the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor. When they are within this range, high brightness can be kept while adjusting luminescence properties. The luminescence properties in the specification are color tone, brightness, afterglow, light output property for excitation intensity, luminescence efficiency and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, elements (the second different elements) which are different from the above-mentioned L, the above-mentioned M, the above-mentioned O, the above-mentioned N and the above-mentioned R may be contained in the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor, other than at least one or more of elements selected from the Group I Element consisting of Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs, the Group V Element consisting of V, Nb and Ta, the Group VI Element consisting of Cr, Mo and W, the Group VII Element consisting of Re and the Group VIII Element consisting of Fe, Co, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Ru, or together with those elements.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The nitride phosphor which is represented by the general formula L<sub>X</sub>M<sub>Y</sub>N<sub>((2/3)X+(4/3)Y)</sub>:R or L<sub>X</sub>M<sub>Y</sub>O<sub>Z</sub>N<sub>((2/3)X+(4/3)Y−(2/3)Z)</sub>:R is a nitride phosphor which emits light having the second luminescence spectrum which has a peak wave length at a yellow to red region and the like when light having the first luminescence spectrum which has a peak wave length at an ultra violet to blue region is irradiated. The luminescence intensity can be changed by containing the second different element in said nitride phosphor, without changing the color tone. The nitride phosphor having desired brightness can be provided thereby. Further, the adjustment of the brightness can be easily carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The above-mentioned different element and the second different element may be contained in raw materials when the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor is prepared. The nitride phosphor having desired brightness can be provided thereby, irrespective of whether those different elements and the second different element remain in the phosphor after preparation, or not. Further, the adjustment of the brightness can be easily carried out. Furthermore, the adjustment of the brightness can be carried out by controlling the kinds and contents of the above-mentioned different elements or the second different elements in the raw materials of the nitride phosphor of the present invention, for example, strontium nitride, calcium nitride, silicon nitride, europium oxide or europium nitride. Further, the purification step of the raw materials can be abbreviated when the contents of various elements which are contained in the raw materials are within the range capable of realizing the objective luminescence properties, and the simplification of the production step can be designed. Further, economic products can be supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, as the second different element, there may be contained at least one or more of elements selected from the Group I Element consisting of Cu, Ag and Au, the Group III Element consisting of B, Al, Ga and In, the Group IV Element consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn and Pb, the Group V Element consisting of P, Sb and Bi, and the Group VI Element consisting of S. The adjustment of the brightness of the base nitride phosphor can be carried out by these elements. Further, Al, B, Ga, In and the like can keep high brightness while adjusting the brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, the content of the above-mentioned second different element is preferably 1000 ppm or less. The adjustment of the luminescence properties can be easily carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, when the above-mentioned different element or the second different element is contained in the raw materials when the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor is prepared, they are preferably contained in the raw materials at a range of 1000 ppm or less. When they are within the range, the nitride phosphor having desired brightness can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The firing step at preparing the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor is preferably carried out under reductive atmosphere. Because the scattering of unnecessary elements contained is accelerated by firing in reductive atmosphere and the improvement of luminescence brightness can be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The first production process of the nitride phosphor of the present invention is characterized in including the first step which mixes in a wet process the oxide of R(R has at least one or more selected from the rare earth element in which Eu is essential among Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er and Lu.) with a compound in which there are contained at least one or more of elements selected from the Group I Element consisting of Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Cu, Ag and Au, the Group III Element consisting of B, Al, Ga and In, the Group IV Element consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn and Pb, the Group V Element consisting of V, Nb, Ta, P, Sb and Bi, the Group VI Element consisting of Cr, Mo, W and S, the Group VII Element consisting of Re and the Group VIII Element consisting of Fe, Co, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Ru; the second step of firing the mixture obtained by the first step; the third step in which the mixture obtained by the second step is mixed with at least any one of the nitride of L (L has at least one or more selected from the Group II Element consisting of Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn), the nitride of M and the oxide of M (M has at least one or more selected from the Group IV Element in which Si is essential among C, Si and Ge); and the fourth step of firing the mixture obtained from the third step in reductive atmosphere. The nitride phosphor having high brightness can be provided thereby. Further, the nitride phosphor having desired luminescence properties can be provided by the elements added.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is preferable that at least either of the above-mentioned second step and the above-mentioned fourth step carries out firing using a crucible and/or a furnace material in which there are contained at least one or more of elements selected from the Group I Element consisting of Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Cu, Ag and Au, the Group III Element consisting of B, Al, Ga and In, the Group IV Element consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn and Pb, the Group V Element consisting of V, Nb, Ta, P, Sb and Bi, the Group VI Element consisting of Cr, Mo, W and S, the Group VII Element consisting of Re and the Group VIII Element consisting of Fe, Co, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Ru. Because it is carried out so that the adjustment of the luminescence properties is further easily carried out by using a crucible and a furnace material which have elements capable of carrying out the luminescence properties. The Group I Element is used as a firing aid at production of the crucible and furnace material. Further, the Group I Element is an element which remains easily in a raw material. A crucible and a furnace material using the single body or the compound of these Group I Elements may be used, and firing treatment may be carried out by being mixed with a raw material of the base nitride phosphor. The adjustment of the luminescence properties can be carried out by using the crucible and the furnace material which contained the Group I Element. It is preferable to use the crucible and the furnace material which contains elements such as B, Au, Ga and In, in addition to the Group I Element. The brightness is improved by using those containing these.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">For the nitride phosphor related to the present invention, the element different from the composition of the nitride phosphor, or a compound containing the different element is added in the production step. However, said different element is scattered at firing step, therefore there is also a case that only the element having smaller amount than the initial addition amount is contained in the composition of the nitride phosphor which is the final product. Accordingly, a smaller amount than the compounding amounts at the initial addition of said different element is only contained in the composition of the nitride phosphor which is the final product. Further, when the particle diameter of the nitride phosphor is desired to be controlled, it can be controlled by adding said different element.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The third nitride phosphor related to the present invention is a nitride phosphor which has at least R (R has at least one or more selected from the rare earth element in which Eu is essential among Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er and Lu.), L (L has at least one or more selected from the Group II Element consisting of Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn), M (M has at least one or more selected from the Group IV Element in which Si is essential among C, Si and Ge), and at least one or more of elements selected from the Group I Element consisting of Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Cu, Ag and Au, the Group III Element consisting of B, Al, Ga and In, the Group IV Element consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn and Pb, the Group V Element consisting of V, Nb, Ta, P, Sb and Bi, the Group VI Element consisting of Cr, Mo, W and S, the Group VII Element consisting of Re and the Group VIII Element consisting of Fe, Co, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Ru; and said nitride phosphor is characterized in being produced by the above-mentioned first production process.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The first light emitting device related to the present invention is a light emitting device which has a light emitting element which emits light having the first luminescence spectrum which has a peak wave length of 500 nm or less and a phosphor which absorbs at least the portion of light having the above-mentioned first luminescence spectrum and emits light having the second luminescence spectrum which has at least one or more of peaks at a range of 520 to 780 nm, and the above-mentioned phosphor is characterized in being any one of the first nitride phosphor related to the present invention, the second nitride phosphor or the third nitride phosphor which was produced by the first production process related to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the first light emitting device, the above-mentioned nitride phosphor is excited by light which is emitted by a light emitting element having the first luminescence spectrum which has a peak wave length at a short wave length side region which is 500 nm or less from near ultra violet to visible light. The nitride phosphor excited emits light having the second luminescence spectrum which has a peak wave length at a yellow to red region of 520 nm to 780 nm. The light emitting device which can emit light of a bulb lamp color can be provided thereby. The electric bulb color is a range in which a point of 2700 to 2800K on the locus of black body radiation is made as a center in a white color according to the JIS Specification (JIS Z8110), and means a tinge having a tinge from yellow to red. Specifically, it means those having a luminescence color at the regions of (light) yellow red, (orange) pink, pink, (light) pink and (yellowish) white in the chromaticity coordinate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, according to the first production process related to the present invention, the phosphor whose particle diameter was controlled at a fixed range can be produced. Accordingly, the light emitting device having extremely little color unevenness can be realized by using the phosphor whose particle diameter was controlled at a fixed range in the above-mentioned first light emitting device. Further, the light emitting device having high brightness can be provided thereby. Furthermore, it has been conventionally difficult to change the luminescence properties without changing the color tone of a light emitting device, but the first light emitting device related to the present invention can change the luminescence properties without changing the color tone of the light emitting device because the nitride phosphor can be changed to desired luminescence properties by the effect of elements added.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is preferable that the first light emitting device has further one or more of phosphors which absorb the light of the above-mentioned first luminescence spectrum and at least the portion of the light of the above-mentioned second luminescence spectrum and emits light having the third luminescence spectrum which has at least one or more of peak wave lengths from a blue region to a green region, a yellow region, and a red region. Thus, the light emitting device having desired luminescence color such as not only a white color but also a pastel color can be provided by using the phosphor which emits light with various tinges in combination with the nitride phosphor related to the present invention. Further, the white color can be also finely adjusted to (yellowish) white, (greenish) white, (bluish) white and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The phosphor emitting the light of the above-mentioned third luminescence spectrum is preferably at least any one or more of a yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by at least cerium, a yttrium-gadolinium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by at least cerium, and a yttrium-gallium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by at least cerium. The light emitting device having desired luminescence color can be provided thereby. For example, when the nitride phosphor related to the present invention, a yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by cerium and the like are used, a white color having various tinges in excitation by visible light can be created by the combination of these phosphors.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The above-mentioned first light emitting device can emit light with various white colors (bluish white, reddish white and the like) by mixing 2 or more of the portion of light from the above-mentioned light emitting element, the portion of light from the phosphor having the above-mentioned second luminescence spectrum, and the portion of light from the phosphor having the above-mentioned third luminescence spectrum. Said light emitting device can provide a desired white color light emitting device by adjusting the compounding amounts of various phosphors. For example, the nitride phosphor is excited by the light emitting element having blue light to emit yellow red light, and the phosphor emitting light of the above-mentioned third luminescence spectrum is excited to emit yellow light, therefore the blue light passed between the nitride phosphor and the phosphor, and the yellow red light of the nitride phosphor and the yellow light of the phosphor are recognized as a white color for human eyes, by the principle with respect to the color mixture of light.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the present invention, the element different from the above-mentioned L, M, N, O and R, or the second different element is usually added by oxides or hydrides, but the present invention is not limited to this, and metals, nitrides, imides, amides or other inorganic salts may be well. Further, a condition in which they are previously contained in other raw materials may be well. Oxygen is occasionally contained in the composition of the above-mentioned nitride phosphor. It is considered that oxygen is introduced from various oxides being raw materials or oxygen is mixed during firing. The oxygen accelerates the effects of Eu diffusion, particle growth and the improvement of crystallinity. Namely, the similar effect can be obtained by replacing one compound which is used for raw materials, to metals, nitrides and oxides, but there is also a case that the effect of using oxides is rather big. The nitride phosphor has crystal configurations such as monoclinic and orthorhombic.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, the first and the second nitride phosphors related to the present invention can arbitrarily adjust the afterglow property. The afterglow property is important in a display device such as displays such as PDP, CRT and LCD on which displays are continuously and repeatedly carried out. The white light emitting device using a semiconductor light emitting element and a phosphor in combination is used as an outdoor display and an LCD back light. Short afterglow is required for the use. Accordingly, the afterglow can be suppressed by containing B, Mg, Cr, Ni, Al and the like in the base nitride phosphor of the phosphor.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The above-mentioned nitride phosphor has preferably a mean particle diameter of 2.5 to 15 μm. In particular, 3 to 8 μm is preferable. When the particle diameter is large, there are advantages that the luminescence brightness is improved and light take-out efficiency is improved, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described above, the first and the second nitride phosphors related to the present invention can easily adjust the luminescence properties such as color tone, brightness and afterglow. Further, the nitride phosphor can be provided by economic and simple production steps while controlling the luminescence properties. The first light emitting device related to the present invention can provide a light emitting device which has good luminescence efficiency and emits slightly reddish warm color white light. Furthermore, it can provide the nitride phosphor having a luminescence spectrum from yellow to red regions which is used in combination with a blue light emitting element and the like. Accordingly, the present invention has a technical meaning that the nitride phosphor, the production process of the nitride phosphor, and the light emitting device using thereof are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described above, according to the present invention, the nitride phosphor having a luminescence spectrum from yellow to red regions which can be used in combination with a blue light emitting element and the like can be provided. The light emitting device which has good luminescence efficiency and emits slightly reddish warm color-base white light can be provided using the nitride phosphor.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, the present invention could specify elements which lower the brightness of the phosphor and elements which improve the brightness of the phosphor. It can optimize the crucible and the material of the firing furnace thereby and can provide the phosphor having high brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, the nitride phosphor whose particle diameter was controlled at a fixed range can be provided. Furthermore, the present invention has an extremely important meaning that it can provide the nitride phosphor by which the improvement of the luminescence properties and durability was designed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the fourth nitride phosphor related to the present invention is a nitride phosphor containing at least one or more of the Group II Element selected from a group consisting of Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn, at least one or more of the Group IV Elements selected from a group consisting of C, Si, Ge, Sn, Ti, Zr and Hf, and N which is activated by at least one or more of the rare earth elements selected from a group consisting of Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er and Lu; and said nitride phosphor is characterized in containing 1 ppm or more and 10000 ppm or less of B. The improvement of the luminescence properties such as luminescence brightness, quantum efficiency and the like can be designed thereby. The reason why the effect is obtained is that it is considered that the diffusion of an activator occurs by addition of a boron element and the growth of a particle is accelerated. Further, it is considered that the boron element invades in the crystal lattices of the nitride phosphor, corrects the distortion of said crystal lattices and directly participates in the luminescence mechanism, therefore the improvement of the luminescence properties such as luminescence brightness, quantum efficiency and the like is designed.</p>

The improvement of the luminescence properties such as luminescence brightness, quantum efficiency and the like can be designed thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The sixth nitride phosphor related to the present invention is a nitride phosphor which absorbs the portion of light having the first luminescence spectrum and emits light having the second luminescence spectrum at a region different from the above-mentioned first luminescence spectrum, and characterized in that there is contained B which was added so that the addition amount can be freely controlled for the raw material of the above-mentioned nitride phosphor. The adjustment of the luminescence properties such as luminescence brightness, quantum efficiency, afterglow and the like can be carried out. When boron is not added, the luminescence properties such as luminescence brightness, quantum efficiency and the like are constant, but the luminescence brightness is designed to be improved and afterglow can be shortened, by adding boron. Since the luminescence properties differ in requested properties in accordance with uses such as illumination and display, it is required to change the luminescence properties at the same color tone.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, the first luminescence spectrum is obtained by excitation by an external device. It is preferable that the crystal configuration of the above-mentioned fifth and sixth nitride phosphors is a nitride phosphor being monoclinic or orthorhombic. The above-mentioned nitride phosphors can make the luminescence properties good by having a monoclinic or orthorhombic crystal configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As the above-mentioned rare earth element, one or more of elements in which Eu is essential are preferable.

The improvement of the luminescence properties such as luminescence brightness, quantum efficiency and the like can be carried out thereby. This is considered because the above-mentioned Group I Element works as a flux during synthesis and then the Group I Element which worked as the flux exists between phosphor particles, or the luminescence itself of the phosphor is hardly inhibited because the Group I Element is scattered during its production steps. Further, the particle diameter of the nitride phosphor can be controlled by containing the Group I Element in the nitride phosphor.</p>

The light emitting device having high brightness can be provided thereby. The larger the mean particle diameter of the nitride phosphor is, the higher the luminescence brightness is, but when it is 15 μm or more, it is hardly coated and treated when it is used for a light emitting device. On the other hand, the smaller the mean particle diameter of the nitride phosphor is, the more homogeneously the phosphor emits light when it is coated on the fluorescent face of the light emitting device, but there are problems that the luminescence brightness is low and it is hardly treated during coating and production. Accordingly, the mean particle diameter having the above-mentioned range is preferable.</p>

A light emitting device having high luminescence efficiency which emits white color light can be provided by the second light emitting device. For example, the nitride phosphor is excited by the light emitting element having blue light to emit yellow red light, and the phosphor emits excited yellow light, therefore the blue light passed between the nitride phosphor and the phosphor, the yellow red light of the nitride phosphor and the yellow light of the phosphor are recognized as a white color for human eyes, by the principle concerning the color mixture of light.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the seventh to tenth nitride phosphors related to the present invention are any one of nitride phosphors which absorb at least the portion of light having the first luminescence spectrum and emits light having the second luminescence spectrum which is different from the above-mentioned first luminescence spectrum. They are the phosphor comprising the system below.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The seventh nitride phosphor related to the present invention is characterized in being an L-M-N:Eu, WR-base phosphor (wherein L contains at least one or more selected from a group of II valency consisting of Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn. M contains at least one or more selected from a group of IV valency consisting of C, Si, Ge, Sn, Ti, Zr and Hf. N is nitrogen. Eu is europium. WR is the rare earth element.). According to the seventh nitride phosphor related to the present invention, the improvement of the luminescence efficiencies such as high brightness and high quantum efficiency can be carried out. Further, the phosphor having extremely good temperature characteristic can be provided. In the seventh phosphor, a co-activator plays a role as a melting agent by combination of Eu being an activator and the rare earth element being a co-activator, and exhibits a flux effect. It is considered that the improvement of the luminescence efficiencies is carried out by the flux effect in the seventh phosphor, and it is considered that since the co-activator plays a role as a melting agent, sensitization action is exhibited and the luminescence efficiencies are improved. The fluorescence sensitization means that a sensitizer being an energy donor is activated together for enhancing luminescence intensity, utilizing the transmission action of energy.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The seventh nitride phosphor related to the present invention converts the wave length of light of the first luminescence spectrum which is discharged from, for example, a light emitting element, a lamp and the like, and emits light having the second luminescence spectrum which is situated at a region different from the first luminescence spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Further, the eighth nitride phosphor related to the present invention is characterized in being an L-M-O—N:Eu, WR (wherein L contains at least one or more selected from a group of II valency consisting of Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn. M contains at least one or more selected from a group of IV valency consisting of C, Si, Ge, Sn, Ti, Zr and Hf. O is oxygen. N is nitrogen. Eu is europium. WR is the rare earth element.). In the eighth phosphor, an oxide can be used as a raw material. Further, when the phosphor is produced, it is considered that oxygen is contained in a composition, but in the eighth nitride phosphor related to the present invention, a phosphor having high luminescence efficiencies can be provided even when oxygen is contained in the composition during the firing step.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The ninth nitride phosphor related to the present invention is characterized in being a Ca—Si—N:Eu, WR-base, or Sr—Si—N:Eu, WR-base, or Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu, WR-base silicon nitride (wherein WR is the rare earth element.). The phosphor having the second luminescence spectrum at a long wave length region can be provided thereby. The principle is that when light having the first luminescence spectrum nearby 460 nm is irradiated to the phosphor, the wave length conversion of said first luminescence spectrum is carried out, and the phosphor comes to have the second luminescence spectrum at a long wave length side of 580 to 700 nm. Further, in like manner as the above-mentioned description, the phosphor having high luminescence efficiencies can be provided by the flux effect and the sensitization effect in accordance with the introduction of a co-activator. Further, the phosphor having different color tone can be provided by co-activation. The color tone is determined by the x value and y value in a chromaticity chart. For example, in Table 8, the phosphor co-activated is shifted to a red side in comparison with a phosphor which is not co-activated. When a red component is desired to be strengthened, the ninth phosphor related to the present invention is extremely effective. Further, short afterglow and long afterglow can be made by carrying out co-activation. For example, when the light emitting device using the phosphor is used for a display, the shorter the afterglow is, the better it is, therefore it can be used as the phosphor for short afterglow.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As the light having the first luminescence spectrum, there is light from a light emitting element, a light emitting element lamp and the like which has a luminescence spectrum at a short wave length side of 360 to 495 nm. In the present ninth phosphor, it is preferable that it is used in combination with a blue light emitting element mainly having a luminescence spectrum at a short wave length side of 440 to 480 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">On the other hand, the second luminescence spectrum is a spectrum of light which the excited phosphor in which the phosphor is excited by the portion of light having the first luminescence spectrum emits. It is situated at a region different from the first luminescence spectrum. It is preferable that the second luminescence spectrum has at least one peak wave length nearby 560 to 700 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The phosphor related to the present invention has a peak wave length nearby 600 to 680 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The tenth nitride phosphor related to the present invention is characterized in being a Ca—Si—O—N:Eu, WR-base, or Sr—Si—O—N:Eu, WR-base, or Sr—Ca—Si—O—N:Eu, WR-base silicon nitride (wherein WR is the rare earth element.). The tenth phosphor can be prepared using an oxide raw material. Further, in like manner as the above-mentioned description, the phosphor having high luminescence efficiencies can be provided by the flux effect and the sensitization effect in accordance with the introduction of a co-activator.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the seventh to tenth nitride phosphors related to the present invention, it is preferable that at least one or more among Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er and Lu are contained as the above-mentioned WR. The phosphor having high luminescence efficiencies can be provided by using Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er and Lu among the rare earth element being a co-activator. It is considered that Y, La, Gd, Lu and the like have no luminescence center, therefore this is caused by the flux effect. Further, Pr, Dy, Tb, Ho, Er and the like among the rare earth element have the luminescence center, and it is considered that this is caused by the sensitization effect and the sensitization effect.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the seventh to tenth phosphors related to the present invention, the amount of the above-mentioned WR added is preferably 10.0% by weight or less. When the amount of Eu being a co-activator and the concentration of WR being a co-activator exceed a fixed amount, the concentration quenching occurs and the luminescence efficiency are lowered, therefore it is preferable to add the co-activator WR within the above-mentioned range.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the eighth and tenth phosphors related to the present invention, the content of the above-mentioned O is preferably 3.0% by weight or less based on the total composition amount. Oxygen is contained in the composition of the fifth and seventh phosphors related to the present invention. This is contained when an oxide is mainly used as a raw material. It is considered that the oxide raw material works as a melting agent. When these oxide raw materials are used, they are generally cheap in comparison with a metal raw material, therefore the cost of a raw material can be reduced. However, oxygen in the composition of the phosphor related to the present invention lowers occasionally the luminescence efficiencies. Accordingly, it is preferable that oxygen is removed to the outside of a system as much as possible. Then, comparing and considering the above-mentioned merit and demerit, the oxygen concentration in the composition of the above-mentioned phosphors was determined within the above-mentioned range. However, even if it is out of the above-mentioned range, adequate luminescence efficiencies are exhibited, therefore it is not limited within the range.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, Mn is preferably added in the seventh to tenth phosphors related to the present invention. When the Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu, WR-base phosphor in which Mn or a Mn compound was added at production process is used, the luminescence efficiencies such as luminescence brightness, quantum efficiency and energy efficiency was improved than the Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu, WR-base phosphor in which Mn was not added. This is considered because the Mn or a Mn compound accelerates the diffusion of Eu<sup>2+</sup> being an activator and enlarges the particle diameter, and crystallinity was improved. Further, this is considered because Mn works as a sensitizer in the phosphor in which Eu<sup>2+</sup> is an activator and the increase of the luminescence intensity of the Eu<sup>2+</sup> activator was carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">When Mn or a Mn compound was added at the production steps of the above-mentioned seventh to tenth phosphors, Mn is scattered at the firing step, and there is also a case that the less amount of Mn than the initial compounding amount added is contained in the composition of the phosphor being the final product. Accordingly, only the less amount of Mn than the initial compounding amount added is contained in the composition of the phosphor being the final product.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Oxides or hydroxy oxide products such as MnO<sub>2</sub>, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>and MnOOH as the Mn added in the above-mentioned seventh to tenth phosphors are usually added, but it is not limited to these, a Mn metal, a Mn nitride, an imide, an amide or other inorganic salts thereof. Further, a condition in which it is previously contained in other raw material may be well. Further, with respect to the above-mentioned seventh to tenth phosphors, O is contained in the composition. It is considered that O is introduced from various Mn compounds being a raw material, or accelerates the effects of Eu diffusion, particle growth and the improvement of crystallinity. Namely, with respect to the effect of the Mn addition, similar effect is obtained even if a Mn compound is changed to a metal, nitride and oxide, and the effect of a case of using an oxide is rather great. As a result, a phosphor in which a trace amount of O is contained in the composition of the phosphor is produced. Even if a compound not containing oxygen in the Mn compound is used, O is introduced by other raw material such as Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, atmosphere and the like, and the above mentioned problems are solved thereby even if a compound containing oxygen is not used.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The addition amount of Mn in the seventh to tenth phosphors is preferably 0.001 to 0.3 mol based on L (Sr—Ca, Sr, Ca and the like). In particular, the addition amount of Mn in the above-mentioned phosphor is preferably 0.0025 to 0.03 mol based on L (Sr—Ca, Sr, Ca and the like). The luminescence efficiencies such as luminescence brightness, quantum efficiency and energy efficiency can be improved by adding Mn in the phosphor during production step or in a raw material.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the above-mentioned seventh to tenth phosphors, the residual amount of Mn is preferably 5000 ppm or less. The luminescence efficiencies can be improved by adding Mn in the above-mentioned phosphor. However, since Mn is scattered during firing and the like, the amount of Mn added in a raw material is different from the amount of Mn in the composition after production.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the above-mentioned seventh to tenth phosphors, it is preferable that there are contained at least one or more selected from a group consisting of Mg, Sr, Ba, Zn, Ca, Ga, In, B, Al, Cu, Li, Na, K, Re, Ni, Cr, Mo, O and Fe. The luminescence efficiencies such as luminescence brightness and quantum efficiency can be improved by adding elements such as Mn and B in the above-mentioned phosphors. The reason is considered to be that the particle diameter of powder becomes homogeneous and big by containing the component constituting elements such as Mg and B in the base nitride phosphor such as Eu and WR, and crystallinity is remarkably improved. The wave length of the portion of light having the first luminescence spectrum can be converted at high efficiency by improving the crystallinity, and the phosphor having good luminescence efficiencies is obtained. Further, the afterglow property of the phosphor can arbitrarily be adjusted by adding the above-mentioned element. The afterglow property is important in a display device such as a display and PDP on which displays are continuously and repeatedly carried out. To the contrary, the afterglow can be suppressed by slightly containing B, Mg, Cr, Ni, Al and the like in the base nitride phosphor of the phosphor. The phosphor related to the present invention can be used for a display device such as a display. Further, even if an oxide such as H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3 </sub>is added for adding B and the like, the luminescence properties are not lowered, and it is considered that O plays also an important role in the diffusion process as described above. Thus, the particle diameter of the phosphor, crystallinity and energy transmission passage are changed by containing the component constituting elements such as Mg and B in the above-mentioned silicone nitride, absorption, reflection and scattering are changed, and the luminescence properties of a light emitting device such as luminescence and take-out of light, afterglow and the like are changed. In other word, the phosphor having the optimum luminescence properties at constituting a light emitting device can be produced by adjusting these.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Further, Sr, Ca, B and the like are mixed with the base nitride phosphor of L-M-N:Eu, WR to be a mix crystal. The peak wave length can be shifted to a short wave length side or a long wave length side by being the mix crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The above-mentioned seventh to tenth phosphors are preferably a mean particle diameter of 3 μm or more. The phosphors of Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu, WR-base, Sr—Si—N:Eu, WR-base, and Ca—Si—N:Eu, WR-base are a mean particle diameter of about 1 to 2 μm, but the above-mentioned silicon nitride to which Mn was added can be a mean particle diameter of 3 μm or more. According to the difference of the particle diameter, there are advantages that the larger the particle diameter is, the more the luminescence brightness of the phosphor is improved, and the light take-out efficiency in a light emitting device is raised, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The third light emitting device related to the present invention is a light emitting device which has at least a light emitting element which emits light having the first luminescence spectrum and a phosphor which absorbs at least the portion of light of the above-mentioned first luminescence spectrum and emits light having the second luminescence spectrum which is different from the above-mentioned first luminescence spectrum; and the above-mentioned phosphor is characterized in using any one of the seventh to tenth phosphors related to the present invention. The light emitting device which emits light being a different color from the color which the light emitting device has can be provided thereby. For example, the light emitting device which emits light of a white color by combining blue and yellow, red and blue green, green and red purple and the like which are in the relation of a complementary color. However, it is not limited to the white color, but the light emitting device having a desired luminescence color can be provided. Specifically, there can be constituted the light emitting device which emits a warm color-base white color which is slightly reddish by mixing blue light which is emitted from a blue light emitting element and yellow red light which was emitted by the wave length conversion by the phosphor, by using the blue light emitting element which has the first luminescence spectrum nearby 440 to 480 nm and using the Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu, WR-base phosphor which carries out the wave length conversion of the portion of light of said first luminescence spectrum and emits light of the second luminescence spectrum at 600 to 660 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The phosphor used for the third light emitting device related to the present invention is not limited to one kind, and a combination of 2 or more of phosphors having different peak wave lengths can be used. For example, the Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu, WR-base phosphor has a luminescence spectrum nearby 650 nm, and on the contrary, the Sr—Si—N:Eu, WR-base phosphor has a luminescence spectrum nearby 620 nm. The phosphor having peak wave length at a desired position within a wave length range of 620 to 650 nm can be produced. The light emitting device using the phosphor which combined 2 kind of phosphors can make a luminescence color different from a light emitting device using only one phosphor.

The light emitting device which is constituted by the combination of the blue light emitting element and the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by cerium exhibits a slightly pale white color, and since the warm color tinge was insufficient, the warm color tinge was compensated by containing the phosphor related to the present invention. Further, the light emitting device having a white color with various tinges can be provided by appropriately changing the compounding amount of the phosphors.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As described above, the third light emitting device related to the present invention has a technical meaning that the light emitting device having good luminescence efficiency which emits light of a warm color-base reddish white color can be provided.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As described above, according to the third light emitting device of the present invention, it has extremely important technical meanings that the light emitting device having good luminescence efficiency which emits light of a warm color-base reddish white color can be provided; further, the phosphor having a luminescence spectrum at yellow to red regions which is used in combination with a blue light emitting element and the like can be provided; and further, the phosphor in which the improvement of efficiency and durability was designed can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the eleventh to thirteenth phosphors related to the present invention is a phosphor which absorbs at least the portion of light having the first luminescence spectrum and emits light having the second luminescence spectrum which is different from the above-mentioned first luminescence spectrum, and consists of silicon nitride below.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The eleventh phosphor related to the present invention is characterized in being a Sr—Ca—Si—N:R-base silicon nitride phosphor comprises Mn wherein R is one or more rare earth elements in which Eu is essential. The phosphor having the second luminescence spectrum at a long wave length side can be provided thereby. Namely, when light having the first luminescence spectrum nearby 460 nm is irradiated to the eleventh phosphor, the wave length conversion of said first luminescence spectrum is carried out, and light having the second luminescence spectrum at a long wave length side of 580 to 700 nm is emitted.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The Sr—Ca—Si—N:R-base silicon nitride phosphor in which Mn or a Mn compound was added at production process improves the luminescence efficiencies such as luminescence brightness, quantum efficiency and energy efficiency than the Sr—Ca—Si—N:R-base silicon nitride phosphor in which Mn was not added. This is considered because the Mn or a Mn compound accelerates the diffusion of Eu<sup>2+</sup> being an activator and enlarges the particle diameter, and crystallinity was improved. Further, this is considered because Mn works as a sensitizer in the phosphor in which Eu<sup>2+</sup> is an activator and the increase of the luminescence intensity of the Eu<sup>2+</sup> activator was carried out. The fluorescence sensitization means that a sensitizer which is an energy donor is activated together for enhancing luminescence intensity utilizing energy transmission action.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Hereat, the first luminescence spectrum is, for example, light from a light emitting element, a light emitting element lamp and the like which has a luminescence spectrum at a short wave length side of 360 to 495 nm. It is preferable that the light emitting element at this wave length is a blue light emitting element having a luminescence spectrum nearby 440 to 480 nm. On the other hand, the second luminescence spectrum is a luminescence spectrum at a wave length region different from the first luminescence spectrum, and a luminescence spectrum of light which the excited phosphor in which the phosphor is excited by at least the portion of light having the first luminescence spectrum emits (wavelength conversion). It is preferable that the second luminescence spectrum has one peak wave length nearby 560 to 700 nm, as at least one portion. The eleventh phosphor related to the present invention has a peak wave length nearby 600 to 680 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Mn or a Mn compound is added at the production process of the above-mentioned and later-mentioned silicon nitride phosphors, Mn is scattered at the firing step, and there is also a case that the less trace amount of Mn than the initial compounding amount added is contained in the composition of the silicon nitride phosphor being the final product. Accordingly, there remains the less amount of Mn than the initial compounding amount added in the composition of the silicon nitride phosphor being the final product.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The twelfth phosphor related to the present invention is characterized in being a Sr—Si—N:R-base silicon nitride phosphor comprises Mn wherein R is one or more rare earth elements in which Eu is essential. In case of the silicon nitride of this system, luminescence efficiency is more improved by adding Mn at a production step than a case of not adding Mn. The effect which Mn exerts to the Sr—Si—N:Eu-base silicon nitride is similar as the above description, and this is considered because the Mn accelerates the diffusion of Eu<sup>2+</sup> being an activator and enlarges the particle diameter, and crystallinity was improved. Further, this is considered because Mn works as a sensitizer in the phosphor in which Eu<sup>2+</sup> is an activator and the increase of the luminescence intensity of the Eu<sup>2+</sup> activator was carried out. The Sr—Si—N:R-base silicon nitride phosphor related to the present invention has a composition and luminescence spectrum different from the above-mentioned Sr—Ca—Si—N:R-base silicon nitride phosphor, and has a peak wave length nearby 610 to 630 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The thirteenth phosphor related to the present invention is characterized in being a Ca—Si—N:R-base silicon nitride phosphor comprises Mn wherein R is one or more rare earth elements in which Eu is essential. The effect of adding Mn is similar as the above description. However, the Ca—Si—N:R-base silicon nitride to which Mn was added has a peak wave length nearby 600 to 620 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Mn which is added to the silicon nitride constituting the above-mentioned eleventh to thirteenth phosphors is usually added by oxides or hydroxy oxide products such as MnO<sub>2</sub>, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>and MnOOH, but it is not limited to these, and may be a Mn metal, a Mn nitride, an imide, an amide or other inorganic salts thereof. Further, a condition in which it is previously contained in other raw material may be well. Further, O is contained in the composition of the above-mentioned silicon nitride. It is considered that O is introduced from various Mn compounds being a raw material, or accelerates the effects of Eu diffusion, particle growth and the improvement of crystallinity. Namely, with respect to the effect of the Mn addition, a similar effect is obtained even if a Mn compound is changed to a metal, nitride and oxide. The effect of a case of using an oxide is rather great. As a result, the phosphor in which a trace amount of O is contained in the composition of silicon nitride is produced. Accordingly, the base nitride phosphor are Sr—Ca—Si—O—N:R, Sr—Si—O—N:R and Ca—Si—O—N:R. Thus, even if a compound not containing oxygen in the Mn compound is used, O is introduced by other raw material such as Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, atmosphere and the like, and Eu diffusion, particle growth and the improvement of crystallinity are accelerated by Mn even if a compound containing oxygen is not used.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The content of the above-mentioned O is preferably 3% by weight or less based on the amount of total composition. The luminescence efficiency can be improved thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the above-mentioned silicon nitride, it is preferable that there are contained at least one or more selected from a group consisting of Mg, Sr, Ca, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn, Cr and Ni. The luminescence efficiencies such as luminescence brightness and quantum efficiency can be improved by containing at least the component constituting elements such as Mn and B in the above-mentioned silicon nitride. The reason is considered to be that the particle diameter of powder becomes homogeneous and big by containing the component constituting elements such as Mg and B in the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor, and crystallinity is remarkably improved. The wave length of the first luminescence spectrum can be converted at high efficiency by improving the crystallinity, and the phosphor having good luminescence efficiencies which has the second luminescence spectrum is obtained. Further, the afterglow property of the phosphor can be arbitrarily adjusted. The afterglow property is important in a display device such as a display and PDP on which displays are continuously and repeatedly carried out. Accordingly, the afterglow can be suppressed by slightly containing B, Mg, Cr, Ni, Al and the like in the base nitride phosphor of the phosphor. Thus, the phosphor related to the present invention can be used for a display device such as a display. Further, even if oxides such as MnO<sub>2</sub>, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>and H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3 </sub>are added for adding B and the like, the luminescence properties are not lowered, and it is considered that O plays also an important role in the diffusion process as described above. Thus, the particle diameter of the phosphor, crystallinity and energy transmission passage are changed by containing the component constituting elements such as Mg and B in the above-mentioned silicone nitride, absorption, reflection and scattering are changed, and the luminescence properties in a light emitting device such as luminescence and take-out of light, afterglow and the like are changed. In other word, the phosphor utilized for a light emitting device is optimized by utilizing this.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">With respect to the Sr—Ca—Si—N:R-base silicon nitride, the molar ratio of Sr to Ca is preferably Sr:Ca=1 to 9:9 to 1. In particular, for the Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu-base silicon nitride, the molar ratio of Sr to Ca is preferably Sr:Ca=1:1. The second luminescence spectrum can be shifted to a long wave length side by changing the molar ratio of Sr to Ca. In the later-mentioned Table 501, with respect to the phosphors having a composition of Sr:Ca=9:1 and Sr:Ca=1:9, the peak wave length is 624 nm and 609 nm, and to the contrary, when the molar ratio of Sr to Ca is gradually changed to Sr:Ca=7:3, Sr:Ca=6:4, and Sr:Ca=3:7, Sr:Ca=4:6, the peak wave length is 639 nm, 643 nm, and 636 nm, 642 nm and thus, the peak wave length can be shifted to a long wave length side. Thus, the phosphor having the peak wave length at a longer wave length side can be produced. Further, when the molar ratio of Sr to Ca is changed, there can be produced the phosphor having the peak wave length at the longest wave length side in which the peak wave length is 644 nm. The luminescence brightness can be improved by changing the molar ratio of Sr to Ca. In Table 1, the luminescence property at Sr:Ca=9:1 is referred to as 100%. When the molar amount of Ca is increased against Sr, the luminescence brightness is 170.3% at Sr:Ca=1:9 and the luminescence brightness is improved by 70.3%. Further, the quantum efficiency is improved by changing the molar ratio of Sr to Ca. In Table 501, the quantum efficiency was 100% at Sr:Ca=9:1, but the quantum efficiency is improved to be 167.7% at Sr:Ca=5:5. Thus, the luminescence efficiency can be improved by changing the molar ratio of Sr to Ca.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The compounding amount of R in the above-mentioned phosphor is preferably 0.003 to 0.5 mol based on Sr—Ca, Sr and Ca. In particular, the compounding amount of R in the above-mentioned phosphor is preferably 0.005 to 0.1 mol based on Sr—Ca, Sr and Ca. The peak wave length can be shifted to a long wave length side by changing the compounding amount of R. Further, the luminescence efficiencies such as luminescence brightness and quantum efficiency can be improved. In the later-mentioned Tables 16 to 18, there are shown test results in which the compounding amount of Eu in the Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu-base silicon nitride was changed. For example, in Table 16, when Eu is 0.005 mol based on Sr—Ca at Sr:Ca=7:3, the peak wave length is 624 nm, the luminescence brightness is 100% and the quantum efficiency is 100%, but when Eu is 0.03 mol, the peak wave length is 637 nm, the luminescence brightness is 139.5% and the quantum efficiency is 199.2%, and the luminescence characteristics become extremely good.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The addition amount of Mn in the above-mentioned phosphor is preferably 0.001 to 0.3 mol based on Sr—Ca, Sr and Ca. In particular, the addition amount of Mn in the above-mentioned phosphor is preferably 0.0025 to 0.03 mol based on Sr—Ca, Sr and Ca. The luminescence efficiencies such as luminescence brightness, energy efficiency and quantum efficiency can be improved by adding Mn in the silicon nitride phosphor during production steps or in a raw material. In the Tables 405 to 409 mentioned later, there are shown the test results in which the addition amount of Mn in the Ca—Si—N:Eu-base silicon nitride was changed. For example, in Tables 19 to 23, when the luminescence brightness is 100% and the quantum efficiency is 100% based on the silicon nitride phosphor to which no Mn was added, the luminescence brightness is 115.3% and the quantum efficiency is 117.4% for the silicon nitride phosphor to which 0.015 mol of Mn based on Ca was added. Thus, the luminescence efficiencies such as luminescence brightness and quantum efficiency can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">It is preferable that the above-mentioned phosphor consists of any one of combinations of the eleventh phosphor and the twelfth phosphor, the twelfth phosphor and the thirteenth phosphor, and the eleventh phosphor and the thirteenth phosphor. For example, the phosphor consisting of the combinations of the eleventh phosphor and the twelfth phosphor means the phosphor mixing the Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu-base silicon nitride phosphor with the Sr—Si—N:Eu-base silicon nitride phosphor. For example, the Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu-base silicon nitride phosphor has the luminescence spectrum nearby 650 nm, and on the contrary, the Sr—Si—N:Eu-base silicon nitride phosphor has the luminescence spectrum nearby 620 nm. The phosphor having the peak wave length at a desired position at a wave length range of 620 to 650 nm can be produced by mixing the desired amount of the mixed phosphor. In addition to the above-mentioned combinations, there can be also produced the phosphor mixing the Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu-base silicon nitride phosphor with the Ca—Si—N:Eu-base silicon nitride phosphor, and the phosphor mixing the Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu-base silicon nitride phosphor, the Sr—Si—N:Eu-base silicon nitride phosphor and the Ca—Si—N:Eu-base silicon nitride phosphor. The phosphor having the peak wave length at a desired position at a wave length range of 600 to 680 nm can be produced by these combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The eleventh to thirteenth phosphors related to the present invention are preferably a phosphor characterized in having a particle diameter of 3 μm or more. The Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu-base, Sr—Si—N:Eu-base and Ca—Si—N:Eu-base silicon nitride phosphors to which no Mn is added have a particle diameter of about 1 to 2 μm, but the above-mentioned silicon nitrides to which Mn is added have a particle diameter of 3 μm or more. There are advantages that when the particle diameter is large, the luminescence brightness is improved by the difference of the particle diameter, and the light take-out efficiency is improved, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">With respect to the eleventh to thirteenth phosphors related to the present invention, the residual amount of Mn is preferably 5000 ppm or less. Because the above-mentioned effects are obtained by adding Mn in the eleventh to thirteenth phosphors related to the present invention. However, since Mn is scattered at firing, the amount of Mn added in a raw material is different from the amount of Mn in the composition after production.</p>

<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The production process of a conventional phosphor (for example, described in International Open Patent No. 01/40403) is that raw materials such as an adequately purified mother body and an activator were mixed, then, the mixture is charged in a molybdenum crucible and it is conducted through a step of being baked in a furnace.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In the method described in the International Open Patent No. 01/40403, the step of firing is carried out under a mix gas atmosphere of hydrogen (3.75%) and nitrogen (400 l/h).

In Table 32, Comparative Example 10 and Example which is related with the third production process related to the present invention are carried out under the same condition excluding the step of firing. Comparative Example 10 is baked in hydrogen and nitrogen atmosphere, and Example of the present invention is baked in ammonia atmosphere. As a result, the brightness of Example of the present invention is higher by 18% than that of Comparative Example 10. It shows an extremely superior result that there was the improvement of brightness by 18%, and it has a technical meaning. Further, energy efficiency is improved by 17.6%.

<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The above-mentioned firing is preferably carried out using a crucible made of a boron nitride material. A molybdenum crucible is used in the cited literature. The molybdenum crucible has fears of inhibiting luminescence and inhibiting a reaction system. On the other hand, when the crucible made of a boron nitride material in the present invention is used, it does not inhibit luminescence and inhibit a reaction system, therefore the nitride phosphor having extremely high purity can be produced.

Further, the nitride phosphor having good temperature characteristic can be provided. The relation of the molar ratio is more preferably L:R=1:0.003 to 0.05.

The light emitting device suppressing the generation of chromaticity deviation can be provided thereby. In particular, since color deviation is generated along the locus of blackbody radiation in the present light emitting device, the color deviation is felt little in human vision in comparison with a case in which the color deviation is generated to a direction of perpendicular of locus of blackbody radiation.

<p id="p-0305" num="0304"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a section view showing the type 3 light emitting device III related to the present invention, and a cap type light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the same codes are named for the same members as the members of the type 1 light emitting device I, and illustration is abbreviated.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">The light emitting device III is constituted by covering a cap <b>16</b> comprising a transparent resin in which the phosphors are dispersed (not illustrated), on the surface of the mold member <b>15</b> of the light emitting device I. The phosphors are homogeneously dispersed in the transparent resin of the cap <b>16</b>. The transparent resin containing the phosphors is molded in a form which is fit in the form of the mold member <b>15</b> of the light emitting device I. Further, in place of the fitting, there may be also possible a production process that after the transparent resin containing the phosphors is charged in a fixed mold frame, the light emitting device I is pushed in said mold frame to be molded. As the specific material of the transparent resin of the cap <b>16</b>, there are used transparent resins excellent in temperature characteristic and weather resistance such as an epoxy resin, a urea resin, a silicone resin, silica sol, glass, an inorganic binder and the like. In addition to the above-mentioned materials, thermosetting resins such as a melamine resin and a phenol resin can be used. Further, there can be used also thermoplastic resins such as a polyethylene, a polypropylene, a polyvinyl chloride and a polystyrene, thermoplastic rubbers such as a styrene-butadiene block copolymer and a segmented polyurethane. Further, a dispersant, barium titanate, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide and the like may be contained together with the phosphors. Further, a light stabilizer, a coloring agent may be contained. The specific phosphors related to the present invention described later are used for the phosphors used for the cap <b>16</b>. The phosphors related to the present invention may be also used in the cup of the mount lead <b>13</b><i>a</i>. However, since the phosphors are used in the cap <b>16</b>, only the coating member <b>12</b> may be adequate in the cup of the mount lead <b>13</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">Thus, in the light emitting device III which was constituted as described above, the wave length of the portion of light discharged from the light emitting element <b>10</b> is converted by the phosphors when it passes through the cap <b>16</b>. The wave length converted light and the blue light whose wave length was not converted by the phosphor are mixed, and as a result, white color-base light is externally discharged from the surface of the cap <b>16</b>.</p>

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Phosphor of Mode of Operation of 11802003</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">The phosphor related to the present invention is a nitride phosphor which is represented by the general formula L<sub>X</sub>M<sub>Y</sub>N<sub>((2/3)X+(4/3)Y)</sub>:R or L<sub>X</sub>M<sub>Y</sub>O<sub>Z</sub>N<sub>((2/3)X+(4/3)Y−(2/3)Z)</sub>:R, and characterized in that an element (hereinafter, merely referred to as the “different element”) which is different from the above-mentioned L, the above-mentioned M, the above-mentioned O, the above-mentioned N and the above-mentioned R are contained in the nitride phosphor.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">Wherein L is at least one or more selected from the Group II Element consisting of Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn,</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">M is at least one or more selected from the Group IV Element in which Si is essential among C, Si and Ge, and</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">R is at least one or more selected from the rare earth element in which Eu is essential among Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er and Lu.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">In the general formula, X, Y and Z is an arbitrary figure larger than 0. In particular, X and Y is preferably X=2 and Y=5 or X=1 and Y=7. Specifically, it is preferable that the nitride phosphors represented by (Sr<sub>T</sub>Ca<sub>1−T</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>:Eu, Sr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>:Eu, Ca<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>:Eu, Sr<sub>T</sub>Ca<sub>1−T</sub>Si<sub>7</sub>N<sub>10</sub>:Eu, SrSi<sub>7</sub>N<sub>10</sub>:Eu, CaSrSi<sub>7</sub>N<sub>10</sub>:Eu and the like are used as the base nitride phosphor. Further, the different elements which are different from the above-mentioned L, the above-mentioned M, the above-mentioned O, the above-mentioned N and the above-mentioned R are contained in the base nitride phosphor. Said different elements are at least one or more of elements selected from the Group I Element consisting of Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Cu, Ag and Au, the Group III Element consisting of B, Al, Ga and In, the Group IV Element consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn and Pb, the Group V Element consisting of P, Sb and Bi, the Group VI Element consisting of S, the Group V Element consisting of V, Nb and Ta, the Group VI Element consisting of Cr, Mo and W, the Group VII Element consisting of Re and the Group VIII Element consisting of Fe, Co, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Ru. One or 2 or more of these different elements are contained in the nitride phosphor. The content of these different elements in the nitride phosphor is not specifically limited, but is preferably 1000 ppm or less based on the phosphor which is represented by the general formula L<sub>X</sub>M<sub>Y</sub>N<sub>((2/3)X+(4/3)Y)</sub>:R or L<sub>X</sub>M<sub>Y</sub>O<sub>Z</sub>N<sub>((2/3)X+(4/3)Y−(2/3)Z)</sub>:R. Because good luminescence properties can be obtained by setting the content as 1000 ppm or less. The content of these different elements is more preferably set at a range of 0.1 to 500 ppm in order to obtain further good luminescence efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">The addition amount of the different elements in the production process may be occasionally set at 500 ppm or more in order to set the addition amount of different elements at a range of 0.1 to 500 ppm in the phosphor after production, considering the scattered amount of the different elements in firing step. For example, there is a case that even if the amount of the different elements which are added in the raw material is set at 10000 ppm or more, the objective properties cannot be achieved because the different elements are scattered during the firing step in the production steps. However, even in such a case, it is preferable to adjust the amount so that the amount of the different elements become 1000 ppm or less in the final product, and the luminescence properties such as luminescence brightness can be adjusted thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">As described above, L consists of at least one or more among Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn. Namely, in the present invention, L may be one element and 2 or more elements may be contained as L.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">For example, the mixture of Sr and Ca can change the compounding ratio according to requirement. In this case, the peak wave length of luminescence spectrum is shifted to a longer wave length side by mixing Sr and Ca, than by using Sr or Ca alone. When the molar ratio of Sr and Ca is about 5:5, the peak wave length is shifted to the longest wave length side, and when the molar ratio of Sr and Ca is 7:3 or 3:7, the peak wave length is respectively shifted to a longer wave length side than by using Sr or Ca alone.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">M has at least one or more selected from the Group IV Element in which Si is essential among C, Si and Ge. Namely, in the present mode 1 of operation, only Si may be used as M, and either of a combination of C and Si, a combination of Ge and Si, a combination of C, Si and Ge may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">Thus, in the present mode 1 of operation, the nitride phosphor having good crystallinity is obtained by setting Si as essential in the composition of the nitride phosphor.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">As a more specific example, for example, those using 95% by weight of Si and 5% by weight of Ge are mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">R has at least one or more selected from the rare earth element in which Eu is essential among Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er and Lu. Namely, in the present mode 1 of operation, R may consisting of Eu alone, and contains Eu and may further contain one or 2 or more among the above-mentioned elements (the element other than Eu). Thus, in the mode 1 of operation, the nitride phosphor having good luminescence properties can be provided by specifying the element which is used as R.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">In Examples related to the mode 1 of operation described later, europium being the rare earth element is used as a luminescent center.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">Europium has mainly 2-valent and 3-valent energy levels. In the phosphor of the present mode 1 of operation, Eu<sup>3+</sup> is used for the alkali earth metal silicon nitride phosphor of mother-body as the activator. For example, it is preferable to use europium alone or europium nitride. Further, in the present mode 1 of operation, the color tone can be changed and the adjustment of luminescence efficiency can be carried out by activating Eu together with other activator such as Ce and Nd.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">In the present mode 1 of operation, the effect of adding the different elements which are different from the above-mentioned L, the above-mentioned M, the above-mentioned O, the above-mentioned N and the above-mentioned R exits in points that as described above, the diffusion of Eu<sup>3+</sup> is accelerated and luminescence properties such as color tone, luminescence brightness and afterglow can be improved. Further, since the particle diameter of phosphor particles can be enlarged, brightness can be improved. Further, Cr, Ni and the like have a function of shortening afterglow. The above-mentioned different element may be contained in raw materials which are used for producing the phosphor, and may be contained in a condition of a single body or a compound in the production steps and baked together with the raw materials. However, the above-mentioned different element is not occasionally contained in the nitride phosphor after firing. Even if it is contained, it may occasionally remain at a trace amount in comparison with the initially added amount (in raw materials or an amount added during the production steps). This is considered to be caused by the diffusion of the different element in the firing step.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">The phosphor related to the present mode 1 of operation absorbs the portion of light at an ultraviolet to blue region which was emitted by the light emitting element <b>10</b>, and emits light at a yellow to red region. When the phosphor related to the present mode 1 of operation is applied to, for example, the type 1 light emitting device I, the light emitting device which emits light of a warm color-base white color can be constituted by the color mixing of blue light emitted from the light emitting element <b>10</b> (light in which the wave length is not converted by the phosphor) and the red color of the phosphor.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">Further, in the light emitting device related to the present invention, in addition to the nitride phosphor related to the present mode 1 of operation, the light emitting device may have one or more of the phosphor which absorbs light of the first luminescence spectrum which was emitted by a light emitting element, and the portion of light having the second luminescence spectrum which is output from the nitride phosphor related to the present mode 1 of operation, and emits light different from the wave length of light absorbed, namely light having the third luminescence spectrum which has at least one or more peak wave lengths (from a blue region to a green region, a yellow region and a red region). Thus, the luminescence color can be made as a multi color. When such constitution is made, the phosphor having the third luminescence spectrum contains preferably at least one or more of the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by at least cerium, the yttrium-gadolinium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by at least cerium, and the yttrium-gallium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by at least cerium. Because a desired chromaticity can be easily adjusted by containing the above-mentioned the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor. Specifically, there can be used Ln<sub>3</sub>M<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:R (Ln is at least one or more selected from Y, Gd and La. M contains at least either of Al and Ga. R is Lanthanide series), (Y<sub>1−x</sub>Gd<sub>x</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(Al<sub>1−y</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>)O<sub>12</sub>:R(R is at least one or more selected from Ce, Tb, Pr, Sm, Eu, Dy and Ho. 0&lt;R&lt;0.5). These phosphors are excited by light at a short wave length side of a near ultraviolet to visible light, 270 to 500 nm, and has a peak wave length of a luminescence spectrum at 500 to 600 nm. However, in the present invention, the phosphor having the third luminescence spectrum is not limited to the above-mentioned phosphors, and various phosphors can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">The yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by cerium and the like absorbs the portion of blue light which was emitted from the light emitting element <b>10</b>, and emits light at a yellow region. Hereat, light becomes a pale white color by the color mixing of the blue light from the light emitting element <b>10</b> and the yellow light of the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor. Accordingly, the light emitting device which emits light of a warm color-base or electric bulb color-base white color can be constituted by using the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor and the above-mentioned nitride phosphor together with a coating member having transparency, and by the combination with the blue light from the light emitting element <b>10</b>. Further, the light emitting device having various spectrum distributions can be provided by appropriately changing the combination of the phosphors and the contents of the respective phosphors. Further, the warm color-base white color and redwish white color light emitting device means that the average color rendering index Ra is 75 to 95 and the color temperature is 2000 to 8000K. In the present invention, it is possible to produce a warm color-base white color light emitting device, an electric bulb color-base white color light emitting device, a white color light emitting device, a neutral white color light emitting device, daylight color light emitting device according to the JISZ9112 Specification. In the light emitting device related to the present invention, the preferable device in particular is a light emitting device in which the average color rendering index Ra and color temperature are situated at the locus of black body radiation in a chromaticity chart. However, it is needless to say that the compounding amount of the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor and the above-mentioned nitride phosphor together is appropriately changed in order to provide a light emitting device having a desired color temperature and the average color rendering index. The warm color-base white color light emitting device can further improve the specific color rendering index R9. With respect to a white color light emitting device which is the combination of a conventional blue light emitting element and the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by cerium, the specific color rendering index R9 is about near 0, and a red component was insufficient. Accordingly, it has been a solving problem to enhance the specific color rendering index R9, but the specific color rendering index R9 can be enhanced to 60 to 70 by containing the phosphor related to the present invention in the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor. Hereat, the specific color rendering index R9 is determined by using the respective color deviation of 7 color chips as a basis which is different from average rendering property, and not the average of 7 kinds. As 7 color chips, there are selected those which represent red having comparatively high chroma, yellow, green, blue, human skin (white people), the green of a leaf of a wood, human skin (Japanese). They are respectively called in order as R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14 and R15. Among these, R9 is a color chip which indicates red.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">Further, the phosphor which is used in combination with the nitride phosphor of the present invention is not limited to the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor and the like. The phosphor having at least one or more of peak wave lengths from a blue region to a green region, a yellow region, and a red region which can attain the similar purpose as the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor and has the third luminescence spectrum can be also used in combination with the above-mentioned nitride phosphor. The white color light emitting device according to the principle of color mixing of light can be provided thereby. As specific phosphor used in combination with the nitride phosphor, there are phosphors emitting green-base light such as SrAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:Eu, Y<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>:Ce, Tb, MgAl<sub>11</sub>O<sub>19</sub>:Ce, Tb, Sr<sub>7</sub>Al<sub>12</sub>O<sub>25</sub>:Eu (at least one or more among Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba)Ga<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>:Eu; phosphors emitting blue-base light such as Sr<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl:Eu, (BaCa)<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl:Eu, (SrCaBa)<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl:Eu, (at least one or more among Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba)<sub>2</sub>B<sub>5</sub>O<sub>9</sub>Cl:Eu,Mn, (at least one or more among Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba)(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>:Eu,Mn; phosphors emitting red-base light such as Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S:Eu, La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S:Eu, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Eu, Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S:Eu. Thus, a desired luminescence spectrum can obtained by changing the composition. However, luminescent phosphors such as green, blue, red and the like are not limited to the above-mentioned phosphors, and various phosphors can be used.</p>

As the material of semiconductor light emitting element, there can be mentioned various semiconductor such as BN, SiC, ZnSe and GaN, InGaN, InAlGaN, AlGaN, BAlGaN and BInAlGaN. Further, a luminescence center can be also made by containing Si, Zn and the like in these elements as impurity elements. As the material of the phosphor which can efficiently emit light at a short wave length region among an ultraviolet region to a visible light region which can efficiently excite the phosphor, nitride semiconductors (for example, a nitride semiconductor containing Al and Ga, In<sub>X</sub>Al<sub>Y</sub>Ga<sub>1−X−Y</sub>N, 0&lt;X&lt;1, 0&lt;Y&lt;1, X+Y≦1 as a nitride semiconductor containing In and Ga) are preferably mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">Further, as the structure of the semiconductor, there are preferably mentioned semiconductors of a homo structure, a hetero structure or a double hetero structure having a MIS junction, a PIN junction, a p-n junction and the like. A luminescence wave length can be variously selected by the material of semiconductor layers and mix crystal ratio. Further, output power can be also further improved by making a single quantum well structure and a multi quantum well structure in which a semiconductor activating layer was formed to be a thin film which generates quantum effect.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">When the nitride semiconductor is used, materials such as sapphire, spinel, SiC, Si, ZnO, GaAs and GaN are preferably used for a substrate. The sapphire substrate is preferably used for forming the nitride semiconductor having good crystallinity by mass production. The nitride semiconductor can be formed on the sapphire substrate using an HVPE method, a MOCVD method and the like. In this case, an amorphous buffer layer in which is GaN, AlN, GaAlN and the like were grown at a low temperature is formed on the sapphire substrate, and the nitride semiconductor having a p-n junction is formed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">The preparation example of the light emitting element capable of efficiently emitting light at an ultraviolet region which has a p-n junction using the nitride semiconductor is as below.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">Firstly, SiO<sub>2 </sub>is formed in a stripe form about perpendicular to an orifla face of a sapphire substrate on the buffer layer. The ELOG (Epitaxial Lateral Over Grows GaN) growth of GaN is carried out on it using an HVPE method. Successively, the first contact layer comprising n-GaN, the first clad layer comprising n-AlGaN, active layers having multi quantum well structure which laminated a plural number of layers of the well layers of InAlGaN and the barrier layers of AlGaN, the second clad layer comprising p-AlGaN, and the second contact layer comprising p-GaN are laminated in order by the MOCVD method.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">Further, it may be carried out as below without using the ELOG growth.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">For example, Si undoped n-GaN layer, n-contact layer comprising Si-doped n-GaN, undoped n-GaN layer, light emitting layer having multi quantum well structure (multi quantum well structure of GaN barrier layer/InGaN well layer), p-clad layer comprising Mg-doped p-GaN, and p-contact layer comprising Mg-doped p-GaN are laminated in order on a sapphire substrate through GaN buffer layer. Further, electrodes are formed as below.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362">P-Ohmic electrode is formed all over the surface on p-contact layer, and a p-pad electrode <b>3</b> is formed on the portion of p-ohmic electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">Further, the undoped GaN layer is removed from the p-contact layer by etching, the portion of n-contact layer is exposed, and an n-electrode is formed on the exposed portion.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">Further, the light emitting layer having multi quantum well structure was used in the present mode of operation, but the present invention is not limited to this. For example, it may be single quantum well structure utilizing InGaN, and GaN to which n-impurities and p-impurities such as Si, Zn and the like were doped may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">Further, the light emitting layer of the light emitting element <b>10</b> can change a main luminescence peak at a range of 420 nm to 490 nm by changing the content of In. Further, the wave length is not limited to the above-mentioned range, those having luminescence wave length at 360 to 550 nm can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366">Thus, a semiconductor light emitting element having double hetero structure is constituted on a substrate. In the present invention, there may be used a semiconductor laser element in which active layer is made as a ridge stripe shape and sandwiched by guide layer, and the edge surface of a resonator is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">A nitride semiconductor exhibits n-type electroconductivity in a condition in which it is not doped. However, it is preferable to set the carrier concentration of the respective layers within a fixed range for improving the luminescence efficiency. It is preferable to appropriately introduce Si, Ge, Se, Te, C and the like as n-type dopant for forming a desired n-type nitride semiconductor in which the carrier concentration is controlled. On the other hand, when p-type nitride semiconductor is formed, it is preferable to dope Zn, Mg, Be, Ca, Sr, Ba and the like. The nitride semiconductor is hardly made be p-type by only doping the p-type dopant, therefore it is preferable to make it be low resistance by carrying out heating by a furnace, a treatment by plasma irradiation and the like after introduction of the p-type dopant. When a structure in which a sapphire substrate is not removed is made, p- and n-contact layers are exposed at the same face side by partially etching from p-type side to the surface of the first contact layer, and the respective electrodes are formed on the respective contact layers. A light emitting element comprising the nitride semiconductor is prepared by cutting in a chip shape.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0368">In the light emitting device, the light emitting element is selected in the relation of an excitation wave length with the luminescence wave length of a phosphor used, in order to realize a luminescence color required, but then, it is appropriately selected considering the deterioration of a transparent resin by light and the like. In the present invention, those having a luminescence spectrum at an ultraviolet region and its main luminescence wave length is 360 nm or more and 420 nm or less, and those having 450 nm or more and 470 nm or less can be also used.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0369">Hereat, it is preferable to adjust the relation of the sheet resistance Rn of n-contact layer formed at an impurity concentration of 10<sup>17 </sup>to 10<sup>20</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>with the sheet resistance Rp of transparent p-electrode, to be Rp≧Rn in the semiconductor light emitting element. Specifically, since the n-contact layer is formed to have, for example, a film thickness of 3 to 10 μm and more preferably 4 to 6 μm, the sheet resistance Rn is estimated to be 10 to 15Ω/□. Accordingly, hereat, the Rp is preferably formed in a thin film to have a resistance value of the above-mentioned sheet resistance (10 to 15Ω/□) or more. Further, the transparent p-electrode may be formed in a thin film having a film thickness of 150 μm or less. Further, ITO and ZnO other than a metal can be used for the p-electrode. Hereat, an n-electrode mode equipped with a plural number of openings for light take-out such as a mesh electrode may be made in place of the transparent p-electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">Further, when the transparent p-electrode is formed by one kind selected from a group of gold and platinum and a multilayered film or alloy comprising at least one kind of other elements, stability and reproducibility are improved by adjusting the sheet resistance of the transparent p-electrode by the content of gold or platinum element contained. Since gold or a metal element has a high absorption coefficient at the wave length of the semiconductor light emitting element used for the present invention, the lesser the amount of gold or platinum element contained in the transparent p-electrode is, the better the transparency is. A conventional semiconductor light emitting element had the relation of the sheet resistance of Rp≦Rn, but in the present invention, since it is Rp≧Rn, the transparent p-electrode is formed in a thinner film in comparison with a conventional one. The thin film forming can be easily attained by reducing the amount of gold or platinum element.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0371">As described above, the semiconductor light emitting element used for the present invention has preferably the relation of Rp≧Rn for the sheet resistance RnΩ/□ of n-contact layer and the sheet resistance RnΩ/□ of the transparent p-electrode. However, since it is difficult to measure Rn after preparing the semiconductor light emitting element, it is substantially impossible to know the relation of Rp and Rn, but it is possible to know what relation exists between Rp and Rn from the condition of light intensity distribution at light emission.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0372">Further, when the transparent p-electrode and n-contact layer have the relation of Rp≧Rn, it is preferable to provide p-side pedestal electrode having an extended conduction portion in contact with the above-mentioned transparent p-electrode, therefore the external quantum efficiency can be further improved. The shape and direction of the extended conduction portion is not limited, and when the extended conduction portion is a linear shape, an area obstructing light is preferably reduced, but the shape may be a mesh shape. The shape may be a curve, a lattice, a branch and a hook other than linear shape. Hereat, since the shading effect is increased in proportion to the total area of the p-side pedestal electrode, it is preferable to design the line width and length of the extended conduction portion so that the shading effect does not exceeds the luminescence increasing effect.</p>

<p id="p-0516" num="0515">With respect to Comparative Examples 6 to 9, firing was carried out changing the firing conditions of a furnace, firing temperature, atmosphere and form. The firing is carried out under hydrogen/nitrogen atmosphere. The nitride phosphors which were obtained in the conditions of Comparative Examples 6 to 8 had extremely low luminescence brightness by visual observation. In case of Comparative Example 9, firing was carried out in hydrogen atmosphere but luminescence was not carried out by visual observation. Even though these tests were repeatedly carried out, similar test results were obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0517" num="0516">The phosphor represented by M<sub>X</sub>Si<sub>Y</sub>N<sub>Z</sub>:Eu (M contains at least one or more of alkali earth metals consisting of a group of Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn, and Z is Z=2/3X+4/3Y) absorbs a short wave length of 250 nm to 450 nm at a visible light region and intensely reflect light at a wave length of 450 nm to 500 nm. Accordingly, since the phosphor absorbs a short wave length of from indigo, blue color to blue green color of visible light, it strongly reflects at wave length sides such as a green color, a yellow color, a red color and the like. For example, it has property of obtaining a slightly reddish white color by combination with a blue light emitting diode, utilizing the characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0518" num="0517">However, although the above-mentioned phosphor has a useful luminescence property, it can be grasped that the luminescence brightness is low depending on the production condition or composition.</p>

<p id="p-0519" num="0518">The mode 7 of operation of the present invention is illustrated as follows referring to drawings. However, the mode 7 of operation shown below exemplifies the light emitting device for embodying the technical philosophy of the present invention, and the present invention does not limit the light emitting device to below. Further, the sizes and positional relation of members shown the respective drawings are occasionally exaggerated for clarifying the illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0520" num="0519">The phosphors used in the present invention are phosphors containing the first phosphor and the second phosphor. The change of luminescence intensity of the second phosphor in accordance with the change of ambient temperature is nearly equal to that of the first phosphor. Further, the phosphors are phosphors containing the second phosphor which has a nearly equal change of luminescence intensity as the first phosphor under a condition in which the ambient temperatures of the phosphors are changed in accordance with the change of the charged electric current to the light emitting element. In particular, the phosphors used in the present mode 7 of operation are the first phosphor which emits light having the peak wave length of luminescence spectrum in a range of a yellow to green region and the second phosphor which emits light having the peak wave length of luminescence spectrum in a red region. The first phosphor is a YAG-base phosphor which contains Y and Al, and contains at least one of elements selected from Lu, Sc, La, Gd, Th, Eu and Sm and at least one of elements selected from Ga and In and is activated by cerium. The second phosphor is a nitride-base phosphor which contains N, and contains at least one of elements selected from Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn and at least one elements selected from C, Si, Ge, Sn, Ti, Zr and Hf, and is activated by Eu and/or the rare earth element.</p>
<p id="p-0521" num="0520">The light emitting diode <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref> is a lead type light emitting diode equipped with the mount lead <b>205</b> and the inner lead <b>206</b>. The LED chip <b>202</b> is provided on the cup portion of the mount lead <b>205</b>, the coating portion <b>201</b> containing the above-mentioned phosphors was filled up in the cup portion so as to cover the LED chip <b>202</b>, and then it is resin-molded by the molding member <b>204</b> to be constituted. Hereat, the n-side electrode and p-side electrode of the LED chip <b>202</b> are respectively connected with the mount lead <b>205</b> and the inner lead <b>206</b> using the wire <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0522" num="0521">In the light emitting diode which was constituted as above, the portion of light (hereinafter, called as the “LED light”) which was emitted by the light emitting element (LED chip) <b>202</b> excites the phosphor contained in the coating portion <b>201</b> to generate fluorescence having a different wave length from the LED light, and the fluorescence which the phosphor generates and the LED light which does not contribute the excitation of the phosphor are color-mixed and are output.</p>
<p id="p-0523" num="0522">In general, since the excitation efficiency of the phosphor is lowered in accordance with the raise of the ambient temperature, the output of light emitted from the phosphor is also lowered. In the present mode 7 of operation, the lowering proportion of the relative luminescence output when the ambient temperature was changed by 1° C. is defined as the decreasing rate of the luminescence output. The decreasing rates of the luminescence output of the first phosphor and the second phosphor are 4.0×10<sup>−3 </sup>[a. u./° C.] or less together, preferably 3.0×10<sup>−3 </sup>[a. u./° C.] or less, and more preferably 2.0×10<sup>−3 </sup>[a. u./° C.] or less, and it is constituted that the lowering of beam [lm] of the whole light emitting device accompanying heat emission can be further suppressed. Further, it is constituted that the decreasing rates of the luminescence output of the first phosphor and the second phosphor against the raise of temperature are nearly equal. Namely, the difference of the decreasing rates of the luminescence output of the first phosphor and the second phosphor is set at 2.0×10<sup>−3 </sup>[a. u./° C.] or less and more preferably 2.0×10<sup>−4 </sup>[a. u./° C.] or less, therefore the decreasing rates of the luminescence output are nearly equal. The temperature characteristics of the phosphors in which the excitation efficiency is lowered by heat emission become nearly equal, therefore a light emitting device which can suppress the color deviation even if the ambient temperature is changed can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0524" num="0523">The respective constitutions of the mode 7 of operation of the present invention are specifically described below.</p>
<p id="h-0040" num="0000">[Phosphor]</p>
<p id="p-0525" num="0524">As the phosphor used in the present mode 7 of operation, there can be used a phosphor combining a yttrium-aluminum-garnet-base phosphor with a phosphor capable of emitting red light, in particular a nitride-base phosphor. These YAG-base phosphor and nitride-base phosphor may be mixed to be contained in the coating portion <b>201</b>, or separately contained in the coating portion <b>201</b> which is constituted by a plural number of layers. The respective phosphors are specifically illustrated below.</p>
<p id="h-0041" num="0000">(Yttrium-aluminum-garnet-base Phosphor)</p>
<p id="p-0526" num="0525">The yttrium-aluminum-garnet-base phosphor (YAG-base phosphor) used in the present mode 7 of operation is a phosphor which contains Y and Al, and contains at least one of elements selected from Lu, Sc, La, Gd, Tb, Eu and Sm and at least one of elements selected from Ga and In and is activated by at least one of elements selected from the rare earth elements, and a phosphor which emits light by being excited by visible light or ultraviolet rays which were emitted from the LED chip <b>202</b>. In particular, in the present mode 7 of operation, two or more of yttrium-aluminum oxide-base phosphors which are activated by Ce or Pr and have different compositions can be also applied. For example, there are mentioned YAlO<sub>3</sub>:Ce, Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12 </sub>Y:Ce (YAG:Ce), Y<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>:Ce, further a mixture thereof and the like. Further, at least one selected from Ba, Sr, Mg, Ca and Zn may be contained, and further, when Si is contained, the reaction of crystal growth can be also suppressed and the particles of the phosphor can be also uniformed. Hereat, the YAG-base phosphor activated by Ce shall be widely considered, and it is used for a wide meaning including a phosphor having fluorescence action in which a portion or all of yttrium is substituted with at least one of elements selected from a group consisting of Lu, Se, La, Gd and Sm, or a portion or all of aluminum is substituted with any or both of Ba, Tl, Ga and In. More specifically, it is a photoluminescence phosphor indicated by the general formula (Y<sub>z</sub>Gd<sub>1−z</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Ce (provided that 0&lt;z≦1), and a photoluminescence phosphor indicated by the general formula (Re<sub>1−a</sub>Sm<sub>a</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Re′<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Ce (provided that 0≦a&lt;1, 0≦b≦1, Re is at least one selected from Y, Gd, La and Sc, and Re′ is at least one selected from Al, Ga and In).</p>
<p id="p-0527" num="0526">A desired white luminescence color display can be carried out by color mixing blue light which was emitted from a light emitting element using a nitride-base phosphor-base semiconductor, with green or red light which is emitted from a phosphor whose body color is yellow for absorbing blue light, or yellow light being more greenish light and more reddish light. It is preferable that the light emitting device contains the powder and bulk of the phosphor in various resins such as an epoxy resin, an acrylic resin or a silicone resin, and inorganic substances such as silicon oxide and aluminum oxide in order to provoke the color mixing. The product containing the phosphor can be variously used for a dot shape product and a laminar shape product which were thinly formed so that light from the LED chip passes through the product, and the like in accordance with uses. Arbitrary color tones such as a light bulb color including a white color can be provided by variously adjusting the ratio of the phosphor and resins, coating and the filling amount, and selecting the luminescence wave length of a light emitting element.</p>
<p id="p-0528" num="0527">Further, a light emitting device capable of efficiently emitting light can be made by respectively arranging 2 or more of phosphors against the incident light from the light emitting element in order. Namely, the reflection light can be effectively utilized by laminating a color converting member in which the phosphor having an absorbing wave length at a long wavelength side and capable of emitting light at a long wavelength side was contained, and a color converting member which has an absorbing wave length at a long wavelength side and can emit light at a longer wave length side, on the light emitting element having a reflection member.</p>
<p id="p-0529" num="0528">When the YAG-base phosphor is used, a light emitting device having an adequate light resistance in high efficiency can be made even though it is arranged contacting with the LED chip having (Ee)=0.1 W·cm<sup>−2 </sup>or more and 1000 W−cm<sup>−2 </sup>or less as emission brightness, or adjacently.</p>
<p id="p-0530" num="0529">Since the YAG-base phosphor capable of emitting blue light which is the yttrium-aluminum oxide-base phosphor used for the present mode 7 of operation which was activated by Ce is a garnet configuration, it is strong for heat, light and moisture, and the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum can be set from 420 nm to 470 nm. Further, the luminescence peak wave length λp is around 510 nm and has a broad luminescence spectrum which is spread around 700 nm. On the other hand, since the YAG-base phosphor capable of emitting red light which is the yttrium-aluminum oxide-base phosphor which was activated by Ce is also the garnet configuration, it is strong for heat, light and moisture, and the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum can be set from 420 nm to 470 nm. Further, the luminescence peak wave length λp is around 600 nm and has a broad luminescence spectrum which is spread around 750 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0531" num="0530">Among the compositions of the YAG-base phosphors having the garnet configuration, the luminescence spectrum shifts toward shorter wavelength by substituting the portion of Al with Ga, and the luminescence spectrum shifts toward longer wavelength by substituting the portion of Y of the composition with Gd and/or La. The YAG-base phosphor can be also obtained by, for example, baking a raw material in which a more excessive amount of substituting element than a stoichiometric ratio was adjusted to be added. When the substitution of Y is less than 20%, a green component is large and a red component is little. Further, when it is more than 80%, the red component is increased but the brightness is rigorously lowered. Further, with respect to the excitation absorption spectrum similarly, among the composition of the YAG-base phosphor having the garnet configuration, the excitation absorption spectrum shifts toward shorter wavelength by substituting the portion of Al with Ga, and the excitation absorption spectrum shifts toward longer wavelength by substituting the portion of Y with Gd and/or La. It is preferable that the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum of the YAG-base phosphor is situated at a shorter wave length side than the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum of the light emitting element. When such a constitution is made, the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum coincides nearly with the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum of the light emitting element, therefore a light emitting device suppressing the generation of the color deviation can be formed without lowering the excitation efficiency of the phosphor.</p>
<p id="p-0532" num="0531">With respect to the phosphor, oxides or compounds which are easily converted to be oxides at a high temperature are used as raw materials of Y, Gd, Ce, La, Al, Sm and Ga, and they are adequately mixed at a stoichiometric ratio to obtain a raw material. Alternatively, a solubilized solution which was obtained by dissolving the rare earth elements of Y, Gd, Ce, La and Sm in an acid at a stoichiometric ratio was co-precipitated with oxalic acid and then the co-precipitated product was baked to obtain a co-precipitated oxide. Then, the co-precipitated oxide, aluminum oxide and gallium oxide are mixed to obtain a mix raw material. An appropriate amount of a fluoride such as ammonium fluoride, or NH<sub>4</sub>Cl as a flux is mixed with this, and the mixture is packed in a crucible and baked at a temperature range of 1350 to 1450° C. in air for 2 to 5 hours to obtain a baked product. The baked product is pulverized in water by a ball mill, washed, separated, dried and finally sieved to obtain the phosphor. Further, in the production method of the phosphor of the alternative mode 7 of operation, it is preferable that a mixture comprising a flux and a mix raw material which mixed the raw materials of the phosphor is baked by 2 steps which consist of the first baking step of carrying out in air or weak reduced atmosphere and the second baking step of carrying out in reduced atmosphere. Wherein the weak reduced atmosphere means weak reduced atmosphere which was set to contain at least an oxygen amount necessary for the reaction process of forming a desired phosphor from the mix raw material. The black conversion of the phosphor can be prevented and the lowering of the absorption efficiency of light can be prevented by carrying out the first baking step until the configuration formation of the desired phosphor is completed in the weak reduced atmosphere. Further, the reduced atmosphere in the second baking step means stronger reduced atmosphere than the weak reduced atmosphere. Thus, when the phosphor is baked at 2 steps, the phosphor having the high absorption efficiency of excitation wave length is obtained. Accordingly, when the light emitting device is formed by the phosphor which was formed thus, the amount of the phosphor necessary for obtaining a desired color tone can be reduced, a light emitting device having a high light-take out efficiency can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0533" num="0532">The yttrium-aluminum oxide-base phosphors which were activated by 2 or more cerium having different compositions may be used in mixture, or may be respectively arranged independently. When the phosphors are respectively arranged independently, it is preferable to arrange a phosphor easily absorbing and emitting light from the light emitting element at a shorter wave length side and a phosphor easily absorbing and emitting light at a longer wave length side than the former, in order. The absorption and emission of light can be carried out in high efficiency thereby.</p>

The phosphors 7-1 to 7-6 are more specifically illustrated referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 92</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 92</figref> is a chart showing the luminescence spectra when the YAG-base phosphors of the phosphors 7-1 and 7-4 were excited at EX=460 nm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref> is a chart showing the reflection spectra of the YAG-base phosphors of the phosphors 7-1 to 7-4. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref> is a chart showing the excitation spectra of the YAG-base phosphors of the phosphors 7-1 to 7-4. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref> is a chart showing the luminescence spectra when the YAG-base phosphors of the phosphors 7-5 and 7-6 were excited at EX=460 nm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95</figref> is a chart showing the excitation spectrum of the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-5. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96</figref> is a chart showing the excitation spectrum of the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-6.</p>
<p id="p-0536" num="0541">Since the YAG-base phosphors of the phosphors 7-1 to 7-6 have different peak wave lengths, the YAG-base phosphor having a desired color tone is selected. Then, the light emitting element is selected from the excitation spectrum and reflection spectrum. For example, the peak wave length at the long wavelength side of the excitation spectrum is about 456 nm for the YAG-base phosphor of 1. Considering a case that the light emitting element is shifted toward shorter wavelength in accordance with the increase of charged electric current, the light emitting element having a luminescence peak wave length at a longer wave length side by about 5 to 10 nm than the 456 nm is selected. Further, the light emitting element is selected considering the excitation spectrum of the second phosphor.</p>
<p id="p-0537" num="0542">On the other hand, when the YAG-base phosphor is selected as the second phosphor after selecting a phosphor which emits light at a certain wave length, the points below must be considered. For example, when the charged electric current is low from the relation of the second phosphor with the light emitting element, the light emitting element having a luminescence peak wave length of 457 nm is used at a rating drive of 20 mA. When the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-6 is selected, the peak wave length of the excitation spectrum of the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-6 is 457 nm. Accordingly, when the charged electric current is comparatively low to the light emitting element, the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-6 emits light most efficiently. However, the peak wave length of the excitation spectrum of the light emitting element is shifted toward shorter wavelength by about 10 nm in accordance with the increase of the charged electric current to the light emitting element. When the luminescence peak wave length is shifted toward shorter wavelength by about 10 nm, the excitation efficiency of the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-6 is lowered, therefore the relative luminescence intensity of the YAG-base phosphor is lowered. Namely, the proportion of the luminescence intensity of emission after conversion to the excitation light is relatively lowered. Accordingly, the light emitting device using the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-6 generates the color tone deviation in accordance with the increase of the charged electric current to the light emitting element. On the contrary, when the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-5 is selected, the peak wave length of the excitation spectrum is 440 nm. The luminescence intensity of the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-5 is improved in accordance with the increase of the charged electric current to the light emitting element. On the other hand, the luminescence output of the YAG-base phosphor is lowered in accordance with the emission of heat. Accordingly, the light emitting device using the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor 7-5 can provide a light emitting device having the little color tone deviation and stable luminescence because the color tone deviation caused by heat is compensated with the color tone deviation caused by spectrum shift in accordance with the increase of the charged electric current to the light emitting element, even if the charged electric current to the light emitting element is increased. Accordingly, when the YAG-base phosphor having the same peak wave length at increasing the charged electric current of the light emitting element or the peak wave length of the excitation spectrum at a short wavelength side is used for the first phosphor, the change of the color tone and luminescence intensity is extremely little. In addition to the above-mentioned phosphors, various YAG-base phosphors can be used.</p>
<p id="h-0042" num="0000">(Nitride-base Phosphor)</p>
<p id="p-0538" num="0543">In the present mode 7 of operation, the nitride-base phosphor absorbs the portion of blue light which was emitted from the LED chip <b>202</b> and emits light at a yellow to red region. The nitride-base phosphor is used together with the YAG-base phosphor to the light emitting device having the above-mentioned constitution, and there is provided the light emitting device which emits light of a warm color-base white color by color mixing of blue light which was emitted from the LED chip <b>202</b>, with the yellow to red light by the nitride-base phosphor. It is preferable to contain the yttrium-aluminum oxide fluorescence substance activated by cerium, in the phosphor which is added in addition to the nitride-base phosphor. Because the phosphor can be adjusted to a desired chromaticity by containing the yttrium-aluminum oxide luminescent substance. The yttrium-aluminum oxide fluorescent substance activated by cerium absorbs the portion of blue light which was emitted from the LED chip <b>202</b> and emits light at a yellow region. Hereat, light of a pale white color is emitted by color mixing of blue light which was emitted from the LED chip <b>202</b>, with the yellow light of the yttrium-aluminum oxide fluorescent substance. Accordingly, there can be provided the light emitting device which emits light of a white color mix light by mixing the yttrium-aluminum oxide fluorescent substance with the phosphor which emits red light in the coating member <b>201</b> having transmittance and combining the mixture with blue light which was emitted from the LED chip <b>202</b>. In particular, the light emitting device emitting white light which is situated on the locus of black body radiation in a chromaticity chart. However, in order to provide a light emitting device having a desired color temperature, the phosphor amount of the yttrium-aluminum oxide fluorescent substance and the amount of the phosphor which emits red light can be also suitably changed. The light emitting device emitting white color mix light is designed to improve the specific rendering index R9.</p>
<p id="p-0539" num="0544">Conventionally, a light emitting device emitting white light which used a semiconductor element adjusts the balance of blue light from a light emitting element and green to red light from a phosphor matching with the visual sensitivity of human, and obtains the balance from the color mixing of light. The color tone of a light emitting device emitting white light which used a semiconductor light emitting element is usually obtained by adjusting the balance of luminescence at the rating drive region in which the output property of the light emitting device is stable. However, in case of a liquid crystal back light and a light-adjustable illumination light source, these light emitting devices are used by changing the applied electric power and electric current density. When the electric current density is changed for adjusting the power of the light emitting device in a conventional technology, the balance of luminescence has been broken and the color tone deviation has been generated to lower the quality of the light source. The mode of operation of the present invention is specifically illustrated below.</p>
<p id="p-0540" num="0545">Firstly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref> is referred.</p>
<p id="p-0541" num="0546">The peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum which the light emitting element has is shifted toward shorter wavelength by increasing the applied electric current to the light emitting element. When the applied electric current is increased, the electric current density is enlarged and energy level is raised. There are factors such as a band gap is enlarged thereby, and the like. The fluctuation width between the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum when the electric current density to the light emitting element is small and the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum when the applied electric current is increased is about 10 nm when the applied electric current is increased by 20 mA to 100 mA in the present mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0542" num="0547">Illustration is carried out using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0543" num="0548">For example, the YAG-base phosphor is used as the first phosphor. The peak wave length of the excitation spectrum for the YAG-base phosphor of the phosphor <b>3</b> is about 448 nm. When the luminescence intensity of the peak wave length of 448 nm of the excitation spectrum is set as 100, the luminescence intensity at 460 nm is 95. Accordingly, the excitation of the YAG-base phosphor at 448 nm has higher luminescence intensity than the excitation of the YAG-base phosphor at 460 nm. The relation of the light emitting element with the first phosphor is outlined because of this reason. Just after electric current is applied to the light emitting element, a light emitting element in which the luminescence peak wave length of the light emitting element is 460 nm is selected. The light emitting element emits blue light. The YAG-base phosphor which was excited by the blue light of the light emitting element emits green light of about 530 nm. Then, the applied electric current of the light emitting element is increased and the electric current of 100 mA is charged. The luminescence output of the semiconductor element is increased thereby, and the temperature of the light emitting element and the periphery is increased in accordance with this. Further, the luminescence peak wave length of the light emitting element is shifted from 460 nm to a short wave length of 450 nm. At this time, the YAG-base phosphor has the higher luminescence intensity at 450 nm than 460 nm of the peak wave length of the excitation spectrum. Accordingly, the excitation of the YAG-base phosphor exhibits relatively the higher luminescence intensity at 450 nm of the excitation light than at 460 nm. Further, blue light has a lower visual feeling efficiency at 450 nm than at 460 nm. Accordingly, since the brightness of the blue light of the light emitting element and the green light of the YAG-base phosphor becomes higher, the relative intensity of the green light to the blue light is strengthened. Accordingly, the color tone of the light emitting device is slightly shifted toward the green light side on a straight line linking the blue light with the green light. On the other hand, since the brightness of the phosphor is lowered by the increase of the ambient temperature, the relative intensity of the green light to the blue light is weakened. Accordingly, the color tone of the light emitting device is slightly shifted toward the blue light side on a straight line linking the blue light with the green light. The color tone deviation is suppressed by these balances.</p>

<p id="p-0545" num="0550">For example, the nitride-base phosphor is used as the second phosphor. The peak wave length of the excitation spectrum with respect to the nitride-base phosphor of the phosphor 5 is about 450 nm between 350 nm and 500 nm. When the luminescence intensity of the peak wave length of 450 nm of the excitation spectrum is set as 100, the luminescence intensity at 460 nm is 95. Accordingly, the excitation of the YAG-base phosphor at 450 nm has higher luminescence intensity than the excitation of the nitride-base phosphor at 460 nm. The relation of the light emitting element with the second phosphor is outlined because of this reason. When the applied electric current density to the light emitting element is low, a light emitting element in which the luminescence peak wave length of the light emitting element is 460 nm is selected. The same light emitting element as the one which was used for exciting the first phosphor is used. The light emitting element emits blue light. The nitride-base phosphor which was excited by the blue light of the light emitting element emits red light of about 637 nm. Then, the applied electric current of the light emitting element is increased and the electric current of 100 mA is charged. The luminescence output of the semiconductor element is increased thereby, and the temperature of the light emitting element and the periphery is increased in accordance with this. Further, the luminescence peak wave length of the light emitting element is shifted from 460 nm to a short wave length of 450 nm. At this time, the nitride-base phosphor has the higher luminescence intensity at 450 nm than 460 nm of the peak wave length of the excitation spectrum. Accordingly, the excitation of the nitride-base phosphor exhibits relatively the higher luminescence intensity at 450 nm of the excitation light than at 460 nm. Further, blue light has a lower visual feeling efficiency at 450 nm than at 460 nm. Accordingly, since the brightness of the blue light of the light emitting element and the red light of the nitride-base phosphor becomes higher, the relative intensity of the red light to the blue light is strengthened. Accordingly, the color tone of the light emitting device is slightly shifted toward the red light side on a straight line linking the blue light with the red light. On the other hand, since the brightness of the phosphor is lowered by the increase of the ambient temperature, the relative intensity of the green light to the blue light is weakened. Accordingly, the color tone of the light emitting device is slightly shifted toward the blue light side on a straight line linking the blue light with the red light. The color tone deviation is suppressed by these balances.</p>
<p id="p-0546" num="0551">The relation between the first phosphor with the second phosphor is outlined. The nitride-base phosphor absorbs not only the light from the light emitting element but also the light around the peak wave length (about 530 nm) of the luminescence spectrum of the YAG-base phosphor, and is excited.</p>
<p id="p-0547" num="0552">Further, the mutual relation of the light emitting element with the first phosphor and the second phosphor is specifically illustrated. Heat emission is generated by charging electric current to the light emitting element. The quantity of heat emission is also increased by increasing the applied electric current to the light emitting element. The greater part of the heat which was generated at the light emitting element is accumulated in the coating member or the phosphor. Thus, the ambient temperature is raised and the lowering of the luminescence output of the phosphor itself is generated. On the contrary, the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum of the light emitting element is shifted toward shorter wavelength side by increasing the applied electric current to the light emitting element as the description, and the luminescence intensity of the first phosphor is increased. The first phosphor can keep the color tone and luminescence output by these interactions without most changing. Further, the second phosphor can also keep the color tone and luminescence output by these interactions without most changing.</p>
<p id="p-0548" num="0553">The color tone of the light emitting device is determined by the respective interactions of the light emitting element with the first phosphor and the second phosphor. Namely, the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum of the light emitting element is shifted toward shorter wavelength in accordance with the increase of the applied electric current. The luminescence intensities of the first phosphor and the second phosphor which are excited by the light emitting element is increased in accordance with this. On the other hand, the light emitting element is heated in accordance with the increase of the applied electric current to the light emitting element. The heat is accumulated in the first phosphor and the second phosphor, the coating member and the like by the heat emission. The luminescence output of these phosphors is lowered by the accumulation of heat. Accordingly, the color tone deviation of the light emitting device can be suppressed even if the applied, electric current to the light emitting element is increased. The color tone deviation can be hardly felt visually by selection of the first phosphor and the second phosphor even if the color tone deviation is generated in the light emitting device. Considering the interactions of the light emitting element with the first phosphor and the second phosphor, the color tone of the light emitting device transfers to a direction in which the color tone x is increased and a direction in which the color tone y is also increased. The direction to which the color tone is deviated is fluctuated along the locus of black radiation. The color deviation along the locus of black radiation is low sensitivity for human vision in comparison with the color deviation to a direction perpendicular to the locus of black radiation. Further, the swing width of the color deviation is narrow by the interaction (self absorption and the like) of the first phosphor and the second phosphor. Accordingly, the present invention can provide a light emitting device preventing the color tone deviation. The present invention has a great effect in particular for a light emitting device being easily subject to the influence of heat, for example, a semiconductor light emitting device which is DC drive and a power system which requires a large applied power, a light emitting device in which heat discharge is difficult and heat is easily accumulated, and under drive environment.</p>
<p id="p-0549" num="0554">Further, a phosphor in which the excitation spectrum is hardly changed can be used within a range in which the light emitting element transfers to a short wavelength side in accordance with the increase of the applied electric power. For example, when the nitride-base phosphor of the phosphor <b>5</b> of Example is used, the excitation spectrum is hardly changed between 420 nm to 450 nm, but the effect is exhibited by using YAG having the characteristic of the present invention in combination. Further, the light emitting device of the present invention can be provided even if a phosphor having a characteristic of temperature-characteristics of the above-mentioned phosphor and a characteristic of the excitation spectrum and the light emitting element is used other than the above-mentioned phosphor.</p>
<p id="p-0550" num="0555">Further, the positions of the excitation spectrum and the peak wave length of the light emitting element can be adjusted considering the thermal resistance and discharge property of heat of the light emitting device, the junction temperature of the light emitting element and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0554" num="0559">The second phosphor is situated on at least one of light emitting elements, and/or on at least one of light emitting elements which are different from the at least one of light emitting elements. Namely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>, the LED chip <b>302</b> capable of emitting light at a blue region is mounted in the first concave portion <b>301</b>, and the first phosphor layer <b>303</b> is formed so as to cover the LED chip <b>302</b>.

When the molding member having a diffusing agent is used, the first phosphor layer <b>303</b> and the second phosphor layer <b>306</b> are covered, the electroconductive wire <b>310</b>, LED chip and phosphor layers are protected, and light which is emitted from the phosphor layers can be also diffused and color-mixed to a direction of the face of observing luminescence. Hereat, the n-side electrode and p-side electrode of the LED chip <b>302</b> and the LED chip <b>304</b> are respectively connected with the n-side electrode and p-side electrode of the lead electrode <b>309</b> which was integrally molded in the package <b>308</b>, using the electroconductive wire <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0555" num="0560">In the light emitting diodes which were constituted as above, the portion of LED light excites the phosphor contained in the first phosphor layer <b>303</b>, and generates light at a red region having a wave length which is different from the LED light. Further, the portions of LED light by the LED chip <b>304</b> and the LED chip <b>302</b> excites the phosphor contained in the second phosphor layer <b>306</b>, and generates light at a yellow to green region having a wave length which is different from the LED light. The fluorescences which are generated from the first phosphor layer <b>303</b> and the second phosphor layer <b>306</b> and LED light which is output without contributing the excitation of the phosphors are color-mixed to be output from the direction of the face of observing luminescence of the light emitting device. Thus, a plural number of LRD chips are used and a plural number of phosphors are directly excited respectively, therefore the present invention can make the light emitting device capable of highly brilliantly emitting the light of luminescence spectrum which the respectively phosphors have naturally, in comparison with a conventional light emitting device which excites several kinds of phosphors by one LED chip at once.</p>
<p id="p-0556" num="0561">When the first phosphor layer and the second phosphor layer, or the third phosphor layer are separately laminated in order, the phosphors emitting light having different wave lengths are respectively contained in the respective phosphor layers, therefore the light emitting device which improved the color rendering property can be made. Namely, since the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum at a red region which is emitted from the red color-base phosphor contained in the first phosphor layer exists at a range of 600 nm to 700 nm and the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum of the YAG-base phosphor contained in the second phosphor layer exists at a range of 420 nm to 470 nm, the light emitted from the red color-base phosphor is hardly absorbed in the YAG-base phosphor and efficiently color-mixed with light having other wave length.</p>
<p id="p-0557" num="0562">Further, the first concave portion <b>301</b> is formed in the inner portion from the second concave portion <b>305</b>. Since the light having a wave length of 500 nm to 700 nm which was emitted from the second phosphor layer <b>306</b> and is oriented to the direction of the face of observing luminescence is not absorbed by the red color-base phosphor having the excitation absorption spectrum at a wave length range of 350 nm to 600 nm, the light emitting device which improved the color rendering property can be made.</p>
<p id="p-0558" num="0563">Further, since the phosphor layers are formed so as to be divided into 2 layers, the light emitted from the first phosphor layer <b>303</b> and the LED light are not absorbed and diffused by the phosphor particles during passing the second phosphor layer <b>306</b>, therefore the light at a blue region, the light at a yellow to green region and the light at a red region are efficiently color-mixed. Accordingly, the color rendering property of the light emitted from the light emitting device can be improved. Further, a diffusing agent or a filler may be preferably contained in the second phosphor layer <b>306</b>, or the molding member which contained a diffusing agent or a filler may be formed on the second phosphor layer <b>306</b>. The color mixing can be more efficiently carried out by making such a constitution.</p>
<p id="p-0559" num="0564">Since the excitation efficiency of phosphors is usually lowered in accordance with the raise of ambient temperature, the output of the light emitted from the phosphors is also lowered. In the present mode 8 of operation, the lowering proportion of the relative luminescence output when the ambient temperature was changed by 1° C. in a condition in which the phosphor is coated on the light emitting element emitting light at a blue region in which the peak wave length λp is about 460 nm is defined as the decreasing rate of the luminescence output. The decreasing rates of the luminescence output of the red color-base phosphor and the YAG-base phosphor against the raise of temperature are 0.4.0×10<sup>−3 </sup>[a. u./° C.] or less and more preferably 2.0×10<sup>−3 </sup>[a. u./° C.] or less, and it can be constituted that the lowering of beam [1 m] of the whole light emitting device accompanying heat emission can be further suppressed. Further, it can be constituted that the decreasing rates of the luminescence output of the red color-base phosphor and the YAG-base phosphor against the raise of temperature are nearly equal. Namely, the difference of the decreasing rates of the luminescence output of the red color-base phosphor and the YAG-base phosphor is set as 2.0×10<sup>−3 </sup>[a. u./° C.] or less and more preferably 2.0×10<sup>−4 </sup>[a. u./° C.] or less, therefore the decreasing rates of the luminescence output can be nearly the same. The temperature characteristics of the phosphors in which the excitation efficiency is lowered by heat emission become nearly equal, therefore a light emitting device which can suppress the color deviation even if the ambient temperature is changed can be formed.</p>

<p id="p-0562" num="0581">In particular, as the phosphor used in the present mode 8 of operation, a phosphor using the yttrium-aluminum-garnet (pomegranate stone type)-base phosphor and the red color-base phosphor capable of emitting red light, in particular, the nitride-base phosphor in combination can be used. These YAG-base phosphor and nitride-base phosphor are respectively contained in the phosphor layers which are constituted by a plural number of layers. The respective phosphors are specifically illustrated below. In the present invention, the particle diameter of the phosphor is a value obtained by a volume based particle size distribution curve, and the volume based particle size distribution curve is obtained by measuring the particle size distribution of a phosphor by a laser diffraction-scattering method. Specifically, the phosphor is diffused in a sodium hexametaphosphate aqueous solution having a concentration of 0.05% under environments of a temperature of 25° C. and a humidity of 70%, and the value is obtained by measuring the particles at a particle diameter range of 0.03 μm to 700 μm by a laser diffraction type particle size distribution measurement apparatus (SALD-2000A).</p>

In particular, the present mode 8 of operation, 2 or more of the yttrium-aluminum oxide-base phosphors having different compositions which were activated by Ce or Pr are utilized. A desired white luminescence color display can be carried out by color mixing the blue light which was emitted from a light emitting element using a nitride-base phosphor-base semiconductor, with the green or red light which is emitted from a phosphor whose body color is yellow for absorbing the blue light, or the yellow light being more greenish light and more reddish light. It is preferable that the light emitting device contains the powder and bulk of the phosphor in various resins such as an epoxy resin, an acrylic resin or a silicone resin, and inorganic transparent substances such as silicon oxide, aluminum oxide and silica sol in order to provoke the color mixing. The product containing the phosphor can be variously used for a dot shape product and a laminar shape product which were thinly formed so that the light from the LED chip passes through the product, and the like in accordance with uses. Arbitrary color tones such as a light bulb color including a white color can be provided by variously adjusting the ratio of the phosphor and resins, coating and the filing amount, and selecting the luminescence wave length of a light emitting element.</p>
<p id="p-0564" num="0583">Further, a light emitting device capable of efficiently emitting light can be made by respectively arranging 2 or more of phosphors against the incident light from the light emitting element in order. Namely, the reflection light can be effectively utilized by laminating a color converting member in which the phosphor having an absorbing wave length at a long wavelength side and capable of emitting light at a long wavelength side was contained, and a color converting member which has an absorbing wave length at a long wavelength side and can emit light at a longer wave length side, on the light emitting element having a reflection member.</p>
<p id="p-0565" num="0584">When the YAG-base phosphor is used, a light emitting device having an adequate light resistance in high efficiency can be made even though it is arranged contacting with the LED chip having (Ee)=0.1 W·cm<sup>−2 </sup>or more and 1000 W·cm<sup>−2 </sup>or less as emission brightness, or adjacently.</p>
<p id="p-0566" num="0585">Since the YAG-base phosphor capable of emitting blue light which is the yttrium-aluminum oxide-base phosphor used for the present mode 8 of operation which was activated by Ce is a garnet configuration, it is strong for heat, light and moisture, and can make the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum be 420 nm to 470 nm. Further, the luminescence peak wave length λp is around 510 nm and has a broad luminescence spectrum which is spread around 700 nm. On the other hand, since the YAG-base phosphor capable of emitting red light which is the yttrium-aluminum oxide-base phosphor which was activated by Ce is also the garnet configuration, it is strong for heat, light and moisture, and can make the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum be 420 nm to 470 nm. Further, the luminescence peak wave length λp is around 600 nm and has a broad luminescence spectrum which is spread around 750 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0567" num="0586">Among the composition of the YAG-base phosphor having the garnet configuration, the luminescence spectrum is shifted toward a shorter wavelength by substituting the portion of Al with Ga, and the luminescence spectrum is shifted toward a longer wavelength by substituting the portion of Y of the composition with Gd and/or La. When the substitution of Y is less than 20%, a green component is large and a red component is little. Further, when it is more than 80%, the red component is increased but the brightness is rigorously lowered. Further, with respect to the excitation absorption spectrum similarly, among the composition of the YAG-base phosphor having the garnet configuration, the excitation absorption spectrum is shifted toward shorter wavelength by substituting the portion of Al with Ga, and the excitation absorption spectrum is shifted toward longer wavelength side by substituting the portion of Y with Gd and/or La. It is preferable that the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum of the YAG-base phosphor is situated at a shorter wave length side than the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum of the light emitting element. When the constitution is made thus, the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum coincides nearly with the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum of the light emitting element, therefore a light emitting device suppressing the generation of the color deviation can be formed without lowering the excitation efficiency of the phosphor.</p>
<p id="p-0568" num="0587">With respect to the phosphor, oxides or compounds which are easily converted to be oxides at a high temperature are used as raw materials of Y, Gd, Ce, La, Al, Sm and Ga, and they are adequately mixed at a stoichiometric ratio to obtain a raw material. Alternatively, a solubilized solution which was obtained by dissolving the rare earth elements of Y, Gd, Ce, La and Sm in an acid at a stoichiometric ratio was co-precipitated with oxalic acid and then the co-precipitated product was baked to obtain a co-precipitated oxide. Then, the co-precipitated oxide, aluminum oxide and gallium oxide are mixed to obtain a mix raw material. An appropriate amount of a fluoride such as ammonium fluoride as a flux is mixed with this, and the mixture is packed in a crucible and baked at a temperature range of 1350 to 1450° C. in air for 2 to 5 hours to obtain a baked product. The baked product is pulverized in water by a ball mill, washed, separated, dried and finally sieved to obtain the phosphor. Further, in the production method of the phosphor of the alternative mode of operation, it is preferable that a mixture comprising a flux and a mix raw material which mixed the raw materials of the phosphor is baked by 2 steps which consist of the first baking step of carrying out in air or weak reduced atmosphere and the second baking step of carrying out in reduced atmosphere. Wherein the weak reduced atmosphere means weak reduced atmosphere which was set to contain at least an oxygen amount necessary for the reaction process of forming a desired phosphor from the mix raw material. The black conversion of the phosphor can be prevented and the lowering of the absorption efficiency of light can be prevented by carrying out the first baking step until the configuration formation of the desired phosphor is completed in the weak reduced atmosphere. Further, the reduced atmosphere in the second baking step means stronger reduced atmosphere than the weak reduced atmosphere. Thus, when the phosphor is baked at 2 steps, the phosphor having the high absorption efficiency of excitation wave length is obtained. Accordingly, when the light emitting device is formed by the phosphor which was formed thus, the amount of the phosphor necessary for obtaining a desired color tone can be reduced, a light emitting device having a high light-take out efficiency can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0569" num="0588">The yttrium-aluminum oxide-base phosphors which were activated by 2 or more cerium having different compositions may be used in mixture, or may be respectively arranged independently. When the phosphors are respectively arranged independently, it is preferable to arrange a phosphor easily absorbing and emitting light from the light emitting element at a shorter wave length side and a phosphor easily absorbing and emitting light at a longer wave length side than the former, in order. The absorption and emission of light can be carried out in high efficiency thereby.</p>

Eu<sup>3+</sup> is easily oxidized and it is commercially available in the composition of tervalent Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. However, since O participates greatly in case of the commercially available Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, a good phosphor is hardly obtained. Accordingly, it is preferable to use those in which O is eliminated from Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>to the out of system. For example, it is preferable to use europium alone or europium nitride.

The light emitting device emitting warm color-base color mix light can be made by color-mixing the blue light emitted from the LED chips <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>, the light by the YAG-base phosphor and the yellow to red light from the nitride-base phosphor, using the nitride-base phosphor together with the YAG-base phosphor for the light emitting device having the above-mentioned constitution. The yttrium-aluminum oxide-base fluorescent substance activated by cerium absorbs the portion of the blue light emitted from the LED chip <b>304</b> and emits light at a yellow region. Hereat, the blue light emitted from the LED chip <b>304</b> and the yellow light of the yttrium-aluminum oxide-base fluorescent substance emit blue white light by color mixing. Accordingly, the light emitting device emitting white-base color mix light can be made by respectively containing the phosphor emitting red light and the yttrium-aluminum oxide fluorescent substance in the first phosphor layer and the second phosphor layer and combining the blue lights emitted from the LED chip <b>302</b> or the LED chip <b>304</b>. The preferable light emitting device in particular is a light emitting device in which chromaticity is situated at the locus of black body radiation in a chromaticity chart. However, the compounding amount of the yttrium-aluminum oxide fluorescent substance and the compounding amount of the phosphor emitting red light can be appropriately changed in order to provide a light emitting device having a desired color temperature. The light emitting device which emits white color-base color mix light designs to improve the specific average rendering index R9. With respect to a white color light emitting device which is the combination of a conventional blue light emitting element and the yttrium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by cerium, the specific average rendering index R9 is about near O around a color temperature Tcp=4600K, and a red component was insufficient. Accordingly, it has been a solving problem to enhance the specific color rendering index R9, but the present invention, the specific color rendering index R9 can be enhanced by using the phosphor emitting red light and the yttrium-aluminum oxide fluorescent substance in combination.</p>

<p id="p-0610" num="0629">The first phosphor layer <b>303</b> and the second phosphor layer <b>306</b> in the present mode 8 of operation cover the LED chips in the concave portions provided in the package, and the red color-base phosphor which converts the luminescence of the LED chips, and the YAG-base phosphor are respectively contained in them. As the specific material of the phosphor layers, there are preferably used transparent resins excellent in weather resistance such as an epoxy resin, a urea resin and a silicone resin; transparent inorganic materials excellent in light resistance such as silica sol and glass. Further, a diffusing agent may be contained together with the phosphor. As the specific diffusing agent, there are preferably used barium titanate, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, calcium carbonate, silicon dioxide, and the like.</p>
<p id="h-0054" num="0000">[Molding Member <b>307</b>]</p>
<p id="p-0611" num="0630">The molding member <b>307</b> can be provided for protecting the LED chips <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>, the electroconductive wire <b>110</b> and the phosphor layer in which the phosphor was contained, from the external environment. The molding member <b>307</b> can be formed generally using a resin. Further, a visual angle can be increased by containing the phosphor, but the directionality from the LED chips is reduced by containing a diffusing agent in the resin mold, and the visual angle can be further increased. Further, a lens effect for focusing and diffusing luminescence from the LED chips can be bestowed by making the molding member <b>307</b> be a desired shape. Accordingly, the molding member <b>307</b> may be a structure in which a plural number of layers were laminated. Specifically, it is a convex lens shape, a concave lens shape, further an elliptical shape viewed from the face of observing luminescence, and a shape which combined a plural number of the shapes. As the specific material of the molding member <b>307</b>, there are preferably used transparent resins excellent in weather resistance such as an epoxy resin, a urea resin and a silicone resin; transparent inorganic materials excellent in light resistance such as silica sol and glass. Further, a diffusing agent may be contained together with the phosphor. As the specific diffusing agent, there are preferably used barium titanate, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, calcium carbonate, silicon dioxide, and the like. Further, the molding member and the phosphor layer may be formed by the same member considering a refractive index, and for example, may be formed using a silicone resin. In the invention of the present application, it can cover the coloration of the phosphor viewed from the face of observing luminescence that the molding member contains a diffusing agent and a coloring agent. Further, the coloration of the phosphor is that the phosphor of the invention of the present application absorbs a blue component among lights from strong external light and emits light. Accordingly, it is observed to be colored yellow. In particular, the colored portion is occasionally magnified depending on the shape of the molding member such as a convex shape. The coloration is occasionally not preferable on designing. The diffusing agent contained in the molding member colors the molding member in a milky white color, and the colorant colors in a desired color, therefore the coloring can be invisible. Accordingly, the color of the phosphor is not observed from the face side of observing luminescence.</p>
<p id="p-0612" num="0631">Further, when the main luminescence wave length of light emitted from the LED chip is 430 nm or more, it is preferable from the viewpoint of weather resistance that an ultraviolet absorbing agent being a light stabilizer is contained in the molding member.</p>

<p id="p-0614" num="0633">Further, temperature characteristic is shown by a relative brightness in which the luminescence brightness at 25° C. is 100%, in Examples below.</p>
<p id="p-0615" num="0634">Further, the particle diameter is a value obtained by an air transmission method called as F.S.S.S.No. (Fisher Sub Sieve Sizer's No.).</p>
<p id="p-0616" num="0635">Further, afterglow is measured by switching off the lamp of an excitation light source after irradiating light of 253.7 nm at room temperature (20° C.) for a fixed time. The basis of time is that the time of the instance of switching off the lamp of the excitation light source is defined as zero. When the brightness during irradiation of the excitation light source is set as the brightness basis of 100%, a time required for the brightness being quenched to 1/10 is measured. The afterglow property is determined by making the measurement result as a basis.</p>

<p id="p-0621" num="0640">The nitride phosphor related to the present invention is a nitride phosphor which is represented by the general formula L<sub>X</sub>M<sub>Y</sub>N<sub>((2/3)X+(4/3)Y)</sub>:R or L<sub>X</sub>M<sub>Y</sub>O<sub>Z</sub>N<sub>((2/3)X+(4/3)Y−(2/3)Z)</sub>:R and the above-mentioned nitride phosphor contains elements (hereinafter, merely referred to as the “different elements”) which are different from the above-mentioned L, the above-mentioned M, the above-mentioned O, the above-mentioned N and the above-mentioned R. Among said general formula, Examples 1 to 80 are a nitride phosphor which is represented by Ca<sub>1.985</sub>Eu<sub>0.015</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>7.990</sub>O<sub>0.00225 </sub>and contain elements different from the above-mentioned L, the above-mentioned M, the above-mentioned O, the above-mentioned N and the above-mentioned R. Table 1 is the result of testing the properties of the nitride phosphor of Example 1 to 80. The mixing ratio of raw materials in Table 1 represents the raw materials by molar ratio. In Examples 1 to 80, the concentration of Eu is 0.015. The concentration of Eu is a molar ratio against the molar concentration of Ca. Further, the addition amount of the different elements against the phosphor after synthesis is the concentration of 100 ppm or 500 ppm. The adjustment of brightness and the adjustment of quantum efficiency can be carried out by adding said different elements. Further, when elements are diffused from a crucible and a furnace material, and in order to confirm the effect by elements contained in raw materials, the effect by said different elements was confirmed by adding the different elements to raw materials. Accordingly, when elements are diffused from a crucible and a furnace material in a practical use, it is considered to be a further mild condition (they become less than a case of consciously adding the different elements to raw materials).</p>
<p id="p-0622" num="0641">In the present Example, the Ca of a raw material was firstly pulverized to 1 to 15 μm, and nitrided in nitrogen atmosphere. Then, the nitride of Ca was pulverized to 0.1 to 10 μm. 20 g of the Ca of a raw material was weighed and nitrided.</p>
<p id="p-0623" num="0642">Similarly, the Si of a raw material was pulverized to 1 to 15 μm, and nitrided in nitrogen atmosphere. Then, the nitride of Si was pulverized to 0.1 to 10 μm. 20 g of the Si of a raw material was weighed and nitrided.</p>
<p id="p-0624" num="0643">Then, a compound containing the different elements was mixed with a Eu compound, Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>in a wet process. An example is illustrated by selecting H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3 </sub>as a compound containing the different elements. Firstly, 20 g of the Eu compound, Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and 3.65 g of H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3 </sub>were weighed. When H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3 </sub>is made as a solution, Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is mixed with the H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3 </sub>solution, and the mixture is dried. After drying, firing was carried out at 700° C. to 800° C. for about 5 hours in oxygen atmosphere. Europium oxide to which B was added was produced thereby. After the firing, a mixture of Eu and B was pulverized to 0.1 to 10 μm.</p>
<p id="p-0625" num="0644">The mixture of nitride of Ca, the nitride of Si and the mixture of Eu and B was mixed in nitrogen atmosphere. In Examples 1 to 80, the mixing ratio (molar ratio) contained in raw materials is Ca:Si:Eu=1.985:5:0.015. 5.73 g of Ca<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2 </sub>(molecular weight=148.26), 13.9 g of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>(molecular weight=140.31), and 0.37 g of the mixture of Eu and B (Eu is 0.31 among them) were weighed and mixed. The amount of B added is 500 ppm.</p>
<p id="p-0626" num="0645">In case of Examples 1 to 80, the mixing, firing, pulverization, and weighing of Eu with the different elements were carried out so that the different elements shown in Table 1 are 100 ppm and 500 ppm in place of the above-mentioned boron (B). The different elements which are added to the nitride phosphors of Examples 1 to 80 are LiOH.H<sub>2</sub>O (Wako Reagent, special grade: 124-01212), Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 197-01585), K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 162-03495), RbCl (Wako Reagent, special grade: 187-00321), CsCl (Wako Reagent, special grade: 035-01952), Mg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 134-00255), CaCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O (Wako Reagent, special grade), SrCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O (Wako Reagent, special grade: 197-04185), BaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O (Wako Reagent, special grade: 029-00175), TiOSO<sub>4</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O (Kishida Chemical: 020-78905), ZrO(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>(Mitsuwa Chemical), HfCl<sub>4 </sub>(Mitsuba Chemical: No.51872), VCl<sub>3 </sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 221-00452), Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 144-05332), TaCl<sub>5 </sub>(Kishida Chemical: 020-76055), Cr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O (Wako Reagent, special grade: 033-03175), H<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4 </sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 209-03452), ReCl<sub>5 </sub>(Mitsuba Chemical: No.58374), FeCl<sub>3</sub>.3H<sub>2</sub>O (Wako Reagent, special grade: 9-87), RuCl<sub>3</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O (Kishida Chemical: 020-68601), Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O (Wako Reagent, special grade: 035-03755), NiCl<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O (Wako Reagent, special grade: 141-01062), IrCl<sub>3 </sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 096-01601), PdCl<sub>2 </sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 162-00053), H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O (Wako Reagent, special grade: 169-02861), Cu(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O (Wako Reagent, special grade: 3-402), AgNO<sub>3</sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 198-00835), HAuCl<sub>4</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O (Wako Reagent, special grade: 077-00931), Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O (Wako Reagent, special grade: 265-01032), H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3 </sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 021-02195), Al(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.9H<sub>2</sub>O (Wako Reagent, special grade: 018-01945), GaCl<sub>3 </sub>(manufactured by NICHIA CORPORATION), InCl<sub>3 </sub>(manufactured by NICHIA CORPORATION), GeO<sub>2 </sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 071-04552), Sn(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2 </sub>(Kishida Chemical: lotF07563D), Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 124-00612), (N<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4 </sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 016-03325), Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 016-11652), Bi(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O (Wako Reagent, special grade: 024-09042), (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>(Wako Reagent, special grade: 019-03435). These compounds were weighed and added so that the concentrations of the different elements in these compounds are 100 ppm or 500 ppm against Ca<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>:Eu.</p>
<p id="p-0627" num="0646">The above-mentioned compounds having the different elements were mixed and baked. As the firing conditions, these compounds were charged in a crucible made of boron nitride in ammonia atmosphere, the temperature was gradually raised from room temperature over about 5 hours, firing was carried out at about 1350° C. for 5 hours, and they were gradually cooled to room temperature over about 5 hours. The different element was scattered by the firing, therefore the different element is also not occasionally contained in the final product. Even though the different element is contained, the less amount thereof than the initial addition amount remain by 0.1 ppm to about several hundreds ppm.</p>
<p id="p-0628" num="0647">The luminescence brightness and quantum efficiency of the nitride phosphor of Examples 1 to 80 is represented by the relative value on the basis that it is 100% when 500 ppm of Cr was added (the quantum efficiency of Example 30).</p>
<p id="p-0629" num="0648">It is the purpose of the firing not only to react in solid state but also to obtain particles having the disired particle sizes and good crystalinity. Flux is a material added to accelerate the growth of crystal. Flux can accelerate not only to grow the crystal but also to introduce a co-activator into the lattice of the base material. For example, since the Group I Elements have a relatively low melting point and can be introduced grain boundary during the firing, the crystal growth is accelerated by melting the element of the phosphor. The phosphor of which particle size is grown to absorbe the exciting energy easily can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0630" num="0649">The nitride phosphors in Examples 1 to 10 containing the Group I Element consisting of Li, Na, K and Cs have high brightness and high quantum efficiency. It is considered that this is caused by the flux effect. In Examples 1 to 10, the brightness can be adjusted by adjusting the addition amount of the Group I Element.</p>
<p id="p-0631" num="0650">Examples 11 to 16, 57 and 58 are the Group II Element corresponding to the above-mentioned L and contain 100 ppm or 500 ppm of Mg, Sr, Ba and Zn. The brightness can be adjusted by adjusting the amount of L in the nitride phosphors.</p>
<p id="p-0632" num="0651">The nitride phosphors containing the Group IV Element consisting of Ti, Zr and Hf of Examples 17 to 22, the Group I Element consisting of Ag and Au of Examples 51 to 56, the Group III Element consisting of B, Al, Ga and In of Examples 59 to 66, the Group IV Element consisting of Sn and Pb of Examples 69 to 72, the Group V Element consisting of P, Sb and Bi of Examples 73 to 78, and the Group VI Element consisting of S of Examples 79 and 80 can be brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0633" num="0652">The brightness can be adjusted by adjusting the amount of the nitride phosphors containing the Group V Element consisting of V, Nb and Ta of Examples 23 to 28, the Group VI Element consisting of Cr, Mo and W of Examples 29 to 34, the Group VII Element consisting of Re of Examples 35 and 36, and the Group VIII Element consisting of Fe, Co, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt and Ru of Examples 37 to 50.</p>
<p id="p-0634" num="0653">In the present Examples, it is considered that a crucible is eroded at firing step, and elements constituting the crucible from the crucible contaminate in the nitride phosphor. Hereat, since the nitride phosphors related to Examples use the crucible of a boron nitride material and firing is carried out in ammonia atmosphere, it is considered that a crucible is eroded and B contaminates in the nitride phosphor. In this case, the nitride phosphor can improve the luminescence brightness and quantum efficiency by containing B as shown in Examples 59 and 60.</p>
<p id="p-0635" num="0654">Accordingly, the crucible of a boron nitride material can be positively used for aiming the effect of improving the luminescence brightness and quantum efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0636" num="0655">On the other hand, when the crucible of a molybdenum nitride material is used, it is considered that molybdenum contaminates in the nitride phosphor, but in this case, molybdenum lowers the brightness and quantum efficiency as shown in Example 32. Accordingly, it is preferable that the boron nitride crucible is used than the molybdenum crucible. Thus, the influence of the element contained in a crucible, a furnace material and the like to the nitride phosphor can be estimated to a certain degree from Examples 1 to 80.</p>
<p id="p-0637" num="0656">Even if the different element is contained by the concentration of several hundreds ppm, a light emitting device which emits light of a brilliant orange to red color by the excitation light source of 450 nm to 470 can be provided without generating the sharp lowering of luminescence brightness and luminescence efficiency, from Examples 1 to 80.</p>
<p id="p-0638" num="0657">Further, in Table 1, the temperature characteristic shows the quality of luminescence of the nitride phosphor at a high temperature and it shows that the nitride phosphor having little attenuation at a high temperature can emits stable luminescence even if the nitride phosphor was provided near at the surface of a light emitting device. Examples 1 to 80 is 97 to 100% at 35° C., 95 to 100% at 100° C., and 58 to 80% at 200° C. Accordingly, it can be grasped that the temperature characteristic of the nitride phosphors of Examples 1 to 80 is extremely good.</p>
<p id="p-0639" num="0658">According to the above-mentioned Examples 1 to 80, in particular, when several tens to several hundreds ppm of B was added, the brightness is 234.6% and the luminescence efficiency is 244.6% (when 100 ppm of B is added), and the brightness is 237.9% and the luminescence efficiency is 248.1% (when 500 ppm of B is added), as the basis when 500 ppm of Cr was added. This shows that the improvement of the luminescence efficiency is remarkable. Further, the similar effect can be obtained at using Ba, Sr, Ca—Sr and the like in place of Ca, although it is not described in Examples.</p>
<p id="p-0640" num="0659">The nitride phosphors of Examples 1 to 80 have a peak wave length near at 609 nm when they are excited by an excitation light source of 460 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0641" num="0660">The afterglow of Example 3 was 14 msec, the afterglow of Example 9 was 18 msec, the afterglow of Example 11 was 22 msec, the afterglow of Example 15 was 18 msec, the afterglow of Example 17 was 14 msec, the afterglow of Example 27 was 18 msec, the afterglow of Example 29 was 10 msec, the afterglow of Example 39 was 16 msec, the afterglow of Example 43 was 12 msec, the afterglow of Example 59 was 20 msec, the afterglow of Example 61 was 22 msec, and the like. Thus, Na, Ti, Mg, Al, B, Cr, Ni and the like have the effect of shortening the afterglow.</p>
<p id="p-0642" num="0661">When the component composition of the nitride phosphors of Examples 1 to 80 was analyzed, Li, Na, K, Rb,Cs, Mg, W, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Ga, In, Ge, Sn, Pb, P, Sb, Bi and the like in which the addition amount were 500 ppm remained by only the amount of 100 ppm or less. Only the less amount of the other different elements than the initial addition amount remained. For example, B which was added by 500 ppm remained by only 400 ppm. This is considered to be that the different elements were scattered.</p>

<p id="p-0643" num="0662">The light emitting device of Example 81 is a white light emitting device which was constituted using the phosphor of Example 15 and to which a reddish component was added. Further, the light emitting device of Example 81 is the type 1 light emitting device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a drawing showing the chromaticity coordinate of the light emitting device of Example 81.</p>
<p id="p-0644" num="0663">In the light emitting element <b>10</b> of Example 81, n+GaN:Si, n−AlGaN:Si, n−GaN, GaInN QWs, p-GaN:Mg, p-AlGaN:Mg, and p-GaN:Mg are laminated in order on the sapphire substrate <b>1</b> as the semiconductor layer <b>2</b>. Further, the portion of n+GaN:Si is etched and exposed to form an n-type electrode. Copper with Fe is used for the lead frame <b>13</b>. The light emitting element <b>10</b> is die-bonded at about the central part of the cup bottom of the mount lead <b>13</b><i>a</i>. Gold is used for the electroconductive wire <b>14</b>, and Ni plating is carried out on the bump <b>4</b> for electrically connecting the electrode <b>3</b> with the electroconductive wire <b>14</b>. In the phosphor <b>11</b> the phosphor of Example 15 and the YAG-base phosphor are used by mixture. As the coating member <b>12</b>, a mixture which mixed an epoxy resin and a dispersant, barium titanate, titanium oxide and the above-mentioned phosphor <b>11</b> at a fixed proportion is used. The epoxy resin is used as the mold member <b>15</b>. The bullet type light emitting device of Example 81 is a column in which the mold member <b>15</b> is a radius of 2 to 4 mm, height is about 7 to 10 mm, and the upper portion is hemispherical.</p>
<p id="p-0645" num="0664">When current is run in the light emitting device <b>1</b> of Example 81, the blue light emitting element <b>10</b> having the first luminescence spectrum with a peak wave length of about 460 nm which can excite the phosphor <b>11</b> emits light, and the phosphor <b>11</b> which covers the semiconductor layer <b>2</b> carries out the wave conversion of the portion of light having the first luminescence spectrum. Specifically, the phosphor of Example 15 emits light having the second luminescence spectrum which is different from light having the first luminescence spectrum. Further, the YAG-base phosphor contained in the phosphor <b>11</b> is excited by light having the first luminescence spectrum and emits light having the third luminescence spectrum. The white light emitting device of Example 81 emits reddish light which was obtained by color mixing of mutually mixing the first, second and third luminescence spectra.</p>
<p id="p-0646" num="0665">As the phosphor <b>11</b> of the light emitting device of Example 81, there is used a phosphor which mixed the phosphor of Example 15 and the yttrium-gadolinium-aluminum oxide phosphor (Y—Ga—Al—O:Ce) activated by cerium. Example 15 is the nitride phosphor of Ca<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>:Eu in which Ba was added. On the other hand, as a comparison, there was prepared the type 1 light emitting device which did not contain the phosphor of Example 15 and used only the yttrium-gadolinium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by cerium as the phosphor <b>11</b>. The white light emitting device of Example 81 and the comparative white light emitting device use the phosphor of (Y<sub>0.8</sub>Gd<sub>0.2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Ce as the yttrium-gadolinium-aluminum oxide phosphor. The comparative white light emitting device emits light by combination of a blue light emitting element and the phosphor of Y—Ga—Al—O:Ce. It is preferable to use the yttrium-gallium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by cerium, Y<sub>3</sub>(Al<sub>0.8</sub>Ga<sub>0.2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Ce, in place of the yttrium-gadolinium-aluminum oxide phosphor activated by cerium.</p>
<p id="p-0647" num="0666">In the light emitting device of Example 81, the weight ratio of the phosphor <b>11</b> was the coating member:the phosphor of Y—Gd—Al—O:Ce:the phosphor of Example 15=10:3.8:0.6.

<p id="p-0650" num="0669">The color rendering property of the light emitting device of Example 81 is improved in comparison with the light emitting device of Comparative Example. The light emitting device of Comparative Example was insufficient in the specific color rendering index R9, but R9 is improved in the light emitting device <b>1</b> of Example 81. The specific color rendering index R9 is a value measuring deviation from a red standard color having comparatively high chroma. Further, it is improved to a value nearer to about 100% than other specific color rendering indexes R8, R10 and the like. Lamp efficiency shows a high value.</p>
<p id="p-0651" num="0670">The phosphor <b>11</b> mixed with the coating member <b>12</b> is used by mixing the phosphor of Y—Gd—Al—O:Ce with the nitride phosphor, but since the two phosphors have different density, those having high density and smaller particle diameter are generally precipitated fast. Accordingly, the phosphor of Y—Gd—Al—O:Ce is precipitated in advance, and the nitride phosphor is precipitated next. Accordingly, even if the same coating member <b>12</b> and the phosphor <b>11</b> are used, color unevenness in the color tone of the light emitting device is generated. Therefore, it is preferable that the particle diameter of the nitride phosphor is controlled at a fixed size and the phosphor of Y—Gd—Al—O:Ce and the nitride phosphor are precipitated about at the same time. It can be improved not to generate the color unevenness.</p>
<heading id="h-0058" level="1">Example 82</heading>
<p id="p-0652" num="0671">The light emitting device of Example 82 related to the present invention is the type 2 (surface mounting type) light emitting device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The light emitting device of Example 82 uses a light emitting element capable of emitting blue light (a light emitting element having InGaN semiconductor layer which has a peak wave length of 460 nm at a blue region as a luminescence layer) as the light emitting element <b>101</b>. However, the present invention is not limited to the light emitting element capable of emitting blue light, and for example, a light emitting element capable of emitting ultraviolet light at 380 to 400 nm can be also used.</p>
<p id="p-0653" num="0672">More specifically, a p-type semiconductor layer and an n-type semiconductor layer are formed in the light emitting element <b>101</b> (not illustrated), and the electroconductive wires <b>104</b> which are respectively linked with the lead electrode <b>102</b> through ohmic electrodes are connected with said p type semiconductor layer and the n-type semiconductor layer. Further, the insulating sealing material <b>103</b> is formed so as to cover the outer peripheral of the lead electrode and prevents short circuit. At the upper part of the light emitting element <b>101</b>, the transparent window portion <b>107</b> which is extended from the lid <b>106</b> situated at the upper part of the package <b>105</b> is provided. At the inner face of said transparent window portion <b>107</b>, a mixture of the phosphor <b>108</b> related to the present invention and the coating member <b>109</b> is coated on about all over the surface. Hereat, the phosphor of Example 60, the phospher of (Ca<sub>0.93</sub>, Eu<sub>0.05</sub>, Mn<sub>0.02</sub>)<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Br<sub>2 </sub>and the phosphor of Y<sub>3</sub>(Al<sub>0.8</sub>, Ga<sub>0.2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Ce are used in the light emitting device of Example 82. The package <b>105</b> is a square having a side of 8 mm to 12 mm whose corner portion was removed.</p>
<p id="p-0654" num="0673">Among the blue light emitted from the light emitting element <b>101</b>, indirect light reflected by a reflecting plate and light directly discharged from the light emitting element <b>101</b> are irradiated on the phosphor <b>108</b>, and white light emission becomes possible.</p>
<p id="p-0655" num="0674">When a white LED lamp is prepared using the light emitting device which was formed as described above, the yield can be 99%. Thus, according to the light emitting diode of the present Example 81, there can be provided a light emitting device which has good mass production and high reliability and further little color tone unevenness.</p>
<heading id="h-0059" level="1">Example 83</heading>
<p id="p-0656" num="0675">The light emitting device of Example 83 is the type 3 (cap type) light emitting device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0657" num="0676">In the light emitting device of Example 83, the phosphor used for the cap <b>16</b> uses the phosphor of Example 15. The phosphor of Example 15 is also used in the cup of the mount lead <b>13</b><i>a</i>. However, since the phosphor used for the cap <b>16</b>, the inside of the cup of the mount lead <b>13</b><i>a </i>may be only the coating member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0658" num="0677">In the light emitting device thus constituted, the wave length conversion of the portion of light emitted from the light emitting element <b>10</b> is carried out by the phosphor of Example 15 when the light passes through the cap <b>16</b>. The wave length-converted light and blue light which was not wave length-converted by the phosphor are mixed, and as a result, white light is discharged from the surface of the cap <b>16</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0710" num="0729">The phosphors of Examples 110 to 124 are represented by the general formula, (Ca<sub>0.9775</sub>,Eu<sub>0.0075</sub>, Z<sub>0.015</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>. In the phosphors of Examples 110 to 124, oxygen is contained by 1.0 to 1.6%. In Examples 110 to 124, the concentration of Eu is 0.0075. The concentration of Eu is a molar ratio against the molar concentration of Ca. Further, the rare earth elements of Sc, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu were used for the co-activator WR. The concentration of the co-activator WR added is 0.015. The concentration of WR added is a molar ratio for the molar concentration of Ca. Comparative Example 1 is a phosphor in which no co-activator WR is added and only Eu was added, and is shown as comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0711" num="0730">Further, Table 8 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> are not the data which compared the optimum value of the phosphors of Examples 110 to 124 in which WR was co-activated, and is one example. For example, as shown in Table 9 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, when the compounding amounts of the co-activator La and the activator Eu, and the like were changed, the phosphor of Example which is different from the compounding amount of the co-activator La of Table 8 showed the highest value of the luminescence brightness. The phosphor having higher luminescence brightness than that of the phosphors of Examples 110 to 124 can be produced by changing the compounding amount of the rare earth element, firing condition and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0712" num="0731">Firstly, calcium nitride, silicone nitride, europium oxide and the oxide of the rare earth element are mixed. The oxides of the rare earth element are represented by Z<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>in general, but cerium, praseodymium, and terbium are exceptional, and they are respectively cerium oxide, CeO<sub>2</sub>, praseodymium oxide, Pr<sub>6</sub>O<sub>11</sub>, and terbium, Tb<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. In Examples 110 to 124, the compounding ratio (molar ratio) of calcium nitride, Ca<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, silicone nitride, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, europium oxide, Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and the oxides of the rare earth element which are raw materials is adjusted to be Ca:Si:Eu:rare earth element=1.955:5:0.015:0.030. At least one or more of Mn, Mg, Sr, Ca, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Cr, Ni and the like may be contained by several ppm to several hundreds ppm in said raw materials.</p>
<p id="p-0713" num="0732">The above-mentioned compounds are mixed, and firing is carried out. As firing conditions, they are charged in a boron nitride crucible in ammonia atmosphere, the temperature was gradually raised from room temperature over about 5 hours, and firing is carried out for 5 hours at about 1350° C., cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours. The base nitride phosphor after the firing is (Ca<sub>0.9775</sub>,Eu<sub>0.0075</sub>,WR<sub>0.015</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0714" num="0733">Example 111 uses Y as the co-activator WR. It becomes low afterglow in comparison with Comparative Example 1 which does not contain the co-activator WR. It can be applied to products such as a display in which short afterglow is required, by making the phosphor be short afterglow.</p>
<p id="p-0715" num="0734">Example 112 uses La as the co-activator WR. The luminescence brightness of Example 112 increases by 11.4% in comparison with Comparative Example 1. A more clear phosphor can be provided by the increase of luminescence brightness in comparison with Comparative Example 1. Further, Example 112 becomes short afterglow in comparison with Comparative Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0716" num="0735">Example 113 uses Ce as the co-activator WR. Example 113 can improve the luminescence brightness in like manner as Example 112.</p>
<p id="p-0717" num="0736">Example 114 uses Pr as the co-activator WR. The luminescence brightness of Example 114 increases by 5.4% in comparison with Comparative Example 1. A more clear phosphor can be provided by the increase of luminescence brightness in comparison with Comparative Example 1. Further, the Y value of color tone is not changed in comparison with Comparative Example 1 and the x value of color tone is changed. A red component is increased in comparison with Comparative Example 1 by the change of the Y value of color tone, and a more reddish phosphor can be provided. Further, the quantum efficiency is good.</p>
<p id="p-0718" num="0737">Example 115 uses Nd as the co-activator WR. The luminescence peak wave length of Example 115 is shifted to 621 nm, and it can increase reddish. Example 115 becomes long afterglow in comparison with Comparative Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0719" num="0738">Example 117 uses Gd as the co-activator WR. Example 117 can improve the luminescence brightness in like manner as Example 112.</p>
<p id="p-0720" num="0739">Example 118 uses Tb as the co-activator WR. Example 118 can improve the luminescence brightness in like manner as Example 112. The quantum efficiency of Example 118 is good.</p>
<p id="p-0721" num="0740">Example 119 uses Dy as the co-activator WR. Example 119 can improve the luminescence brightness in like manner as Example 112.</p>
<p id="p-0722" num="0741">Example 120 uses Ho as the co-activator WR. Example 120 can improve the luminescence brightness in like manner as Example 112. Example 120 becomes short afterglow in comparison with Comparative Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0723" num="0742">Example 121 uses Er as the co-activator WR. Example 121 can improve the luminescence brightness in like manner as Example 112. Example 121 becomes short afterglow in comparison with Comparative Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0724" num="0743">Example 124 uses Lu as the co-activator WR. Example 124 can improve the luminescence brightness in like manner as Example 112. Example 124 becomes short afterglow in comparison with Comparative Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0725" num="0744">Any of the temperature characteristics of the phosphors of Examples 110 to 124 is extremely good. With respect to the temperature characreristics, when said phosphors were provided on the surface of light emitting elements, the composition of the phosphors is not changed, and the high luminescence properties are exhibited, therefore it is shown that the higher the temperature is, the more stable the phosphor is.</p>
<p id="p-0726" num="0745">The phosphor related to Example uses the crucible of a boron nitride material, and firing is carried out in ammonia atmosphere. Since a furnace and a crucible are not eroded under the firing condition, impurities are not contaminated in a baked product. The crucible of a boron nitride material can be used, but it is not preferable that the crucible of a molybdenum nitride material is used. When the crucible of a molybdenum nitride material is used, it is considered that the crucible is eroded, molybdenum contaminates in the nitride phosphor, and molybdenum provokes the lowering of the luminescence properties.</p>
<p id="p-0727" num="0746">Thus, the improvement of the luminescence properties can provide a luminescence material which emits light of a more brilliant white color. Further, since the improvement of the luminescence properties enhances the luminescence efficiency, the reduction of electric power can be attained.</p>
<heading id="h-0067" level="1">Examples 125 to 133</heading>
<p id="p-0728" num="0747">Examples 125 to 133 produced phosphors which variously changed the addition concentration of the co-activator La in the base nitride phosphor, Ca—Si—N:Eu,La. Table 9 shows the chemical properties and physical properties of the phosphors of Examples 125 to 133 which variously changed the addition concentration of the co-activator La in the base nitride phosphor, Ca—Si—N:Eu,La. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a drawing which shows the measurement result which was obtained by measuring the luminescence brightness of the phosphors of Examples 125 to 133 which variously changed the addition concentration of the co-activator La in the base nitride phosphor, Ca—Si—N:Eu,La. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a drawing which shows the luminescence spectra of the phosphors of Examples 125 to 133 which variously changed the addition concentration of the co-activator La in the base nitride phosphor, Ca—Si—N:Eu,La. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows the reflection spectra of the phosphors of Examples 125 to 133 which variously changed the addition concentration of the co-activator La in the base nitride phosphor, Ca—Si—N:Eu,La. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows the excitation spectra of the phosphors of Examples 125 to 133 which variously changed the addition concentration of the co-activator La in the base nitride phosphor, Ca—Si—N:Eu,La. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref> is a photo photographed the particle diameter of the phosphor of Example 128, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> is a photo photographed that of Example 129.</p>

<p id="p-0730" num="0749">The phosphor is represented by the general formula, (Ca<sub>(1−0.0075−X)</sub>Eu<sub>0.0075</sub>La<sub>X</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8 </sub>in which Mn was added. In the phosphors of Examples 125 to 133, oxygen is contained by 1.0 to 1.6%. In Examples 125 to 133, the concentration of Eu is 0.0075. In Examples 125 to 133, there were prepared the phosphors in which the concentration of La was changed to 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.06, 0.1 and 0.2. Examples 125 to 133 use La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>as a raw material. Comparative Example 1 is a phosphor in which no co-activator La is added and only Eu was added, and is shown as comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0731" num="0750">Since Examples 125 to 133 carry out the similar production steps as Examples 110 to 124, the steps which pass the similar constitution are abbreviated.

<p id="p-0732" num="0751">In Examples 125 to 133, the x value of color tone and the y value of color tone are nearly the same. On the contrary, the luminescence brightness is improved in accordance with the gradual increase of the addition concentration of La. This is considered to be caused by the flux effect. Although the luminescence brightness was peak when the addition concentration of La is 0.02, it is lowered afterward. This is considered to be caused by concentration quenching.</p>
<p id="p-0733" num="0752">Further, the afterglows of Examples 125 to 133 become short in comparison with Comparative Example 1.</p>

In the phosphors of Examples 134 to 144, oxygen is contained by 1.0 to 1.6%. In Examples 134 to 144, the concentration of Eu is 0.0075. In Examples 134 to 144, there were prepared the phosphors in which the concentration of Pr was changed to 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, 0.01, 0.0125, 0.015, 0.0175, 0.02, 0.03, 0.06 and 0.1. Examples 134 to 144 use Pr<sub>6</sub>O<sub>11 </sub>as a raw material. Comparative Example 1 is a phosphor in which no co-activator Pr is added and only Eu was added, and is shown as comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0739" num="0758">Since Examples 134 to 144 carry out the similar production steps as Examples 110 to 124, the steps which pass the similar constitution are abbreviated. In said raw materials, at least one or more of Mg, Sr, Ca, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn, Cr and Ni may be contained by several ppm to several hundreds ppm.</p>
<p id="p-0740" num="0759">In Examples 134 to 144, the x value of color tone and the y value of color tone are nearly the same. The peak wave lengths are also about the same. To the contrary, the luminescence brightness is improved in accordance with the gradual increase of the addition concentration of Pr. This is considered to be caused by the sensitization effect. Although the luminescence brightness was peak when the addition concentration of Pr is 0.005, it is lowered afterward. This is considered to be caused by concentration quenching. The luminescence brightness of Example 139 was improved.</p>
<p id="p-0741" num="0760">Any of the temperature characteristics of Examples 134 to 144 is extremely good. For example, the temperature characteristic of Example 135 is 99.2% at 1001C, and 68.1% at 200° C. The temperature characteristic of Example 139 is 98.6% at 100° C., and 74.8% at 200° C.</p>

Comparative Example 1 is a phosphor in which ratio is Sr:Ca=0:10, no co-activator La is added and only Eu was added, and is shown as comparison.</p>
<p id="p-0751" num="0770">Since Examples 149 to 155 carry out the similar production steps as Examples 110 to 124, the steps which pass the similar constitution are abbreviated. In said raw materials, at least one or more of Mg, Sr, Ca, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn, Cr and Ni may be contained by several ppm to several hundreds ppm.</p>
<p id="p-0752" num="0771">Since the phosphors of Examples 149 to 155 are the phosphor of mix crystal type of Sr and Ca, the phosphor of mix crystal type of Sr and Ca changes the color tone and peak wave length. The peak wave length shifts to a long wave length side in accordance with the increase of Sr. The peak wave length shifts to the longest wave length side at Sr:Ca=5:5. A reddish warm color-base phosphor having a peak wave length at a longer wave length side than Ca—Si—N:Eu,WR can be produced thereby. In Examples 149 to 155, the x value of color tone and the y value of color tone are changed by the mixing ratio of Sr and Ca. The phosphor having a desired color tone can be produced thereby. For example, the light emitting device mixing the phosphor of Ca—Si—N:Eu,La and the phosphor of Sr—Ca—Si—O—N:Eu,La can provide a light emitting device having a desired peak wave length at a range of 609 nm to 634 nm. Any of the temperature characteristics of Examples 149 to 155 is extremely good.</p>

<p id="p-0779" num="0798">Examples 170 to 176 are results of testing the chemical properties and physical properties of the phosphors related to the present invention which are represented by Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu to which Mn was added. The mixing ratio of raw materials in Table 15 is those in which the raw materials are represented by molar ratio. The phosphors are represented by the general formula Sr<sub>X</sub>Ca<sub>(1.94−X)</sub>Eu<sub>0.06</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8 </sub>(0≦X≦1.94) to which Mn was added, or those containing the fine amount of oxygen are used. In Examples 170 to 176, the concentration of Eu is 0.03. The concentration of Eu is a molar ratio against the molar concentration of Sr—Ca. Further, Si is 5, while the addition amount of Mn is 0.015. Examples 170 to 176 are results obtained by properly changing the concentration of Sr and the concentration of Ca.</p>
<p id="p-0780" num="0799">Firstly, strontium nitride, calcium nitride, silicone nitride and europium oxide are mixed. In Example 170, the compounding ratio (molar ratio) of strontium nitride, Sr<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, calcium nitride, Ca<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, silicone nitride, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, and europium oxide, Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>which are raw materials is adjusted to be Sr:Ca:Si:Eu=X: 1.94−X:5:0.06.</p>
<p id="p-0781" num="0800">Mn was added at a molar ratio of 0.015. At least one or more of Mg, Sr, Ca, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn, Cr and Ni may be contained by several ppm to several hundreds ppm in said raw materials.</p>
<p id="p-0782" num="0801">The above-mentioned compounds are mixed, and firing is carried out. As firing conditions, they are charged in a boron nitride crucible in ammonia atmosphere, the temperature was gradually raised from room temperature over about 5 hours, firing is carried out for 5 hours at about 1350° C., and cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours. Mn remains by several ppm to several tens ppm in Sr<sub>X</sub>Ca<sub>(1.94−X)</sub>Eu<sub>0.06</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>(0≦X≦1.94) after the firing.</p>
<p id="p-0783" num="0802">In Example 170, the molar ratio of Sr:Ca is 9:1. The luminescence brightness of the silicon nitride phosphor of Example 170 is referred to as 100%, the luminescence efficiency is referred to as 100%, and the luminescence efficiencies of Examples 171 to 176 are prescribed based on the basis of the compounding proportion at this time. When the compounding proportion of Ca against Sr is increased, the luminescence efficiencies of the silicon nitride phosphor 126.9% at the molar ratio of Sr: Ca=7:3, and the peak wave length is 639 nm. The luminescence efficiency is improved from this, and the peak wave length is shifted to a long wave length side. Further, when the compounding proportion of Ca against Sr is increased and the molar ratio of Sr:Ca is 5:5, namely, 1:1, the luminescence brightness of the silicon nitride phosphor is 111.2%, the luminescence efficiency is 167.7%, and the peak wave length is 644 nm. From this result, the luminescence efficiencies such as the luminescence brightness and quantum efficiency are more improved than the case of Sr:Ca=9:1. In particular, since the peak wave length is shifted to a longer wave length side, the reddish phosphor can be produced. Further, the temperature characteristic is also extremely good. When the compounding proportion of Ca against Sr is further increased, the peak wave length is shifted to a short wave length side. Even such case, the luminescence brightness and quantum efficiency are not lowered, and the good luminescence properties can be obtained. In particular, since Sr is expensive in comparison with Ca, production cost can be reduced by increasing the compounding proportion of Ca.</p>
<p id="p-0784" num="0803">The phosphor having a desired peak wave length can be produced by appropriately combining the phosphors of Examples 170 to 176 with Sr—Si—N:Eu to which Mn was added, Ca—Si—N:Eu to which Mn was added, Sr—Ca—Si—O—N:Eu to which Mn was added, Sr—Si—O—N:Eu to which Mn was added, and Ca—Si—O—N:Eu to which Mn was added. Since these have about the same composition, the phosphor has good luminescence properties.</p>
<p id="p-0785" num="0804">The phosphor related to Example uses the crucible of a boron nitride material, and firing is carried out in ammonia atmosphere. Since a furnace and a crucible are not eroded under the firing condition, impurities are not contaminated in a baked product. The crucible of a boron nitride material can be used, but it is not preferable that the crucible of a molybdenum nitride material is used. When the crucible of a molybdenum nitride material is used, it is considered that the crucible is eroded, molybdenum contaminates in the nitride phosphor, and molybdenum provokes the lowering of the luminescence properties.</p>
<p id="p-0786" num="0805">Thus, the improvement of the luminescence properties can provide luminescence materials which emit light of more brilliant white. Further, since the improvement of the luminescence properties enhance the energy efficiency, electric power can be also reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0787" num="0806">When said phosphor was provided on the surface of a light emitting device, it is represented that the high luminescence properties are exhibited and the higher the temperarure characteristics are, the more stable they are.</p>

<p id="p-0790" num="0809">Examples 177 to 180 are results of testing the chemical properties and physical properties when the concentration of Eu of the phosphors related to the present invention which are represented by Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu to which Mn was added were changed. The phosphor is represented by the general formula Sr<sub>X</sub>Ca<sub>(2−T−X)</sub>Eu<sub>T</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>(0≦X&lt;2) to which Mn was added or those containing the fine amount of oxygen are used. The compounding proportion of Sr and Ca of raw materials is Sr:Ca=X:2−T−X=7:3. As the compounding proportion of Eu, those which are T=0.01, 0.03, 0.06 and 0.12 are used. The concentration of Eu at this case is 0.005, 0.015, 0.03 and 0.06. The concentration of Eu is a molar ratio against the molar concentration of Sr—Ca. Further, Si is 5, while the addition amount of Mn is 0.015.</p>
<p id="p-0791" num="0810">Since Examples 177 to 180 carries out the similar production steps as Examples 170 to 176, the step which passes the similar constitution is abbreviated. At least one or more of Mg, Sr, Ca, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn, Cr and Ni may be contained by several ppm to several hundreds ppm in said raw materials.</p>
<p id="p-0792" num="0811">The luminescence efficiency is shown based on the basis of the phosphor of Example 177. The most improvement of the luminescence brightness was observed at Example 177 in which the concentration of Eu is 0.03. When the concentration of Eu is little, the luminescence is not adequately carried out, and when the concentration of Eu is too much, the concentration quenching occurs, or it is reacted with Sr<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2 </sub>or Ca<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, and creates the composition different from the objective base nitride phosphor, therefore the lowering of the luminescence efficiency occurs. The luminescence efficiency is best for Example 180. On the other hand, the peak wave length is shifted to a long wave length side in accordance with the increase of the concentration of Eu. The reason why this phenomenon occurs is not clear, but it is considered that the mix crystal of Sr and Ca is further accelerated by accelerating the diffusion of Mn with Sr<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2 </sub>and Ca<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, therefore the peak wave length is shifted to a long wave length side. Any of the temperarure characteristics of Examples 177 to 180 is extremely good.</p>

<p id="p-0795" num="0814">Examples 181 to 189 are results of testing the chemical properties and physical properties when the concentration of Eu of the phosphors related to the present invention which are represented by Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu to which Mn was added were changed. The phosphor is represented by the general formula Sr<sub>X</sub>Ca<sub>(2−T−X)</sub>Eu<sub>T</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>(0≦X&lt;2) to which Mn was added or those containing the fine amount of oxygen are used. The compounding proportion of Sr and Ca of raw materials is Sr:Ca=X: 2−T−X=5:5. As the compounding proportions of Eu in Examples 181 to 184, those which are T=0.01, 0.03, 0.06 and 0.12 are used. The concentrations of Eu at this case is 0.005, 0.015, 0.03 and 0.06. The concentration of Eu is a molar ratio against the molar concentration of Sr—Ca. Examples 0.185 to 189 used commercially available raw materials which are different from Examples 181 to 184. As the compounding proportions of Eu in Examples 185 to 189, those which are T=0.12, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6 are used. The concentrations of Eu at this case is 0.06, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.3. With respect to the addition amount of Mn in Examples 181 to 189, Si is 5, while the addition amount of Mn is 0.015.</p>
<p id="p-0796" num="0815">Since Examples 181 to 189 carry out the similar production steps as Examples 170 to 176, the step which passes the similar constitution is abbreviated. At least one or more of Mg, Sr, Ca, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn, Cr and Ni may be contained by several ppm to several hundreds ppm in said raw materials.</p>
<p id="p-0797" num="0816">The luminescence efficiency is shown based on the basis of the phosphor of Example 181. The most improvement of the luminescence brightness was observed at Example 183 in which the concentration of Eu is 0.03. When the concentration of Eu is little, the luminescence is not adequately carried out, and when the concentration of Eu is too much, the concentration quenching occurs, or it is reacted with Sr<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2 </sub>or Ca<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, and creates the composition different from the objective base nitride phosphor, therefore the lowering of the luminescence efficiency occurs. The luminescence efficiency is best for Example 184. Examples 185 to 189 generate the lowering of the luminescence brightness, but it is considered that since commercially available raw materials are used, impurities are contained in said raw materials therefore the lowering of the luminescence efficiency occurs. In Examples 181 to 185 and in Examples 185 to 189, the peak wave length is shifted to a long wave length side in accordance with the increase of the concentration of Eu. The principle is not clear, but it is considered that the mix crystal of Sr and Ca is further accelerated by accelerating the diffusion of Mn with Sr<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2 </sub>and Ca<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, therefore the peak wave length is shifted to a long wave length side. Any of the temperarure characteristics of Examples 181 to 189 is extremely good.</p>

<p id="p-0805" num="0824">Examples 194 to 201 are results of testing the chemical properties and physical properties when the addition amount Mn of the phosphors related to the present invention which are represented by Ca—Si—N:Eu was changed. The mixing ratio of raw materials in Table 19 was a value in which the raw materials are represented by molar ratio. The phosphor which was thus produced is represented by the general formula Ca<sub>(2−T)</sub>Eu<sub>T</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8 </sub>to which Mn was added or a form containing the fine amount of oxygen. A phosphor in which Mn was not added is shown in Example 194. The phosphors of Examples 194 to 201 use those in which the addition amounts of Mn are 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1 and 0.2. The concentrations of Mn in this case are 0.0025, 0.005, 0.0075, 0.015, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.1, and the concentration of Mn is a molar ratio against the molar concentration of Ca. The concentration of Eu is constant at 0.075.</p>
<p id="p-0806" num="0825">Since Examples 194 to 201 carry out the similar production steps as Examples 170 to 176, the step which passes the similar constitution is abbreviated. At least one or more of Mg, Sr, Ca, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn, Cr and Ni may be contained by several ppm to several hundreds ppm in said raw materials.</p>
<p id="p-0807" num="0826">The luminescence efficiency is shown based on the basis of the phosphor of Example 194 to which Mn was not added. The most improvement of the luminescence brightness was observed in Example 197 in which the concentration of Mn is 0.0075 and Example 198 in which the concentration of Mn is 0.015. This is considered to be caused by that when the concentration of Mn is little, the diffusion of raw materials is not adequately carried out and the growth of particles is not adequately carried out. On the other hand, when the concentration of Mn is too much, it is considered to be caused by that Mn prevents the composition formation of Ca—Si—N:Eu and crystal growth. The quantum efficiency is extremely good in Examples 195 to 198. Even if the addition amount of Mn is changed, the temperarure characteristics in Examples 194 to 200 are extremely good. The peak wave length is constant even if the addition amount of Mn is changed.</p>

<p id="p-0815" num="0834">Examples 205 to 206 are results of testing the chemical properties and physical properties when the addition amount of Mn of the phosphors related to the present invention which are represented by Ca—Si—N:Eu was changed. The mixing ratio of raw materials in Table 21 is a value in which the raw materials are represented by a molar ratio. The phosphor which was thus produced is represented by the general formula Ca<sub>(2−T)</sub>Eu<sub>T</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8 </sub>to which Mn was added or a form containing the fine amount of oxygen. A phosphor in which Mn was not added is shown in Example 205. The phosphor of Example 206 uses one in which the addition amount of Mn is 0.04 mol. The concentration of Mn in this case is 0.02, and the concentration of Mn is a molar ratio against the molar concentration of Ca. The concentration of Eu is constant at 0.02.</p>
<p id="p-0816" num="0835">Since Examples 205 to 206 carry out the similar production steps as Examples 170 to 176, the step which passes the similar constitution is abbreviated. At least one or more of Mg, Sr, Ca, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn, Cr and Ni may be contained by several ppm to several hundreds ppm in said raw materials.</p>
<p id="p-0817" num="0836">The luminescence efficiency is shown based on the basis of the phosphor of Example 205 to which Mn was not added.</p>
<p id="p-0818" num="0837">Example 206 in which the addition amount of Mn is 0.02 improved the luminescence brightness and the luminescence efficiency. The reason is considered to be the same as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0819" num="0838">When the mean particle diameters of Examples 205 and 206 were measured, the mean particle diameter of Example 205 is 2.9 μm and the mean particle diameter of Example 206 is 6.4 μm. The difference of the luminescence brightness is generated by the difference of the mean particle diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0820" num="0839">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, there are shown photos which photographed the particle diameters of the phosphor to which Mn was not added and the phosphor to which Mn was added. The mean particle diameter of the phosphor of Example 205 to which Mn was not added is 2.8 μm and the mean particle diameter of the phosphor of Example 206 to which Mn was added is 6.4 μm. The mean particle diameter of the phosphor to which Mn was added is comparatively big in comparison with the phosphor to which Mn was not added. It is considered that the difference of the mean particle diameter enhances the luminescence brightness.</p>

<p id="p-0823" num="0842">Examples 207 to 211 are results of testing the chemical properties and physical properties when the addition amount of Mn of the phosphors related to the present invention which are represented by Sr—Si—N:Eu was changed. The mixing ratio of raw materials in Table 22 is a value in which the raw materials are represented by a molar ratio. The phosphor which was thus produced is represented by the general formula Sr<sub>(2−T)</sub>Eu<sub>T</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8 </sub>to which Mn was added or a form containing the fine amount of oxygen. A phosphor in which Mn was not added is shown in Example 207. The phosphors of Examples 208 to 211 use those in which the addition amounts of Mn are 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.2. The concentrations of Mn in this case are 0.005, 0.015, 0.05 and 0.1, and the concentration of Mn is a molar ratio against the molar concentration of Sr. The concentration of Eu is constant at 0.03.</p>

<p id="p-0825" num="0844">The luminescence efficiency is shown based on the basis of the phosphor of Example 207 to which Mn was not added. Examples 208 to 210 improved the luminescence brightness, and in particular, Example 209 in which the concentration of Mn is 0.015 improved the luminescence brightness to the utmost. Further, with respect to Examples 208 to 210, the quantum efficiency is extremely good. Further, the temperarure characteristics in Examples 208 to 211 are extremely good, even if the addition amount of Mn is changed. The peak wave length is shifted to a long wave length side in accordance with the increase of the addition amount of Mn. The reason is not clear, but it is considered that Mn accelerates the diffusion of raw materials, in particular, Eu.</p>

<p id="p-0828" num="0847">Examples 212 to 220 are results of testing the chemical properties and physical properties when the addition amount of Mn of the phosphors related to the present invention which are represented by Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu was changed. The mixing ratio of raw materials in Table 23 is a value in which the raw materials are represented by a molar ratio. The phosphors of Examples 212 to 220 which were thus produced are represented by the general formula Sr<sub>X</sub>Ca<sub>(2−X−T)</sub>Eu<sub>T</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8 </sub>or a form containing the fine amount of oxygen.</p>
<p id="p-0829" num="0848">Since Examples 212 to 220 carry out the similar production steps as Examples 170 to 176, the step which passes the similar constitution is abbreviated. At least one or more of Mg, Sr, Ca, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn, Cr and Ni may be contained by several ppm to several hundreds ppm in said raw materials.</p>
<p id="p-0830" num="0849">The molar ratios of Sr and Ca in Examples 212 to 220 are Sr:Ca=5:5. A phosphor in which Mn was not added is shown in Example 212. The phosphors of Examples 213 to 216 use those in which the addition amounts of Mn are 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.2. The concentrations of Mn in this case are 0.005, 0.015, 0.05 and 0.1, and the concentration of Mn is a molar ratio against the molar concentration of Sr—Ca. The concentration of Eu is constant at 0.02.</p>
<p id="p-0831" num="0850">The luminescence efficiency is shown based on the basis of the phosphor of Example 212 to which Mn was not added. Any of Examples 213 to 216 improved the luminescence brightness. Further, the luminescence efficiencies are also improved. Furthermore, the temperature characreristics are also extremely good. Thus, the luminescence properties are improved by adding Mn to the phosphor represented by Sr—Ca—Si—N:Eu.</p>
<p id="p-0832" num="0851">Examples 217 and 218 carried out the production of the phosphor related to the present invention using commercially available raw materials. The molar ratio of Sr and Ca in Examples 217 and 218 is Sr:Ca=5:5. The phosphor to which Mn was not added is shown in Example 217. The phosphor of Example 218 uses a phosphor in which the addition amount of Mn is 0.04. The concentration of Mn is 0.02, and the concentration of Mn is a molar ratio against the molar concentration of Sr—Ca. The concentration of Eu is 0.02.</p>
<p id="p-0833" num="0852">The luminescence efficiency is shown based on the basis of the phosphor of Example 217 to which Mn is not added. The luminescence properties can be improved by addition of Mn even if commercially available raw materials are used.</p>
<p id="p-0834" num="0853">The production of the phosphor related to the present invention was carried out using the commercially available raw materials in Examples 219 and 220. The molar ratio of Sr and Ca in Examples 219 and 220 is Sr:Ca=7:3. The phosphor to which Mn is not added is shown in Example 50. The phosphor of Example 220 uses a phosphor in which the addition amount of Mn is 0.02. The concentration of Mn in this case is 0.01. The concentration of Mn is a molar ratio against the molar concentration of Sr—Ca. The concentration of Eu is 0.01.</p>
<p id="p-0835" num="0854">The luminescence efficiency is shown based on the basis of the phosphor of Example 219 to which Mn was not added. Example 220 in which the addition amount of Mn is 0.01 can improve the luminescence properties.</p>

<p id="p-0850" num="0869">In the light emitting device <b>3</b> of Example 222, the phosphor <b>11</b> uses a mixture of the phosphor of Example 218 and the yttrium-gadolinium-aluminum oxide fluorescent substance (Y—Ga—Al—O:Ce) activated by cerium. Further, in the light emitting device <b>3</b> of Example 222, the phosphor having the composition of Y<sub>3</sub>(Al<sub>0.8</sub>Ga<sub>0.2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Ce is used as the yttrium-gadolinium-aluminum oxide fluorescent substance.</p>
<p id="p-0851" num="0870">When the present phosphor is excited by light of Ex=460 nm, light having a peak wave length of 533 nm is emitted. Similarly, the peak wave length of the phosphor of Example 218 is 650 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0852" num="0871">The phosphor <b>11</b> and the coating member are mixed at the weight ratio of the coating member:the phosphor of (Y—Ga—Al—O:Ce):the phosphor of Example 218=10:4.0:1.08.</p>
<p id="p-0853" num="0872">The light emitting device of Example 22 using the phosphor which was thus mixed emits light of an electric bulb color. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> showing the chromaticity coordinate of the light emitting device of Example 222, the color tone x and the color tone y are situated at a warm color-base white color luminescence region. The specific color rendering index R9 of the light emitting device of Example 222 is also 60%, and the color rendering property is improved. In the light emitting device of Example 222, the peak wave length is situated at a red region of 620.7 nm, therefore the electric bulb color white light emitting device is obtained. In the light emitting device of Example 222, the color temperature is 2832K, the color rendering property Ra is 90.4, therefore it has the luminescence property nearby an electric bulb color. Further, the light emitting device of Example 222 has the high luminescence property of 19.2 lm/W.</p>

<p id="p-0854" num="0873">The light emitting device of Example 223 is the type 3 light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0855" num="0874">The light emitting device of Example 223 uses the light emitting element <b>101</b> which has an InGaN semiconductor layer having a luminescence peak of 460 nm at a blue region as a light emitting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0856" num="0875">Further, the phosphor of Example 220 and the phosphor of Y<sub>3</sub>(Al<sub>0.8</sub>Ga<sub>0.2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Ce are used as the phosphor.</p>
<p id="p-0857" num="0876">In the light emitting device of Example 2.23 which was constituted as above, the phosphor is a phosphor in which an indirect luminescence spectrum which was reflected from a reflection plate and a luminescence spectrum which was directly emitted from the light emitting element <b>101</b> are irradiated on the phosphor <b>108</b>, and light having a blue luminescence spectrum which was emitted from the light emitting element <b>101</b> emits light of a white color.</p>
<p id="p-0858" num="0877">Further, a desired luminescence spectrum can be obtained by doping phosphors emitting green light such as SrAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:Eu, Y<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>:Ce,Tb, MgAl<sub>11</sub>O<sub>19</sub>:Ce,Tb, Sr<sub>7</sub>Al<sub>12</sub>O<sub>25</sub>:Eu (at least one or more among Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba)Ga<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>:Eu; phosphors emitting blue light such as Sr<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl:Eu, (SrCaBa)<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl:Eu, (BaCa)<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl:Eu, (at least one or more among Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba)<sub>2</sub>B<sub>5</sub>O<sub>9</sub>Cl:Eu,Mn, (at least one or more among.

<p id="p-0865" num="0884">The above-mentioned compounds are mixed and firing is carried out. As firing conditions, they are charged in a boron nitride crucible in ammonia atmosphere, the temperature was gradually raised from room temperature over about 5 hours, firing is carried out for 5 hours at about 1350° C., and cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0866" num="0885">According to Table 27, O is contained by 0.87% by weight, and Mg, Sr, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn and Fe are contained by several ppm in the nitride phosphor of Example 224 in addition to the base nitride phosphor. Si of % by weight obtained by extracting the above-mentioned base nitride phosphor from 100% is contained. The nitride phosphor has high luminescence brightness by the firing conditions and Mg, Sr, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu and Mn. Since a semiconductor light emitting element generally used is raised to a temperature of 100 to 150° C., it is preferable that it is stable at said temperature when the nitride phosphor are formed on the surface of a light emitting element. The temperature characteristics of the nitride phosphors of the present Examples 224 to 229 are extremely good. From this viewpoint, Example 225 has extremely good temperature characteristic therefore has a superior technical meaning.</p>
<p id="p-0867" num="0886">Example 226 has the high luminescence brightness in comparison with Example 225, and has the high quantum efficiency. Accordingly, Example 226 exhibits the extremely good temperature characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0868" num="0887">The particle diameter of Example 224 is 1 to 3 μm, the particle diameter is big, and the luminescence brightness is high. It has a good dispersion and easiness to handle.</p>
<p id="p-0869" num="0888">Example 227 carried out the firing of raw materials changing firing conditions. Even if the firing is a two step firing, Example 227 exhibits the high brightness, high quantum efficiency and good temperature characteristic in like manner as Examples 224 and 226.</p>
<p id="p-0870" num="0889">The phosphors related to Examples use the crucible of boron nitride material, and firing is carried out in ammonia atmosphere. Since a furnace and a crucible are not eroded, impurities are not contaminated in a baked product. Example 228 shows the luminescence efficiency when B is contained in raw materials. From the result of Example 228, the luminescence efficiency is kept in a high condition even if much B is contained.</p>
<p id="p-0871" num="0890">This is caused by an assumption that a furnace and a BN crucible are eroded and BN is contained in the phosphor, but since the luminescence efficiency is not lowered, firing can be carried out without considering the erosion of the furnace and crucible. Namely, even if the boron nitride eroded is contained in the phosphor as a result of carrying out the firing under the condition, the luminescence efficiency is not lowered, therefore it is extremely useful.</p>
<p id="p-0872" num="0891">Example 229 shows the luminescence properties of the phosphor containing much aluminum. This considered the erosion from an alumina crucible when the alumina crucible is used. From the result of Example 229, the phosphor in which aluminum is contained exhibits also the high luminescence properties. Accordingly, even if the alumina crucible is used, firing can be carried out without considering the contamination of the alumina crucible.</p>
<p id="p-0873" num="0892">On the contrary, Comparative Example 2 uses a molybdenum crucible. When the molybdenum crucible is used, the crucible is eroded to be contained in the phosphor. The phosphor of Comparative Example 2 containing molybdenum generates the lowering of the luminescence properties. Accordingly, it is not preferable to use the molybdenum crucible. Since molybdenum lowers the luminescence properties, it is preferably removed to the outside of a system.</p>
<p id="p-0874" num="0893">Comparative Example 2 used those which contained Fe in the phosphor. Since Fe is occasionally contained in the phosphor by the contamination from the molybdenum crucible and a furnace, an effect of containing Fe in the phosphor was tested. As a result, since Fe lowers also the luminescence properties, it is preferably removed to the outside of a system.</p>
<p id="h-0093" num="0000">Comparative Test</p>
<p id="p-0875" num="0894">In order to clear the action effect of the present invention, a comparative test was further carried out. Comparative Example 4 is a nitride phosphor containing the base nitride phosphor, and on the other hand, Examples 224 and 227 are the nitride phosphors containing the base nitride phosphor and the component constituting elements. The result is shown in Table 28. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> is a drawing showing luminescence spectra when the nitride phosphors of Example 224 and Comparative Example 4 were excited at Ex=460 nm.</p>

On the other hand, the compounding proportion of the raw materials of Example 227 uses the same condition as Comparative Example 4, and the concentration of several ppm of Mg, Sr, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn and Fe which is the same concentration as that of Example 224 is contained in the raw materials. Example 227 charges the three compounds of the raw materials in a BN crucible, the temperature was gradually raised from room temperature, firing is carried out for 3 hours at about 800° C., and further the temperature was gradually raised, firing is carried out for 5 hours at about 1350° C., and cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours. Comparative Example 4 charged the three compounds of the raw materials which do not contain Mn and the like in a molybdenum crucible, and firing was carried out in hydrogen/nitrogen atmosphere. When the ammonia flow rate of Example 227 is referred to as 1, the flow rate of hydrogen/nitrogen of Comparative Example 4 is hydrogen:nitrogen=0.1:3. On the other hand, Example 224 carried out the raise of temperature gradually, firing was carried out for 5 hours at about 1350° C., and cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0879" num="0898">As cleared from Table 28 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, the luminescence brightness of Comparative Example 4 is 99.1% and on the other hand, the luminescence brightness of Example 227 was 128.7%, therefore the luminescence brightness was improved by 29.6%. The difference of the luminescence brightness has an important technical meaning from the viewpoint of the luminescence efficiency. The energy efficiency of Comparative Example 4 was 99.1%, and on the contrary, the energy efficiency of Example 227 was 131.1%. It was improved by 32%. Further, the quantum efficiency of Comparative Example 4 was 100.5%, and on the contrary, the quantum efficiency of Example 227 was 136.8%. It was improved by 36.3%. Thus, the extremely remarkable luminescence properties can be obtained by changing atmosphere and the material of a crucible. Further, the extremely remarkable luminescence properties can be obtained by containing Mg, Mn and the like. The improvement of the luminescence properties can provide a light emitting material which emits light of a more brilliant white color. Further, the improvement of the luminescence property can improve also the reduction of electric power because it enhances energy efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0880" num="0899">Further, Example 224 carried out firing under the same condition except the difference of a firing pattern in comparison with Example 227. The firing pattern of Example 224 carried out the raise of temperature gradually from room temperature, firing was carried out for 5 hours at about 1350° C., and cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours. At this time, the luminescence brightness was 134.3%, and it was improved by 34.3% in comparison with Comparative Example 4. Further, the energy efficiency was 136.8%, and it was improved by 36.8% in comparison with Comparative Example 4. Further, the quantum efficiency was 139.3%, and it was improved by 39.3% in comparison with Comparative Example 4. Further, when the temperature characteristic is observed by the relative brightness fluctuation of a measured lot by setting room temperature as 100, Comparative Example 4 is 62.8% at a temperature of 200° C., and on the contrary, Example 224 is 67.1% at the same temperature, which showed a high value. Further, Comparative Example 4 is 18.2% at a temperature of 300° C., and on the contrary, Example 224 was 23.5% at the same temperature, which showed a high value. When said nitride phosphor was provided on surface of a light emitting element, the composition of the nitride phosphor is not changed, it represents that the temperature characteristic shows the high luminescence property, and it shows that the higher the temperature characteristic is, the more stable it is. From the result of Table 28, it is clear that the nitride phosphor related to the present invention has the better temperature characteristic than Comparative Example 4, and reliability is high. Examples 224 and 227 showed the extremely remarkable luminescence property in comparison with Comparative Example 4. The improvement of the luminescence property which has been not solved can be extremely easily carried out thereby.</p>

The concentration of 250 to 400 ppm of Mg, Sr, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn, Co and Fe are contained in the raw materials. The three compounds of the raw materials were charged in a BN crucible, firing was carried out for 3 hours at 800 to 1000° C. in a tubular furnace, then firing was carried out at 1250 to 1350° C. for 5 hours, and cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours. Ammonia gas was continuously flown at a flow rate of 1 liter/min. As a result, the temperature characteristic at 200° C. of the nitride phosphor of Example 230 is 87.7%, which shows the extremely high temperature characteristic.

<p id="p-0884" num="0903">The base nitride phosphor of the phosphor of Example 231 is Sr<sub>1.4</sub>Ca<sub>0.6</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>:Eu. The concentration of about 250 to 350 ppm of Mg, Sr, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn, Co and Fe are contained in strontium nitride, calcium nitride, silicon nitride and europium oxide which are the raw materials of the phosphor. Example 231 carried out firing under the similar condition as Example 230. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> is a drawing showing a luminescence spectrum when Example 231 was excited at Ex=460 nm. As cleared from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, when light of a luminescence spectrum of Ex=460 nm was irradiated, the combination of Sr and Ca shifted it to a longer wave length side than a case of using Sr of II valency alone. The peak of the luminescence spectrum is 657 nm. Thus, the phosphor emitting light of a reddish white color can be obtained by the combination of a blue light emitting element and the phosphor of Example 231. Further, the quantum efficiency of the phosphor, Sr<sub>1.4</sub>Ca<sub>0.6</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>:Eu of Example 231 is 151.9%, which is extremely good.</p>
<p id="p-0885" num="0904">Example 232 changed the compounding proportion of Eu. Example 232 shows the good luminescence property in like manner as other Examples. Further, the luminescence wave length becomes 637 nm by changing the concentration of Eu. The temperature characteristic is 97.9% at 200° C., which shows a high value, therefore high stability is shown</p>

<p id="p-0888" num="0907">The measurement of Examples 233 to 243 irradiates ultraviolet of 254 nm, and the luminescence intensity just after termination of irradiation is referred to as 1. The time from just after termination of irradiation until the luminescence intensity becomes 1/10 is measured. Table 30 is the time required for until the luminescence intensity becomes 1/10. Examples 233 to 243 are the same composition except the phosphor of Example 224 and additives. Namely, the base nitride phosphor of the phosphor is Ca<sub>1.97</sub>Eu<sub>0.03</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>, the component constituting elements are Mg, Sr, Ba, Zn, B, Al, Cu, Mn, Co and Fe, and the component constituting elements are contained by the concentration of 250 to 400 ppm. BN, H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3 </sub>and Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2 </sub>are contained by the concentration of several % by weight in the raw material of Example 224. The raw material containing B and Mg was charged in BN and firing was carried out. Fixed compounding amounts of BN are used for Examples 233 to 236, those of H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3 </sub>are used for Examples 237 to 240 and those of Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2 </sub>are used for Examples 241 to 243. A phosphor which does not contain additives was used for a standard value as a comparison object. As a result, the afterglow of Example 233 was shortest among Examples 233 to 236. The afterglow of Example 237 was shortest among Examples 237 to 240. The afterglow of Example 241 was shortest among Examples 241 to 243. Thus, the afterglow property can be suppressed by adding fixed amounts of B, Mg and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0905" num="0925">Example 246 and Comparative Example 10 are adjusted so that the compounding proportion of calcium nitride, Ca<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, silicon nitride, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, and europium oxide, Eu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>which are the raw materials is Ca:Si:Eu=1.97:5:0.03. The three compounds of the raw materials are charged in a BN crucible, the temperature was gradually raised from room temperature, firing was carried out for 3 hours at about 800° C., the temperature was gradually further raised, firing was carried out for 5 hours at about 1350° C., and cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours. With respect to Comparative Example 10, firing was carried out in hydrogen/nitrogen atmosphere. When the ammonia flow rate of Example 246 is referred to as 1, the flow rate of hydrogen/nitrogen of Comparative Example 10 is hydrogen:nitrogen=0.1:3. On the other hand, Example 246 carried out firing in ammonia atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0906" num="0926">As cleared from Table 32 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, the luminescence brightness of Comparative Example 10 is 100% and on the other hand, the luminescence brightness of Example 246 was 130.0%, therefore the luminescence brightness was improved by 30%. The difference of the luminescence brightness has an extremely important meaning from the viewpoint of the luminescence efficiency. The energy efficiency of Comparative Example 10 was 100%, and on the contrary, the energy efficiency of Example 246 was 130.8%. It was improved by 30.8%. Further, the quantum efficiency of Comparative Example 10 was 100%, and on the contrary, the quantum efficiency of Example 246 was 136.1%. It was improved by 36.1%. Thus, the extremely remarkable luminescence properties can be obtained by changing atmosphere. The improvement of the luminescence properties can provide a light emitting material which emits light of a more brilliant white color. Further, the improvement of the luminescence property can improve also the reduction of electric power because it enhances energy efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0907" num="0927">Further, Example 247 carried out firing under the same condition except the difference of a firing pattern in comparison with Example 246. The firing pattern of Example 247 carried out the raise of temperature gradually from room temperature, firing was carried out for 5 hours at about 1350° C., and cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours. At this time, the luminescence brightness was 136.9%, and it was improved by 36.9% in comparison with Comparative Example 10. Further, the energy efficiency was 138%, and it was improved by 38% in comparison with Comparative Example 10. Further, the quantum efficiency was 138%, and it was improved by 38% in comparison with Comparative Example 10. Further, when the temperature characteristic is observed by the relative brightness fluctuation of a measured lot by setting room temperature as 100, Comparative Example 10 is 62.8 at a temperature of 200° C., and on the contrary, Example 247 is 67.1 at the same temperature, which showed a high value. Further, Comparative Example 10 is 18.2 at a temperature of 300° C., and on the contrary, Example 247 was 23.5 at the same temperature, which showed a high value. The temperature characteristic represents that when said nitride phosphor was provided on surface of a light emitting element, it shows the high luminescence property without changing the composition of the nitride phosphor, and it shows that the higher the temperature characteristic is, the more stable it is. From the result of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, it is clear that the nitride phosphor related to the present invention has the better temperature characteristic than Comparative Example 10, and it is clear that reliability is high. Examples 246 and 247 showed the extremely remarkable luminescence property in comparison with Comparative Example 10. The improvement of the luminescence property which has been not solved can be extremely easily carried out thereby.</p>

The nitride phosphor is (Ca<sub>1−t</sub>Eu<sub>t</sub>) <sub>2</sub>Si<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub>. Examples 247 to 249 use Eu as the activator Z and change the compounding proportion t of said Eu. Example 247 contains 0.015 of Eu, Example 248 contains 0.005 of Eu, and Example 249 contains 0.03 of Eu. The firing condition is similar as Example 247, the temperature was gradually raised from room temperature, firing was carried out for 5 hours at about 1350° C., and cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0912" num="0932">It is clear that Example 247 has the higher temperature characteristic in comparison with Example 248. Since the temperature of a light emitting element generally used is raised to a temperature of 100 to 150° C., it is preferable that it is stable at said temperature range when the nitride phosphor is formed on the surface of the light emitting element. From the viewpoint, since Example 248 has the extremely good temperature characteristic, it has superior technical meaning.</p>

<p id="p-0918" num="0938">The three compounds of the raw materials were charged in a BN crucible, and firing was carried out for 5 hours at 1200 to 1350° C. in a tubular furnace under ammonia atmosphere. Temperature was raised by heating from room temperature to 1350° C. over 5 hours, firing was carried out for 5 hours, and cooling was further gradually carried out until room temperature over 5 hours. Ammonia gas was continuously flown at a flow rate of 2 liter/min. As a result, the nitride phosphor powder in which a body color is orange and a luminescence color is also orange was obtained. With respect to the phosphor powder, the whole phosphor powder emits light of an orange color in visual observation. Thus, since the whole phosphor powder emits light uniformly, the improvement of production efficiency, the provision of a stable nitride phosphor and the reduction of production cost can be carried out.</p>

Further, the luminescence brightness of the nitride phosphor obtained by the present Example 252 was improved than Comparative Example in visual observation. Further, the phosphor obtained by Example 252 showed the luminescence brightness which is similar as Example 251.</p>
<p id="h-0104" num="0000">(Measurement Result of Phosphor Obtained from Examples 251 and 252)</p>
<p id="p-0925" num="0945">As a typical example, the measurement of the nitride phosphors of Examples 251 and 252 was carried out. The test result is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> is a drawing showing the luminescence spectra when Examples 251 and 252 were excited at Ex=460 nm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> is a drawing showing the reflection ratio of Examples 251 and 252. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> is a drawing showing the excitation spectra of Examples 251 and 252.</p>

<p id="p-0927" num="0947">Light having a wave length of 460 nm at a visible light region was irradiated on Examples 251 and 252. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, Example 251 emits light at 620 nm to the utmost, and Example 252 emits light at 610 nm to the utmost. Thus, since Example 251 is shifted to a longer wave length than Example 252, it emits redder light. Since 460 nm is a wave length having the highest luminescence brightness among known blue light emitting diode, the reddish white nitride phosphor can be produced by combination of the blue and yellow-red luminescence spectra. With respect to the reflection coefficient, the nitride phosphor of Example 252 exhibits higher reflection property than the nitride phosphor of Example 250. Both of the nitride phosphors of Examples 251 and 252 absorb light of a short wave length side at visible light region. With respect to the excitation spectrum, the nitride phosphor of Example 251 exhibits a higher excitation spectrum than the nitride phosphor of Example 252.</p>

<p id="p-0957" num="0977">The LED chip <b>202</b> used for exciting the phosphors in the present Example is the light emitting element in which the InGaAlN compound semiconductor was formed as a luminescence layer, and the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum is 460 nm. Further, the chromaticity coordinate is shifted toward lower color temperature along the black body radiation locus by heightening the electric current density between 3 to 300 A/cm<sup>2</sup>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> is a chart showing the electric current property of luminescence spectrum when electric current run in the LED chip <b>202</b> is changed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, with respect to the electric current property of luminescence spectrum, the peak wave length is shifted toward shorter wavelength side in accordance with the increase of applied electric current.</p>
<p id="p-0958" num="0978">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, the positions of the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum of the above-mentioned three phosphors 257-1 to 257-3 are nearly coincided with the positions to which the peak wave length of luminescence spectrum of the LED chip is shifted in accordance with the increase of electric current which is applied to the LED chip. Hereat, it is preferable that the difference between the peak wavelength of the excitation absorption spectrum of the phosphors 257-1 to 257-3 and the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum of the LED chip is 40 nm or less. Since the excitation efficiency of the phosphors is improved by using the phosphors and the quantity of light emitted from the LED is decreased without wave length conversion, the chromaticity deviation of a light emitting device can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0959" num="0979">Hereat, when the phosphor 257-3 is used, the luminescence spectrum of the phosphor 257-3 is shifted toward shorter wave length than the luminescence spectrum of the phosphor 257-1 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>. Accordingly, although the chromaticity deviation of the light emitting device can be prevented by shifting the peak wave lengths of the excitation absorption spectrum of the YAG-base phosphors, the emission of the light emitting device is deviated from the black body radiation locus, therefore a red component is added to the color mix light by adding the phosphor 257-4 or the phosphor 257-5, and the chromaticity coordinate is adjusted near at the black body radiation locus.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>, in case of Comparative Examples 11 to 13, the chromaticities are migrated to a high color temperature region as if it leaves from the black body radiation locus to an arrow direction in accordance with the increase of the applied electric current. On the other hand, in case of Example 257, it can be grasped that the chromaticity is migrated to a low chromaticity side to an arrow direction as if it migrates nearly along the black body radiation locus.</p>
<p id="p-0966" num="0986"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref> is a chart showing the chromaticity change when DC drive was carried out with respect to Example 257 and Comparative Example 11. In case of Comparative Example 11, the chromaticities in the respective electric currents are migrated to a high chromaticity side as if it leaves from the black body radiation locus to an arrow direction when the electric current is increased from 1 mA to 5 mA, 10 mA, 20 mA, 40 mA, 60 mA. On the other hand, in case of Example 257, the fluctuation of light chromaticity by color mixing is within a range of 0.326 to 0.333 in the x coordinate and 0.343 to 0.348 in the y coordinate on the chromaticity chart. Namely, the light chromaticity by color mixing is migrated at a position nearly along the black body radiation locus even if the electric current is increased, and the fluctuation of the chromaticity is hardly generated. Thus, it is a result of mutually compensating the chromaticity change to a high chromaticity side along the black body radiation locus which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> as the ambient temperature-chromaticity property, with the chromaticity change to a low chromaticity side along the black body radiation locus which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref> as the ambient temperature-chromaticity property as the applied electric current-chromaticity property that the chromaticity is hardly changed in case of Example 257.</p>
<p id="p-0967" num="0987">The constitution of Example 257 is a constitution that the decreasing rates of the luminescence outputs for the ambient temperature of the phosphors combined are 2.0×10<sup>−3 </sup>[a. u./° C.] or less together and small in comparison with the phosphors of other Examples, and the difference of the decreasing rate of the luminescence outputs is 2.0×10<sup>−4 </sup>[a. u./° C.] and set as a combination being small in comparison with other Examples. Namely, the decreasing rates of the luminescence outputs for the temperature rises of the phosphor 3 and the phosphor 5 are nearly equal. By making such a constitution thus, the difference of the luminescence outputs of the phosphor 3 and the phosphor 5 is kept at a nearly equal value without being influenced by the ambient temperature, even if the luminescence outputs of the phosphor 3 and the phosphor 5 are lowered by the rise of the ambient temperature caused by the heat emission of the light emitting element. Namely, by making such a constitution of the present invention, there can be made a light emitting device of improving color rendering property irrespective of the change of the ambient temperature of the light emitting device, in particular, the ambient temperature of the light emitting device caused by the change of electric current and hardly generating the color deviation. Further, when a light source for a back light which can be used as the constituting member of a liquid crystal display is formed by using the light emitting device related to the present invention in combination with a light conductive plate which introduces the light emitted from the light emitting device to the face side of observing luminescence, the light source for a back light improving color rendering property irrespective of the change of the ambient temperature and hardly generating the color deviation can be made.</p>

On the other hand, in case of Example 258 and Example 259, the chromaticity is hardly changed.</p>
<p id="p-0977" num="0997">The constitution of Example 258 and Example 259 is a constitution that the decreasing rates of the luminescence outputs for the ambient temperature of the phosphors combined are 3.0×10<sup>−3 </sup>[a. u./° C.] or less together and small in comparison with the phosphor 258-1 of Comparative Example 14. By making such a constitution of the present invention, there can be made a light emitting device of improving color rendering property irrespective of the change of the ambient temperature of the light emitting device, in particular, the ambient temperature of the phosphor caused by the change of electric current and hardly generating the color deviation.</p>

Hereat, the weight ratio of the resin and the phosphor in the present Comparative Example are shown in Table 42. Further, the measurement result of the optical properties of the light emitting device which was formed as Comparative Example 14 is shown in Table 43 below with the Examples 258 and 259. Further, the chromaticity change is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>, when DC drive was carried out with respect to Comparative Example 14.

This is considered to be because the luminescence peak wave length of the LED chip is shifted toward shorter wavelength in accordance with the increase of electric current as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, is deviated from the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum of the phosphor 258-1 which was shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</figref>, therefore the wave length conversion efficiency of the phosphor is lowered and the wave length component of light from the LED chip in which the wave length conversion is not carried out by the phosphor is increased. On the other hand, the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum of the phosphor 258-2 which is used in Example 258 and Example 259 is situated at a short wavelength side in comparison with the phosphor 258-1, the luminescence peak wave length of the LED chip is within a range of being migrated in accordance with the change of the applied electric current, therefore the wave length conversion efficiency of the phosphor is not lowered. Further, in case of Example 258 and Example 259, there can be made the light emitting device of hardly generating the color deviation irrespective of the change of the ambient temperature of the light emitting device caused by the change of electric current, in particular, the ambient temperature of the phosphor and improving color rendering property, by using the YAG-base phosphor in combination with the nitride-base phosphor in which the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum within a range that the luminescence peak wave length of the LED chip is migrated in accordance with the change of the applied electric current.</p>

<p id="p-1005" num="1025">The phosphors used in the present Example are the phosphor 261-1 and the phosphor 261-2 which have the nearly equal decreasing rates of luminescence outputs against temperature rises. Namely, the decreasing rates of the luminescence outputs for the ambient temperature of the phosphors combined are 2.0×10<sup>−3 </sup>[a. u./° C.] or less together and small in comparison with the combination of other phosphors, and the difference of the decreasing rate of the luminescence outputs is 2.0×10<sup>−4 </sup>[a. u./° C.] and set as a combination being small in comparison with other phosphors.</p>
<p id="p-1006" num="1026">The LED chip <b>302</b> or <b>304</b> which is used for exciting the phosphors in the present Example is the light emitting element in which the InGaAlN base compound semiconductor was formed as a luminescence layer, and the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum is around 460 nm. Further, the chromaticity coordinate is shifted toward lower color temperature side along the black body radiation locus by heightening the electric current density between 3 to 300 A/cm<sup>2</sup>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref> is a chart showing the electric current properties of luminescence spectrum when electric current run in the LED chips <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> is changed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref>, with respect to the electric current properties of luminescence spectrum, the peak wave length is shifted toward shorter wavelength in accordance with the increase of applied electric current.</p>
<p id="p-1007" num="1027">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>, the positions of the peak wave lengths of the excitation absorption spectrum of the above-mentioned three phosphors 261-2, 266-1 and 266-2 are nearly coincided with the positions to which the peak wave lengths of luminescence spectrum of the LED chips are shifted in accordance with the increase of electric current which is applied to the LED chips. Hereat, it is preferable that the difference between the peak wave length of the excitation absorption spectrum of the phosphors 261-2, 266-1 and 266-2, and the peak wave length of the luminescence spectrum of the LED chips is 40 nm or less. Since the excitation efficiency of the phosphors is improved by using the phosphors and the quantity of light emitted from the LED is decreased without wave length conversion, the chromaticity deviation of a light emitting device can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-1008" num="1028">Hereat, when the phosphor 261-2 is used, the luminescence spectrum of the phosphor 261-2 is shifted toward shorter wave length than the luminescence spectrum of other phosphor as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>. Accordingly, although the chromaticity deviation of the light emitting device can be prevented by shifting the peak wave lengths of the excitation absorption spectrum of the YAG-base phosphors, the emission of the light emitting device is deviated from the black body radiation locus, therefore a red component is added to the color mix light by adding the phosphor 261-1 or the phosphor 266-3, and the chromaticity coordinate is adjusted near at the black body radiation locus.</p>
<p id="p-1009" num="1029">As shown in Table 44, the color rendering property in case of the present Example is Ra=91.9, and the color rendering property can be improved in comparison with a conventional technique.</p>
<p id="p-1010" num="1030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref> is a chart showing the chromaticity change when DC drive was carried out with respect to the light emitting device which was formed in the present Example. When the electric current density is increased from 15 [A/cm<sup>2</sup>] to 180 [A/cm<sup>2</sup>], the fluctuation of light chromaticity by color mixing is within a range of 0.339 to 0.351 in the x coordinate and 0.321 to 0.322 in the y coordinate on the chromaticity chart. Namely, the light chromaticity by color mixing is migrated at a position nearly along the black body radiation locus even if the electric current is increased, and the fluctuation of the chromaticity is hardly generated.</p>
<p id="p-1011" num="1031">The constitution of the present Example is a constitution that the decreasing rates of the luminescence outputs for the ambient temperature of the phosphors combined are 2.0×10<sup>−3 </sup>[a. u./° C.] or less together and small in comparison with the phosphors of other Examples, and the difference of the decreasing rate of the luminescence outputs is 2.0×10<sup>−4 </sup>[a. u./° C.] and set as a combination being small in comparison with other Examples. Namely, the decreasing rates of the luminescence outputs for the temperature rises of the phosphor 261-1 and the phosphor 261-2 are nearly equal. By making such a constitution thus, the difference of the luminescence outputs of the phosphor 261-1 and the phosphor 261-2 is kept at a nearly equal value without being influenced by the ambient temperature, even if the luminescence outputs of the phosphor 261-1 and the phosphor 261-2 are lowered by the rise of the ambient temperature caused by the heat emission of the light emitting element and the like. Namely, by making such a constitution of the present Example, there can be made a light emitting device of improving the color rendering property irrespective of the change of the ambient temperature of the light emitting device and hardly generating the chromaticity deviation.</p>
<p id="p-1012" num="1032">Further, when a light source for a back light which can be used as the constituting member of a liquid crystal display is formed by using the light emitting device related to the present invention in combination with a light conductive plate which introduces the light emitted from the light emitting device to the face side of observing luminescence, the light source for a back light improving color rendering property irrespective of the change of the ambient temperature and hardly generating the color deviation can be made.</p>
